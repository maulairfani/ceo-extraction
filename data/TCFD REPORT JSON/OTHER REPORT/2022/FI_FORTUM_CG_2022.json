Fortum fully complies with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020. The corporate governance statement is issued separately from the operating and financial review, and it has been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee of Fortum's Board of Directors.\n\nFortum Corporation ('Fortum' or the 'Company') has been listed on Nasdaq Helsinki stock exchange since 1998. Fortum's industrial sector according to the Global Industry Classification Standard is Electric Utilities. The State of Finland through the Ownership Steering Department of the Prime Minister's Office of the Finnish Government is the majority owner in Fortum with a total of 51.26% of the shares as on 31 December 2022.\n\nFortum prepares the consolidated financial statements and interim reports in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, the Finnish Securities Markets Act, as well as the applicable Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines and Nasdaq Helsinki rules.\n\nThe Company's operating and financial review and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act, Accounting Act, Securities Markets Act, and the opinions and guidelines of the Finnish Accounting Board. The consolidated financial statements are also published in accordance with the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) reporting requirement. The Company's external auditor, Deloitte Oy, has provided an independent auditor's reasonable assurance report on Fortum's ESEF financial statements in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised). The auditor's report covers the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.\n\nThe Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020 is available on the website of the Securities Market Association at\n\n- 4 www.cgfinland.fi .\n\n## Governing bodies of Fortum\n\nThe decision-making bodies managing and overseeing Fortum's administration and operations are the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors with its Audit and Risk Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and the President and CEO, supported by the Fortum Executive Management.\n\nFurther, Fortum has an informal Advisory Council consisting of representatives of Fortum's different key stakeholder groups as invited by the Board of Directors. The Advisory Council aims at advancing Fortum's businesses by facilitating a dialogue and exchange of views between Fortum and its stakeholders. In 2022, the Advisory Council consisted of 13 representatives of Fortum's different stakeholder groups, including three employee representatives.\n\nAs sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy and operations, the highest decision-making on sustainability and climate-related matters is with the Board of Directors. Therefore, Fortum has not established a specific Sustainability Committee for the decision-making on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters. The Audit and Risk Committee, members of the Fortum Executive Management, and other senior executives support the Board of Directors in the decision-making in these matters.\n\n## Major changes in Group structure in 2022\n\nOn 21 September 2022, Fortum, the German Government and Uniper signed an agreement in principle by which Fortum would sell its shares in Uniper SE to the German State. Since March 2020, Fortum had been the majority owner in Uniper SE and Uniper was consolidated as a subsidiary.\n\nAccording to the agreement in principle, Fortum fully divested its ownership in Uniper to the German State which resulted in Fortum losing control of Uniper and deconsolidating Uniper as from the third quarter of 2022. The divested businesses included all operations in Fortum's Uniper segment.\n\n## Governing bodies of Fortum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe agreement was completed on 21 December 2022. The German State acquired all of Fortum's approximately 293 million shares in Uniper SE for EUR 1.70 per share, i.e. for a total of EUR 0.5 billion. At that point, Uniper repaid Fortum's EUR 4.0 billion shareholder loan granted to Uniper. Out of the EUR 4.0 billion parent company guarantee facility that Fortum has granted to Uniper, a total of EUR 3.0 billion was also released. The remaining approximately EUR 1.0 billion, will be released latest at the end of June 2023.\n\nFortum's Russian operations are functioning on a 'standalone' basis with e.g. separated IT-systems. Governance has been segregated to support the planned exit phase simultaneously ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including sanctions. Since spring 2022, there are no parent company representatives on the boards of the Russian subsidiaries and the head of Fortum's Russia division has stepped down from the Fortum Executive Management team. However, he continues to report to the group CEO.\n\nDue to existing sanctions imposed by Russia, the Group's Russian operations are subject to significant foreign exchange\n\n2",

Every shareholder has the right to participate in the General Meeting, to propose items to be included in the agenda of the General Meeting and to exercise his/her power of decision in the matters belonging to the General Meeting by law, as stipulated in the Finnish Companies Act.\n\nEach share entitles to one vote. A shareholder also has the right to ask questions concerning the matters discussed at the General Meeting of Shareholders. By the end of each financial year, Fortum discloses the date by which a shareholder may propose items to be included on the agenda of the following Annual General Meeting on its Annual General Meeting website.\n\n## The main duties of the Annual General Meeting include:\n\n- \u00b7 Adoption of the parent company financial statements and consolidated financial statements\n- \u00b7 Resolution on the use of the profit shown on the balance sheet and on the dividend\n- \u00b7 Resolutions on the discharge from liability of the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO\n- \u00b7 Resolution on the remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors\n- \u00b7 Resolution on the number of members of the Board of Directors\n- \u00b7 Election of the Chair, Deputy Chair and Members of the Board of Directors\n- \u00b7 Resolution on the remuneration of the external auditor\n- \u00b7 Election of the external auditor\n\nThe resolutions at the General Meeting of Shareholders are primarily made by a simple majority of votes. Such resolutions include, for example, resolutions on the adoption of the financial statements, payment of dividend, on discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability, election of members of the Board of Directors and the External Auditor, and resolution on their remuneration.\n\nIn accordance with Fortum's Articles of Association and the Finnish Companies Act, a notice to convene the General Meeting of Shareholders is issued by the Board of Directors. The notice is delivered no earlier than three months and no later than three weeks before the date of the General Meeting of Shareholders by publishing the notice on the Company's website or in two newspapers selected by the Board of Directors. The Annual General Meeting shall be held once a year, in June at the latest.\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders shall be held whenever the Board of Directors finds it necessary or when it is required by law to convene such a meeting.\n\n## General Meetings in 2022\n\nFortum's Annual General Meeting 2022 was held on 28 March 2022 at the Company's headquarters in Espoo. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved on an exceptional annual general meeting procedure on the basis of the temporary provision (375/2021) to the Finnish Companies Act. In accordance with the temporary provision, shareholders of the Company and their proxies could only participate in the meeting and exercise the shareholder rights by means of voting in advance, as well as by making counterproposals and presenting questions in advance. It was not possible to attend the meeting in person, but shareholders could follow the Annual General Meeting live online on the Company's website. The Remuneration report for the Company's governing bodies for 2021 was presented to the Annual General Meeting and it was approved in an advisory vote.\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of Fortum was held on 23 November 2022 at the Helsinki House of Culture (Helsingin Kulttuuritalo). The EGM resolved, supported by a qualified majority of all shares and votes represented at the EGM, in accordance with the proposal of the Board of Directors, on\n\na directed share issue without payment to Solidium Oy. In addition to participating in the EGM at the meeting venue, the shareholders also had an opportunity to vote on the agenda item in advance and to follow the EGM live online on the Company's website.\n\n## Shareholders' Nomination Board\n\nThe Company's Annual General Meeting 2013 established a permanent Shareholders' Nomination Board. The purpose and task of the Shareholders' Nomination Board is to prepare and present proposals on the remuneration, number of and members of the Board of Directors to the General Meeting. In addition, the Shareholders' Nomination Board seeks candidates for potential board members.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board consists of four members. Three are appointed by the Company's three largest shareholders, who shall appoint one member each. The Chair of the Company's Board of Directors serves as the fourth member. The members are appointed annually, and their term of office ends when new members are appointed to replace them. Fortum's three largest shareholders that are entitled to appoint members to the Shareholders' Nomination Board are determined on the basis of the registered holdings as at the first working day of September in the year concerned. In the event that a shareholder does not wish to exercise its right to appoint a representative, it shall pass the right to the next largest shareholder. The Shareholders' Nomination Board forwards its proposals for the Annual General Meeting to the Board of Directors by 31 January each year.\n\n## Diversity Principles for the Board of Directors\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board prepares and applies diversity principles to the Board of Directors in line with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020. The principles are applied in preparing the proposal concerning nomination of board members. The diversity principles include, among others, that the board composition shall include expertise from the geographical areas where Fortum conducts its business, the underlying profession of the board members shall include such competences that support the implementation\n\n3",

In addition, the board composition shall include both genders. Fortum also complies with the principles set forth in the Finnish Government Resolution dated 17 December 2015 on equal gender representation in the boards of listed companies. The Shareholders' Nomination Board reviews the diversity principles and their implementation annually.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board has applied the diversity principles in preparing the proposal concerning nomination of the board members for the Annual General Meeting 2022 and for the upcoming Annual General Meeting 2023. The goal of the Shareholders' Nomination Board is to seek candidates for potential board members meeting the requirements set by the international nature of the Company's business emphasising experience gained in a CEO level management position in international business and strong expertise in ESG, energy industry, and digitalisation, in particular. The Shareholders' Nomination Board deems that the current board composition and the proposed board members for the Annual General Meeting 2023 include all the competences defined in the diversity principles in a wellbalanced manner.\n\nThe proposal for the board members for the Annual General Meeting 2023 consists of 4 women and 6 men. The current Board of Directors consists of 4 women and 5 men, corresponding to a ratio of 44.4% and 55.6% respectively.\n\n## Shareholders' Nomination Board in 2022\n\nIn September 2021, the following persons were appointed to the Shareholders' Nomination Board: Kimmo Viertola, b. 1961, M.Sc.

The Group Risk Policy also includes a description of the main features of the risk management process applicable to all processes, including financial reporting at Fortum.\n\n## Internal controls in relation to financial reporting\n\nFortum's internal control framework is based on the main elements of the framework introduced by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The controls, including financial reporting controls have been defined based on the main risks in the process. Internal controls are one of the key elements of the Compliance Programme in Fortum, which also covers business ethics and regulatory compliance.\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe standards, processes and structures in internal control are set through Group policies, Group instructions and the Fortum internal control framework. Fortum's internal control framework is designed to support operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and policies. The internal control framework defines the key controls and the minimum requirements for the key processes. Corporate Accounting is responsible for the overall control structure of the financial reporting process. Fortum Controllers' manual defines the instructions and guidelines relating to financial reporting.\n\n## Financial reporting framework in Fortum\n\nG o v e r n a n c e\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFortum has a decentralised organisational model, and a substantial degree of authority and responsibility has been delegated to the divisions in the form of control responsibilities. Fortum's control governance applies the so-called 'Three Lines of Defense' model as illustrated in the graphic 4 on the next page .\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisks are regularly identified and analysed as part of the risk management process. Risks that might, if realised, have a material financial impact or lead to non-compliance are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee at least on an annual basis.\n\n## Control activities\n\nControl activities are applied in the processes and, from the financial reporting perspective, they ensure that errors or deviations are prevented or detected and corrected.\n\nThe Corporate Accounting unit together with the Recordto-Report internal process team determine the control requirements covering the financial reporting process. Divisions and units define their controls based on these requirements. Responsibilities are assigned for the control activities and for ensuring that the control coverage is in accordance with the requirements. The stream leader of the Record-to-Report ensures the consistency of the control requirements and assessment in the organisation.\n\n13\n\nR e p o r t i n g",

The general IT controls support the financial reporting controls in areas such as access control and back-up management.\n\nResponsibilities are assigned to finance functions to ensure that analyses of the business performance, including e.g. volumes, revenue, costs, working capital, and asset valuations are performed in accordance with the control requirements.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nThe Controllers' manual includes the Fortum Accounting manual, Investment manual and reporting instructions, and also other instructions relating to financial reporting. Regular core controllers' meetings, headed by the Vice President, Corporate Accounting, steer the finance function. Accounting Network Forum meetings are held regularly to inform about\n\nupcoming changes in IFRS, new accounting policies and other changes in reporting requirements.\n\n## Monitoring and follow-up\n\nFinancial performance and key risks and uncertainties related to business operations are reported monthly to the Fortum Executive Management.\n\nAs part of the Fortum internal control framework, divisions and units regularly assess the maturity of their control activities including the financial reporting process controls. The Group Compliance Officer reports on the results of internal control maturity assessments and identified improvement actions to the Executive Management and to the Audit and Risk Committee. Internal control design and operating effectiveness are also assessed as part of the audits carried out by Internal Audit. Audit results, including corrective actions and their status, are regularly reported to the management and to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Fortum's Control Governance\n\n<!-- image -->",

The internal audit function reports on the audit results and the status of the audits to the Audit and Risk Committee on a regular basis.\n\n## External Audit\n\nThe Group and the parent company have one external auditor. The external auditor is elected by the Annual General Meeting for a term of office that expires at the end of the first Annual General Meeting following the election.\n\nFortum's Annual General Meeting 2022 re-elected audit firm Deloitte Oy as the company's external auditor with Authorised Public Accountant Jukka Vattulainen as principal auditor.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2022 also resolved that the auditor's fee is paid pursuant to invoice approved by the Company. The fee paid to the auditor for the services rendered and invoiced in 2022 totalled approx. EUR 3,0 million.\n\n## Code of Conduct and Compliance Programme at Fortum\n\nFortum's Code of Conduct is based on the shared corporate values which form the ethical basis for all work at Fortum. Fortum renewed its Code of Conduct in 2021 and it was approved by the Board of Directors. During 2022, continuous attention has in general been directed to communicating the business ethics and compliance topics through internal and external communication channels. Alignment is enforced by the full commitment of the top management.\n\nFortum applies a compliance programme which covers the key areas of regulatory compliance and business ethics. Internal Controls are an integral part of compliance at Fortum. Group Compliance prepares readiness to provide comprehensive compliance support in all potential outcomes and scenarios of ongoing strategic assessments. During 2022, Competition Law Compliance and Privacy have been added to the Fortum Compliance framework and Group Privacy Office is since 1.4.2022 part of the Group Compliance.

Fortum employees and other stakeholders can confidentially report any suspicions of misconduct by using the 'SpeakUp' channel in their own language on Fortum's internal and external web pages. In Russia, Fortum has also a separate compliance organisation with appointed compliance officers. Fortum is also further developing the 'SpeakUp' process to ensure compliance with the EU Whistleblowing Directive as the national legislations are still evolving.\n\nPrevention of corruption is one of the focus areas of the Code of Conduct. Fortum has anti-corruption procedures,\n\nincluding prevention, oversight, reporting and enforcement, in place, based on the requirements prescribed in international legislation. Compliance requirements are also part of the legal company governance at Fortum. One of the priorities in the light of external stakeholder expectations, is the third-party compliance including economic sanctions and anti-money laundering aspects. The new third-party risk management process has been in use since 1 January 2022.\n\nIn addition, Fortum has a Supplier Code of Conduct in place, and the company expects its business partners to act responsibly and to comply with the requirements set forth therein. Fortum assesses the performance of its business partners with supplier qualification and supplier audits.\n\n## Insider Administration\n\nFortum complies with the EU regulation on market abuse (MAR) and EU regulation on wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) and related regulation. In addition, Fortum complies also with the Guidelines for Insiders of Listed Companies issued by Nasdaq Helsinki, and has internal insider rules in place.
