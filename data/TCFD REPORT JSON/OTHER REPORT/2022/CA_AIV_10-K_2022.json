        "page_content": "## EXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nApartment Investment and Management Company (\"Aimco\" or \"the Company\"), a Maryland corporation, is a self-administered and self-managed real estate  investment  trust,  or  REIT.  On  December  15,  2020, Aimco  completed  the  separation  of  its  business  into  two,  separate  and  distinct,  publicly  traded companies, Aimco and Apartment Income REIT Corp. ('AIR'). The separation was effected by way of a pro rata distribution, in which stockholders of Aimco received one share of Class A common stock of AIR for every one share of Class A common stock of Aimco held as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. Apartment Income REIT, L.P. ('AIR Operating Partnership'), formerly known as 'Aimco Properties, L.P.' until July 7, 2021, also completed a pro rata distribution of all of the outstanding common limited partnership units of Aimco OP L.P. (\"Aimco Operating Partnership\" and such units, \"OP Units\") to holders of AIR Operating Partnership common limited partnership units and AIR Operating Partnership Class I High Performance partnership units as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. The transactions described in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the 'Separation' and are governed by the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement').\n\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Separation, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, Aimco is presented as being spun-off from AIR. This presentation is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and is due primarily to the relative significance of Aimco's business, as measured in terms of revenue, net income, assets, and other relevant indicators, as compared to those indicators for AIR before the Separation. Therefore, Aimco is considered 'spun' for accounting purposes and AIR is considered the divesting entity and treated as the accounting spinner, or accounting predecessor. A separate capital structure did not exist since the assets, liabilities and operations of Aimco prior to the Separation (Aimco and AIR together, as they existed prior to the Separation, 'Aimco Predecessor') were spread across multiple legal entities. Events noted in this filing as occurring before December 15, 2020, were those entered into by Aimco Predecessor. The historical financial statements of Aimco do not represent the financial position and results of operations of one legal entity,  but  rather  a  combination  of  entities  under  common  control  that  have  been  'carved  out'  from Aimco  Predecessor's  financial statements.\n\nAimco,  through  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  is  the  general  partner  and  directly  is  the  special  limited  partner  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership.  As  of December 31, 2022, Aimco owned 92.6% of the legal interest in the common partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership and 94.9% of the economic interest  in Aimco  Operating  Partnership.  The  remaining  7.4%  legal  interest  is  owned  by  limited  partners. As  the  sole  general  partner  of Aimco  Operating Partnership, Aimco has exclusive control of Aimco Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nAimco  Operating  Partnership  holds  all  of  Aimco's  assets  and  manages  the  daily  operations  of  Aimco's  business.  Pursuant  to  the  Aimco  Operating Partnership agreement, Aimco is required to contribute to Aimco Operating Partnership all proceeds from the offerings of its securities. In exchange for the contribution of such proceeds, Aimco receives additional interests in Aimco Operating Partnership with similar terms (e.g., if Aimco contributes proceeds of a stock offering, Aimco receives partnership units with terms substantially similar to the stock issued by Aimco).\n\nThis filing combines the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, of Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership. Where it is important to distinguish between the two entities, we refer to them specifically. As used herein and except as the context otherwise requires, 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' refer to Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries, collectively.\n\nWe believe combining the periodic reports of Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 We present our business as a whole, in the same manner our management views and operates the business;\n- \u00b7 We eliminate duplicative disclosure and provide a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosures apply to both Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership; and\n- \u00b7 We save time and cost through the preparation of a single combined report rather than two separate reports.\n\nWe  operate Aimco  and Aimco  Operating  Partnership  as  one  enterprise,  the  management  of Aimco  directs  the  management  and  operations  of Aimco Operating Partnership, and Aimco OP GP, LLC, Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner, is member managed by Aimco.\n\nWe believe it is important to understand the few differences between Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership in the context of how Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. Aimco has no assets or liabilities other than its investment in Aimco Operating Partnership. Also, Aimco is a corporation that issues publicly traded equity from time to time, whereas Aimco Operating Partnership is a partnership that has no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from stock offerings by Aimco, which are contributed to Aimco Operating Partnership in exchange for additional limited partnership interests (of a similar type and in an amount equal to the shares of stock sold in the offering), Aimco Operating Partnership generates all",

These sources include Aimco Operating Partnership's working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its revolving credit facility, the issuance of debt and equity securities, including additional partnership units, and proceeds received from the sale of real estate.\n\nEquity, partners' capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of Aimco and those of Aimco Operating Partnership.  Interests  in Aimco  Operating  Partnership  held  by  entities  other  than Aimco,  are  classified  within  partners'  capital  in Aimco Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Aimco's consolidated financial statements.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Aimco  and  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  this  report  provides  separate  consolidated  financial statements for Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership; a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity's  stockholders'  equity  or  partners'  capital,  and  earnings  per  share  or  earnings  per  unit,  as  applicable;  and  a  combined  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes discrete information related to each entity.\n\nThis report also includes separate Part II, Item 9A.

Additional information regarding the Separation is contained in the Explanatory Note.\n\nPlease refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion regarding our business segments.\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nOur mission is to make real estate investments, primarily focused on the multifamily sector within targeted U.S. markets, where outcomes are enhanced through our human capital and substantial value is created for investors, teammates, and the communities in which we operate.\n\nOur value proposition includes our:\n\n- \u00b7 Platform, consisting of a cohesive, talented, and tenured team with diverse real estate industry experience combined with a disciplined and proven investment process;\n- \u00b7 Diversified  portfolio,  consisting  of  $0.8  billion  of  in-process  value-added  investments,  a  deep  pipeline  which  includes  approximately  14  million square feet of potential future development, a national portfolio of stabilized multifamily real estate and select indirect and passive investments; and\n- \u00b7 Capital redeployment plan of prudent recycling of capital, reallocating our equity to higher returning investments.\n\nOur  primary  goal  is  outsized  risk-adjusted  returns  and  accelerating  growth  for  our  shareholders.  We  are  focused  on  providing  superior  total-return performance to shareholders, primarily through capital appreciation driven by accretive investment and active portfolio management over multi-year periods. We plan to reinvest earnings to facilitate growth and, therefore, do not presently intend to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend.\n\nOur financial  objectives  are  to  create  value  and  produce  superior,  project-level,  risk-adjusted  returns  on  equity  as  measured  by  the  investment  period Internal  Rate  of  Return  ('IRR')  and  the  project-level  Multiple  on  Invested  Capital  ('MOIC'). We  measure  broader  performance  based  on  Net Asset  value ('NAV') growth over time.\n\nOur capital allocation strategy was designed to leverage our investment platform and optimize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.\n\nAimco targets a balanced allocation which includes investments in 'Value Add' and 'Opportunistic' multifamily real estate, primarily located in South Florida,  the Washington  DC Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range, plus investment in a geographically diversified portfolio of 'Core' and 'Core-Plus' apartment communities.\n\nIn  addition,  we  currently  hold  select  alternative  assets,  consisting  primarily  of  indirect,  real  estate  related,  debt  and  equity  investments.  We  plan  to significantly reduce our allocation to these investments over time.\n\nWe have policies in place that support our stated strategy, guide our investment allocations, and manage risk, including to hold at all times a sizeable portion of our net equity in stabilized cash-flowing assets and to require cash or committed credit necessary for completion of development and redevelopment projects prior to their commencement.\n\nGiven our stated strategy, it is expected that at any point in time the value-creation process will be ongoing at numerous of our investments. Over time, we expect our enterprise to produce superior returns on equity on a risk-adjusted basis and it is our plan to do so by:\n\n- \u00b7 Benefiting from a national platform while leveraging local and regional expertise\n\nWe have corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado and Washington, D.C. Our investment platform is managed by experienced professionals based in  three  regions,  where we will focus our new investment activity: Southeast Florida and the Washington D.C. Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range. By regionalizing this platform, we are able to leverage\n\n## PART I",

        "page_content": "the in-depth local market knowledge of each regional leader, creating a comparative advantage when sourcing, evaluating, and executing investment opportunities.\n\n- \u00b7 Managing and investing in value-add and opportunistic real estate\n- Our  dedicated  team  will  source  and  execute  development  and  redevelopment  projects,  and  various  other  direct  investment  strategies.  Our development and redevelopment portfolio currently includes $0.8 billion of projects in construction and lease-up. In addition, our team has secured significant, high-quality, future development opportunities, including total potential of approximately 14 million square feet, located in high-growth markets. Generally, we seek direct investment opportunities in locations where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined and where we have a comparative advantage over others in the market.\n- \u00b7 Owning a portfolio of stabilized core and core plus real estate\n- Our entire portfolio of operating properties includes 26 apartment communities (22 consolidated properties and four unconsolidated properties) with average  rents  in  line  with  local  market  averages  (generally  defined  as  B  class).  We  also  own  one  commercial  office  building  that  is  part  of  an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building. The target composition of our stabilized portfolio will continue to include primarily B multifamily assets,  spread  across  a  geographically  diversified  portfolio  and  with  a  bias  toward  long  established  residential  neighborhoods  that  rank  highly  in regard to schools, employment fundamentals and state and regional governance. Core-Plus opportunities offer the opportunity for incremental capital investment while maintaining stabilized cashflow to accelerate income growth and improve asset values.\n- \u00b7 Managing and, over time, reducing our allocation to alternative investments\n- We currently hold select alternative investments the majority of which originated with Aimco Predecessor and, over time, plan to significantly reduce capital  allocated  to  these  investments.    Our  current  allocation  to  alternative  investments  includes:  our  indirect  interest  mezzanine  loan  to  the Parkmerced partnership  which  owns  3,165  apartment  homes  and  future  development  rights  in  San  Francisco,  California,  and  our  passive  equity investments in IQHQ, Inc. ('IQHQ'), a privately-held life sciences real estate development company, and in property technology funds consisting of entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining sufficient liquidity and utilizing safe financial leverage\n\nAt all times, we will guard our liquidity by maintaining sufficient cash and committed credit.\n\nFrom time-to-time, we will allocate capital to financial assets designed to mitigate risks elsewhere in our enterprise. Existing examples include our option  to  acquire  an  interest  rate  swap  designed  to  protect  against  repricing  risk  on  our  maturing  liabilities  and  the  use  of  rate  caps  to  provide protection against increases in interest rates on in-place loans.\n\nWe expect to capitalize our activities through a combination of non-recourse property debt, construction loans, third-party equity, and the recycling of our equity, including retained earnings. We plan to limit the use of recourse leverage, with a strong preference towards non-recourse property-level debt in order to limit risk to our enterprise. When warranted, we plan to seek equity capital from joint venture partners to improve our cost of capital, further leverage our equity, reduce exposure to a single investment and, in certain cases, for strategic benefits.\n\n## Competition\n\nThere are many developers, managers, and owners of apartment real estate and underdeveloped land, as well as REITs, private real estate companies, and investors, that compete with us in acquiring, developing, obtaining financing for, and disposing of apartment communities. This competition affects our ability to realize our real estate development and transactional objectives.\n\nIn addition, our apartment communities compete for residents with other housing alternatives, including other rental apartments and condominiums, and single-family homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing, as well as household formation and job creation in a particular area, could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates.\n\n## Taxation\n\n## Aimco\n\nAimco has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), commencing with its initial taxable year, and intends to continue to operate in such a manner. The Code imposes various requirements related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets",

If Aimco continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it will generally not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the 'double taxation' (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.\n\nCertain of our operations, or a portion thereof, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a 'TRS'. A TRS is a corporate subsidiary that has elected to be a TRS instead of a REIT and, as such, is subject to United States federal corporate income tax.\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nAimco Operating Partnership is treated as a 'pass-through' entity for United States federal income tax purposes and is not subject to United States federal income taxation. Partners in Aimco Operating Partnership, however, are subject to tax on their allocable share of partnership income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits, regardless of whether the partners receive any actual distributions of cash or other property from Aimco Operating Partnership during the taxable year. Generally, the characterization of any particular item is determined by Aimco Operating Partnership rather than at the partner level, and the amount of a partner's  allocable  share  of  such  item  is  governed  by  the  terms  of Aimco  Operating  Partnership's  Partnership Agreement. Aimco  Operating  Partnership  is subject to tax in certain states.\n\n## Regulation\n\n## General\n\nApartment development is subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including those concerning entitlement, building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, and sales, and similar matters apply to or affect the real estate development industry.\n\nApartment communities and their owners are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including those related to real estate broker licensing and regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, activity centers, and other common areas.\n\nChanges in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on communities or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, as well as changes in laws affecting development, construction, and safety requirements, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows from operating activities.\n\nIn  addition,  existing  rent  control  laws,  as  well  as  future  enactment  of  rent  control  or  rent  stabilization  laws,  or  other  laws  and  ordinances  regulating multifamily housing, may reduce rental revenue or increase operating costs in particular markets.\n\n## Environmental\n\nVarious federal, state, and local laws subject real estate owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present. These materials may include lead-based paint, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, and petroleum-based fuels. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such materials. In connection with the ownership of real estate, we could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our real estate, whether currently owned, acquired in the future, or owned in the past. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors .\n\n## Corporate Responsibility\n\nCorporate responsibility is an important part of our business. As with all other aspects of our business, our corporate responsibility program focuses on continuous improvement, to the benefit of our stockholders, our residents, our teammates, our communities, and the environment. We actively discuss these matters with our stockholders and solicit their feedback on our program.\n\n## Environmental, Social, Governance Policies\n\nWe updated our Environmental, Social, Governance (\"ESG \") policies and published a Corporate Responsibility Report reflecting our ESG priorities and performance.",

Our ESG policies are in place to guide this commitment and are applicable to all new construction, existing assets, and corporate operations. These policies are also taken into consideration when hiring suppliers and procuring materials.\n\n## Human Capital and Culture\n\nWe believe our most valuable asset is our human capital, and are committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a welcoming and inclusive culture for all teammates. Our success is reliant on the collective sum of individual talents.\n\nWe continuously invest in our teammates and company culture to ensure employee satisfaction, health, and well-being.\n\nWe hire and promote employees based upon their unique experiences, abilities, talents, and drive. This naturally leads to a workforce rich with diverse backgrounds and perspectives, leading to improved outcomes.\n\nWe focus on succession planning and talent development to produce a strong, stable team that is the foundation of our success. We are responsible for and implement succession planning in all leadership positions, both in the short term and the long term.\n\nWe offer benefits and support reinforcing our emphasis on the health and well-being of our teammates, including 16 weeks of paid time for parental leave to new mothers and fathers, a longstanding policy of workplace flexibility for our teammates to attend to personal and family matters during the workweek, office environments focused on natural light and ergonomic office furniture including adjustable height desks, access to Company-provided healthy snacks and drinks, paid time annually to volunteer in local communities, and a bonus structure at all levels of the organization.\n\nWe evaluate  team  engagement  and  retention  and  include  those  in  our  goals  on  which  all  teammates  are  compensated.  Every  teammate  is  surveyed annually via  a  third-party  confidential  survey. The  teammate  engagement  score  consists  of  the  average  of  the  responses  to  the  questions  that  comprise  the engagement index, on a scale of 1 to 5, for all teammates who complete the survey during the year. Our overall team engagement score for the 2022 Annual Lifecycle Surveys was 4.52, with a 91% overall response rate, compared to the target score of 4.20.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 62 full-time team members, approximately 60% performing development or transactional services with the balance managing corporate and area functions, including debt and capital market transactions, legal, finance, accounting, and other support functions. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.\n\nIn 2022, Aimco was recognized with Healthiest Employers Awards in South Florida, Washington, D.C., and Denver, ranking #1 in its category for South Florida,  #2  in  its  category  for  Washington,  D.C.,  and  a  top  scorer  in  Denver's  medium  sized  employer  category.  The  Healthiest  Employers Awards  honor companies with policies and initiatives promoting the health and well-being of their employees. Healthiest Employers takes a holistic view of worksite health, evaluating the extent of leadership team buy-in, including how well they understand the needs of the employee population and how they proactively support well-being.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur combined Annual Report on Form 10-K, our combined Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by us or Aimco Operating Partnership, and any amendments to any of those reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable through our website at www.aimco.com. The information contained on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nThe risk factors noted in this section, and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report, describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS\n\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises and dislocations in the financial and credit markets could affect our ability to collect rents and late fees from tenants, and our ability to evict tenants, in addition to having other negative effects on our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions, local, regional, national, or international health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could negatively impact our tenants and our operations. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19 may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. These conditions also may add uncertainty to operations and may cause supply chain disruptions.",

The extent of such impact will depend on developments, such as the emergence of new COVID-19 variants. Such developments, depending on their nature, duration, and intensity, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\n\n## We do not have control over the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments, the operation of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur indirect interest in the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, exposure to the skill and capital of the controlling party and those resulting from fluctuations in San Francisco occupancy rates, the operating disruption due to effects of COVID-19, and the current economic situation which may result in all, or a portion of the loan not being repaid. In the future, we may have situations like the Parkmerced Apartments impairment that may affect us. Such risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Development, redevelopment, and construction risks could affect our profitability.\n\nDevelopment and redevelopment are subject to numerous risks, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third-party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities;\n- \u00b7 we  may  incur  costs  that  exceed  our  original  estimates  due  to  increased  material,  labor,  or  other  factors  and  costs,  such  as  those  resulting  from litigation, program changes, inflation, interest rate increases or supply chain disruptions;\n- \u00b7 we  may  be  unable  to  complete  construction  and  lease-up  of  an  apartment  community  on  schedule,  including  as  a  result  of  global  supply  chain disruptions, resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues;\n- \u00b7 occupancy rates and rents at an apartment community may fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development of competing communities;",

If market volatility causes economic conditions to remain unpredictable or to trend downwards, we may not achieve our expected returns on properties under development and we could lose some or all of our investments in those properties. In addition, the lead time required to develop, construct, and lease-up a development property may increase, which could adversely impact our projected returns or result in a termination of the development project.\n\nIn addition, we may serve as either the construction manager or the general contractor for our development projects. The construction of real estate projects entails unique risks, including risks that the project will fail to conform to building plans, specifications, and timetables. These failures could be caused by labor strikes,  weather,  government  regulations,  and  other  conditions  beyond  our  control.  In  addition,  we  may  become  liable  for  injuries  and  accidents  occurring during the construction process that are underinsured.\n\n## Failure to generate sufficient net operating income may adversely affect our liquidity, limit our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures, or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions.\n\nOur ability to fund necessary capital expenditures on our communities and make payments to our investors depends on, among other things, our ability to generate net operating income in excess of required debt payments and our ability to collect on interest and principal payments due to us. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures on our communities, we may not be able to preserve the competitiveness of our communities, which could adversely affect their net operating income and long-term value.\n\nOur net operating income and liquidity may be adversely affected by events or conditions beyond our control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the general economic climate;\n- \u00b7 an inflationary environment in which the costs to operate and maintain our communities increase at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents, which we can only do upon renewal of existing leases or at the inception of new leases;\n- \u00b7 competition from other apartment communities and other housing options;\n- \u00b7 local conditions, such as loss of jobs, unemployment rates, or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates;\n- \u00b7 changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance;",

In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing affordability. Rising interest rates increase the borrowing costs on new debt and could affect fair value of our investments. In an inflationary environment, our cost of capital, labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline, which can have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.\n\nAlternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our real estate to decline. These, or other factors related to deflation, could have a negative impact on our business or financial results.\n\n## Our ability to continue to grow or maintain our pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities may be constrained.\n\nWe source development and redevelopment opportunities through various means, including from our operating portfolio and property acquisitions. We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of properties compatible with our investment strategy. We may be unable to locate properties that will produce returns with a sufficient spread to our cost of capital.  The inability to source opportunities could impede our growth and could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Our properties are geographically concentrated in Florida, Chicago, and in the Northeast region of the United States, which makes us more susceptible to regional and local adverse economic and other conditions than if we owned a more geographically diversified portfolio.\n\nThe majority of our properties are located in Florida, Chicago, and in the Northeast region of the United States. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to  adverse  economic  or  other  conditions  in  these  markets  (such  as  periods  of  economic  slowdown  or  recession,  business  layoffs  or  downsizing,  industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases in real estate and other taxes, and the cost of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation), as well as to natural disasters (including earthquakes, storms, and hurricanes), potentially adverse effects of 'global warming,' and other disruptions that occur in these markets (such as terrorist activity or threats of terrorist activity and other events), any of which may have a greater impact on the value of our assets or on our operating results than if we owned a more geographically diversified portfolio.\n\nWe cannot assure you that these markets will grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners, operators, and developers of multifamily, retail, or office assets, or future development assets. Our operations may also be affected if competing assets are built in these markets. Moreover, submarkets within our core markets may be dependent upon a limited number of industries. Any adverse economic or other conditions, or any decrease in demand for office, multifamily, or retail assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Our development projects may subject us to certain liabilities, and we are subject to risks associated with developing properties in partnership with others.\n\nWe may hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction, engineering, and various other services for development projects. Certain of these contracts may be structured such that we are the principal rather than the agent. As a result, we may assume liabilities in the course of the project and be subjected to, or become liable for, claims for construction defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions by third parties we have engaged.\n\nAdverse outcomes of disputes or litigation could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, particularly if we have not limited the extent of the damages for which we may be liable, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance that we carry. Moreover, our tenants may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a legal matter, in which case we may determine it necessary to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the tenant or customer relationship or to protect our corporate brand. To the extent our tenants are obligated to reimburse us, acting as a principal may also mean that we pay a contractor before we have been reimbursed by our tenants. This exposes us to additional risks of collection in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, or a condominium purchaser default. The reverse can occur as well, where a contractor we have paid files for bankruptcy protection or commits fraud with the funds before completing a project that we have funded in part or in full.",

Acting  through  our  wholly-owned subsidiaries, we typically will be the general partner or managing member in these partnerships or limited liability companies. There are, however, instances in which  we  may  not  control  or  even  participate  in  management  or  day-to-day  operations  of  these  properties.  The  use  of  partnerships  and  limited  liability companies involve special risks associated with the possibility that:\n\n- \u00b7 a partner or member may have interests or goals inconsistent with ours;\n- \u00b7 a general partner or managing member may take actions contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives with respect to our real estate investments;\n- \u00b7 a partner or member could experience financial difficulties that prevent it from fulfilling its financial or other responsibilities to the project; or\n- \u00b7 a partner may not fulfill its contractual obligations.\n\nIn the event any of our partners or members file for bankruptcy, we could be precluded from taking certain actions affecting our project without bankruptcy court approval, which could diminish our control over the project even if we were the general partner or managing member. In addition, if the bankruptcy court were to discharge the obligations of our partner or member, it could result in our ultimate liability for the project being greater than originally anticipated.\n\nFurther, disputes between us and a partner may result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent our management from focusing their time and attention on our business.\n\nTo the extent we are a general partner, we may be exposed to unlimited liability, which may exceed our investment or equity in the partnership. If one of our subsidiaries is a general partner of a particular partnership, it may be exposed to the same kind of unlimited liability.\n\n## Development of properties may entail a lengthy, uncertain, and costly entitlement process.\n\nApproval  to  develop  real  property  sometimes  requires  political  support  and  generally  entails  an  extensive  entitlement  process  involving  multiple  and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requires discretionary action by local governments. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development  regulations  and  may  need  to  comply  with  state  and  federal  regulations.  We  may  incur  substantial  costs  to  comply  with  legal  and  regulatory requirements. An increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs, or in some cases cause us to determine that the property is not feasible for development. In addition, our competitors and local residents may challenge our efforts to obtain entitlements and permits for the development of properties. The process to comply with these regulations is usually lengthy and costly, may not result in the approvals we seek, and can be expected to materially affect our development activities.\n\n## Government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of the development of our communities, increase our expenses or limit our building of apartments or other activities.\n\nVarious local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales, and similar matters apply to or affect the real estate development industry. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state, and local policies, rules and regulations, and their interpretations and application.\n\nMunicipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. If municipalities in which we operate take such actions, it could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs, or limiting our ability to operate in those municipalities. These measures may reduce our ability to develop apartment communities and to build and sell other real estate development projects in the affected markets, including with respect to land we may already own, and create additional costs and administration requirements, which in turn may harm our future sales, margins, and earnings.\n\nIn addition, there is a variety of legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state, and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct buildings. Such environmental laws may affect, for example, how we manage storm water runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate properties on or affecting resources such as  wetlands,  endangered species, cultural  resources,  or  areas  subject  to  preservation  laws;  and  how  we  address  contamination. As  climate  change  concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. In addition, it is possible that some form of expanded energy efficiency legislation may be passed by the",

        "page_content": "U.S. Congress or federal agencies and certain state legislatures, which may, despite being phased in over time, significantly increase our costs of building apartment communities and the sale price to our buyers and adversely affect our sales volumes. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law.\n\nEnergy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy-related taxes and regulations. Our noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations, other sanctions and reputational harm.\n\nGovernmental regulation affects not only construction activities but also sales activities, mortgage lending activities, and other dealings with consumers. Further,  government  agencies  routinely  initiate  audits,  reviews,  or  investigations  of  our  business  practices  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and regulations,  which  can  cause  us  to  incur  costs  or  create  other  disruptions  in  our  business  that  can  be  significant.  Further,  we  may  experience  delays  and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.\n\n## Competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes, increase or maintain rents or execute our development strategy.\n\nOur apartment communities compete for residents with other housing alternatives, including other rental apartments and condominiums, and, to a lesser degree, single-family homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing, as well as the lack of household formation and job creation in a particular area, could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates.\n\nIn  addition,  there  are  many  developers,  managers,  and  owners  of  apartment  real  estate  and  underdeveloped  land,  as  well  as  REITs,  private  real  estate companies, and investors, that compete with us, some of whom have greater financial resources and market share than us. If our competitors prevent us from realizing our real estate development objectives, our performance may fall short of our expectations and adversely affect our business.\n\n## Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to sell apartment communities or other assets when appropriate.\n\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. REIT tax rules also restrict our ability to sell apartment communities. Thus, we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other market conditions. Our ability to dispose of apartment communities  in  the  future  will  depend  on  prevailing  economic  and  market  conditions,  including  the  cost  and  availability  of  financing.  This  could  have  a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Climate change may adversely affect our business.\n\nTo the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including significant property damage to or destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulations  based  on  concerns  about  climate  change  could  result  in  increased  capital  expenditures  on  our  properties  (for  example,  to  improve  their  energy efficiency and/or resistance to inclement weather) without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income.\n\n## Potential liability or other expenditures associated with potential environmental contamination may be costly.\n\nVarious federal, state, and local laws subject real estate owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present in the land or buildings. Potentially hazardous materials may include polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleumbased fuels, lead-based paint, or asbestos, among other materials. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such materials. The presence of, or the failure to manage or remediate properly, these materials may adversely affect occupancy at such real estate as well as the ability to sell or finance such real estate. In addition, governmental agencies may bring claims for costs associated with investigation and remediation actions, damages to natural resources, and for potential fines or penalties in connection with such damage or with respect to the improper management of hazardous materials. Moreover, private plaintiffs may potentially make claims for investigation and remediation costs they  incur,  or  personal  injury,  disease,  disability,  or  other  infirmities  related  to  the  alleged  presence  of  hazardous  materials  at  an  apartment  community.

Especially in times of recession and economic slowdown, rent control initiatives can acquire significant political support. If rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties, our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected.\n\n## Laws benefiting disabled persons may result in our incurrence of unanticipated expenses.\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ('ADA'), all places intended to be used by the public are required to meet certain federal requirements related  to  access  and  use  by  disabled  persons. The  Fair  Housing Amendments Act  of  1988  ('FHAA')  requires  apartment  communities  first  occupied  after March  13,  1991,  to  comply  with  design  and  construction  requirements  for  disabled  access.  For  those  apartment  communities  receiving  federal  funds,  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 also has requirements regarding disabled access. These and federal, state, and local laws may require structural modifications to our apartment communities or changes in policy/practice or affect renovations of the communities. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. Although  we  believe  that  our  apartment  communities  are  substantially  in  compliance  with  present  requirements,  we  may  incur  unanticipated expenses to comply with the ADA, the FHAA, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in connection with the ongoing operation or redevelopment of our apartment communities.\n\n## Moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly.\n\nAlthough we are proactively engaged in managing moisture intrusion and preventing the presence of mold at our apartment communities, it is not unusual for periodic moisture intrusion to cause mold in isolated locations within an apartment community. We have implemented policies, procedures, and training, and include  a  detailed  moisture  intrusion  and  mold  assessment  during  acquisition  due  diligence. We  believe  these  measures  will  manage  mold  exposure  at  our apartment communities and will minimize the effects that mold may have on our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate mold conditions. We have only limited insurance coverage for property damage claims arising from the presence of mold and for personal injury claims related to mold exposure.\n\n## Although we are insured for certain risks, the cost of insurance, increased claims activity, or losses resulting from casualty events may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are insured for a portion of our real estate assets' exposure to casualty losses resulting from fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and other perils, which insurance is subject to deductibles and self-insurance retention. We recognize casualty losses or gains based on the net book value of the affected asset and the amount of any related insurance proceeds. In many instances, the actual cost to repair or replace the apartment community may exceed its net book value and any insurance proceeds. We recognize the uninsured portion of losses as casualty losses in the periods in which they are incurred. In addition, we are self-insured for a portion of our exposure to third-party claims related to our workers' compensation coverage and general liability exposure. With respect to our exposure to claims of third parties, we establish reserves at levels that reflect our known and estimated losses. The ultimate cost of losses and the impact of unforeseen events may vary materially from recorded reserves, and variances may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We purchase insurance to reduce our exposure to losses and limit our financial losses on large individual risks. The availability and cost of insurance are determined by market conditions outside our control. No assurance can be made that we will be able to obtain and maintain insurance at the same levels and on the same terms as we do today. If we are not able to obtain or maintain insurance in amounts we consider appropriate for our business, or if the cost of obtaining such insurance increases materially, we may have to retain a larger portion of the potential loss associated with our exposures to risks.\n\n## Natural disasters and severe weather may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather such as hurricanes may result in significant damage to our real estate assets. The extent of our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected  area.  When  we  have  geographic  concentration  of  exposures,  a  single  catastrophe  (such  as  an  earthquake)  or  destructive  weather  event  (such  as  a hurricane) affecting a region may have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot accurately predict natural disasters or severe weather, or the number and type of such events that will affect us. As a result, our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next. Although we anticipate and plan for losses, there can be no assurance that our financial",

Members of our senior management team have national or regional industry reputations that attract business and investment opportunities and assist us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants, and other industry participants. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain similarly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities, and weaken our  relationships  with  lenders,  business  partners,  existing  and  prospective  tenants,  and  industry  participants,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\n\n## We rely on our property managers to manage our properties. If our property managers fail to efficiently manage our properties, tenants may not renew their leases, or we may become subject to unforeseen liabilities.\n\nA majority of our properties are managed by AIR. We do not supervise AIR or its managers and employees on a day-to-day basis and we cannot assure you that  they  will  manage  such  properties  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  their  obligations  under  our  agreements,  that  they  will  not  be  negligent  in  their performance or  engage  in  any  criminal  or  fraudulent  activity,  or  that  they  will  not  otherwise  default  on  their  management  obligations  to  us.  If  any  of  the foregoing occurs, the relationships with our tenants at such properties could be damaged, which may cause the tenants not to renew their leases, and we could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to the properties or to persons at the properties. If we are unable to lease the properties or we become subject to significant liabilities as a result of AIR's management performance, our financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\n\n## Our business and operations would suffer in the event of significant disruptions or cyberattacks of our information technology systems or our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations related to privacy and data protection.\n\nInformation technology, communication networks, and related systems are essential to the operation of our business. We use these systems to manage our vendor relationships, internal communications, accounting and record-keeping systems, and many other key aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks, which also depend on the strength of our  procedures  and  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  controls.  Information  security  risks  have  generally  increased  in  recent  years  due  to  the  rise  in  new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks.\n\nDespite system redundancy, risk transfer, insurance, indemnification, the implementation of security measures, required employee awareness training, and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems, and systems maintained by third-party vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number of sources. We face risks associated with energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures, and cyberattacks and intrusions, such as computer viruses, malware, attachments to emails, intrusion, and unauthorized access, including from persons inside our organization or from persons outside our organization with access to our systems. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and have implemented various measures  to  manage  the  risk  of  a  security  breach  or  disruption,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  security  efforts  and  measures  will  be  effective  or  that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy  and  other  laws,  significant  legal  and  financial  exposure,  damage  to  our  reputation,  loss,  or  misuse  of  the  information  (which  may  be  confidential, proprietary, or commercially sensitive in nature), and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.\n\nWe also are subject  to  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  United  States,  such  as  the  California  Consumer  Protection Act  (the  'CCPA'  (which  became effective on January 1, 2020)), relating to the collection, use, and security of employee and other data.

In addition, AIR has an additional right of first offer with respect to stabilized properties that we are under contract to purchase, with certain exceptions as further set forth in the Master Leasing Agreement. The rights of first offer held by AIR may discourage third parties from negotiating with us with respect to the sale of our real property and may limit the number of interested buyers, and further may prevent us from receiving the maximum price that we may otherwise have obtained for such properties.\n\n## There may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR.\n\nThere may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR. The Separation was designed to minimize conflicts of interest between us and AIR, and the volume of transactions with AIR has significantly decreased since the Separation. Additionally, Mr. Considine no longer serves as a director on the Aimco Board. However, there can be no assurance that such conflicts don't exist.\n\nActual,  potential,  or  perceived  conflicts  could  give  rise  to  investor  dissatisfaction,  settlements  with  stockholders,  litigation  or  regulatory  inquiries  or enforcement actions. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential, actual, or perceived conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including causing a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us, a decrease in the prices of our equity securities, and a resulting increased risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\n\n## Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\n\nPublicly  traded  companies  have  increasingly  become  subject  to  campaigns  by  investors  advocating  corporate  actions  such  as  financial  restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. Given our stockholder composition and other factors, it is possible our stockholders or future activist stockholders may attempt to effect such changes. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by such activist stockholders or others would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board and senior management team from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or changes to the composition of our board of directors (the \"Board\") may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability, or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential lenders, partners, or others with whom we do business, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING\n\n## Our debt financing could result in foreclosure of our apartment communities, prevent us from making distributions on our equity, or otherwise adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nA significant number of our assets, including apartment communities, land, and construction projects serve as collateral for our credit facility, property debt and construction loans. Our secured credit facility matures in December 2023, subject to extension options. Certain of our subsidiaries have existing secured property-level debt equal to approximately $938.5 million and construction loans of approximately $126.3 million as of December 31, 2022. Over time, we are likely to become party to additional financing arrangements, including credit facilities or other bank debt, bonds, and mortgage financing. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur, and we have significant amounts of debt outstanding. Payments of principal and interest may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our communities or pay distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT.\n\nIn connection with such financing activities, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that our indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of thenexisting indebtedness. If we fail to make required payments of principal and interest on our non-recourse property debt, our lenders could foreclose on the apartment communities and other collateral securing such debt, which would result in the loss to us of income and asset value.",

        "page_content": "## Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing and the cost of available financing and could adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nOur ability  to  obtain  financing  and  the  cost  of  such  financing  depends  on  the  overall  condition  of  the  United  States  credit  markets.  During  periods  of economic uncertainty, the United States credit markets may experience significant liquidity disruptions, which may cause the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably and make obtaining financing, including, but not limited to non-recourse property debt secured by stabilized properties, construction loans, and corporate borrowings such as those under our credit facilities, more difficult. In particular, apartment borrowers have benefited from the historic willingness of  the  Federal  National  Mortgage Association  ('Fannie  Mae'),  and  the  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  ('Freddie  Mac'),  to  make  substantial amounts  of  loans  secured  by  multifamily  properties,  even  in  times  of  economic  distress.  These  two  lenders  are  federally  chartered  and  subject  to  federal regulation, which is subject to change, making uncertain their prospects and ability to provide liquidity in a future downturn.\n\nIf our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected, we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financings through other sources of liquidity, which could result in a lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt and loss of income and asset value, both of which would adversely affect our liquidity.\n\n## Increases  in  interest  rates  would  increase  our  interest  expense  and  reduce  our  profitability,  and  the  phasing  out  of  LIBOR  could  adversely  affect  our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nOur revolving secured credit facility contains a variable interest rate which may be based, in part, on LIBOR. We also have certain non-recourse property debt and construction loans that are based on variable interest rate indexes. An increase or decrease in these variable interest rate indexes would likely increase or decrease our interest expense. An increase in interest expense may affect our profitability. We have taken steps to mitigate risk associated with an increase in variable interest rate indexes with approximately 98% of our non-recourse property debt and construction loans being either fixed or hedged as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIn March 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, formally announced that the publication of LIBOR was ending and confirmed that USD LIBOR-indexed rates would cease to be published after June 30, 2023. In 2018, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') as the recommended alternative to LIBOR. The adoption of SOFR is growing, and SOFR is now a widely used index on new transactions. However, until the transition from LIBOR is complete, there are risks and uncertainty in the markets as to the adoption and implementation of alternative reference rates. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of this on-going transition. Certain of our debt agreements, including our revolving secured credit facility,  bear  interest  at  rates  that  are  calculated  based,  in  part,  on  LIBOR.  If  LIBOR  ceases  to  exist  during  the  term  of  our  agreements,  the documents associated with our agreements contain language to address a transition to another benchmark rate. Accordingly, the phase-out of LIBOR and any other related changes or reforms, could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, and as a result, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\n\n## Covenant restrictions may limit our operations and impact our ability to make payments to our investors.\n\nSome of our existing and/or future debt and other securities may contain covenants that restrict our activities. These may include covenants that limit our operations or impact our ability to make distributions or other payments unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied, as well as certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants.\n\n## We may increase leverage in executing our development plan, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\n\nWe may decide to increase our leverage to execute our development plan. We will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. Although our credit facility may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness,  our  governing  documents  do  not  limit  the  amount  of  debt  we  may  incur,  and  we  may  change  our  target  debt  levels  at  any  time  without  the approval of our stockholders. We may incur additional indebtedness from time to time in the future to finance working capital,",

If we do so, the risks related to our indebtedness could intensify.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\n## Aimco may fail to qualify as a REIT .\n\nIf Aimco fails to qualify as a REIT, Aimco will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and will be subject to United States federal income tax at regular corporate rates. This would substantially reduce our funds available for general corporate usage or for distribution to our investors. Unless entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, Aimco also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, Aimco's failure to qualify as a REIT may place us in default under our credit facilities.\n\nWe believe Aimco operates, and has since its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, operated, in a manner that enables it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. However, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Moreover, even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Aimco's continued qualification  as  a  REIT  will  depend  on  its  satisfaction  of  certain  asset,  income,  investment,  organizational,  distribution,  stockholder  ownership,  and  other requirements on a continuing basis. Aimco's ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we do not obtain independent appraisals.  Aimco's compliance with the REIT annual income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for United States federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the 'IRS'), will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or other issuers constitutes a violation of the REIT requirements. Moreover, future economic, market, legal, tax, or other considerations may cause Aimco to fail to qualify as a REIT, or the Board may determine to revoke its REIT status.\n\n## REIT distribution requirements limit our available cash.\n\nAs a REIT, Aimco is subject to annual distribution requirements. Aimco pays distributions, including taxable stock dividends, intended to enable Aimco to satisfy  its  distribution  requirements.  This  limits  the  amount  of  cash  available  for  other  business  purposes,  including  amounts  to  fund  our  growth. Aimco generally  must  distribute  annually  at  least  90%  of  our  'real  estate  investment  trust  taxable  income,'  which  is  generally  equivalent  to  net  taxable  ordinary income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to United States federal corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to Aimco's stockholders to comply with the requirements applicable to REITs under the Code (which may be all cash or combination of cash and stock satisfying the requirements of applicable law). However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell apartment communities or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.\n\n## Aimco may be subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in certain circumstances.\n\nEven as a REIT, Aimco may be subject to United States federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on its undistributed income. We could also be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm's-length transactions between us and a taxable REIT subsidiary ('TRS') and on any net income from sales of apartment communities that were held for sale primarily in the ordinary course. State and local tax laws may not conform to the United States federal income tax treatment, and Aimco may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions in which Aimco transacts business. Any taxes imposed on Aimco would reduce our operating cash flow and net income and could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends and distributions.\n\n## Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\n\nREITs are entitled to a United States federal income tax deduction for dividends paid to their stockholders. As compared to other taxable corporations, this ability  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  REIT's  taxable  income  by  paying  dividends  to  stockholders  is  a  principal  benefit  of  maintaining  REIT  status,  generally resulting in a lower combined tax liability of the REIT and its stockholders",

        "page_content": "as compared to that of the combined tax liability of other taxable corporations and their stockholders. Notwithstanding this combined benefit, dividends payable by REITs may result in marginally higher taxes to the stockholder.\n\nC-corporations are generally required to pay United States federal income tax on earnings. After-tax earnings are then available for stockholder dividends. The maximum United States federal tax rate applicable to income from 'qualified dividends' payable to United States stockholders that are individuals, trusts, and estates is currently 20%, plus the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. While dividends payable by REITs are generally not eligible for the qualified dividend reduced rates, stockholders that are individuals, trusts, or estates, and meet certain requirements, may generally deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary dividends from REITs. This deduction is available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, and will generally cause the maximum tax rate for ordinary dividends from REITs to be 29.6%, plus the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. The more favorable tax rates applicable to regular  corporate  qualified  dividends  could  cause  investors  who  are  individuals,  trusts,  and  estates  to  perceive  investments  in  REITs  to  be  relatively  less attractive than investments in the shares of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including Aimco Common Stock.\n\n## Complying with the REIT requirements may cause Aimco to forgo otherwise attractive business opportunities.\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, Aimco must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts distributed to its stockholders, and the ownership of our stock. As a result of these tests, Aimco may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when Aimco does not have funds readily available for distribution, forgo otherwise attractive investment opportunities, liquidate assets in adverse market conditions, or contribute assets to a TRS that is subject to regular corporate federal income tax.\n\n## Changes to United States federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect Aimco and Aimco's stockholders.\n\nThe present United States federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial, or administrative action at any time, which could affect the United States federal income tax treatment of an investment in Aimco's Common Stock. The United States federal income  tax  rules  dealing  with  REITs  are  constantly  under  review  by  persons  involved  in  the  legislative  process,  the  IRS,  and  the  United  States  Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect Aimco or its stockholders. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT and the tax considerations relevant to an investment in Aimco's Common Stock or could cause us to change our investments and commitments.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO AIMCO OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS\n\nThere are restrictions on the ability to transfer and redeem Aimco Operating Partnership Units, there is no public market for Aimco Operating Partnership Units and holders of Aimco Operating Partnership Units are subject to dilution.\n\nThe Aimco Operating Partnership agreement restricts the transferability of OP Units. Until the expiration of a one-year holding period, subject to certain exceptions, investors may not transfer OP Units without the consent of Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner. Thereafter, investors may transfer such OP Units subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the general partner's right of first refusal. In addition, after the expiration of the one-year holding period, investors have the right, subject to the terms of Aimco Operating Partnership's agreement, to require Aimco Operating Partnership to redeem all or  a  portion  of  such  investor's  OP  Units  (in  exchange  for  shares  of  our  Common  Stock or cash, at the Aimco Operating Partnership's discretion) once per quarter on an exchange date set by Aimco Operating Partnership, provided such investor provides notice at least 45 days prior to the quarterly exchange date. See 'Description of Aimco Operating Partnership Units and Summary of Aimco Operating Partnership Agreement-Redemption Rights of Qualifying Parties'. There is no public market for the OP Units. Aimco Operating Partnership has no plans to list any OP Units on a securities exchange. It is unlikely that any person will make a market in the OP Units, or that an active market for the OP Units will develop. If a market for the OP Units develops and the OP Units are considered 'readily tradable' on a 'secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof),' Aimco Operating Partnership would be classified as a publicly traded partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could have a material adverse effect on Aimco Operating Partnership and its unitholders.\n\nIn addition, Aimco Operating Partnership may issue an unlimited number of additional OP Units or other securities for such consideration and on such terms as it may establish, without the approval of the holders of OP Units. Such securities could have priority over the OP Units as to cash flow, distributions, and liquidation proceeds. The effect of any such issuance may be to dilute the interests of holders of OP Units.",

        "page_content": "## Cash distributions by Aimco Operating Partnership are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with partnership performance.\n\nAimco Operating Partnership does not intend to make regular distributions to holders of OP Units (other than what is required for Aimco to maintain its REIT status). There can be no assurance regarding the amounts of available cash that Aimco Operating Partnership will generate or the portion that its general partner  will  choose  to  distribute.  The  actual  amounts  of  available  cash  will  depend  upon  numerous  factors,  including  profitability  of  operations,  required principal  and  interest  payments  on  its  debt,  the  cost  of  acquisitions  (including  related  debt  service  payments),  its  issuance  of  debt  and  equity  securities, fluctuations in working capital, capital expenditures, adjustments in reserves, prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business, and other factors, some of which  may  be  beyond  Aimco  Operating  Partnership's  control.  Cash  distributions  depend  primarily  on  cash  flow,  including  from  reserves,  and  not  on profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. Therefore, cash distributions may be made during periods when our operating partnership records losses and may not  be  made  during  periods  when  it  records  profits.  The Aimco  Operating  Partnership  agreement  gives  the  general  partner  discretion  in  establishing reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership's business that will affect the amount of available cash. Aimco Operating Partnership may be required to make reserves for the future payment of principal and interest under its credit facilities and other indebtedness. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership's credit facilities may limit its ability to distribute cash to holders of OP Units. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance regarding actual levels of cash distributions on OP Units, and Aimco Operating Partnership's ability to distribute cash may be limited during the existence of any events of default under any of its debt instruments.\n\n## Holders of OP Units have limited voting rights and are limited in their ability to effect a change of control.\n\nAimco Operating Partnership is managed and operated by its general partner, Aimco. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, holders of OP Units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting Aimco Operating Partnership's business. Such matters relate to certain amendments of the partnership agreement and certain transactions such as the institution of bankruptcy proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors and certain transfers by the general partner of its interest in Aimco Operating Partnership or the admission of a successor general partner. Holders of OP Units have no right to elect the general partner on an annual or other continuing basis, or to remove the general partner. As a result, holders of OP Units have limited influence on matters affecting the operation of Aimco Operating Partnership, and third parties may find it difficult to attempt to gain control over, or influence the activities of, Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nThe limited partners of Aimco Operating Partnership are unable to remove the general partner or to vote in the election of our directors unless they own shares of Aimco. In order to comply with specific REIT tax requirements, Aimco's charter has restrictions on the ownership of its equity securities. As a result, Aimco Operating Partnership limited partners and Aimco's stockholders are limited in their ability to effect a change of control of Aimco Operating Partnership and Aimco, respectively.\n\n## Holders of OP Units may not have limited liability in specific circumstances.\n\nThe limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states. If it were determined that Aimco Operating Partnership had been conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute, or that the right or the exercise of the right by the holders of OP Units as a group to make specific amendments to the agreement of limited partnership or to take other action under the agreement of limited partnership constituted participation in the 'control' of Aimco Operating Partnership's business, then a holder of OP Units could be held liable under specific circumstances for our operating partnership's obligations to the same extent as the general partner.\n\n## Aimco may have conflicts of interest with holders of OP Units.\n\nConflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership and its affiliates (including us), on the one hand, and Aimco Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. The directors and officers of the general partner have fiduciary duties to manage the general partner in a manner beneficial to us, as the sole stockholder of the general partner. At the same time, as the general partner of our operating partnership, we have fiduciary duties to manage Aimco Operating Partnership in a manner beneficial to Aimco Operating Partnership and its limited partners. The duties of the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership to Aimco Operating Partnership and its partners may therefore come into  conflict  with  the  duties  of  the  directors  and  officers  of  the  general  partner  to  its  sole  stockholder, Aimco.  Such  conflicts  of  interest  might  arise  in  the following situations, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 decisions of the general partner with respect to the amount and timing of cash expenditures, borrowings, issuances of additional interests and reserves in any quarter, will affect whether or the extent to which there is available cash to make distributions in a given quarter;",

Therefore, the general partner, in its capacity as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, will be primarily responsible for enforcing such obligations; and\n- \u00b7 under the terms of the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement, the general partner is not restricted from causing Aimco Operating Partnership to pay the general partner or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to Aimco Operating Partnership or entering into additional  contractual  arrangements  with  any  of  such  entities  on  behalf  of  our  operating  partnership.  Neither  the  Aimco  Operating  Partnership agreement nor any of the other agreements, contracts, and arrangements between Aimco Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership and its affiliates, on the other, are or will be the result of arm's-length negotiations.\n\n## Provisions in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement may limit the ability of a holder of OP Units to challenge actions taken by the general partner.\n\nDelaware law provides that, except as provided in a partnership agreement, a general partner owes the fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the partnership and  its  limited  partners.  The Aimco  Operating  Partnership  agreement  expressly  authorizes  the  general  partner  to  enter  into,  on  behalf  of Aimco  Operating Partnership, a right of first opportunity arrangement and other conflict avoidance agreements with various affiliates of Aimco Operating Partnership and the general partner, on such terms as the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, believes are advisable. The latitude given in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement to the general partner in resolving conflicts of interest may significantly limit the ability of a holder of OP Units to challenge what might otherwise be a breach of fiduciary duty. The general partner believes, however, that such latitude is necessary and appropriate to enable it to serve as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership without undue risk of liability.\n\nThe Aimco  Operating  Partnership  agreement  limits  the  liability  of  the  general  partner  for  actions  taken  in  good  faith. Aimco  Operating  Partnership's partnership agreement expressly limits the liability of the general partner by providing that the general partner, and its officers and directors, will not be liable or accountable in damages to Aimco Operating Partnership, the limited partners, or assignees for errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or omission if the general partner or such director or officer acted in good faith. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership is required to indemnify the general partner, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses, judgments, fines, and other actions incurred by the general partner or such other persons, provided that Aimco Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (i) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law or (ii) for any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement. The provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and the general partner has not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict the fiduciary duties of the general partner that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries may be prohibited from making distributions and other payments.\n\nAll of Aimco Operating Partnership's real estate assets are owned by subsidiaries of our operating partnership. As a result, Aimco Operating Partnership depends on distributions and payments from its subsidiaries in order to satisfy our financial obligations and make payments to our equity holders, as applicable. The ability of Aimco Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to make such distributions and other payments depends on their earnings and cash flows and may be subject to statutory or contractual limitations, including covenants in some of our existing and/or future debt agreements. As an equity investor in the REIT subsidiaries and our subsidiaries, our right to receive assets upon their liquidation or reorganization are effectively subordinated to the claims of their creditors and any holders of preferred equity senior to our equity investments.

Aimco's charter also limits ownership of Aimco's Common Stock and preferred stock by any single stockholder to 8.7% of the value of the outstanding Common Stock and preferred stock, or 15% in the case of certain pension trusts, registered investment companies, and Mr. Considine. The charter also  prohibits  anyone  from  buying  shares  of Aimco's  capital  stock  if  the  purchase  would  result  in Aimco  losing  its  REIT  status.  This  could  happen  if  a transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of Aimco's shares of capital stock or results in five or fewer persons (applying certain attribution rules of the Code) owning 50% or more of the value of all of Aimco's shares of capital stock.

If the trust transfers any of the shares of capital stock, the affected person will receive the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the then current market price. An individual who acquires shares of capital stock that violate the above rules bears the risk that the individual:\n\n- \u00b7 may lose control over the power to dispose of such shares;\n- \u00b7 may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases;\n- \u00b7 may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases; and\n- \u00b7 may be required to repay to us any dividends received from us as a result of his or her ownership of the shares.\n\n## Aimco's charter may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of Aimco.\n\nThe 8.7% and other ownership limits discussed above may have the effect of delaying or precluding acquisition  by  a  third-party  of  control  of Aimco without the consent of our Board of Directors. Aimco's charter authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 510,587,500 shares of capital stock. As of December 31, 2022, 500,787,260 shares were classified as Common Stock and 9,800,240 shares were classified as preferred stock. Under Aimco's charter, Aimco's  Board  of  Directors  has  the  authority  to  classify  and  reclassify  any  of  our  unissued  shares  of  capital  stock  into  shares  of  capital  stock  with  such preferences, conversion or other rights, voting power restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemptions as the Board of Directors may determine. The authorization and issuance of a new class of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of Aimco, where there is a difference of opinion between Aimco's Board of Directors and others as to what is in  Aimco's stockholders' best interests.\n\n## The Maryland General Corporation Law may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of Aimco.\n\nAs a Maryland corporation, Aimco is subject to various Maryland laws that may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, where there is a difference of opinion between our Board of Directors and others as to what is in our stockholders' best interests.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\n## Aimco\n\nOur Common Stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol 'AIV.'\n\nOn February 24, 2023, there were 149,925,165 shares of Common Stock outstanding, held by 825 stockholders of record. The number of holders does not include individuals or entities who beneficially own shares but whose shares are held of record by a broker or clearing agency but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one record holder.\n\n## Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities\n\nFrom time to time, we may issue shares of our Common Stock in exchange for OP Units, defined under the Aimco Operating Partnership heading below. Such shares are issued based on an exchange ratio of one share for each OP Unit. We may also issue shares of our Common Stock in exchange for limited partnership interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Please refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of such exchanges.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued approximately 108,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for OP Units in these transactions. Such shares were issued in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n## Repurchases of Equity Securities\n\nOur Board has, from time to time, authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding Common Stock. On July 27, 2022, our Board replaced all prior share repurchase authorizations with a new authorization to repurchase up to 15.0 million shares of  our outstanding Common Stock, subject to customary limitations, which may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This authorization has no expiration date. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at a weighted-average price of $7.21 per share. As of December 31, 2022, up to 12.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase authorization.\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nThere  is  no  public  market  for  OP  Units,  and  we  have  no  intention  of  listing  OP  Units  on  any  securities  exchange.  In  addition,  Aimco  Operating Partnership's Partnership Agreement restricts the transferability of OP Units.\n\nOn February 24, 2023, there were 162,014,847 OP Units and equivalents outstanding (of which 149,925,165 were held by us), that were held by 2,117 unitholders of record.\n\n## Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities\n\nAimco Operating Partnership did not issue any unregistered OP Units during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## Repurchases of Equity Securities\n\nAimco Operating Partnership's Partnership Agreement generally provides that after holding OP Units for one-year, limited partners other than us have the right to redeem their OP Units for cash or, at our election, shares of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary antidilution adjustments). During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 108,000 OP Units were redeemed in exchange for shares of Common Stock, and approximately 33,000 OP Units were redeemed in exchange for cash at an aggregate weighted average price per unit of $7.07.\n\n## Dividend and Distribution Payments\n\nAs a REIT, Aimco is required to distribute annually to holders of its Common Stock at least 90.0% of its 'real estate investment trust taxable income,' which, as defined by the Code and United States Department of Treasury regulations, is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income. Aimco's Board determines and declares Aimco's dividends. In making a dividend determination, Aimco's Board considers a variety of factors, including REIT distribution requirements; current market conditions; liquidity needs; and other uses of cash, such as deleveraging and accretive investment activities.\n\nStockholders receiving any dividend, whether payable in cash or cash and shares of Aimco Common Stock, will be required to include the full amount of such dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as",

Aimco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the sole general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership.

The distributions paid by Aimco Operating Partnership to Aimco are used to fund the dividends paid to Aimco's stockholders.

The FTSE Nareit Equity Apartments Index is published by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ('Nareit'), a representative of multifamily real estate investment trusts and publicly traded real estate companies with interests in United States real estate and capital markets. The FTSE Nareit Equity Apartments Index serves as our sector comparison and the Russell 2000 serves as our broad-based market index.\n\nThe indices are weighted for all companies that fit the definitional criteria of the particular index and are calculated to exclude companies as they are acquired and to add companies to the index calculation as they become publicly traded companies. All companies that fit the definitional criteria and existed at the point in time presented are included in the index calculations. The graph assumes the investment of $100 in our Common Stock and in each index on December 31, 2017, and that all dividends paid have been reinvested. The historical information set forth on the following page is not necessarily indicative of future performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                             |   For the years ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 2022 |   For the years ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 2022 | For the years ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 2022   | For the years ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 2022   | For the years ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 2022   | For the years ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Index                                       |                                                   2017 |                                                2018    |                                                        |                                                        |                                                        |                                                        |\n| Apartment Investment and Management Company |                                                    100 |                                                 104.13 | 126.55                                                 | 111.27                                                 | 162.68                                                 | 150.35                                                 |\n| FTSE Nareit Equity Apartment Index          |                                                    100 |                                                 103.7  | 130.99                                                 | 110.89                                                 | 181.44                                                 | 123.46                                                 |\n| Russell 2000                                |                                                    100 |                                                  88.99 | 111.70                                                 | 134.00                                                 | 153.85                                                 | 122.41                                                 |\n\nSource: Zacks Investment Research, Inc.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. For discussion of the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, please refer to Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nOur mission is to make real estate investments, primarily focused on the multifamily sector within targeted U.S. markets, where outcomes are enhanced through our human capital and substantial value is created for investors, teammates, and the communities in which we operate.\n\nPlease refer to 'Item 1. Business' for additional discussion of our business organization and strategy and 'Item 2. Properties' and 'Schedule III - Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation' for details regarding the size, location, and key characteristics of our various properties.\n\n## The Separation\n\nOn  December  15,  2020,  we  completed  the  separation  of AIR  from Aimco,  creating  two  distinct,  independent  businesses.  Prior  to  the  Separation,  the consolidated financial statements were prepared on a carve-out basis and reflect significant assumptions and allocations. The consolidated financial statements reflect  our  historical  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows  in  conformity  with  U.S.  GAAP.  Our  financial  statements  are  presented  for  all historical periods described and at the carrying value of such assets and liabilities reflected in Aimco Predecessor's books and records.\n\n## Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022\n\nThe results from the execution of our business plan during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, are described below.\n\n## Financial Results and 2022 Highlights\n\n- \u00b7 For the year ended December 31, 2022, net income attributable to common stockholders per share, on a fully dilutive basis, was $0.49, compared to a net loss per share of $0.04 for the same period in 2021, due primarily to lease modification income and gains on dispositions of real estate.\n- \u00b7 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we exited $952.8 million of assets including the sales of three stabilized apartment communities and one development land parcel, the termination of leases on four completed and stabilized development and redevelopment projects, and the liquidation of 22% of our investment in the private real estate developer, IQHQ Inc.\n- \u00b7 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we raised $912.0 million of new debt, which was used to capitalize development projects and payoff the $534.1 million of purchase money notes due to AIR Communities, 18 months prior to their maturity. This activity facilitated an increase in the weighted average maturity of Aimco's debt from 3.5 years for the year ended December 31, 2021, to 6.7 years for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we added future development opportunities in each of our target markets with the potential to produce more than 3,600 apartment homes and more than 450,000 square feet of commercial use.\n\n## Value Add, Opportunistic and Alternative Investments\n\n## Development and Redevelopment\n\nWe generally seek development and redevelopment opportunities where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined, and where we have a comparative advantage over others in the market. We will focus our new investment activity in Southeast Florida, the Washington D.C. Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range. Our Value Add and Opportunistic investments may also target portfolio acquisitions, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements.",

        "page_content": "We currently have five active development and redevelopment projects, located across four U.S. markets, in varying phases of construction and lease-up. These projects remain on track, as measured by budget, lease-up metrics, and current market valuations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we invested $294.4 million in development and redevelopment activities. Updates include:\n\n- \u00b7 In Miami, Florida, construction is nearing completion and fully renovated apartment homes are being leased at The Hamilton. Demand for rental housing in Southeast Florida remains robust, especially for unique luxury properties such as The Hamilton. The building welcomed its first residents in October and at year end the building was 50% occupied at rental rates significantly ahead of our underwritten projections.\n- \u00b7 In Bethesda, Maryland, construction began on the first phase of Strathmore Square which will contain 220 highly tailored apartment homes when complete in 2025. This infill project is located adjacent to the Grosvenor-Strathmore Metro station and the Strathmore Performing Arts Campus, and 1.5 miles from the National Institutes of  Health  main  campus.  Funding  for  the  $164.0  million  project  is  fully  secured  with Aimco's equity commitment projected to be $31.5 million.\n- \u00b7 In  upper  northwest  Washington  D.C.,  construction  at  Upton  Place  continues  on  schedule  and  on  budget.  The  neighboring  apartment community, City Ridge, is leasing up well and at rents that provide a positive indicator for Upton Place. Aimco plans to start pre-leasing Upton's 689 apartment homes during the summer of 2023 in anticipation of initial delivery in 4Q 2023. To date, 80% of the projects 105K square feet of retail space has been leased.\n- \u00b7 In Corte Madera, California, construction is ongoing at Oak Shore where 16 luxury single family rental homes and 8 accessory dwelling units are being developed. The Marin County submarket is significantly supply constrained with for-sale starter homes generally priced near $2.0 million. The development remains on budget, however major rain events delayed our construction schedule by an estimated eight weeks. Aimco expects to deliver the first homes in the third quarter with pre-leasing efforts having begun in the first quarter of 2023.\n- \u00b7 In Aurora, Colorado, The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club, the 106-key boutique hotel and event center, is slated for completion at the end of March. As the only 'on campus' accommodations, The Benson will serve the surrounding Anschutz Medical Campus which includes the University of Colorado Medical School, UC Health Hospital, Children's Hospital Colorado, The Rocky Mountain VA Medical Center and the burgeoning Fitzsimons Innovation Community.\n\n## Alternative Investments\n\nOur current alternative investments are primarily those investments originated by Aimco Predecessor and include a mezzanine loan secured by a stabilized multifamily  property  with  an  option  to  participate  in  future  multifamily  development,  as  well  as  three  passive  equity  investments.  Over  time,  we  plan  to significantly reduce capital allocated to these investments.\n\nUpdates for our alternative investments include:\n\n- \u00b7 The borrower on our mezzanine loan, which is secured by the Parkmerced stabilized multifamily property plus phases two through nine of the site's  future  development  opportunity,  remains  current  on  its  first  mortgage  obligations.  In  the  fourth  quarter,  given  the  decline  in  the underlying collateral value, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the investment to $158.6 million. We are currently exploring opportunities to monetize this investment to focus our capital on other accretive uses.\n- \u00b7 During 2022, we funded the remaining $14.2 million of a total $50.0 million commitment of a passive equity investment in IQHQ Inc., a life sciences developer. After funding was completed, 22% of our passive equity investment in IQHQ was redeemed for $16.5 million resulting in a greater than 50% internal rate of return over the hold period for this portion of our investment. We retained 2.4 million shares with a carrying value  of    $59.7  million  and  the  opportunity  to  collaborate  with  IQHQ  on  future  development  opportunities  that  include  a  multifamily component. We have no remaining equity commitments to IQHQ.\n\n## Investment Activity\n\nWe are focused on development and redevelopment, primarily funded through construction loans and joint venture equity.

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In 2022, we grew our pipeline of development opportunity with the acquisition of 14.9 acres of land for $152.5 million in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Miami, Florida, and on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado.\n- \u00b7 In  2022,  we  formed  two  joint  ventures  for  mixed-use  developments  in  the  Edgewater  neighborhood  of  Miami,  Florida  and  at  Strathmore Square in Bethesda, Maryland.\n- \u00b7 We sold three stabilized operating properties in 2022: Pathfinder Village in Fremont, California; Cedar Rim in Renton, Washington; and 2900 on First in Seattle, Washington, for $249.0 million at a weighted average NOI cap rate of 4.0%.\n- \u00b7 In December 2022, we sold 0.8 acres of the land acquired in 2022 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for $18.3 million.\n- \u00b7 Additionally,  following  the  successful  development  and  lease-up  of  (i)  707  Leahy  in  Redwood  City,  California,  (ii)  Prism  in  Cambridge, Massachusetts, (iii) Flamingo Point North Tower in Miami Beach, Florida and (iv) The Fremont on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, we and AIR entered into an agreement that terminated our leasehold interest in each of these four properties on September 1, 2022. The termination was completed on schedule at a combined asset value of $669 million and after the relief of the leasehold liabilities we received a cash payment of $200 million (subject to customary prorations and adjustments) as consideration from AIR, resulting in value creation, net of costs, of approximately $100 million, which was realized about 18 months sooner than anticipated.\n\n## Operating Property Results\n\nWe own a diversified  portfolio  of  stabilized  apartment  communities  located  in  eight  major  U.S.  markets  with  average  rents  in  line  with  local  market averages. We also own a commercial office building that is part of an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building.\n\nHighlights for the year ended December 31, 2022 include:\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $135.2 million, up 10.6% year over year, resulting from a $211 increase in average monthly revenue per apartment home to $2,087, partially offset by a 60-basis point decrease in Average Daily Occupancy to 97.4%.\n- \u00b7 Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $40.8 million, up 3.1% year over year, due primarily to higher real estate taxes and insurance.\n- \u00b7 Net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $94.4 million, up 14.2% year over year.\n- \u00b7 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, a waterfront office building in Miami, Florida, is owned as part of a larger assemblage with substantial development potential. During 2022, we executed leases on over 96,000 square feet of office space, at rates per square foot 10% higher than leases executed in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the building was 86% occupied, up from 80% at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Balance Sheet and Financing Activities\n\nWe are highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, including having at all times ample liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, we had access to $379.8 million in liquidity, including $206.5 million of cash on hand, $23.3 million of restricted cash, and the capacity to borrow up to $150.0 million on our revolving credit facility. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information regarding our leverage.\n\n## Financial Results of Operations\n\nWe have three segments: (i) Development and Redevelopment; (ii) Operating; and (iii) Other.\n\nOur  Development  and  Redevelopment  segment  includes  properties  that  are  under  construction  or  have  not  achieved  stabilization,  as  well  as  land assemblages that are being held for future development. Our Operating segment includes 21 residential apartment communities that have achieved stabilized levels of operations as of January 1, 2021, and maintained it throughout the current year and comparable period. Our Other segment consists of properties that are not included in our Development and Redevelopment or Operating segments.\n\nThe  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  the  results  of  our  operations  and  financial  condition  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  accompanying consolidated financial statement in Item 8.",

        "page_content": "Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to the same period in 2021\n\nNet income increased by $97.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, due primarily to the recognition of lease modification income and gains recognized on disposition of real estate partially offset by the non-cash impairment of the  Mezzanine Investment.\n\n## Property Results\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Development and Redevelopment segment included five properties that were under construction. Our Operating segment included 21 communities with 5,582 apartment homes, and our Other segment included our Eldridge Townhomes acquisition, and one office building.\n\nWe use proportionate property net operating income to assess the operating performance of our segments. Proportionate property net operating income is defined as our share of rental and other property revenues, less direct property operating expenses, but:\n\n- \u00b7 excluding utility reimbursements for the consolidated communities. In our Consolidated Statements of Operations, utility  reimbursements are included in Rental and other property revenues , in accordance with GAAP;\n- \u00b7 excluding  the  results  of  four  apartment  communities  with  an  aggregate  142  apartment  homes  that  we  neither  manage  nor  consolidate,  our investment in IQHQ and the Mezzanine Investment; and\n- \u00b7 excluding property management costs and casualty gains or losses, reported in consolidated amounts, in our assessment of segment performance.\n\nPlease refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses.\n\n## Proportionate Property Net Operating Income\n\nThe results of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as presented below, are based on segment classifications as of December 31, 2022.\n\n|                                                                    | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |            |           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-----------|\n| (in thousands)                                                     | 2022                      | 2021                      | $          |           |\n| Rental and other property revenues, before utility reimbursements: |                           |                           |            |           |\n| Development and Redevelopment                                      | $ 919                     | $ 2,036                   | $ (1,117 ) | (54.9 %)  |\n| Operating                                                          | 135,224                   | 122,303                   | 12,921     | 10.6 %    |\n| Other                                                              | 18,030                    | 14,559                    | 3,471      | 23.8 %    |\n| Total                                                              | 154,173                   | 138,898                   | 15,275     | 11.0 %    |\n| Property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements:        |                           |                           |            |           |\n| Development and Redevelopment                                      | 2,198                     | 1,446                     | 752        | 52.0 %    |\n| Operating                                                          | 40,841                    | 39,625                    | 1,216      | 3.1 %     |\n| Other                                                              | 5,560                     | 4,405                     | 1,155      | 26.2 %    |\n| Total                                                              | 48,599                    | 45,476                    | 3,123      | 6.9 %     |\n| Proportionate property net operating income:                       |                           |                           |            |           |\n| Development and Redevelopment                                      | (1,279 )                  | 590                       | (1,869 )   | (100.0 %) |\n| Operating                                                          | 94,383                    | 82,678                    | 11,705     | 14.2 %    |\n| Other                                                              | 12,470                    | 10,154                    | 2,316      | 22.8 %    |\n| Total                                                              | $ 105,574                 | $ 93,422                  | $ 12,152   | 13.0 %    |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Development and Redevelopment proportionate net operating income decreased by $1.9 million due primarily to a reduction at The Hamilton, due to its de-leasing in late 2021 for redevelopment.\n- \u00b7 Operating proportionate property net operating income increased by $11.7 million, or 14.2%. The increase was attributable primarily to a $12.9 million, or 10.6% increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues of $211 per apartment home, partially offset by a 60-basis point decrease in occupancy.\n- \u00b7 Other proportionate property net operating income increased by $2.3 million, or 22.8% primarily due to owning Eldridge Townhomes for all of 2022.",

The increase was attributable to a $5.4 million, or 4.6% increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues of $47 per apartment home, and a 160-basis point increase in occupancy, offset partially by a $1.7 million, or 4.5% increase in property operating expenses due primarily to higher real estate taxes and insurance.\n\nOther proportionate property net operating income increased by $1.2 million, or 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, due primarily to the acquisition of Eldridge Townhomes in the third quarter of 2021.\n\n## Non-Segment Real Estate Operations\n\nOperating income amounts not attributed to our segments include property management costs, casualty losses, and, if applicable, the results of apartment communities sold or held for sale, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $74.3 million, or 87.7%, due primarily to $85.7 million of accelerated depreciation recognized relating to the 2022 lease termination as described in Note 4 .\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, General and administrative expenses increased by $6.5 million, or 19.7%. General and administrative expenses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2021 were prior to the full build out of our platform. General and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 included $6.5 million of expenses for consulting services with respect to strategic growth, direction and advice per the Separation Agreement with AIR. This agreement concluded at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, interest expense increased by $20.9 million, or 39.6% due primarily due to $27.9 million of spread maintenance costs related to prepayment of the Notes Payable to AIR and other debt, the refinancing of certain property debt, and the payoff of a construction loan, partially offset by reduced interest expense on the Notes Payable to AIR due to the early payoff.",

        "page_content": "## Mezzanine Investment Income (Loss), Net\n\nIn November 2019, Aimco Predecessor made a five-year, $275.0 million mezzanine loan to the partnership owning the \"Parkmerced Apartments\" located in southwest  San  Francisco  (the  \"Mezzanine  Investment\").  The  loan  bears  interest  at  a  10%  annual  rate,  accruing  if  not  paid  from  property  operations.  As discussed in Note 2, ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the mezzanine loan was retained by AIR following the Separation. The Separation Agreement provides for AIR to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the mezzanine loan, once required third-party consents to transfer are received. Until legal title of the subsidiaries is transferred, AIR is obligated to pass payments on the mezzanine loan to us.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the Mezzanine Investment to $158.6 million. The non-cash impairment is reflected in Mezzanine investment income (loss), net , in our Consolidated Statements of Operations , and as a reduction in Mezzanine investment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets .\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $30.4 million of income in connection with the mezzanine loan.\n\n## Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Options\n\nWe are required to adjust our interest rate options to fair value on a quarterly basis. As a result of the mark-to-market adjustments, we recorded unrealized gains of $36.9 million and $6.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. In addition, we realized gains of $11.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments\n\nIn June 2022, 22% of our original investment in IQHQ was redeemed for $16.5 million and we recognized a realized gain of $5.7 million. Our remaining investment in IQHQ with a cost basis of $39.2 million was valued at an estimated fair market value of $59.7 million, and we recognized a $20.5 million unrealized gain at the same per share value as the cash redemption. We measure our investments in property technology funds at NAV as a practical expedient. As a result of changes in NAV, we recorded unrealized losses of $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to unrealized gains of $6.6 million for the same period in 2021.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold three stabilized multifamily properties and one land parcel for gross proceeds of $267.3 million and recognized $175.9 million of gain on dispositions of real estate.\n\n## Lease Modification Income\n\nIn  June  2022,  we  as  lessee  and AIR  as  lessor,  entered  into  a  lease  termination  agreement  pursuant  to  which AIR  paid  us  a  termination  payment  on September 1, 2022. Upon receipt of this payment, the leases with respect to four properties were terminated, and we relinquished control of the associated leasehold improvements and underlying land of these four properties. The total lease modification income recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $207.0 million.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net , includes costs associated with our risk management activities, partnership administration expenses, fee income, and certain non-recurring items. For the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, Other income (expense), net decreased by $16.6 million due primarily to one-time fee revenue earned in 2021 as well as advisory expenses related to a strategic business review and the annual shareholder meeting in 2022 .\n\n## Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\n\nCertain  aspects  of  our  operations,  including  our  development  and  redevelopment  activities,  are  conducted  through  taxable  REIT  subsidiaries,  or  TRS entities. Additionally, our TRS entities hold investments in one of our apartment communities and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive.\n\nOur income tax benefit calculated in accordance with GAAP includes income taxes associated with the income or loss of our TRS entities. Income taxes, as well as changes in valuation allowance and incremental deferred tax items in conjunction with intercompany asset transfers and internal restructurings (if applicable), are included in Income tax benefit (expense) in our C onsolidated Statements of Operations.",

        "page_content": "Consolidated GAAP income or loss subject to tax consists of pretax income or loss of our taxable entities and gains retained by the REIT. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income subject to tax of $88.8 million, compared to net losses subject to tax of $31.4 million for the same period in 2021.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $17.3 million, compared to income tax benefit of $13.6 million for the same period in 2021. The year-to-year change is due primarily to GAAP income taxes associated with the net lease modification income recognized in 2022.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our loan agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our available liquidity was $379.8 million, which consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 $206.5 million in cash and cash equivalents;\n- \u00b7 $23.3 million of restricted cash, including amounts related to tenant security deposits and escrows held by lenders for capital additions, property taxes, and insurance; and\n- \u00b7 $150.0 million of available capacity to borrow under our revolving secured credit facility.\n\nWe have commitments for approximately $155.8 million and remaining planned spend of $278.7 million on development and redevelopment projects, with $304.6 million undrawn on our construction loans as of December 31, 2022. The initial allocation to our Edgewater joint venture and Strathmore joint ventures  have  remaining  unfunded  commitments  of  $10.3  million.  We  also  have  unfunded  commitments  in  the  amount  of  $2.4  million  related  to  four investments in entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of  principal  and  interest  on  outstanding  debt,  capital  expenditures,  and  future  investments. Additionally,  our  third-party  property  managers  may  enter  into commitments on our behalf  to  purchase  goods  or  services  in  connection  with  the  operation  of  our  apartment  communities  and  our  office  building.  Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to historical levels.\n\nWe believe, based on the information available at this time, that we have sufficient cash on hand and access to additional sources of liquidity to meet our operational needs for the next twelve months.\n\nIn the event that our cash and cash equivalents, revolving secured credit facility, and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our liquidity needs, we have the means to generate additional liquidity, such as from additional property financing activity and proceeds from apartment community sales.  We  expect  to  meet  our  long-term  liquidity  requirements,  including  debt  maturities,  development  and  redevelopment  spending,  and  future  investment activity, primarily through property financing activity, cash generated from operations, and the recycling of our equity. Our revolving secured credit facility matures in December 2023, prior to consideration of its two one-year extension options.\n\n## Leverage and Capital Resources\n\nThe availability and cost of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We have taken steps to mitigate a portion of our short-term refunding risk. However, if property or development financing options become unavailable, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in capital spending or apartment community dispositions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 83% of our outstanding non-recourse property debt had a fixed interest rate and  approximately 17% had a variable interest rate. In addition, the weighted-average rate on our non-recourse property debt was 5.2%, and the average remaining term to maturity was 7.1 years. At December 31, 2022, substantially all of our outstanding non-recourse property debt was either fixed or hedged. Our use of interest rate caps may vary from quarter to quarter depending on lender requirements, recycling of interest rate caps between projects, and our view on forecasted interest rates.\n\nWhile our primary source of leverage is property-level debt, we also have a secured $150.0 million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions, and construction loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving secured credit facility. Under our revolving secured credit facility, we have agreed to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, minimum tangible net worth of $625.0 million, and maximum leverage of 60% as defined in the credit",

        "page_content": "agreement. We are currently in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants during the next twelve months.\n\nChanges in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n\nThe following discussion relates to changes in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this report.\n\n## Operating Activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $204.2 million. Our operating cash flow is primarily affected by rental rates,  occupancy  levels  and  operating  expenses  related  to  our  portfolio  of  apartment  communities,  and  general  and  administrative  costs.  Cash  provided  by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by $191.6 million compared to the same period in 2021, due primarily to cash received from development property lease terminations in 2022.\n\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased by $35.3 million compared to 2020, due to higher operating and general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities of $120.8 million consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $237.5 million and $129.2 million of cash used to acquire undeveloped land parcels, offset by $260.0 million of proceeds received from the disposition of real estate. Cash used in investing  activities  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,    decreased  by  $150.7  million  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2021,  due  primarily  to  proceeds received from the disposition of real estate offset by increased capital expenditures and acquisitions.\n\nCapital additions totaled $237.5 million and $177.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022. and 2021, respectively, and were primarily used for construction costs on our development and redevelopment properties.\n\nWe exclude the amounts of capital spending related to commercial spaces and to apartment communities sold or classified as held for sale at the end of the period from the foregoing measures. We have also excluded from these measures indirect capitalized costs, which are not yet allocated to communities with capital additions, and their related capital spending categories.\n\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased by $142.1 million compared to 2020, due primarily to capital expenditures and cash used in the purchase of The Benson Hotel, the Eldridge Townhomes, and construction costs on our development properties.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in financing activities of $98.3 million consisted primarily of the $534.1 million payoff of the Notes Payable to AIR, $302.4 million to retire property debt and the $138.4 million paydown of construction loans, offset by $756.2 million in cash raised from the issuance of new property debt, $93.2 million in cash draws received from construction loans, and a $102.0 million redeemable noncontrolling interest preferred equity contribution from an institutional partner. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by financing activities of $204.7 million consisted primarily of $165.2 million of proceeds received from construction loans undertaken and $59.8 million of proceeds received from non-recourse property debt issuances.\n\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased by $165.4 million compared to 2020, due primarily to the nonrecurring $420.9 million investment received from Aimco Predecessor in connection with the Separation.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nWe use EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance. These key financial indicators are non-GAAP measures and are defined and described below. We provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP.",

        "page_content": "Earnings Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate ('EBITDAre')\n\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP measures, which we believe are useful to investors, creditors, and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of our ability to incur and service debt because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and allow for comparison of our credit strength to different companies. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of liquidity. There can be no assurance that our method of calculating EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Nareit defines EBITDAre as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, further adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 gains and losses on the dispositions of depreciated property;\n- \u00b7 impairment write-downs of depreciated property;\n- \u00b7 impairment write-downs of investments in unconsolidated partnerships caused by a decrease in the value of the depreciated property in such partnerships; and\n- \u00b7 adjustments to reflect our share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities.\n\nEBITDAre is defined by Nareit and provides for an additional performance measure independent of capital structure for greater comparability between real estate investment trusts. We define Adjusted EBITDAre as EBITDAre adjusted to exclude the effect of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests, and unrealized gain on interest rate options, which we believe allow investors to compare a measure of our earnings before the effects of our capital structure and indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry. Additionally, we exclude interest income recognized on our Mezzanine Investment that was accrued but not paid.\n\nThe  reconciliation  of  net  (loss)  income  to  EBITDAre  and  Adjusted  EBITDAre  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022  and  2021  is  as  follows  (in thousands):\n\n|                                                                                                                   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                   | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Net income (loss)                                                                                                 | $ 92,158                  | $ (4,980 )                |\n| Adjustments:                                                                                                      |                           |                           |\n| Interest expense                                                                                                  | 73,842                    | 52,902                    |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense                                                                                      | 17,264                    | (13,570 )                 |\n| Gains on dispositions of real estate                                                                              | (175,863 )                | -                         |\n| Lease modification income                                                                                         | (206,963 )                | -                         |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                                                                     | 158,967                   | 84,712                    |\n| Impairment                                                                                                        | -                         | -                         |\n| Adjustment related to EBITDAre of unconsolidated partnerships                                                     | 1,004                     | 836                       |\n| EBITDAre                                                                                                          | $ (39,591 )               | $ 119,900                 |\n| Net (income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling    interests in consolidated real estate partnerships | (8,829 )                  | (91 )                     |\n| Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests    in consolidated real estate partnerships            | (3,672 )                  | (1,136 )                  |\n| EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests                                                     | (491 )                    | (320 )                    |\n| Mezzanine investment (income) loss, net                                                                           | 179,239                   | (30,436 )                 |\n| Realized and unrealized (gains) losses on interest rate options                                                   | (48,205 )                 | (6,509 )                  |\n| Unrealized (gains) losses on IQHQ investment                                                                      | (20,501 )                 | -                         |\n| Adjusted EBITDAre                                                                                                 | $ 57,950                  | $ 81,408                  |\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Capitalized Costs\n\nWe capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including developments, redevelopments, other tangible apartment community improvements, and replacements of existing community",

        "page_content": "components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by employees in connection with the planning, execution, and control of all capital addition activities at our communities. We characterize as 'indirect costs' an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital addition activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes, and insurance during periods in which redevelopments are in progress. We commence capitalization of costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital addition activities,  at  the  point  in  time  when  activities  necessary  to  get  communities,  apartment  homes,  or  leased  spaces  ready  for  their  intended  use  begin.  These activities include when communities, apartment homes, or leased spaces are undergoing physical construction, as well as when homes or leased spaces are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting, planning, and design are in progress. We cease the capitalization of costs when the communities or components thereof are substantially complete and ready for their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and homes or leased spaces are available for occupancy. We charge costs including ordinary repairs, maintenance, and resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nReal estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a sublease of office space within our corporate offices to AIR at then-current market rents. Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows per the terms of the sublease arrangement, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with the subleased space, including, the right-of-use asset, tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment and concluded the subleased assets were impaired as of December 31, 2020. We recorded an impairment charge of $11.0 million in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a software license agreement with AIR to provide for the use of certain internally developed software at then-current market rates. Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relative to the carrying value of the internally developed software, we concluded  the  assets  were  impaired. Additionally,  following  an  evaluation  of  the  future  service  potential  of  certain  other  internal  software  that  was  under development,  we  ceased  development  and  impaired  the  associated  carrying  value.  We  recorded  an  aggregate  impairment  charge  of  $4.9  million  in  our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nUpon the acquisition  of  real  estate,  we  determine  whether  the  purchase  qualifies  as  an  asset  acquisition  or,  less  frequently,  meets  the  definition  of  an acquisition  of  a  business.  We  generally  recognize  the  acquisition  of  apartment  communities  or  interests  in  partnerships  that  own  communities  at  our  cost, including the related transaction costs, as asset acquisitions.\n\nWe allocate the cost of apartment communities acquired based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using valuation techniques that rely on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs within the fair value framework. We determine the fair value of tangible assets, such as land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment using valuation techniques that consider comparable market transactions, replacement costs and other available information. We determine the fair value of identified intangible assets or liabilities, which typically relate to in-place leases, using valuation techniques that consider the terms of the in-place leases, current market data for comparable leases and our experience in leasing similar communities.\n\nThe intangible assets or liabilities related to in-place leases are comprised of: (a) the value of the above- and below-market leases in-place, measured over the period, including probable lease renewals for below-market leases, that the leases are expected to remain in effect; (b) the estimated unamortized portion of avoided  leasing  commissions  and  other  costs  that ordinarily  would  be  incurred  to  originate  the  in-place  leases;  and  (c)  the  value  associated  with  leased apartment homes during an estimated absorption period, which estimates rental revenue that would not have been earned had leased apartment homes been vacant at the time of acquisition, assuming lease-up periods based on market demand and stabilized occupancy levels. The above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to rental revenue over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases, which",

        "page_content": "include reasonably assured renewal periods. Other intangible assets related to in-place leases are amortized to depreciation and amortization over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment\n\nPre-Separation, the Mezzanine Investment in the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments and related swaption were accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and a derivative, respectively. Post-Separation, the legal title to the loan investment and swaption remained with AIR, while we obtained the right to all of the economics.\n\nOn  a  periodic  basis,  we  evaluate  our  Mezzanine  Investment  for  impairment.  We  assess  whether  there  are  any  indicators  that  imply  the  value  of  our investment may be impaired. These include assessments of both the underlying property performance and general market conditions in place. An investment is considered  impaired  if  we  determine  that  its  fair  value  is  less  than  the  net  carrying  value  of  the  investment  on  an  other-than-temporary  basis.  Cash  flow projections for the investment consider property level factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, such as changes in the macroeconomic environment that can lead to increases in capitalization rates and discount rates. We consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include the loan's maturity date, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, and the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity.\n\nAs a result of our analysis, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the Mezzanine Investment to $158.6 million at December 31, 2022. The impairment loss is reflected in Mezzanine investment income (loss), net ,  in  our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, and as a reduction in Mezzanine investment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022. No impairment losses were recognized for the mezzanine investment during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nPrior to recording the non-cash impairment charge, we recognized as income the net amounts earned on the mezzanine loan by AIR on its equity investment that are due to be paid to us when collected to the extent the income was supported by the change in AIR's claim to the net assets of the underlying borrower. The income recognized primarily represents the interest accrued under the terms of the underlying mezzanine loan.\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur chief market risks are refunding risk, that is the availability of property debt or other cash sources to refund maturing property debt, and repricing risk, that  is  the  possibility  of  increases  in  base  interest  rates  and  credit  risk  spreads.  We  use  long-dated,  fixed-rate,  non-recourse  property  debt  on  stabilized properties.\n\nIn order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short-term borrowings. We use working capital primarily to fund short-term uses. We make limited use of derivative financial instruments and we do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, on a consolidated basis, we had $164.2 million of variable-rate property-level debt outstanding  and $113.4 million of variable rate construction loans. The impact of rising interest rates is mitigated by our use of interest rate caps, which as of December 31, 2022, provided protection for our variable interest rate debt. Our use of interest rate caps may vary from quarter to quarter depending on lender requirements, recycling of interest rate caps between projects, and our view on forecasted interest rates. We estimate that an increase in our variable rate indices of 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads, would increase interest expense by $0.5 million on an annual basis. We estimate that a decrease in our variable rate indices of 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads, would reduce interest expense by $1.0 million on an annual basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we held interest rate swaps and caps with $2.0 billion notional value. These instruments were acquired for $17.7 million and at year end were valued at $62.3 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $229.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, a portion of which bears interest at variable rates.\n\n## ITEM 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Aimco\n\n## Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  our  management  and directors; and\n- \u00b7 provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  or  disposition  of  assets  that  could  have  a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.

In our opinion, Apartment Investment and Management Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## /s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nDenver, Colorado February 27, 2023",

Only independent directors serve on the Audit, Compensation and Human Resources, and Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Independent Chairman of the Board.  The Company's Chairman of the Board is an independent director.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Separation of Chairman and CEO.  The Company has separated the roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Board Refreshment.  The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee has structured the Board such that there are directors of varying tenures and perspectives, with new  directors joining the Board every few years, while retaining the institutional memory of longer-tenured directors. In connection with the Separation, six directors left the Board and the Company added  seven new directors. |\n| Regular Access to and Involvement with Management.  In addition to regular access to management during Board and committee meetings, the independent directors have ongoing, direct access to  members of management and to the Aimco business. This includes the Audit Committee chairman's active and regular engagement with accounting staff and the Aimco auditors, the Compensation and                            |\n| Human Resources Committee chairman's continuing involvement with compensation and personnel matters, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee chairman's  participation in director recruitment and other governance matters, and Mr. Stone's frequent involvement with Mr. Powell with respect to strategy, agenda setting, board materials, and policy matters.                                 |\n| Engaged Board.  In addition to regular access to management, the non-management directors meet at least quarterly and receive written updates from the CEO regularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Stockholder Engagement.  Under the direction of the Board and including participation by Board members when requested by stockholders, Aimco systematically and at least annually canvasses its  largest stockholders, those holding approximately two-thirds of outstanding Aimco shares, concerning compensation, governance, and other ESG matters.                                                                   |\n| Director Stock Ownership.  By the completion of five years of service from the time of the Separation or from joining the Board, a non-management director is expected to own equity having a value  of at least five times the annual cash retainer for independent directors.                                                                                                                                          |",

        "page_content": "## What Aimco Does\n\nRisk Assessment. The Board conducts an annual risk assessment. Areas involving risk that are reported on by management and considered by the Board, include: operations, liquidity, leverage, finance, financial statements, the financial reporting process, accounting, legal matters, regulatory compliance, information technology and data protection, sustainability, environmental, social, and governance ('ESG'), compensation, and human resources and human capital. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee is responsible for succession planning in all leadership positions, both in the short term and the long term, with particular focus on CEO succession in the short term and the long term.\n\nMajority Voting with a Resignation Policy. In an uncontested election, Aimco requires its directors to be elected by a majority of the votes cast. Directors failing to get a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election are expected to tender their resignation.\n\nProxy Access. A stockholder or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of our shares for three years, may submit nominees for up to 20% of the Board, or two nominees, whichever is greater, for inclusion in our proxy materials, subject to complying with the requirements contained in our bylaws.\n\n## What Aimco Does Not Do\n\nUnapproved Related Party Transactions. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee oversees a related party transactions policy requiring review and approval of such transactions to help ensure that Aimco's decisions are based on considerations only in the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders.\n\nPledging or hedging shares held to satisfy stock ownership requirements. The Company's insider trading policy places restrictions on the Company's directors, executive officers, and all other employees entering into hedging transactions with respect to the Company's securities (such as, but not limited to, zero-cost collars, equity swaps, and forward sale contracts) and from holding the Company's securities in margin accounts or otherwise pledging such securities as collateral for loans. Pledging or hedging transactions are permitted only in very limited circumstances, and only with respect to shares held in excess of stock ownership requirements. Hedging transactions may not be entered into with regard to Aimco securities that are subject to a risk of forfeiture (e.g., restricted stock awards) and Aimco directors, executive officers, other officers, and certain other employees must receive preclearance from Aimco's legal department before engaging in any hedging transactions. No directors or executive officers have in place any hedging or pledging transactions.\n\nInterlocking Directorships. No member of Aimco management serves on a board or a compensation committee of a company at which an Aimco director is also an employee.\n\nDirector Overboarding. Aimco's corporate governance guidelines and committee charters limit the number of other boards and the number of other audit committees on which an Aimco director may serve. Typically, an Aimco director is limited to service on four or fewer boards (including the Company's) and is limited to service on three or fewer audit committees, including the Company's.\n\nRetirement Age or Term Limits. Rather than impose arbitrary limits on service, the Company regularly (and at least annually) reviews each director's continued role on the Board and considers the need for periodic board refreshment.\n\n## CODE OF ETHICS\n\nThe Board has adopted a code of ethics entitled 'Code of Business Conduct and Ethics' that applies to the members of the Board, all of Aimco's executive officers and all teammates of Aimco or its subsidiaries, including Aimco's principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com) and is also available in print to stockholders, upon written request to Aimco's Corporate Secretary. If, in the future, Aimco amends, modifies, or waives a provision in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, rather than filing a Current Report on Form 8-K, Aimco intends to satisfy any applicable disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K by posting such information on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com), as necessary.",

In 2021 and 2022, we engaged with stockholders representing more than 80% of our outstanding shares on a broad range of topics, including executive compensation. The Company continued to receive broad support from stockholders on its executive compensation program, including the program's structure, the program's alignment with pay and performance, the quantum of compensation delivered under the program, and the level of disclosure.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF AIMCO'S PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY\n\nAimco is a pay-for-performance organization. Aimco starts by setting target total compensation near the median of target total compensation for Aimco's peers as identified below, both as a measure of fairness and also to provide an economic incentive to remain with Aimco. Actual compensation varies from target compensation based on Aimco's results. Each officer's annual cash incentive compensation, 'short term incentive' or STI, is based in part on Aimco's performance against corporate, rather than personal, goals. The more senior the officer, the greater the percentage of his or her STI that is based on Aimco's performance against its corporate goals. Aimco's longer term compensation, 'long term incentive' or LTI, follows a similar tiered structure. Each officer's LTI is based in part on relative 'total stockholder return' or TSR, with NEOs having a greater share of their LTI based on relative TSR. In the case of Mr. Powell, his entire LTI award is 'at risk' based on Aimco's relative TSR. LTI is measured and vests over time, so that officers bear longer term exposure to the decisions they make.",

        "page_content": "## CEO Pay Overview\n\nThe Committee determines the compensation for the CEO. In setting Mr. Powell's target total compensation for 2022, the Committee considered, among other things, the peer group compensation data as discussed below and Mr. Powell's relevant expertise and experience. Because Mr. Powell was relatively new to his position, having been promoted to CEO in December 2020, the Committee set his target total compensation at approximately 72% of the median for the peer group. The Committee devised a compensation plan for Mr. Powell that resulted in approximately 24% base salary, 29% based on Aimco's performance against its 2022 corporate goals, and 47% based on relative TSR. Mr. Powell's target compensation mix is illustrated as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to reviewing the performance of, and determining the compensation for, the CEO, the Committee also reviews and approves the decisions made by the CEO as to the compensation of Aimco's other executive officers. Base salary, target STI, and target LTI are generally set near the median base salary, target STI, and target LTI for peer comparators.\n\n## How peer comparators are identified\n\nThe Committee, with the advice of its independent executive compensation consultant, developed a peer group for purposes of benchmarking NEO compensation based on industry and business strategy. The peer group ranged from 0.5x to 2.5x Aimco's total capitalization, with Aimco at the 41st percentile, and with Aimco at the 51st and 60th percentile based on total and gross depreciable assets, respectively. Based on this analysis, Aimco included as 'peers' for 2022 target compensation the following 12 real estate companies:\n\n|                                        | Peer Group                                           |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc.        | Independence Realty Trust, Inc.                      |\n| Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. | JBG SMITH Properties                                 |\n| Centerspace                            | Mack-Cali Realty Corp.

Aimco's compensation programs align management incentives with the long-term interests of the Company.",

The compensation of executive officers and other teammates is not overly weighted toward STI. Moreover, STI is capped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Use of LTI.  LTI is included in target total compensation and typically vests over a period of three to four years. The vesting period encourages officers to focus on sustaining Aimco's long-term  performance. Executive officers with more responsibility for strategic and operating decisions have a greater percentage of their target total compensation allocated to LTI. LTI is capped at two times  target, or 200%, for the CEO, and 1.67 times target, or 167%, for the other NEOs.                   |\n| Stock ownership guidelines and required holding periods after vesting.  Aimco's stock ownership guidelines require all executive officers to hold a specified amount of Aimco equity. Any  executive officer who has not yet satisfied the stock ownership requirements for his or her position must retain LTI after its vesting until stock ownership requirements are met. These policies ensure  each executive officer has a substantial amount of personal wealth tied to long-term holdings in Aimco stock. |\n| Shared performance metrics across the organization.  A portion of STI for the NEOs is based upon Aimco's performance against its corporate goals, which are reviewed and approved by the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Committee. One hundred percent of Mr. Powell's STI, and 50% of the STI for the other NEOs, is based upon Aimco's performance against its corporate goals. In addition, having shared performance  metrics across the organization reinforces Aimco's focus on a collegial and collaborative team environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Multiple performance metrics.  Aimco had five corporate goals for 2022. In addition, through Aimco's performance management program, Managing Aimco Performance, or MAP, which sets and  monitors performance objectives for every team member, each team member had several different individual performance goals that are set at the beginning of the year and approved by management.                                                                                                                          |\n| Mses. Stanfield and Johnson had an average of six individual goals for 2022. Having multiple performance metrics inherently reduces excessive or unnecessary risk-taking, as incentive compensation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n\n## TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR 2022\n\nFor 2022, total compensation is the sum of base compensation earned in 2022, STI earned in 2022, and LTI awards granted in 2022.\n\n## Base Compensation for 2022\n\nFor 2022, Mr. Powell's base compensation was $550,000, approximately 76% of the median for CEOs in Aimco's peer group. For 2022, Ms. Stanfield's base compensation was $450,000 and base compensation for Ms. Johnson was set at $395,000.\n\n## Short-Term Incentive Compensation for 2022\n\nThe Committee determined Mr. Powell's STI by the extent to which Aimco met five designated corporate goals, which are described below and are referred to as Aimco's Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs.\n\nFor the other NEOs, calculation of STI was determined by two components: Aimco's performance against the KPI; and each officer's achievement of her individual MAP goals. For example, if an executive's target STI was $400,000 and weighted 50% on KPIs, then 50% of that amount, or $200,000, varied based on KPI results and 50% of that amount, or $200,000, varied based on MAP results. As actual KPI results were 162.00% of target in 2022, then the executive would receive 162.00% of $200,000 ($324,000) for the KPI portion of her STI, and if MAP results were 100%, such hypothetical executive would receive 100% of the $200,000, for a total STI payment of $524,000.",

The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objective to achieve rent growth for its stabilized portfolio based on high levels of resident retention, through superior customer selection and satisfaction, coupled with disciplined innovation resulting in sustained cost control, to maximize NOI margins, and to monetize investments when the time is right, maximizing proceeds and Aimco's internal rate of return (\"IRR\") on investments. For 2022, the range for the stabilized portfolio NOI portion of the goal was as follows: 'Threshold' equated to achievement of five percent unfavorable to 2022 budgeted NOI; 'Target' equated to achievement of 2022 budgeted NOI; and 'Maximum' equated to five percent favorable to 2022 budgeted NOI. For the dispositions and monetization of investments portion of the goal, target performance equated to cancellation of Aimco's leasehold interest in Prism in Cambridge, MA, and 707 Leahy in Redwood City, CA. Stabilized property NOI, which was up 14.2% from 2021, was more than 5% above budgeted NOI, achieving the maximum level of performance for this portion of the goal. Following the successful development and lease-up of 707 Leahy in Redwood City, CA, Prism in Cambridge, MA, Flamingo Point North Tower in Miami Beach, FL, and The Fremont on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, CO, Aimco and AIR canceled Aimco's leasehold interest in each property on September 1, 2022. In return for the termination of the leases, Aimco received proceeds of $200M, resulting in value creation, net of costs, of approximately $100M, which was realized approximately 18 months earlier than anticipated. Aimco also exited the Seattle market, closing on the sales of two apartment communities for a total of $122M, and sold Pathfinder Village in Fremont, CA, for $127M. Aimco's joint venture in Fort Lauderdale, FL (described below in \"Capital Deployment and Allocation\") monetized a portion of its investment by closing on the sale of one of three parcels it acquired in early 2022 for development along Broward Avenue. The 0.8 acre parcel was sold for $18.3M, approximately double the",

With regard to Aimco's alternative investments, Aimco redeemed 22% of its passive equity investment in IQHQ, receiving proceeds of $16.5M from the sale, a greater than 50% IRR over the hold period for this portion of our investment. This resulted in a payout on the Portfolio Management goal of 20.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nDevelopment and Redevelopment Execution (30% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Company's strategic objective of executing active development, redevelopment, and lease-up projects pursuant to the Company's 2022 budget and plan. Large and/or complex projects provided increased weighting toward the total goal weighting of 30%, with smaller scale projects provided lower weighting toward the total goal weighting. Achievement for each project was determined with reference to the 2022 budgeted investment and plan for the project, and was based on the extent to which the project work was completed on time and within budget, as well as, where applicable, the extent to which year-end occupancy and rental rates were consistent with the 2022 budget and plan. In 2022, Aimco's development and redevelopment projects were on track as measured by budget and lease-up metrics. Aimco completed construction and/or lease up of 707 Leahy in Redwood City, CA, Prism in Cambridge, MA, Flamingo Point North Tower in Miami Beach, FL, and The Fremont on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, CO. Aimco and its joint venture partner began construction on a 220-apartment home development at Strathmore Square in Bethesda, MD, discussed further below. This resulted in a payout on this goal of 34.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nCapital Deployment and Allocation (30% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objective of effectively deploying capital into its existing pipeline of previously identified and/or controlled investment opportunities and into newly identified value-add opportunities. In 2022, Aimco invested $279.4M in its active development and redevelopment projects.  Additionally, Aimco deployed capital into several newly identified value-add opportunities, significantly expanding Aimco's potential development pipeline. Aimco formed a joint venture for the construction of approximately 1M square feet of mixed-use development in the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami, FL. Aimco has a 20% share of the joint venture, which includes the initial contribution of an eighth of an acre of land that Aimco purchased for $1.7M in January 2022. The development site is situated as the gateway to Aimco's Edgewater land assemblage and its redevelopment of The Hamilton. Aimco will serve as the development manager for the venture and expects to begin construction in 2023. Aimco executed a joint venture agreement to act as a co-GP on the development of a phased multifamily community at Strathmore Square in Bethesda, MD. The project is fully entitled and includes approvals for over 2,200 units in six phases. Aimco will participate in the first two multifamily phases totaling 574 units. Aimco has rights to increase our investment and to choose to participate in future phases of development. Aimco and its joint venture partner began construction on the first phase of development in late 2022. Aimco closed on the purchase of three development parcels for $100M in the rapidly growing Flagler Village neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale, FL. The nine-acre assemblage allows for approximately 3M square feet of phased, mixed-use development, which could contain up to 1,500 residential units, more than 300 hotel keys, and more than 100,000 square of retail space at full build-out. As set forth above, the joint venture monetized a portion of its investment by closing on the sale of the 0.8 acre parcel for approximately double the original purchase price per acre. Aimco closed on a $1.8M purchase of a land option it controlled for multifamily development on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, CO. Aimco has begun planning for the next multifamily development on the site, which slated to include approximately 275 apartment homes. This resulted in a payout on this goal of 50.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nBalance Sheet (20% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objectives of executing its debt and equity financing plans and maintaining abundant liquidity. In 2022, Aimco retired or refinanced more than $1B of near-term liabilities, improving our balance sheet, which is now comprised of primarily fixed-rate loans on stabilized properties with an average term to maturity of 8.2 years. Aimco's construction loans are primarily floating rate with in-place hedges that protect against rising interest rates. In July 2022, Aimco completed the early repayment of $534M of notes due to AIR, originally scheduled to mature in January 2024. Aimco entered into a strategic partnership with Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation to provide Limited Partner equity capital for up to $1B of Aimco-led multifamily development projects. At December 31, 2022, Aimco had access to $379.8M, including $206.5M of cash on hand, $23.3M of restricted cash, and the capacity to borrow up to $150M on its revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, 98% of Aimco's total debt was either fixed rate or hedged with interest rate cap protection. Aimco's interest hedging instruments, purchased to provide protection against increases in interest rates, were valued at $62.3M versus a cost basis of $18M. This resulted in a payout on the balance sheet goal of 40.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nHuman Capital & Environmental, Social, and Governance (10% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Aimco's strategic objective of fostering a healthy environment of respect and innovation, empowering our human capital to create value, and furthering our broader commitment to corporate responsibility. In 2022, Aimco retained 100% of its officer team and reduced overall voluntary turnover by more than half year-over-year (from 31% voluntary turnover in 2021 to 14% in 2022). Every teammate is surveyed via a third-party, confidential survey performed on an annual basis. The team engagement score consists of the average of the responses to the questions that comprise the engagement index, on a scale of 1 to 5, for all teammates who complete the survey during the year. Team engagement for 2022 was 4.52 (up from 4.21 in 2021), a new",

Aimco was recognized as a 'Healthiest Employer' by the Denver Business Journal, the South Florida Business Journal, and Healthiest Employers of Greater Washington, D.C., and certified as a 'Great Place to Work.' In 2022 Aimco refreshed its ESG policies, adopted a new human rights policy, performed first-time climate risk assessments for its portfolio, and began reporting to the TCFD. This resulted in a payout on the ESG goal of 18.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nDue to Aimco's overall achievement on each of its 2022 goals, Aimco's overall KPI performance was 162%. Accordingly, each NEO was awarded 162% of the portion of his or her target STI attributable to KPI.\n\nVarious of the key financial indicators we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are non-GAAP measures. Key non-GAAP measures we use are defined, described and, where appropriate, reconciled to the most comparable financial measures computed in accordance with GAAP under the Non-GAAP Measures heading within Part II, Item 7 of this filing.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards for 2022\n\nUnder the 2022 LTI program for executive officers, four forms of LTI awards were granted to NEOs on February 2, 2022, as follows: (1) performance-based restricted stock, which was granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, representing 50% of the 2022 LTI awards for Mr. Powell and approximately 54% of the respective 2022 LTI awards for Mses. Stanfield and Johnson; (2) performance-based stock options, which were granted to both Mr. Powell, representing 50% of his 2022 LTI awards, and to Ms. Johnson, representing approximately 13% of her 2022 LTI awards; (3) performance-based LTIP Units, which were granted to Ms. Stanfield, representing approximately 13% of her 2022 LTI awards; and (4) time-based restricted stock, which was granted to Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, representing one-third of their respective 2022 LTI awards, with one-third of the awards vesting on each anniversary of the grant date. Aimco refers to the performance-based restricted stock, performance-based stock options, and performance-based LTIP Units as 'performance-based LTI awards' because the amount of restricted stock, stock options, and LTIP Units that vest, if any, is determined based on Aimco's relative TSR performance during a forward looking, three-year performance period, as described in detail below.\n\nThe Committee typically sets grant dates for LTI awards at the time of its final compensation determination, generally in late January or early February.\n\n## 2022 CEO LTI EQUITY MIX\n\n## 2022 OTHER NEOs LTI EQUITY MIX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Stanfield and Johnson, the performance-based stock options granted to Mr. Powell and Ms. Johnson, and the performance-based LTIP Units granted to Ms. Stanfield. The Committee set threshold performance to pay out at 50%; target performance to pay out at 100%; and maximum performance to pay out at 200%. Performance below threshold will result in no payout. If performance is between threshold and target or between target and maximum, the amount of the payout will be interpolated. Performance-based LTI awards vest 100% following the end of the three-year performance period (based on attainment of TSR targets), for a three-year plan from start to finish, illustrated below, subject to the grantee's continued service to Aimco, and subject to a delay if absolute TSR for the three-year forward looking performance period is negative.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the purpose of calculating the number of shares of performance-based restricted stock to be granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, the dollar amount allocated to restricted stock was divided by $7.32 per share, which price was calculated by a third party financial firm with particular expertise in the valuation of performance-based restricted stock. The share award agreements to which the performance-based restricted shares were granted do not provide for the payment of dividends, if any, until the shares are earned. Dividends, if any, accrue during the performance period.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating the number of shares subject to the performance-based stock options to be granted to Mr. Powell and Ms. Johnson, the dollar amount allocated to stock options was divided by $2.82, which price was calculated by a third party  financial firm with particular expertise in the valuation of performance-based stock options. The stock options as granted had an exercise price of $6.96, which was the closing price of Aimco's stock on the grant date and equal to the fair market value of Aimco's Common Stock on the grant date.",

The Committee determined Mr. Powell's STI for 2022 would be based entirely on Aimco's performance against corporate goals, described above. The Committee calculated Mr. Powell's STI by multiplying his STI target of $688,000 by 162.00%, which was the Committee's payout determination having reviewed Aimco's overall performance against corporate goals, as described in detail above. The Committee granted Mr. Powell's LTI in the form of restricted stock and stock options on February 2, 2022, for the three-year performance period from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2024; the LTI grant is entirely at risk, based on relative returns over the performance period.

For Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, an allocation of the target STI was made as follows: 50% of the target STI was calculated based on Aimco's performance against KPI and 50% of the target STI was calculated based on each executive's achievement of her individual MAP goals. As described above, Aimco's KPI performance was 162.00%. Accordingly, each was awarded 162.00% of the portion of her STI attributable to KPI.\n\nIn determining the MAP achievement component of 2022 STI, Mr. Powell determined that: Ms. Stanfield's MAP achievement would be paid at 200% of target for her contributions to Aimco's balance sheet and to finance, capital allocation, and tax; and Ms. Johnson's MAP achievement would be paid at 200% of target for her leadership over legal matters, human capital, and ESG efforts. The Committee reviewed and approved Mr. Powell's determinations with respect to Mses. Stanfield and Johnson. As described above, LTI for Mses.

As part of the 2020 LTI program, the Company granted performance-share awards that might be earned based on relative TSR as compared to the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index (60% weighting) and the MSCI US REIT Index (40% weighting) over a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2022, with awards vesting 50% following the end of the three-year performance period (based on attainment of TSR targets) and 50% one year later, for a four-year plan from start to finish. On February 1, 2023, the Committee determined that Aimco's threeyear TSR (combined with AIR's TSR for the period from December 15, 2020, through December 31, 2022, as described in the chart below) was 180 basis points higher than the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index and 490 basis points lower than the MSCI US REIT Index for the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2022, resulting in the number of shares being earned at approximately 82% of target for Mr. Powell and Ms. Stanfield. Factoring in the portion of 2020 LTI that was for the purpose of retention, the realized LTI compensation for Mr. Powell and Ms. Stanfield was 88% of target.\n\nThe chart below summarizes the results for the 2020 performance share awards, and provides performance as of December 31, 2022, for the 'in progress' 2022 and 2021 and performance share awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                               | Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status         | Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Three-Year Performance Period | 2020                                    | 2021                                    | 2022                                    | 2023                                    | 2024                                    | Status                                        | CEO % Payout (1)(2)                     | Other NEOs (2)                          |\n| 2022 - 2024                   |                                         |                                         |                                         | 33% Completed                           | 33% Completed                           | Tracking Between Target and  Maximum          | 200% (3)                                | 167% (3)                                |\n| 2021 - 2023                   |                                         | 67% Completed                           | 67% Completed                           |                                         | Maximum                                 | Tracking Between Target and                   | 200% (3)                                | 167% (3)                                |\n| 2020 - 2022                   | 100% Completed                          |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                         | Payout Achieved Between Threshold  and Target | 88% (4)                                 | 88% (4)                                 |\n\n## OTHER COMPENSATION\n\nFrom time to time, Aimco determines to provide executive officers with additional compensation in the form of discretionary cash or equity awards. Aimco did not provide any such awards to the NEOs in 2022.\n\n## POST-EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYMENT AND SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS\n\n## 401(k) Plan\n\nAimco provides a 401(k) plan that is offered to all Aimco teammates. Aimco matches 100% of participant contributions to the extent of the first 3% of the participant's eligible compensation and 50% of participant contributions to the extent of the next 2% of the participant's eligible compensation. For 2022, the maximum match by Aimco was $12,200, which was the amount that Aimco matched for each of Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson's 2022 401(k) contributions.\n\nOther than the 401(k) plan, Aimco does not provide post-employment benefits. Aimco does not maintain a defined benefit pension plan, a supplemental executive retirement plan, or any other similar arrangements.\n\n## Executive Employment Arrangements\n\n2021 Powell Employment Agreement . On October 27, 2021, Aimco Development Company, LLC, an affiliate of the Company and the employer entity for Aimco's employees, entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Powell (the '2021 Employment Agreement'). The Committee evaluated the terms of the 2021 Employment Agreement in comparison to those of the CEOs of Aimco's peers. The 2021 Employment Agreement is for a term expiring on December 31, 2022. The 2021 Employment Agreement provides that on December 31, 2022, and on each subsequent one-year anniversary thereafter, the agreement shall be renewed for an additional one-year term unless either party gives written notice of intent not to renew to the",

On December 31, 2022, the 2021 Employment Agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term.\n\nThe 2021 Employment Agreement provides that the Committee shall review and set Mr. Powell's target total compensation on an annual basis in comparison to compensation paid to the Company's peers, taking into consideration experience, performance, and other relevant factors.\n\nPursuant to the 2021 Employment Agreement, upon termination of Mr. Powell's employment by Aimco Development Company, LLC without cause, or by Mr. Powell for good reason, Mr. Powell is generally entitled to: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of (i) his annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) his target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination; (b) any short-term incentive bonus earned but unpaid for a prior fiscal year (the 'Prior Year STI'); (c) a pro-rata portion of the short-term incentive bonus he would have earned for the year in which the termination occurs, based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance targets (the 'Pro Rata STI'); and (d) an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium for health and welfare plan coverage for Mr. Powell and his coverage dependents in effect on the date of termination (the 'monthly COBRA reimbursement') multiplied by 24 months. The vesting and exercise of any equity awards held Mr. Powell on the date of termination would be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nIn the event of termination of Mr. Powell's employment by Aimco without cause, or by Mr. Powell for good reason, in either case, within the period commencing six months prior to and ending 24 months following a 'Change in Control' (as defined in the 2021 Employment Agreement), then in lieu of the severance benefits described above, Mr. Powell will be entitled to: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to three times the sum of (i) his annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) his target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination; (b) the Prior Year STI; (c) the Pro Rata STI; (d) the monthly COBRA reimbursement multiplied by 36 months; and (e) 100% accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards then held by Mr. Powell.\n\nThe 2021 Employment Agreement provides that if Mr. Powell's employment is terminated by reason of his death or disability, then Mr. Powell will be eligible to receive the Prior Year STI and the Pro Rata STI. The vesting and exercise of any equity awards held by Mr. Powell at the time of his death or disability would be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nIn the event that any payment or benefit payable to Mr. Powell under the 2021 Employment Agreement would result in the imposition of excise taxes under the 'golden parachute' provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will either be made and/or provided in full or will be reduced such that the excise tax under Section 280G is not applicable, whichever is least economically disadvantageous to Mr. Powell. The 2021 Employment Agreement does not provide for any excise tax or other tax 'gross-up' payment.\n\nAll severance payments and benefits under the 2021 Employment Agreement are subject to applicable withholding obligations, Mr. Powell's execution and nonrevocation of a release of claims, and compliance with certain non-competition, non-disclosure, and non-solicitation covenants.\n\nNeither Ms. Stanfield nor Ms. Johnson has an employment agreement.\n\n## Executive Severance Arrangements\n\nAimco has an executive severance policy that provides that Aimco shall seek stockholder approval or ratification of any future severance agreement for any senior executive officer that provides for benefits, such as lump-sum or future periodic cash payments or new equity awards, in an amount in excess of 2.99 times such executive officer's base salary and bonus. Compensation and benefits earned through the termination date, the value of vesting or payment of any equity awards outstanding prior to the termination date, pro rata vesting of any other long-term awards, or benefits provided under plans, programs or arrangements that are applicable to one or more groups of employees in addition to senior executives are not subject to the policy. It has been Aimco's longstanding practice not to provide excessive severance arrangements.\n\nExecutive Severance Policy. On February 22, 2018, the Committee adopted the Apartment Investment and Management Company Executive Severance Policy (the 'Executive Severance Policy'). The Executive Severance Policy superseded and replaced any employment agreement or other plan, policy or practice involving the payment of severance benefits to participants under the Executive Severance Policy. On April 28, 2021, the Committee amended the Executive Severance Policy in accordance with recommendations provided by the Committee's compensation consultant to bring the policy in line with",

        "page_content": "market. On October 27, 2021, the Committee amended the Executive Severance Policy to remove severance provisions for the Chief Executive Officer in connection with the Committee's approval of an employment agreement for Mr. Powell that includes severance provisions that are consistent with the severance to which he may otherwise become entitled under the Executive Severance Policy. The Company's Executive Vice Presidents, as determined on the records of the Company and any other entities through which the operations of the Company are conducted, are eligible to participate in the Executive Severance Policy. Each of Mses. Stanfield and Johnson are participants under the Executive Severance Policy.\n\nThe Executive Severance Policy provides that if the Company terminates a participant's employment without 'Cause,' or if the participant terminates his or her employment for 'Good Reason' (each as defined in the Executive Severance Policy), then the participant will be eligible to receive the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7   a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (i) the annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) the target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination; and\n- \u00b7   with respect to each participant, an amount equal to their monthly COBRA premium, multiplied by 18 months.\n\nThe vesting and exercise of any equity awards held by a participant on the date of termination will be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Executive Severance Policy, if the Company terminates a participant's employment without Cause, or if the participant terminates his or her employment for Good Reason, in either case, within the period commencing six months prior to and ending 24 months following a 'Change in Control' (as defined in the Executive Severance Policy), then in lieu of the severance benefits described above the participant will be eligible to receive the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7   a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of (i) the annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) the target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination;\n- \u00b7   with respect to each participant, the monthly COBRA premium multiplied by 24 months; and\n- \u00b7   100% accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards then-held by the participant.\n\nThe Executive Severance Policy provides that if the employment of the participant is terminated by reason of the participant's death or disability, then the participant will be eligible to receive a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination. In addition, the vesting and exercise of any equity awards held by the participant at the time of his or her death or disability will be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nIn the event that any payment or benefit payable to a participant under the Executive Severance Policy would result in the imposition of excise taxes under the 'golden parachute' provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will either be made and/or provided in full or will be reduced such that the excise tax under Section 280G is not applicable, whichever is least economically disadvantageous to the participant. The Executive Severance Policy does not provide for any excise tax or other tax 'gross-up' payment.\n\nAll severance payments and benefits under the Executive Severance Policy are subject to applicable withholding obligations, the participant's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, and compliance with certain non-competition, non-disclosure and non-solicitation covenants set forth in a restrictive covenant agreement that is appropriate for the participant's position.\n\nThe Executive Severance Policy will remain in effect, subject to amendment, until terminated by the Board. The Board may terminate or amend the Executive Severance Policy at any time, so long as at least 90 days' prior notice is provided to any participant if the termination or amendment of the Executive Severance Policy would materially or adversely affect the rights of the participant.\n\n## Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements\n\nEffective in connection with their promotions by Aimco for Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, Aimco entered into certain non-competition and nonsolicitation agreements with each executive. Mr. Powell's non-competition and non-solicitation agreement was replaced by his 2021 Employment Agreement. Pursuant to these agreements, each of these NEOs agreed that during the term of his or her employment with the Company and for a period of two years following the termination",

The agreements further require that the NEOs protect Aimco's trade secrets and confidential information. For Mr. Powell, the non-solicitation requirement survives a change in control of the Company. For Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, the agreements provide that in order to enforce the above-noted non-competition condition following the executive's termination of employment by the Company without cause, the executive will receive, for a period not to extend beyond the earlier of 24 months following such termination or the date of acceptance of employment with a non-competitor, (i) non-compete payments in an amount, if any, to be determined by the Company in its sole discretion and (ii) a monthly payment equal to two-thirds of such executive's monthly base salary at the time of termination. For purposes of these agreements, 'cause' is defined to mean, among other things, the executive's (i) breach of the agreement, (ii) failure to perform required employment services, (iii) misappropriation of Company funds or property, (iv) conviction, plea of guilty, or plea of no contest to a crime involving fraud or moral turpitude, or (v) negligence, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, misconduct or violation of law.\n\n## Equity Award Agreements\n\nDouble Trigger Vesting Upon Change in Control . The award agreements pursuant to which restricted stock, stock option, and/or LTIP Unit awards have been granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, as applicable, provide that if (i) a change in control occurs and (ii) the executive's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason, in either case, within 12 months following the change in control, then (a) for time-based restricted stock and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock and LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested, and (b) for performance-based restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested based on the higher of actual or target performance through the truncated performance period ending on the date of the change in control, and all vested stock options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option.\n\nAccelerated Vesting Upon Termination of Employment Due to Death or Disability . The award agreements pursuant to which restricted stock, stock option, and/or LTIP Unit awards have been granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, as applicable, provide that upon a termination of employment due to death or disability, then (a) for time-based restricted stock and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock and LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested, and (b) for performance-based restricted stock, stock option, and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested based on the higher of actual or target performance through the truncated performance period ending on the date of termination, and all vested stock options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option.\n\n## OTHER BENEFITS; PERQUISITE PHILOSOPHY\n\nAimco's executive officer benefit programs are substantially the same as for all other eligible officers and employees. Aimco does not provide executives with more than minimal perquisites, such as reserved parking places.\n\n## STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES AND REQUIRED HOLDING PERIODS AFTER VESTING\n\nAimco believes that it is in the best interest of Aimco's stockholders for Aimco's executive officers to own Aimco equity. Every year, the Committee and CEO review Aimco's stock ownership guidelines, each executive officer's holdings in light of the stock ownership guidelines, and each executive officer's accumulated realized and unrealized restricted stock, stock option, and LTIP Unit gains. The Committee updated the stock ownership guidelines in April 2022.\n\nEquity ownership guidelines for all executive officers are determined as a multiple of the executive's base salary. The Committee and management have established the following stock ownership guidelines for Aimco's executive officers:\n\n| Officer Position                | Ownership Target   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Chief Executive Officer         | 5x base salary     |\n| Other Executive Vice Presidents | 3x base salary     |",

        "page_content": "## ROLE OF OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS\n\nThe Committee has the authority under its charter to engage the services of outside advisors, experts and others to assist the Committee. In 2022, the Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson to advise the Committee regarding Aimco's executive compensation plan. Willis Towers Watson did not provide other services to Aimco. The Committee assessed the independence of Willis Towers Watson pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that Willis Towers Watson is independent.\n\nThe Committee directed Willis Towers Watson to: (i) perform studies of competitive compensation practices; (ii) develop conclusions and recommendations regarding Aimco's executive compensation plans for consideration by the Committee; (iii) identify an executive compensation peer group; (iv) perform a benchmarking analysis of the base salary, STI, and LTI of the NEOs relative to competitive practices; (v) advise the Committee regarding stock ownership guidelines for the NEOs; and (vi) perform an assessment of the risks contained in Aimco's incentive compensation plans.\n\n## BASE SALARY, INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, AND EQUITY GRANT PRACTICES\n\nBase salary adjustments typically take effect on January 1. The Committee (for the CEO) and the CEO, in consultation with the Committee (for the other executive officers), determine incentive compensation in late January or early February. STI is typically paid in February or March. LTI is granted on a date determined by the Committee, typically in late January or early February.\n\nAimco grants equity in three scenarios: in connection with its annual incentive compensation program as discussed above; in connection with certain new-hire or promotion packages; and for purposes of retention.\n\nWith respect to LTI, the Committee sets the grant date for the restricted stock, stock option, and LTIP Unit grants. The Committee typically sets grant dates at the time of its final compensation determination, generally in late January or early February. The date of determination and date of award are not selected based on share price. In the case of new-hire packages that include equity awards, grants are made on the executive's start date or on a date designated in advance based on the passage of a specific number of days after the executive's start date. For non-executive officers, as provided for in the 2015 Plan, the Committee has delegated the authority to make equity awards, up to certain limits, to the Chief Financial Officer (Ms. Stanfield) and/or Corporate Secretary (Ms. Johnson). The Committee and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson time grants without regard to the share price or the timing of the release of material non-public information and do not time grants for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.\n\n## 2023 COMPENSATION TARGETS\n\nBased on comparison to compensation paid to CEOs at Aimco's peers, the Committee set Mr. Powell's target total compensation (base compensation, STI and LTI) for 2023 at approximately $3.9 million. Mr. Powell, in consultation with and approval from the Committee, set target total compensation (base compensation, STI and LTI) for 2023 for the other NEOs as follows: Ms. Stanfield - $1.8 million; and Ms. Johnson - $1.4 million. Aimco performance will determine the amounts paid for 2023 STI and the portion of LTI awards that vest, and such amounts may be less than, or in excess of, these target amounts. STI will be paid in cash. The LTI was granted on February 1, 2023, and was in the form of restricted stock.\n\n## ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nThe Committee generally considers the accounting treatment and tax implications of the compensation awarded or paid to our executives. Grants of equity compensation awards under our long-term incentive program are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 718. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code was amended on December 22, 2017, by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 'Tax Act'). Under the Tax Act, Section 162(m) applies to each employee who serves as the Company's principal executive officer or principal financial officer during the taxable year, each other employee of the Company who is among the three most highly compensated officers during such taxable year, and any other employee who was a covered employee of the Company for any preceding taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016. The Tax Act also eliminated the performance-based compensation exception with respect to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, but includes a transition rule with respect to compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2018, and not materially modified after that date. The Company has awarded, and will continue to award, compensation as it considers appropriate that does not qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m).\n\n## Compensation and Human Resources Committee Report to Stockholders",

The terms of these arrangements are described under 'CD&A - Post-Employment Compensation and Employment and Severance Arrangements - Executive Employment Arrangements, Executive Severance Arrangements, and Equity Award Agreements' above.\n\nIn the table that follows, potential payments and other benefits payable upon termination of employment and change in control situations are set out as if the conditions for payments had occurred and/or the terminations took place on December 31, 2022. In setting out such payments and benefits, amounts that had already been earned as of the termination date are not shown. Also, benefits that are available to all full-time regular employees when their employment terminates are not shown. The amounts set forth below are estimates of the amounts that could be paid out to the NEOs upon their termination. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such NEOs' separation from Aimco. The following table summarizes the potential payments under various scenarios if they had occurred on December 31, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the principal executive officer. The disclosure is required for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The annual total compensation for 2022 for Mr. Powell, our CEO, was $2,858,721, as reported under the heading 'Summary Compensation Table.' Our median employee's total compensation for 2022 was $177,320. As a result, we estimate that Mr. Powell's 2022 total compensation was approximately 16 times that of our median employee.\n\nOur CEO to median employee pay ratio was calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining 2022 total compensation, consisting of base salary, annual bonus amounts, stock-based compensation (based on the grant date fair value of awards granted during 2022) and other incentive payments for all individuals who were employed by Aimco on December 31, 2022, other than our CEO. Our measuring date of December 31 remained the same as last year. We included all active employees and annualized the compensation for any employees who were not employed by Aimco for the full 2022 calendar year. After identifying the median employee based on 2022 total compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the 'Total' column in the Summary Compensation Table.",

        "page_content": "## DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nIn formulating its recommendation for director compensation, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviews director compensation for independent directors of companies in the real estate industry and companies of comparable market capitalization, revenue, and assets and considers compensation trends for other NYSE-listed companies. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee also considers the size of the Board as compared to other boards, the participation of each independent director on committees, and the resulting workload on the directors. In addition, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee considers the overall cost of the Board to the Company and the cost per director.\n\n## 2022 COMPENSATION\n\nFor 2022, based on the advice of Aimco's independent compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, with such advice based on a review of director compensation for Aimco's identified peer group, compensation for the Independent Directors included an annual fee of $170,000, payable up to 50% in the form of a cash retainer with the remainder in stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units. The stock, stock options, and LTIP Units were awarded on February 4, 2022. The closing price of Aimco's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 4, 2022, was $6.79. No meeting fees were paid to independent directors for attending meetings of the Board and the committees on which they serve.\n\nAs contemplated by the Separation and by Aimco and AIR, Mr. Considine had specific responsibilities to Aimco as a non-executive consultant during 2021 and 2022 to support the establishment and growth of the Aimco business, reporting directly to the Board. These responsibilities included short and long-term strategic direction and advice, transition and executive support to Aimco officers, and advice and consultation with respect to Aimco's strategic growth and acquisition activities. The Independent Directors set Mr. Considine's 2022 target total compensation (including base compensation, STI, and LTI) for these responsibilities at $1.8 million. Mr. Considine's responsibilities to Aimco as a non-executive consultant did not continue past 2022, and he will not be provided any further compensation as a non-executive consultant in 2023. Mr. Considine resigned from serving as a member of the Board on February 13, 2023.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Aimco paid the directors serving on the Board during that year as follows:\n\n| Name                 | Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($) (1)   | Stock Awards ($) (2)   | Option Awards ($) (3)   | Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation ($)   | Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings   | All Other Compensation ($)   | Total ($)   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|\n| Quincy L.

        "page_content": "directly to the Board, as described above. The Independent Directors set Mr. Considine's 2022 target total compensation for these responsibilities at $1.8 million, consisting of $300,000 in base salary, target STI of $600,000, and target LTI of $900,000. Mr. Considine's 2022 base salary of $300,000 was paid in the form of 175,439 LTIP Units. The LTIP Units were granted on February 2, 2022 and vested 100% on the anniversary of the grant date. Mr. Considine's 2022 STI was $600,000 at target with a final value based entirely on Aimco's performance against 2022 corporate goals. The final value was equal to 162% of target or 568,422 LTIP Units and was awarded on February 1, 2023. This award will appear next year under the 'Stock Awards' heading of this table in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Mr. Considine's 2022 LTI award, valued at $900,000, was granted by the Independent Directors on February 2, 2022, and consisted of a number between zero and 633,804 of performance-based LTIP Units, or 316,902 LTIP Units at target, for the forward-looking, three-year performance period from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2024, pursuant to the same 2022 LTI plan as established by the Committee for the NEOs described above under the heading 'Compensation Discussion & Analysis - Total  Compensation for 2022 - Long Term Incentive Compensation Awards for 2022.' The performance-based LTIP Units constitute profits interests within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. The exact number of Mr. Considine's performance-based LTIP Units granted in 2022 that may vest is determined based on Aimco's relative TSR performance over the course of the forward-looking, three-year performance period, with 100% of such number of LTIP Units generally vesting at the later of the time performance is determined or February 2, 2025. With respect to the performance-based LTIP Units granted to Mr. Considine, Mr. Considine was granted the ability to participate in the appreciation of value of Aimco that took place after the grant date, subject to their vesting. For the purpose of calculating the number of shares subject to these LTIP Units, the target dollar amount of $900,000 was divided by $2.84, or 316,902 LTIP Units, with such LTIP Unit value calculated by a third-party financial firm with particular expertise in the valuation of such LTIP Units. The LTIP Units as granted had a conversion price of $6.96, which was the closing price of Aimco's stock on the grant date, and equal to the fair market value of Aimco's Common Stock on the grant date. Additional details regarding the structure of LTIP Units can be found in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Aimco OP L.P., effective as of December 14, 2020, and the Form of Performance Vesting LTIP II Unit Agreement, each of which are incorporated by reference in this filing, as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.15, respectively. The amount shown for Mr. Considine under the 'Stock Awards' heading above represents the grant date value of the performance-based LTIP Units based on the probable outcome of the performance condition to which such award is subject, which was calculated using a Monte  Carlo  valuation  model  in  accordance  with  FASB  ASC  Topic  718.  For  additional  information  on  the  valuation  assumptions  with  respect  to  the  award,  refer  to  the  Share-Based Compensation footnote to Aimco's consolidated financial statements in this filing. Based on the foregoing, the grant date fair value was $2.84 per LTIP Unit as to Mr. Considine's performancebased LTIP Unit award. The grant date fair value of the performance-based LTIP Unit award of $900,002 at target, assuming achievement at the maximum level of performance, is $1,800,003. The amount shown under the \"Stock Awards\" heading above also includes Mr. Considine's 2021 STI, which was $600,000 at target with a final value based entirely on Aimco's performance against 2021 corporate goals. The final value was equal to 126.75% of target, or 563,334 LTIP Units, and was awarded on February 2, 2022.\n\n## 2023 Compensation\n\nCompensation for each of the non-management directors in 2023 includes an annual fee of $200,000, payable up to 50% in the form of a cash retainer with the remainder in stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units. The stock, stock options, and LTIP Units were awarded on February 1, 2023. The closing price of Aimco's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 1, 2023, was $7.59. Additional retainers for Board leadership positions in 2023 are as follows: Chairman of the Board - $65,000; Audit Committee Chairman - $20,000; Compensation and Human Resources Committee Chairman - $15,000; Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee Chairman -  $14,000; and Investment Committee Chairman - $15,000. Directors will not receive meeting fees in 2023.",

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\n\n## CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\n\nPolicies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions\n\nAimco recognizes that related person transactions can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that Aimco's decisions are based on considerations other than the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. Nevertheless, Aimco recognizes that there are situations where related person transactions may be in, or may not be inconsistent with, the",

        "page_content": "best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee, pursuant to a written policy approved by the Board, has oversight for related person transactions. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee will review transactions, arrangements or relationships in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $100,000 in any calendar year, (2) Aimco (or any Aimco entity) is a participant, and (3) any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than an interest arising solely as a result of being a director of another corporation or organization that is a party to the transaction or a less than ten percent beneficial owner of another entity that is a party to the transaction). The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee has also given its standing approval for certain types of related person transactions such as certain employment arrangements, director compensation, transactions with another entity in which a related person's interest is only by virtue of a non-executive employment relationship or limited equity position, and transactions in which all stockholders receive pro rata benefits.\n\n## Sublease of a Portion of Aimco Office Space\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Aimco entered into a sublease agreement (the 'Sublease') with an entity in which Mr. Considine, former Director who resigned from the Board in February 2023, has sole voting and investment power. Under this agreement, Aimco has subleased to said entity approximately 2,957 square feet of office space within the same building as Aimco's corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado, and consisting of excess space not needed by Aimco, on exactly the same terms as Aimco leases the space. The Sublease does not provide any benefit to the entity, as other space in the building requires comparable rent. The Sublease provides some benefit to Aimco as it gives Aimco the ability to put the excess space to productive use. The entity has a lease term less favorable than Aimco's lease with the landlord, in that Aimco has the option to terminate the Sublease at any time, for any or no reason, upon six months' notice. The Sublease has a term that began on April 1, 2019, and ends on April 30, 2029, the same term as the Aimco lease. The annual amount of rent in the first year was $78,361, subject to annual increases. The aggregate amount of rent expected to be paid under the Sublease, assuming the entire lease term is fulfilled, is approximately $850,000. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed the Sublease and determined that it is in the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders.\n\n## Related Person Transactions\n\nIn November 2019, Aimco confirmed an arrangement with Richard M. Powell, of R.M. Powell & Co., a contractor for Aimco since 1997 and father of Mr. Wes Powell, Director, President and CEO. Depending on the success of potential transactions identified by Mr. Richard Powell, he may earn fees in amounts in excess of $120,000. Pursuant to the Company's related party transactions policy, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed and approved the arrangement with Mr. Richard Powell, subject to the Committee's subsequent review and approval of any specific transaction in which R.M. Powell & Co. provides services. In April 2022, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed and approved a transaction directly sourced by R.M. Powell & Co., including a fee paid to R.M. Powell & Co. in the amount of $998,134, with such fee calculated pursuant to the fee structure previously reviewed and approved by the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee.\n\nIn March 2020, Elizabeth Likovich, the daughter of Mr. Considine, former Director who resigned from the Board in February 2023, became a full-time employee of the Company. Her compensation for 2022 was in line with the median for her peers, and consisted of $262,184 in base salary, $129,687 in STI, $8,403 in non-discretionary matching contributions under Aimco's 401(k) plan, and $103,728 in equity awards vesting over three years. Prior to joining Aimco, Ms. Likovich held a similar position at a peer apartment company. Pursuant to the policy noted above, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed and approved the employment of Ms. Likovich.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe Board has determined that to be considered independent, a director may not have a direct or indirect material relationship with Aimco or its subsidiaries (directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). A material relationship is one that impairs or inhibits, or has the potential to impair or inhibit, a director's exercise of critical and disinterested judgment on behalf of Aimco and its stockholders. In determining whether a material relationship exists, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including whether the director or a family member is a current or former employee of the Company, family member relationships, compensation, business relationships and payments, and charitable contributions between Aimco and an entity with which a director is affiliated (as an executive officer, partner or substantial stockholder). The Board consults with the Company's counsel to ensure that such determinations are consistent with all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the definition of 'independent director,' including but not limited to those categorical standards set forth in Section 303A.02 of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.",

A summary of the Pre-Approval Policy is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7   The Pre-Approval Policy describes the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and Other Permitted services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7   Pre-approvals are typically subject to a dollar limit of $50,000.\n- \u00b7   The term of any general pre-approval is generally 12 months from the date of pre-approval.\n- \u00b7   At least annually, the Audit Committee reviews and pre-approves the services that may be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7   Unless a type of service has received general pre-approval and is anticipated to be within the dollar limit associated with the general pre-approval, it requires specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it is to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.\n- \u00b7   The Audit Committee will consider whether all services are consistent with the rules on independent registered public accounting firm independence.\n- \u00b7   The Audit Committee also considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, for reasons such as its familiarity with Aimco's business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance Aimco's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. Such factors are considered as a whole, and no one factor is necessarily determinative.\n\nAll of the services described in the Principal Accountant Fees section above were approved pursuant to the annual engagement letter or in accordance with the Pre-Approval Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\n\nApartment Investment and Management Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apartment Investment and Management Company (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related  notes  and  financial  statement  schedule  listed  in  the  index  at  Item  15(a)  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  'consolidated  financial  statements').  In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's  financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our especially  challenging,  subjective  or  complex  judgments.  The  communication  of  the  critical  audit  matter  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impairment of mezzanine investment\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\nDuring 2022 the Company recorded an impairment loss on its mezzanine investment of $212.6 million to reduce the investment to  its  estimated  fair  value  of  $158.6  million.  As  more  fully  described  in  Note  2  and  Note  13  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the Company periodically evaluates the mezzanine investment for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized to adjust the investment to its estimated fair value when the Company determines the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment on an other-than-temporary basis.\n\nAuditing the Company's measurement of the impairment loss on the mezzanine investment involved a higher degree of judgment due to the subjective nature of the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of real estate include the capitalization rate, discount rate, market rental rates and operating expense ratio.",

        "page_content": "## How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  Company's process to determine the fair value of the mezzanine investment and measure the impairment loss. This included testing controls over management's evaluation of the significant inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.\n\nTo test the impairment loss on the mezzanine investment, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the information included in the valuation model and evaluating the significant assumptions mentioned above that were used to estimate fair value.  With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we compared the significant assumptions to observable market data and published industry resources, including comparing management's capitalization rate, discount rate, market rental rates, operating expense ratio to ranges for comparable properties in the same or nearby markets.\n\n## /s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2020.\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nFebruary 27, 2023",

(the Partnership) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement  schedule  listed  in  the  index  at  Item  15(a)  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  'consolidated  financial  statements').  In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Partnership  at  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  and  the  results  of  its operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2022,  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our especially  challenging,  subjective  or  complex  judgments.  The  communication  of  the  critical  audit  matter  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impairment of mezzanine investment\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\nDuring 2022 the Company recorded an impairment loss on its mezzanine investment of $212.6 million to reduce the investment to  its  estimated  fair  value  of  $158.6  million.  As  more  fully  described  in  Note  2  and  Note  13  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the Company periodically evaluates the mezzanine investment for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized to adjust the investment to its estimated fair value when the Company determines the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment on an other-than-temporary basis.\n\nAuditing the Company's measurement of the impairment loss on the mezzanine investment involved a higher degree of judgment due to the subjective nature of the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of real estate include the capitalization rate, discount rate, market rental rates and operating expense ratio.\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm",

This included testing controls over management's evaluation of the significant inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.\n\nTo test the impairment loss on the mezzanine investment, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the information included in the valuation model and evaluating the significant assumptions mentioned above that were used to estimate fair value.  With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we compared the significant assumptions to observable market data and published industry resources, including comparing management's capitalization rate, discount rate, market rental rates, operating expense ratio to ranges for comparable properties in the same or nearby markets.\n\n## /s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Partnership's auditor since 2020.\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nFebruary 27, 2023",

Aimco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the general partner and directly is the special limited partner of Aimco OP L.P. (\"Aimco Operating Partnership\").\n\nExcept  as  the  context  otherwise  requires,  'we,'  'our,'  and  'us'  refer  to  Aimco,  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  and  their  consolidated  subsidiaries, collectively.\n\n## The Separation\n\nOn December 15, 2020, we completed the separation of our businesses (the 'Separation'), creating two, separate and distinct, publicly traded companies, Aimco and Apartment Income REIT Corp. ('AIR') (Aimco and AIR together, as they existed prior to the Separation, 'Aimco Predecessor'). Events noted in this filing as occurring before December 15, 2020, were those entered into by Aimco Predecessor.\n\nPrior to the Separation, the consolidated financial statements were prepared on a carve-out basis and reflect significant assumptions and allocations. The consolidated  financial  statements  reflect  our  historical  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows  in  conformity  with  generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). The historical financial statements of Aimco do not represent the financial position and results of operations of one legal entity,  but  rather  a  combination  of  entities  under  common  control  that  have  been  'carved  out'  from Aimco  Predecessor's  financial statements. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nAll  Separation-related  transactions  between  Aimco  and  Aimco  Predecessor  have  been  considered  effectively  settled  through  partners'  capital  in  our consolidated  financial  statements,  other  than  the  Notes  Payable  to AIR  as  discussed  in Note  7 .  The  settlement  of  these  transactions  has  been  reflected  as Contributions from Aimco Predecessor, net in our Consolidated Statements of Equity and Partners' Capital and Change in Aimco Predecessor investment, net in financing activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows .\n\n## Business\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Aimco owned 92.6% of the legal interest in the common partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership and 94.9% of the economic  interest  in Aimco  Operating  Partnership.  The  remaining  7.4%  legal  interest  is  owned  by  limited  partners. As  the  sole  general  partner  of Aimco Operating Partnership, Aimco has exclusive control of Aimco Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe own or lease a portfolio of real estate investments focused primarily on the U.S. multifamily sector. These real estate investments include a portfolio of 26  operating  apartment  communities  (22  consolidated  properties  with  5,640  apartment  homes  and  four  unconsolidated  properties),  diversified  by  both geography and price point; one commercial office building that is part of a land assemblage; three residential apartment communities, with 1,185 planned apartment homes, a single family rental community, with 16 planned homes plus eight accessory dwelling units, and one hotel, with 106 planned rooms, we are actively developing or redeveloping; land parcels held for development. Our Other real estate portfolio also includes two unconsolidated investments in land held for development. In addition, we hold other alternative investments, including our Mezzanine investment (see Note 2 for further information); our IQHQ investment (see Note 3 for further information); and our investment in real estate technology funds.\n\nAny reference to the number of apartment communities and homes, square footage, or occupancy percentage in these notes to our consolidated financial statements are unaudited.\n\n## Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated subsidiaries. Aimco Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aimco Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.",

        "page_content": "As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, 'partnership' refers to a limited partnership or a limited liability company and 'partner' refers to a partner in a limited partnership or a member of a limited liability company.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period financial statement presentation with no effect on the Company's previously reported results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nWe consolidate a variable interest entity ('VIE'), in which we are considered the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Refer to Note 6 for further information.\n\n## Allocations\n\nThe 2020 Consolidated Statement of Operations includes allocations of general and administrative expenses from Aimco Predecessor, as discussed in Note 5 . We consider the basis on which expenses have been allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by us  during  the  periods  presented.  However,  the  allocations  may  not  include  all  of  the  actual  expenses  that  we  would  have  incurred  and  may  not  reflect  our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had it been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that might have been incurred had we been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, what functions we might  have  performed  ourselves  or  outsourced,  and  strategic  decisions  we  might  have  made  in  areas  such  as  information  technology  and  infrastructure. Following the Separation, AIR, through its subsidiaries, provides us with certain property management and other services, and we perform certain functions using our own resources or purchase services from third parties.\n\n## Common Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nIndividuals and entities that hold an interest in Aimco Operating Partnership other than Aimco are reflected in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as Common Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership . Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss is allocated to the holders of OP Units, other than Aimco, based on the weighted-average number of OP Units (including Aimco) outstanding during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the holders of OP Units had a weighted-average economic ownership interest in Aimco Operating Partnership of approximately 5.1%, 5.0%,  and  5.0%,  respectively.  Please  refer  to Note  10 for  further  information  regarding  the  items  comprising  common  noncontrolling  interests  in Aimco Operating Partnership. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Aimco are held by Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests consist of equity interests held by a limited partner in a consolidated real estate partnership that has a finite life. We generally attribute to noncontrolling interests their share of income or loss of consolidated partnerships based on their proportionate interest in the results of operations  of  the  partnerships,  including  their  share  of  losses  even  if  such  attribution  results  in  a  deficit  noncontrolling  interest  balance  within  our  equity accounts.\n\nIf  a  consolidated  real  estate  partnership  includes  redemption  rights  that  are  not  within  our  control,  the  noncontrolling  interest  is  included  as  temporary equity. If the redemption right is not currently redeemable, but probable of being redeemable in the future, changes in redemption value are recognized each quarter with the change in value being reflected in additional paid-in-capital.\n\nThe assets of our consolidated real estate partnerships must first be used to settle the liabilities of the consolidated real estate partnerships. The consolidated real estate partnership's creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nIn December 2022, we were admitted to Strathmore Joint Venture 1 as sole limited partner. In addition, in the same period $12.9 million of loans were funded to the Strathmore Joint Venture 1 and $6.4 million in funds were remitted to our co-GP as a partial return of their capital contributions to the joint venture. This remittance reduced their ownership percentage in the joint venture and increased our combined GP and LP ownership percentage. As a result of these transactions, we consolidated Strathmore Joint Venture 1 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and recognized $7.3 million of redeemable noncontrolling interests.",

        "page_content": "In July 2022, we closed a $102.0 million preferred equity financing with an institutional investor, providing for a fixed 8% annual rate of return payable monthly. We recognized this financing as a capital contribution to redeemable noncontrolling interests.\n\nIn February 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding redeemable non-controlling interests in an entity reported as a consolidated VIE as of December 31, 2021. At the time of redemption, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests was $4.9 million.\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships as of December 31, 2022 consist of the $102.0 million preferred equity noted above, our partner's equity interest in the Upton Joint Venture, which provides for an accruing 9.7% rate of return on their investment and the $7.3 million net interest held by the other general partner of Strathmore Joint Venture 1. These investment interests are presented as Redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe following table shows changes in our redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships during the years ended December 31, 2022 , and 2021 (in thousands):\n\n|                                | 2022      | 2021     |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Balance at Beginning of Period | $ 33,794  | $ 4,263  |\n| Capital contributions          | 138,479   | 29,440   |\n| Distributions                  | (9,365 )  | -        |\n| Redemptions                    | (4,911 )  | -        |\n| Net income                     | 8,829     | 91       |\n| Balance at December 31,        | $ 166,826 | $ 33,794 |\n\n## Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nWe own general  and  limited  partner  interests  in  partnerships  that  either  directly,  or  through  interests  in  other  real  estate  partnerships,  own  apartment communities. We generally account for investments in real estate partnerships that we do not consolidate under the equity method. Accordingly, we recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods presented, inclusive of our share of any impairments and disposition gains or losses recognized by and related to such entities, and we present such amounts within Income from unconsolidated real estate partnerships in  our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe excess of our cost of the acquired partnership interests over our share of the partners' equity or deficit is generally ascribed to the fair values of land and buildings owned by the partnerships. We amortize the excess cost ascribed to the buildings over the related estimated useful lives. Such amortization is recorded as an adjustment of the amounts of earnings or losses we recognize from such unconsolidated real estate partnerships.\n\nWe assess the recoverability of our equity method investments if there are indicators of potential impairment. We did not recognize any such impairments of our equity method investments during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment\n\nIn November 2019, Aimco Predecessor made a five-year, $275.0 million mezzanine loan to the partnership owning the 'Parkmerced Apartments' located in southwest San Francisco (the 'Mezzanine Investment'). The loan bears interest at a 10% annual rate, accruing if not paid from property operations. Ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the mezzanine loan was retained by AIR following the Separation.\n\nThe Separation Agreement provides for AIR to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the mezzanine loan, a related equity option to acquire a 30% interest in the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments and the interest rate option, or swaption, that provides partial protection against future refinancing risk to us through 2024 once required third-party consents are received. At the time of the Separation and as of the date of this filing, legal title of these subsidiaries had not yet transferred to us. Until legal title of the subsidiaries is transferred, AIR is obligated to pass payments received on such loan to us, and we are obligated to indemnify AIR against any costs and expenses related thereto. We have the risks and rewards of ownership of the Mezzanine Investment and have recognized an asset related to our right to receive the Mezzanine Investment from AIR.\n\nOn  a  periodic  basis,  we  evaluate  our  Mezzanine  Investment  for  impairment.  We  assess  whether  there  are  any  indicators  that  imply  the  value  of  our investment may be impaired. These include assessments of both the underlying property performance and general market conditions in place. An investment is considered  impaired  if  we  determine  that  its  fair  value  is  less  than  the  net  carrying  value  of  the  investment  on  an  other-than-temporary  basis.  Cash  flow projections for the investments consider property",

        "page_content": "level  factors  such  as  expected  future  operating  income,  trends  and  prospects,  as  well  as  the  effects  of  demand,  competition  and  other  factors. We  consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include the loan's maturity date, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, and the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity.\n\nThe loan is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, changes in the macroeconomic environment that can lead to increases in capitalization rates and discount rates, and factors that can have negative effects on occupancy and market rental rates such as lower demand for urban living in San Francisco resulting from the post pandemic virtual working environment adopted by big tech, and an increase in virtual participation as compared to pre-pandemic in class learning at local colleges. These trends have impacted the demand at the Parkmerced Apartments, resulting in a sustained decrease in rents and a negative impact on the resulting occupancy rates. Further, recent transactions in the market and a supporting appraisal, indicate that that the collateral from the note has declined in value.\n\nThis decline was deemed to be other-than-temporary and the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $212.6 million to reduce the carrying value of the Mezzanine Investment to $158.6 million as of December 31, 2022. The non-cash impairment is reflected in Mezzanine investment income (loss), net , in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, and as a reduction in the carrying value of the Mezzanine investment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 . No impairment losses were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nPrior to recording the impairment charge, we recognized as income the net amounts earned on the mezzanine loan by AIR on its equity investment that are due to be paid to us when collected to the extent the income was supported by the change in AIR's claim to the net assets of the underlying borrower. The income recognized primarily represents the interest accrued under the terms of the underlying mezzanine loan.\n\n## Real Estate\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nUpon the acquisition  of  real  estate,  we  determine  whether  the  purchase  qualifies  as  an  asset  acquisition  or,  less  frequently,  meets  the  definition  of  an acquisition of a business. We generally recognize the acquisition of real estate or interests in partnerships that own real estate at our cost, including the related transaction costs, as asset acquisitions.\n\nWe allocate the cost of real estate acquired based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using valuation techniques that rely on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs within the fair value framework. We determine the fair value of tangible assets, such as land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, and equipment using valuation techniques that consider comparable market transactions, replacement costs, and other available information. We determine the fair value of identified intangible assets or liabilities, which typically relate to in-place leases, using valuation techniques that consider the terms of the in-place leases, current market data for comparable leases, and our experience in leasing similar real estate.\n\nThe intangible assets or liabilities related to in-place leases are comprised of: (a) the value of the above- and below-market leases in-place, measured over the period, including probable lease renewals for below-market leases, for which the leases are expected to remain in effect; (b) the estimated unamortized portion of avoided leasing commissions and other costs that ordinarily would be incurred to originate the in-place leases; (c) the value associated with in-place leases during an estimated absorption period, which estimates rental revenue that would not have been earned had the leased space been vacant at the time of acquisition, assuming lease-up periods based on market demand and stabilized occupancy levels; and (d) tax abatement contract related intangibles, to the extent the  property  has  them  in  place.  The  above  and  below-market  lease  intangibles  are  amortized  to  rental  revenue  over  the  expected  remaining  terms  of  the associated  leases,  which  include  reasonably  assured  renewal  periods.  Other  intangible  assets  related  to  in-place  leases  are  amortized  to  depreciation  and amortization over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases.\n\n## Capital Additions\n\nWe capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopments, other tangible apartment community improvements, and replacements of existing community components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time  spent  by  employees  in  connection  with  the  planning,  execution,  and  control  of  all  capital  addition  activities  at  our  communities.  We  characterize  as 'indirect costs' an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital addition activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes, and insurance during periods in which construction projects are in progress. We commence capitalization of costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital addition activities,",

        "page_content": "at the point in time when activities necessary to get communities, apartment homes, or leased spaces ready for their intended use begin. These activities include when communities, apartment homes or leased spaces are undergoing physical construction, as well as when homes or leased spaces are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting, planning, and design are in progress. We cease the capitalization of costs when the communities or components thereof are substantially complete and ready for their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and homes or leased spaces are available for occupancy. We charge costs including ordinary repairs, maintenance, and resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred.\n\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we capitalized to buildings and improvements $30.6 million, $21.3 million, and $1.0 million of interest costs, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we capitalized to buildings and improvements $16.9 million, $20.9 million, and $2.7 million of indirect costs, respectively.\n\n## Gain or Loss on Dispositions\n\nGain or loss on dispositions are recognized when we no longer hold a controlling financial interest in the real estate and sufficient consideration has been received. Upon disposition, the related assets and liabilities are derecognized, and the gain or loss on disposition is recognized as the difference between the carrying  amount  of  those  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  value  of  consideration  received.  Total Gains  on  dispositions  of  real  estate of  $175.9  million  were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.  There were no dispositions in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Impairment\n\nReal estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the community. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the community.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a sublease of office space within our corporate offices to AIR at then-current market rents. Based on an analysis  of  the  estimated  undiscounted  cash  flows  relative  to  the  sublease  arrangement,  we  evaluated  the  recoverability  of  the  assets  associated  with  the subleased space, including, the right-of-use asset, tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment and concluded the subleased assets were impaired. We recorded an impairment charge of $11.0 million in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a software license agreement with AIR to provide for the use of certain internally developed software at then-current market rates. Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relative to the carrying value of the internally developed software, we concluded  the  assets  were  impaired. Additionally,  following  an  evaluation  of  the  future  service  potential  of  certain  other  internal  software  that  was  under development,  we  ceased  development  and  impaired  the  associated  carrying  value.  We  recorded  an  aggregate  impairment  charge  of  $4.9  million  in  our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. We maintain cash equivalents in financial institutions in excess of insured limits. We have not experienced any losses in these accounts in the past and believe that we are not exposed to significant credit risk because our accounts are deposited with major financial institutions.",

        "page_content": "## Deferred Leasing Costs\n\nIn accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standard Codification ('ASC') 842, we defer leasing costs incremental to a lease that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. Amortization of these costs over the lease term on the same basis as lease income, is included in Depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Operations .\n\n## Revenue from Leases\n\nWe are a lessor for residential and commercial leases. Our operating leases with residents may provide that the resident reimburse us for certain costs, primarily the resident's share of utilities expenses, incurred by the apartment community. Our operating leases with commercial tenants may provide that the tenant  reimburse  us  for  common  area  maintenance,  real  estate  taxes,  and  other  recoverable  costs  incurred  by  the  commercial  property.  Residential  and commercial reimbursements represent revenue attributable to non-lease components for which the timing and pattern of recognition is the same as the revenue for  the  lease  components. Reimbursements and the related expenses are presented on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, with  the reimbursements included in Rental and other property revenues in the period the recoverable costs are incurred. We recognize rental revenue attributed to lease components, net of any concessions, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## Debt Issuance Costs\n\nWe defer, as debt issuance costs, lender fees and other direct costs incurred in obtaining new financing and amortize the amounts over the terms of the related  loan  agreements.  In  connection  with  the  modification  of  existing  financing  arrangements,  we  defer  lender  fees  and  amortize  these  costs  and  any unamortized debt issuance costs over the term of the modified loan agreement. Debt issuance costs associated with non-recourse property debt are presented as a direct deduction from the related liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For debt issuance costs associated with our revolving credit facilities and construction loans that have not been drawn we record the costs in Other assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortize the costs to Interest expense, on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. Debt issuance costs associated with construction loans are reclassified as a direct deduction to the construction loan liability in proportion to any draws on the loans in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently amortized to Interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the arrangement in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nWhen financing arrangements are repaid or otherwise extinguished prior to maturity, unamortized debt issuance costs are written off. Any lender fees or other  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  an  extinguishment  are  recognized  as  expense.  Amortization  and  write-off  of  debt  issuance  costs  and  other extinguishment costs are included in Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation for all tangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Acquired buildings and improvements are depreciated  over  a  useful  life  based  on  the  age,  condition,  and  other  physical  characteristics  of  the  asset.  Furniture,  fixtures,  and  equipment  are  generally depreciated over five years.\n\nWe depreciate capitalized costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related improvement, which is generally 5, 15, or 30 years. We also capitalize payroll and other indirect costs incurred in connection with preparing an asset for its intended use. These costs include corporate-level costs that clearly relate to the capital addition activities, which we allocate to the applicable assets. All capitalized payroll costs and indirect costs are allocated to capital additions proportionately based on direct costs and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of such capital additions.\n\nPurchased equipment is recognized at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally five years. Leasehold improvements are also recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's estimated useful life or the term of the related lease.\n\nCertain homogeneous items that are purchased in bulk on a recurring basis, such as appliances, are depreciated using group methods that reflect the average estimated useful life of the items in each group. Except in the case of casualties, where the net book value of the lost asset is written off in the determination of casualty  gains  or  losses,  we  generally  do  not  recognize  any  loss  in  connection  with  the  replacement  of  an  existing  community  component  because  normal replacements are considered in determining the estimated useful lives used in connection with our composite and group depreciation methods.",

        "page_content": "## Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\n\nCertain  aspects  of  our  operations,  including  our  development  and  redevelopment  activities,  are  conducted  through  taxable  REIT  subsidiaries,  or  TRS entities. Additionally, our TRS entities hold investments in one of our apartment communities and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive.\n\nOur income tax benefit (expense) calculated in accordance with GAAP includes income taxes associated with the income or loss of our TRS entities. Income taxes,  as  well  as  changes  in  valuation  allowance  and  incremental  deferred  tax  items  in  conjunction  with  intercompany  asset  transfers  and  internal restructurings (if applicable), are included in Income tax benefit (expense) in our C onsolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nConsolidated GAAP income or loss subject to tax consists of pretax income or loss of our taxable entities and gains retained by the REIT. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income subject to tax of $88.8 million, compared to net loss subject to tax of $31.4 million for the same period in 2021.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $17.3 million, compared to income tax benefit of $13.6 million for the same period in 2021. The year-to-year change is due primarily to the GAAP income taxes associated with the net lease modification income recognized in 2022.\n\nAimco has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, and Aimco intends to continue to operate in such a manner. Aimco's current and continuing qualification as a REIT depends on its ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Code, which are related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. If Aimco qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it will generally not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the 'double taxation' (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.\n\nEven if Aimco qualifies as a REIT, Aimco may be subject to United States federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on undistributed income. Aimco also will be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm's length transactions between Aimco and a TRS and on any net income from sales of apartment communities that were held for sale in the ordinary course. The state and local tax laws may not conform to the United States federal income tax treatment, and Aimco may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business. Any taxes imposed on us reduce our operating cash flow and net income.\n\n## Earnings per Share and per Unit\n\nAimco and Aimco Operating Partnership calculate earnings per share and unit based on the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock or OP Units, participating securities, common stock or common unit equivalents and dilutive convertible securities outstanding during the period. Aimco Operating Partnership considers both OP Units and equivalents, which have identical rights to distributions and undistributed earnings, to be common units for purposes of the earnings per unit computations. Please refer to Note 11 for further information regarding earnings per share and unit computations.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Current Year\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we adopted ASU 2021-05 establishing Topic 842, Lessors - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments in conjunction with our ongoing operations. ASU 2021-05 requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable payments that do not depend on an index or rate as an operating lease  if  either  a  sales-type  lease  or  direct  financing  lease  classification  would  trigger  a  day-one  loss,  which  was  effective  for  us  on  January  1,  2022.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate  Reform  on  Financial  Reporting' ('ASU  2020-04'),  which  provides  optional  expedients  and  exceptions  for  applying  GAAP  to  contracts,  hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the",

The guidance was effective beginning March 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2024. In January 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-01 , 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope' ('ASU 2021-01'), which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance. In December 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2022-06, \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848\" (\"ASU 2022-06\"), which deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has an intended cessation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of USD LIBOR of June 30, 2023. We plan to adopt ASU 2020-04, ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2022-06 when LIBOR is discontinued. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Significant Transactions\n\n## Acquisitions and Investments\n\n- \u00b7 In January 2022, our Fort Lauderdale consolidated joint venture closed on the acquisition of three undeveloped land parcels located in downtown Fort Lauderdale, Florida for $49.0 million ($25.0 million at our 51% share), funded primarily by a $40.0 million loan ($20.4 million at our share). The cost was allocated among the parcels based on third-party appraisals. In the fourth quarter of 2022, this loan was paid down to $22.9 million ($11.7 million at our 51% share) with disposition proceeds from one of the three undeveloped land parcels.\n- At the time of acquisition, one land parcel was subject to a sales agreement, which closed in December 2022, for a gross sales price of $18.3 million. This land parcel was classified as a held for sale asset prior to the sale. See below Dispositions section for further details.\n- \u00b7 In  February  2022,  we  entered  into  a  short-term  cancellable  lease  of  and  a  purchase  agreement  to  acquire,  for  $100.0  million,  a  nine-acre development site in the Flagler Village neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The site has the potential for the development of approximately three million square feet of mixed-use property, which could contain up to 1,500 residential units at full build-out. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the $100.0 million purchase and capitalized an additional $5.9 million of costs to Land in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n- \u00b7 In December 2022, we closed on the acquisition of an undeveloped land parcel located in Aurora, Colorado for $1.8 million. This land is intended for the development of a multifamily property on the Anschutz Medical Campus. Capitalized costs of $0.2 million were recorded as of December 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7 During  2022,  we  made  an  additional  $14.2  million  payment  for  our  passive  equity  investment  in  IQHQ,  which  completed  our  total  capital commitment of $50.0 million. Based on certain facts and circumstances related to the investment, IQHQ was initially reported at cost. In June 2022, 22% of our original investment with a cost basis of $10.8 million was redeemed for $16.5 million and we recognized a $5.7 million gain. Concurrently, our remaining investment in IQHQ with a cost basis of $39.2 million was valued at an estimated fair market value of $59.7 million, and a $20.5 million unrealized gain was recognized.\n\n## Joint Venture Transactions\n\n- \u00b7 In  March  2022,  we  formed  a  joint  venture  for  the  construction  of  approximately  one  million  square  feet  of  mixed-use  development  in  the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami, Florida. We hold a 20% share of the joint venture (the 'Edgewater joint venture\"), which includes our initial contribution of an eighth of an acre of land that we purchased for $1.7 million in January 2022 and a cash contribution of $0.3 million. Our total capital commitment for this venture is $8.0 million. We will serve as the development manager for this venture.\n- \u00b7 In May 2022, we formed two joint ventures for a ground up project on the development of a phased multifamily community totaling 574 units at Strathmore Square in Bethesda, Maryland. We hold a 50% share of the general partner interest in these joint ventures. In December 2022, we were admitted as the sole limited partner in one of the two joint ventures (\"Strathmore Joint Venture 1\") and our funding commitments for both joint  ventures increased to $35.6 million with remaining unfunded commitments of $21.2 million as of December 31, 2022. We serve as codevelopment manager for these ventures.\n\n## Dispositions\n\n- \u00b7 In May 2022, we sold our Pathfinder Village property located in Fremont, California, for a gross sales price of $127.0 million and recognized a gain from the sale of $94.6 million. Pathfinder Village was a stabilized property previously reported within our Operating segment.",

The land parcel was purchased in January 2022 and reported as a held for sale asset prior to the sale.\n\n## Lease Arrangements\n\n- \u00b7 In September 2022, we as lessee, received final payment from AIR, pursuant to the lease termination agreement entered into in June 2022. The leases with respect to four properties were terminated, and we relinquished control of these properties. See Note 4 for further information.\n- \u00b7 In  December  2022,  in  conjunction  with  consolidation  of  the  Strathmore  Joint  Venture  1,  described  in  the Joint  Venture  Transactions section above, we recognized a 98-year ground lease for the land underlying the development site in Bethesda, Maryland.

We receive variable payments from our residents and commercial tenants primarily for utility reimbursements and other services.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our total lease income was comprised of the following amounts for all residential and commercial property leases (in thousands):\n\n|                       | Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                       | 2022                                |                                     |                                     |\n| Fixed lease income    | $ 176,080                           | $ 157,842                           | $ 140,140                           |\n| Variable lease income | 13,654                              | 11,487                              | 11,192                              |\n| Total lease income    | $ 189,734                           | $ 169,329                           | $ 151,332                           |\n\nIn general, our commercial leases have options to extend for a certain period of time at the tenant's option. Future minimum annual rental payments we will receive under commercial leases, excluding such extension options, are as follows as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\n\n| 2023       | 13,031   |\n|------------|----------|\n| 2024       | 9,212    |\n| 2025       | 5,728    |\n| 2026       | 3,430    |\n| 2027       | 1,546    |\n| Thereafter | 800      |\n| Total      | 33,747   |\n\nGenerally, our residential leases do not provide extension options, so the average remaining term is less than one year. Our commercial leases, as of December 31, 2022, have an average remaining term of 3.2 years.\n\n## Aimco as Lessee\n\n## Lease Arrangements with AIR\n\nWe as lessee, and AIR, as lessor, have entered into leases on properties currently under construction or in lease-up. These lease arrangements are governed by separate Master Lease Agreements and the Master Leasing Agreement .\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Master Leasing Agreement governed one finance lease for a 15-acre plot of land in the San Francisco Bay Area. This lease commenced on June 1, 2021, has a term of 25 years, and is governed by both a separate Master Lease Arrangement and this Master Leasing Agreement. In June 2021, we commenced construction of 16 single family rental homes and 8 accessory dwelling units on this land.",

        "page_content": "In June 2022, we as lessee and AIR as lessor, entered into a lease termination agreement with respect to four leases entered into on January 1, 2021 that pertained  to  our  North  Tower  of  Flamingo  Point,  707  Leahy,  The  Fremont,  and  Prism  properties.  This  agreement  terminated  these  four  finance  leases  on September 1, 2022. Upon termination, both parties were released of any and all liabilities and obligations under each respective lease other than those liabilities and  obligations,  if  any,  that  expressly  survived  termination.  On  September  1,  2022,  we  relinquished  control  of  the  leasehold  improvements  on  these  four properties as well as the underlying land. In exchange, AIR remitted a total of $200.0 million in consideration to us as termination payments.\n\nBecause the termination agreement modified the expiration date of each lease to September 1, 2022, we accelerated depreciation on the associated leasehold improvements using lease terms that ended September 1, 2022. We recorded $85.7 million of total depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, we recognized Lease modification income of $207.0 million, which is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## Ground Leases\n\nIn December 2022, in conjunction with consolidating the Strathmore Joint Venture 1, which was described in the Note 3 , we recognized a 98-year ground lease for the land underlying the development site, a ground up project on the development of a phased multifamily community totaling 220 units in Bethesda, Maryland, initially recording right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities of $15.0 million and $15.2 million, respectively.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into two 99-year ground leases for the land underlying the development site at Upton Place, a mixed-use  development  project  which  will  create  689  apartment  homes  and  approximately  100,000  square  feet  of  commercial  space  in  upper-northwest Washington,  D.C.,  initially  recording  right-of-use  lease  assets  and  lease  liabilities  of  $92.8  million  and  $86.3  million,  respectively.  Substantially  all  of  the payments under our ground leases are fixed. We exclude options to extend the leases from our minimum lease terms unless the options are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\n## Other Finance Lease Arrangements\n\nIn February 2022, we, as lessee, entered into certain finance lease arrangements concurrent with a purchase agreement to acquire a development site in the Flagler Village  neighborhood  of  Fort  Lauderdale,  Florida.  During  the  third  quarter  of  2022,  we  completed  the  $100.0  million  purchase  and  recognized  an additional $5.9 million of capitalized costs as Land in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 for further information.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our finance leases had weighted-average remaining terms of 94.2 years and 38.5 years, respectively, and weighted-average discount rates of 6.1% and 5.4%, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, finance lease right-of-use assets and liabilities totaled $110.3 million and $114.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, finance right-of-use lease assets and liabilities totaled $429.8 million and $435.1 million, respectively.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, amortization related to finance leases was $6.7 million, net of amounts capitalized, compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we capitalized $8.5 million of lease costs associated with active development and redevelopment projects on certain of the underlying property and ground lease assets, compared to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. No lease costs were capitalized on leased assets for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, interest expense net of amounts capitalized related to our finance leases was $7.5 million compared to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Operating Lease Arrangements\n\nWe have operating leases primarily for corporate office space. Substantially all of the payments under our office leases are fixed. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our operating leases had weighted-average remaining terms of 5.6 years and 7.4 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our operating leases had weighted-average discount rates of 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively.\n\nWe record operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Total operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $1.1 million, $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, operating lease right-of-use assets of $6.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, are included in Other assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, operating lease liabilities of $12.8 million and $12.7 million, respectively, are included in Accrued liabilities and other in  our Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to not separate these components for all classes of underlying assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . Leases with initial terms greater than 12 months are recorded as operating or financing leases in our Consolidated Balance Sheets .\n\n## Office Space Sublease\n\nWe have a sublease arrangement to provide space within our corporate office for fixed rents, which commenced on January 1, 2021 and expires on May 31, 2029. We sublease office space within our corporate office to AIR which is reflected in the sublease income below. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recognized sublease income from AIR of $1.4 million, $1.4 million, and $0.1 million, respectively.\n\n## Annual Future Minimum Lease Payments\n\nCombined minimum annual lease payments under operating and finance leases, and sublease income that offsets our operating lease rent, are as follows as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\n\n|                         | Sublease Income and  Lease Modification  Income   | Operating Lease Future  Minimum Rent   | Finance Leases Future  Minimum Payments   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| 2023                    | $ 1,403                                           | $ 1,999                                | $ 2,905                                   |\n| 2024                    | 1,413                                             | 2,298                                  | 3,921                                     |\n| 2025                    | 1,423                                             | 2,302                                  | 4,437                                     |\n| 2026                    | 1,433                                             | 2,341                                  | 4,954                                     |\n| 2027                    | 1,443                                             | 2,380                                  | 5,483                                     |\n| Thereafter              | 2,083                                             | 3,024                                  | 1,433,295                                 |\n| Total                   | $ 9,198                                           | $ 14,344                               | $ 1,454,995                               |\n| Less: Discount          |                                                   | (1,502 )                               | (1,340,370 )                              |\n| Total lease liabilities |                                                   | $ 12,842                               | $ 114,625                                 |\n\n## Note 5 - Agreements and Transactions with AIR\n\nIn conjunction with the Separation, we entered into various separation and transition services agreements with AIR that have significant operational and financial impacts to us.\n\n## Master Services Agreement\n\nUnder the Master Services Agreement with AIR, AIR provides us with customary administrative and support services. We are obligated to pay AIR the fully  burdened  costs  in  performing  the  services.  We  may  terminate  any  or  all  services  on  60  days  prior  written  notice,  and AIR  may  terminate  individual services, at any time after December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred administrative and support fees of $2.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively. We did not incur any fees during the year ended December 31, 2020. These administrative support fees are included in General and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Property Management Agreements\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreements with AIR, AIR provides us with certain property management, property accounting and related services for the majority of our operating properties. We pay AIR a property management fee for these services equal to 3% of each respective property's revenue collected and such other fees as may be mutually agreed for various other services. The initial term of each Property Management Agreement is one year, with automatic one-year renewal periods, unless either party elects to terminate at any time upon delivery of 60 days prior written notice to the other party before the end of the term. Neither party is obligated to pay to the other party a termination fee or other penalty upon such termination.\n\nDuring  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  we  recognized  property  management  and  property  accounting  fees  of  $5.3  million  and  $5.2 million, respectively. From Separation to December 31, 2020, we recorded property management and",

These  property  management  and  property  accounting  fees  are  included  in Property  operating  expenses in  our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Master Leasing Agreement\n\nThe Master Leasing Agreement, as amended on June 14, 2022, governs the current and any future leasing arrangements between us, as lessee, and AIR, as lessor. Under the amendments to the Master Leasing Agreement, AIR's purchase option to acquire completed development and redevelopment properties was replaced with a right of first offer on development and redevelopment assets that have achieved stabilization and that we choose to bring to market within one year thereafter. Each time the parties wish to execute a new lease for a particular property, they will execute a stand-alone lease.\n\n## Notes Payable to AIR\n\nIn July 2022, we completed the early repayment of the $534.1 million of Notes Payable to AIR, which was entered into in December 2020. As a result of the early repayment, we incurred $17.4 million of spread maintenance costs, which were included in Interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized interest expense on the Notes Payable to AIR of $13.7 million and $27.8 million, respectively.\n\n## Other\n\nIn June 2022, for $7.2 million, we acquired from AIR the common noncontrolling interest in the entity that indirectly holds a portfolio of assets that previously secured the Notes Payable to AIR.\n\n## Due to and from AIR\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have amounts due to and from AIR of $7.2 million and $1.7 million, which are included in Other assets and Accrued liabilities and other , respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had amounts due to and from AIR of $15.7 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The amounts due to AIR primarily consist of invoices paid on our behalf and other reimbursements owed to AIR. The amounts due from AIR primarily consist of net cash flows generated by our operating properties.\n\n## Terry Considine Service Agreement/AIR Reimbursement\n\nAs  contemplated  by  the  Separation  and  by Aimco  and AIR,  Terry  Considine,  an Aimco  board  member  and  our  former  Chief  Executive  Officer,  had specific responsibilities to us as a non-executive employee during 2021 and 2022 to support the establishment and growth of our business, reporting directly to the Board. These responsibilities, separate from Mr. Considine's services as a board member, which have also come to an end, included (i) short and long-term strategic direction and advice; (ii) transition and executive support to officers; and (iii) advice and consultation with respect to strategic growth and acquisition activities.  Mr.  Considine's  transition  services  to Aimco  have  been  completed. The  independent  directors  of  the  Board  set  Mr.  Considine's  2022  target  total compensation (including base compensation, short-term incentive, and long-term incentive) for these responsibilities at $1.8 million, to be paid in equity. Mr. Considine did not receive any additional compensation for serving on the Board in 2022.\n\nAdditionally, we are obligated for all base salary, short-term incentive amounts and long-term incentive amounts payable to Mr. Considine for the calendar year 2022 under the terms of his employment agreement with AIR that are in excess of $1.0 million, collectively.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $6.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively, of expense in the aggregate pursuant to these arrangements. This expense is included in General and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $4.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, is included in the amounts due to AIR.\n\nThese arrangements concluded as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, Mr. Considine resigned from serving as a member of the Board on February 13, 2023.\n\n## Expense Allocation\n\nIn  preparing  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  periods  prior  to  the  Separation,  certain  expenses,  including  property  operating  expenses, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses, incurred at the corporate level that are attributable to us have been allocated on a carveout basis. Expenses allocated for the years ended December 31, 2020 was $9.8 million. Depending on the nature of the expense, the allocation was based on our relative share of total gross potential revenue, and the relative gross asset value of our communities as compared to the total gross potential revenue and gross asset",

The  accounting  standards  for  the  consolidation  of  VIEs  require  qualitative  assessments  to  determine  whether  we  are  the  primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary analysis is based on power and economics. We conclude that we are the primary beneficiary and consolidate the VIE if we have both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly influence the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Significant judgments and assumptions related to the determinations include, but are not limited to, estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\n\nWe consolidate Aimco Operating Partnership, a VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary. Through Aimco Operating Partnership, we consolidate all VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary. Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are those of Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nAimco Operating Partnership is the primary beneficiary, and therefore consolidates its five VIEs that own interests in real estate. In addition, we have eight unconsolidated VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary because we are not their primary decision maker. The eight unconsolidated VIEs include four unconsolidated real estate partnerships that hold four apartment communities in San Diego, California, the Mezzanine Investment, our passive investment in IQHQ, our investment in the Edgewater joint venture, and our investments in one of the Strathmore joint ventures.\n\nThe  details  of  our  consolidated  and  unconsolidated  VIEs,  excluding  those  of Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  are  summarized  in  the  table  below  as  of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except for VIE count).\n\n|                                         | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                         | Consolidated              | Unconsolidated            | Consolidated              | Unconsolidated            |\n| Count of VIEs                           | 5                         | 8                         | 9                         | 6                         |\n| Assets                                  |                           |                           |                           |                           |\n| Real estate, net                        | $ 258,529     $           | -    $                    | 564,909     $             | -                         |\n| Mezzanine investment                    | -                         | 158,558                   | -                         | 337,797                   |\n| Right-of-use lease assets               | 110,269                   | -                         | 429,768                   | -                         |\n| Unconsolidated real estate partnerships | -                         | 15,789                    | -                         | 13,005                    |\n| Other assets, net                       | 36,345                    | 59,823                    | 43,715                    | 35,773                    |\n| Liabilities                             |                           |                           |                           |                           |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                | -                         | -                         | 124,747                   | -                         |\n| Accrued liabilities and other           | 26,003                    | -                         | 30,519                    | -                         |\n| Non-recourse property debt, net         | 22,689                    | -                         | -                         | -                         |\n| Construction loans, net                 | 40,013                    | -                         | 163,570                   | -                         |\n| Lease liabilities                       | 114,625                   | -                         | 435,093                   | -                         |\n\n## Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nThe changes in consolidated VIE assets and liabilities from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 in the table above are primarily due to the impact of:\n\n- (i) In December 2022, we were admitted as sole limited partner to Strathmore Joint Venture 1, and we remitted $6.4 million in funds to our co-GP as a partial return of their capital contributions to the joint venture. This remittance reduced their ownership percentage in the joint venture and increased our combined GP and LP ownership percentage to greater than 50%. As a result of this change in ownership, we became the primary beneficiary and consequently consolidated the joint venture. As of December 31, 2022, we had $51.4 million in assets and $28.5 million in liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . There was no gain or loss recognized upon consolidation.\n\n(ii) In September 2022, we as lessee received final payment from AIR as lessor, pursuant to the lease termination agreement entered into in June 2022. The leases with respect to four properties were terminated, and we relinquished control of the associated leasehold improvements and underlying land of these four properties. Consequently, we derecognized real estate assets of $86.6 million and paid off a $138.4 million construction loan, which was derecognized as well. In",

        "page_content": "addition, we derecognized right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities of $326.1 million and $337.3 million, respectively, due to the lease terminations described here and in Note 4.\n\n(iii)  In  February  2022,  we acquired all of the outstanding redeemable non-controlling interests in an entity reported as a consolidated VIE as of December 31, 2021. Consequently, the entity became wholly owned by us and is no longer a VIE. As a result, $416.2 million of Real estate, net and $124.7 million of Deferred tax liability are no longer presented in the table above.\n\n## Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nWe own an interest in four unconsolidated real estate partnerships that hold four apartment communities in San Diego, California. We also own investments in the Edgewater joint venture formed in March 2022 to develop a 2.8-acre site in Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, and a Strathmore joint venture formed in May 2022 to develop a ground-up phased multifamily community in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nOur investment balances of $15.8 million and $13.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, represent our maximum exposure to loss in these unconsolidated VIEs.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  2,  AIR  holds  a  mezzanine  loan  payable  by  the  partnership  that  owns  Parkmerced  Apartments,  of  which  it  is  not  the  primary beneficiary. Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, AIR is obligated to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that hold this interest to us upon receipt of applicable third-party consents. Our investment balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were $158.6 million and $337.8 million. The net carrying values reflect our indirect interest in the mezzanine notes receivable through our agreement with AIR and our maximum exposure to loss in this VIE.\n\n## Note 7 -Debt\n\n## Non-Recourse Property Debt\n\nWe finance apartment communities in our portfolio primarily using property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate debt.

The revolving loans (other than the swingline) will bear interest, at our option, at a per annum rate equal to (a) LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% or (b) a base rate plus a margin of 1.00%. Swingline loans made under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the base rate plus a margin of 1.00%. The base rate is defined as a fluctuating per annum rate of interest equal to the highest of (x) the overnight bank funding rate as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.5%, (y) PNC Bank, National Association's prime rate and (z) the daily LIBOR Rate plus 1.00%.

        "page_content": "Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 510,587,500 shares of Common Stock and we had 146,524,941 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## 2022 Stock Repurchases\n\nOur Board has, from time to time, authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding Common Stock. As of December 31, 2022, we were authorized to repurchase up to 12.3 million shares of our outstanding Common Stock, subject to certain customary limitations, which may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This  authorization  has  no  expiration  date.  During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  we  repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of our Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $7.21 per share.\n\nThere were no stock repurchases during the years ended December 31, 2021, or December 31, 2020.\n\n## 2022 Cash Dividend\n\nAs a REIT, Aimco is required to distribute annually to holders of shares of its Common Stock at least 90.0% of its 'real estate investment trust taxable income,' which, as defined by the Code and United States Department of Treasury regulations, is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income. Aimco's Board  determines  and  declares  Aimco's  dividends.  In  making  a  dividend  determination,  Aimco's  Board  considers  a  variety  of  factors,  including  REIT distribution  requirements,  current  market  conditions,  liquidity  needs,  and  other  uses  of  cash,  such  as  deleveraging  and  accretive  investment  activities.  On September 30, 2022, Aimco paid a special cash dividend of $0.02 per share to shareholders of record on September 14, 2022.\n\n## Separation from AIR\n\nOn December 15, 2020, we completed the Separation which was effected by way of a pro rata distribution, in which stockholders of Aimco received one share of Class A common stock of AIR for every one share of Class A common stock of Aimco held as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. AIR Operating Partnership also completed a pro rata distribution of all of the outstanding common OP units of Aimco Operating Partnership to holders of AIR Operating Partnership common OP units and AIR Operating Partnership Class I High Performance OP units as of the close of business on December 5, 2020.\n\nNotwithstanding  the  legal  form  of  the  Separation,  for  accounting  and  financial  reporting  purposes,  we  are  presented  as  being  spun-off  from  AIR. Therefore, we are the accounting spinee and AIR is considered the divesting entity and treated as the accounting spinnor, or accounting predecessor. Since the assets, liabilities and operations of Aimco prior to the Separation were spread across multiple legal entities, a separate capital structure did not exist.\n\n## Note 10 - Partners' Capital\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership Partners' Capital\n\n## Common Partnership Units\n\nIn Aimco Operating Partnership's Consolidated Balance Sheets ,  the OP Units held by us are classified within Partners' Capital as General Partner and Special Limited Partner capital and the OP Units held by entities other than us are classified within Limited Partners' capital. In our Consolidated Balance Sheets , the OP Units held by entities other than us are classified within permanent equity as Common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership .\n\nOP Units held  by  us  are  not  redeemable  whereas  OP  Units  held  by  interests  in Aimco  Operating  Partnership  other  than Aimco  are  redeemable  at  the holders' option, subject to certain restrictions, on the basis of one OP Unit for either one share of Common Stock or cash equal to the fair value of a share of Common Stock at the time of redemption. We have the option to deliver shares of Common Stock in exchange for all or any portion of such OP Units tendered for redemption. When a limited partner redeems an OP Unit for Common Stock, Limited Partners' capital is reduced, and the General Partner and Special Limited Partners' capital is increased.\n\nEntities other than us that hold OP Units receive distributions in an amount equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of Common Stock.\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  approximately  108,000  OP  Units,  which  were  redeemed  in  exchange  for  shares  of  Common  Stock,  and approximately 33,000  OP Units were redeemed in exchange for cash at an aggregate weighted average price per unit of $7.07.",

        "page_content": "## Separation from AIR\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Aimco Operating Partnership completed the Separation, which was effected, in part, through a pro rata distribution of all of the outstanding common limited partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership to holders of AIR Operating Partnership common limited partnership units and AIR Operating Partnership Class I High Performance partnership units as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. In addition, our stockholders received one share of Class A common stock of AIR for every one share of Class A common stock of Aimco held as of the close of business on the record date and received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Class A common stock of AIR.\n\n## Note 11 - Earnings and Dividends per Share and per Unit\n\nAimco and Aimco Operating Partnership calculate basic earnings per share of common stock and basic earnings per common unit based on the weightedaverage number of shares of Common Stock and common partnership units outstanding. We calculate diluted earnings per share of Common Stock and diluted earnings  per  unit  taking  into  consideration  dilutive  shares  of  Common  Stock  and  common  partnership  unit  equivalents  and  dilutive  convertible  securities outstanding during the period.\n\nThe shares of Common Stock and common partnership units outstanding at the Separation date are reflected as outstanding for all periods prior to the Separation for purposes of determining earnings per share and per unit. Each of our executives and AIR's executives received one unvested share of our stock and one unvested share of AIR stock at the Separation date for each unvested share they held at that date. We include AIR's executives' rights to receive Aimco shares upon vesting in our dilutive calculations.\n\nAimco's Common Stock and common partnership unit equivalents include options to purchase shares of Common Stock, which, if exercised, would result in our issuance of additional shares of Common Stock and Aimco Operating Partnership's issuance to us of additional common partnership units equal to the number of shares of Common Stock purchased under the options. These equivalents also include unvested performance-based restricted stock awards that do not meet the definition of participating securities, which would result in an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock and common partnership units outstanding equal to the number of the shares that vest. Common partnership unit equivalents also include unvested long-term incentive partnership units. We include in the denominator securities with dilutive effect in calculating diluted earnings per share and per unit during these periods.\n\nAimco's time-based restricted stock awards receive non-forfeitable dividends similar to shares of common stock and common partnership units prior to vesting, and our Performance-Based LTIP I units and Performance-Based LTIP II units receive non-forfeitable distributions based on specified percentages of the  distributions  paid  to  common  partnership  units  prior  to  vesting  and  conversion.  The  unvested  restricted  shares  and  units  related  to  these  awards  are participating  securities.  We  include  the  effect  of  participating  securities  in  basic  and  diluted  earnings  per  share  and  unit  computations  using  the  two-class method of allocating distributed and undistributed earnings when the two-class method is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. Participating securities are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share and unit for the year ended December 31, 2022, because the effect of their inclusion is dilutive. Participating securities are excluded from our computation of diluted loss per share and unit for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, because the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.",

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 21.4 million shares were available for issuance under the Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the '2015 Plan'). The total number of shares available for issuance under this plan may increase due to any forfeiture, cancellation, exchange, surrender, termination or expiration of an award outstanding under the 2015 Plan. Awards under the 2015 Plan may be in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, or other types of awards as authorized under the 2015 Plan. Our plans are administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into an agreement to modify all outstanding awards granted to the holders of such awards. Each outstanding time or performance based Aimco award was converted into one share of our Common Stock and one share of AIR common stock. Generally, all such Aimco equity awards retain the same terms and vesting conditions as the original Aimco equity awards immediately before the Separation.\n\nFollowing  the  Separation,  compensation  expense  related  to  these  modified  awards  for  the  employees  retained  by  us  is  incurred  by  Aimco.  The compensation expense related to these modified awards for employees of AIR is incurred by AIR.",

        "page_content": "For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, total compensation cost recognized for share-based awards was (in thousands):\n\n|                                          | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share-based compensation expense (1)     | 6,441  | 3,377  | 1,070  |\n| Capitalized share-based compensation (2) | 1,016  | 340    | 138    |\n| Total share-based compensation (3)       | 7,457  | 3,717  | 1,208  |\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our share of total unvested compensation cost not yet recognized was 13.5 million. We expect to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years.\n\nWe grant stock options and restricted stock awards that are subject to time-based vesting and require continuous employment, typically over a period of four to five years from the grant date, and we refer to these awards as Time-Based Stock Options and Time-Based Restricted Stock, respectively. We also grant stock options, restricted stock awards, and two forms of long-term incentive partnership units ('LTIP units'), that vest conditioned on our total shareholder return ('TSR'),  relative  to  identified  indices  over  a  forward-looking  performance  period  of  three  years.  We  refer  to  these  awards  as  TSR  Stock  Options,  TSR Restricted Stock, TSR LTIP I units, and TSR LTIP II units. Vested LTIP II units may be converted at the holders' option to LTIP Units for a conversion price over a term of 10 years. Earned TSR-based awards, if any, will generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant date, based on continued employment. Our Time-Based Stock Options and TSR Stock Options expire generally 10 years from the date of grant.\n\nWe recognize compensation cost associated with time-based awards ratably over the requisite service periods, which are typically three to four years. We recognize compensation cost related to the TSR-based awards, over the requisite service period, commencing on the grant date. The value of the TSR-based awards takes into consideration the probability that the market condition will be achieved; therefore, previously recorded compensation cost is not adjusted in the event that the market condition is not achieved, and awards do not vest.\n\nWe had Time-Based Stock Options, Time-Based Restricted Stock, TSR Stock Options, TSR Restricted Stock, TSR LTIP I units and TSR LTIP II units outstanding as of December 31, 2022.

Under this method, the prices of the indices and shares of our Common Stock were simulated through the end of the performance period. The correlation matrix between shares of our Common Stock and the indices, as well as the corresponding return volatilities, were developed based upon an analysis of historical data.\n\nThe following table includes the assumptions used for the valuation of TSR-based awards that were granted in 2022 and 2021.\n\n| TSR-based Award Assumptions                                           | 2022          | 2021         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Grant date market value of a common share                             | $6.96         | $6.66-$7.10  |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                               | 0.19%-1.38%   | 0.02%-1.22%  |\n| Dividend yield                                                        | 0%            | 0%           |\n| Expected volatility                                                   | 32.09%-33.04% | 30.4%-32.29% |\n| Derived vesting period of TSR Restricted Stock                        | 3.0           | 3.0          |\n| Weighted average expected term of TSR Stock Options and LTIP II units | 4.9           | 5.4          |\n\n## Note 13 - Fair Value Measurements\n\n## Recurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nFrom time to time, we purchase interest rate swaps, caps, and other instruments to provide protection against increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2022, we held interest rate swaps and caps with $2.0 billion notional value. These instruments were acquired for $17.7 million, and the fair value of these instruments is noted in the table below.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we monetized an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap for $16.8 million and recognized gains of $11.1 million, net of transaction costs, which are included in Realized and unrealized gain (losses) on interest rate options .\n\nOn a recurring basis, we measure at fair value our interest rate options, which are presented in Other assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our interest rate options are classified within Level 2 of the GAAP fair value hierarchy, and we estimate their fair value using pricing models that rely on observable market information, including contractual terms, market prices, and interest rate yield curves. The fair value adjustment is included in earnings in Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate options in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in fair value are reflected as a non-cash transaction in adjustments to arrive at cash flows from operations, and any upfront premium is reflected in Purchase of interest rate options in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had investments of $4.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively, in property technology funds consisting of entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry. These investments are measured at net asset",

See Note 14 for further information regarding unfunded commitments related to these investments.\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of our interest rate options and our investments in real estate technology funds as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\n\n|                                                  | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                  | Total                     | Level 1                   | Level 2                   | Level 3                   | Total                     | Level 1                   | Level 2                   | Level 3                   |\n| Interest rate options                            | $62,259                   | $-                        | $62,259                   | $-                        | $25,449                   | $-                        | $25,449                   | $-                        |\n| Investments in real estate technology funds  (1) | $4,296                    | $-                        | $-                        | $-                        | $9,613                    | $-                        | $-                        | $-                        |\n\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we tested the Mezzanine Investment for impairment given triggering events occurring in the fourth quarter of 2022 and we recorded  a  non-cash  impairment  charge  to  reduce  the  carrying  value  of  the  Mezzanine  Investment  to  $158.6  million.  Our  estimate  of  the  Mezzanine Investment's fair value was derived using internally developed models to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral, with significant weighting given to a third-party appraisal of the Parkmerced Apartments collateral. This appraisal incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being the capitalization rate and discount rate of 3.75% and 11.5%, respectively, market rental rates and operating expenses.  These assumptions are based on Level 3 inputs. See Note 2 for further details.\n\nImmediately  following  the  Separation,  we  tested  our  right  of  use  assets,  tenant  improvements,  furniture,  fixtures  and  equipment  and  our  internally developed software for impairment. We concluded that the estimated fair value of the related assets no longer exceeded their carrying values and recorded an aggregate impairment of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The fair value determination included assumptions based on Level 3 inputs. See Note 2 for further information. There were no such impairments in 2022 or 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Disclosures\n\nWe  believe  that  the  carrying  value  of  the  consolidated  amounts  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash,  accounts  receivables  and  payables approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, due to their relatively short-term nature and high probability of realization. We estimate the fair  value  of  our  debt  using  an  income  and  market  approach, including comparison of the contractual terms to observable and unobservable inputs such as market interest rate risk spreads, contractual interest rates, remaining periods to maturity, debt service coverage ratios, and loan to value ratios. We classify the fair value of our non-recourse property debt and construction loans within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy based on the significance of certain of the unobservable inputs used to estimate their fair value. The carrying amount of the Notes Payable to AIR, which were fully repaid in the third quarter of 2022, approximated their fair value at December 31, 2021.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  carrying  value  and  fair  value  of  our  non-recourse  property  debt,  construction  loans,  and  Notes  Payable  to AIR  as  of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\n\n|                            | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                            | Carrying Value            | Fair Value                | Carrying Value            | Fair Value                |\n| Non-recourse property debt | 938,476                   | $ 878,804                 | $ 484,883                 | $ 498,960                 |\n| Construction loans         | 126,317                   | 125,954                   | 168,376                   | 168,376                   |\n| Notes Payable to AIR       | -                         | -                         | 534,127                   | 534,127                   |\n| Total                      | 1,064,793                 | $ 1,004,758               | $ 1,187,386               | $ 1,201,463               |\n\n## Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Commitments\n\nIn connection with our development, redevelopment and other capital additions activities, we have entered into various construction-related contracts, and have made commitments to complete development and redevelopment of certain real estate, pursuant to financing or other arrangements. We have entered into contracts for $155.8 million, with $304.6 million undrawn on our construction loans as of December 31, 2022.",

The timing of the remaining funding of these commitments is uncertain.\n\nWe also enter into certain commitments for future purchases of goods and services in connection with the operations of our apartment communities. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.\n\n## Legal Matters\n\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings, incidental to the normal course of business. While the outcome of the legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe there are no legal proceedings pending that would have a material effect upon on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Note 15 - Business Segments\n\nWe have three segments: (i) Development and Redevelopment, (ii) Operating, and (iii) Other.\n\nOur Development and Redevelopment segment consists of properties that are under construction or have not achieved stabilization, as well as land held for development. Our Operating segment includes 21 residential apartment communities that have achieved stabilized level of operations as of January 1, 2021 and maintained it throughout the current year and comparable period. We aggregate all our apartment communities that have reached stabilization into our Operating segment. Our Other segment consists of properties that are not included in our Development and Redevelopment or Operating segments. During 2022, we disposed of two Seattle, Washington area properties and one stabilized property located in Fremont, CA that was previously reported within our Operating segment.  In  addition,  we  terminated  the  leases  for  four  residential  apartment  communities  that  were  previously  reported  within  our  Development  and Redevelopment segment. Prior period segment information has been recast based upon our current segment population, and is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") evaluates the business. The recast conforms with our reportable segment composition as of December 31, 2022.\n\nOur CODM uses cash flow, construction timeline to completion, and actual versus budgeted results to evaluate our properties in our Development and Redevelopment  segment.  Our  CODM  uses  proportionate  property  net  operating  income  to  assess  the  operating  performance  of  our  Operating  segment. Proportionate  property  net  operating  income  is  defined  as  our  share  of  rental  and  other  property  revenues,  excluding  reimbursements,  less  direct  property operating  expenses,  net  of  utility  reimbursements,  for  consolidated  communities.  In  our Consolidated Statements of Operations, utility  reimbursements  are included in Rental and other property revenues , in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Development and Redevelopment segment consists of 12 properties; three residential apartment communities with 1,185 planned apartment homes, a single family rental community with 16 planned homes plus eight accessory dwelling units, and one hotel, with 106 planned rooms, we are actively developing or redeveloping; and land parcels held for development. Our Operating segment includes 21 consolidated apartment communities with  5,582  apartment  homes.  Our  Other  segment  includes  our  Eldridge  Townhomes  apartment  community,  stabilized  but  not  owned  for  the  comparable reporting period, and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, our only office building.\n\nThe following tables present the results of operations of consolidated properties, with our segments reported on a proportionate basis for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (in thousands): Prior period carve out amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reconcile the difference between nonrecurring carve out accounting and current results as it relates to insurance",

As described in Note 4, we entered into termination agreements that cancelled our leases on North Tower of Flamingo Point, 707 Leahy, The Fremont, and Prism properties on September 1, 2022. Consequently, during 2022, we wrote off $326.1 million and $337.3 million of right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities, respectively.\n\n## Note 16 - Subsequent Events\n\nOn February 20, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell our Parkmerced mezzanine loan for $167.5 million. The closing of the sale is subject to a reasonable due diligence period and the satisfaction of certain conditions to closing including various approvals, and as such closing is not guaranteed.",
