        "page_content": "## Dear readers and friends of Symrise,\n\n  We /first published our regularly updated sustainability strategy 13 years ago and have since demonstrated that we can operate both sustainably and pro/fitably. In fact, we managed to increase sales in 2022 for the 17th year in a row. But just as important as our current situation is the need to keep our sights set on the future. It's essential to protect and preserve the foundation of our business, which is dependent on nature and its biodiversity. Our goals are clear: We plan to be climate-positive in 2030 and thus do our part to ensure sustainable business.\n\nThe basic element for that is the circular economy, which is also the focus of our stories in this year's Corporate Report. We have always made an e/ffort to utilize 100 % of our raw materials in various ways. We also use by-products, which are value-adding materials sourced from many processes that would otherwise be disposed of, including the oils from the peels left over from orange juice production as well as by-products of the paper industry, from which we produce fragrance ingredients. We also process eggs that are unsuitable for human consumption into important components for pet food.\n\nThis sustainable approach is applied to all of the processes and in recent years has also entailed diversi/fication of our business model, ensuring we're better able to withstand crises. By 2028, we plan to achieve half of our sales in business units that don't belong to our traditional /flavor and fragrance portfolio. In addition, we continue to rely on our extensive regional presence and customer base, which allows us to successfully respond to the major challenges of these years. Despite the war in Ukraine, raw material scarcity, delayed supply chains, a drastic increase in energy costs and high in/flation, we've again achieved an EBITDA margin 1 of 20 %.\n\nOur individual business units have performed very well in the highly volatile market environment. The demand for pet food has increased signi/ficantly once again, resulting in healthy, double-digit growth in our Pet Food division. As a result, we're expanding our capacities in China, North America, Brazil and France and, with the acquisition of Scha/ffelaarbos and Wing Pet Food, have ensured even more diversity and depth in the portfolio. The Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, to which pet food belongs, has also experienced healthy growth, due in part to the fact that sales have increased, for example, in the Food & Beverage division. People are doing more in their free time and eating out more often.\n\nWe've also signi/ficantly consolidated our range in the Scent & Care segment with the acquisition of companies Groupe N\u00e9roli and SFA Romani in southern France. The approximately 200 employees will be working closely with our Maison Lautier brand and our other fragrance experts, allowing us to leverage many synergies here. In recent years, sales have increased drastically here and in the Cosmetic Ingredients division.",

Dr. J\u00f6rn Andreas, who until recently was in charge of the Cosmetic Ingredients division at Symrise, will take over the Scent & Care segment, which was temporarily managed by Chief Executive O/fficer Dr. Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Bertram.

But we only have limited resources.\n\nFurthermore, the economy is global - and still it is marked by many regional and even local features in many respects. This is also due in great part to digitalization, which makes many aspects clearer and more individual and ensures greater speed - to which companies must adjust their processes.\n\nLast but not least, the preferences of consumers are also changing rapidly. There has not been a 'one-size-/fits-all' solution for quite some time now. People demand products that have the smallest possible impact on the environment and simultaneously have a positive e/ffect on all areas of life.\n\n## Our commitment How we think and act\n\nWe must work as a team along the entire value chain. That applies to us at Symrise, where we cooperate in a cross-business manner, work together to unlock potential and produce sustainably.\n\nAnd we do not di/fferentiate when it comes to our partners. We work together with our suppliers and partners on equal footing and based on trust in order to reach our common goals. In doing so, we keep our focus on people - the consumers. They tell us what they want and we deliver the best solutions.\n\nAnd we always act guided by the core of our business model: We want to sustainably ensure the protection of biological diversity.

For this reason, we have made sustainability an integral part of our corporate strategy at Symrise. The goal is to continuously increase the value of the company and to minimize risks. This way we strengthen the future viability of our company.\n\n  Symrise has set itself the goal of increasing its sales to an amount of \u20ac 5.5 billion to \u20ac 6.0 billion by 2025. At the same time, humanity is living beyond its means concerning the climate, environment and resource consumption - which is exacerbated by the fact that the global population surpassed 8 billion in November 2022. How does that /fit together? The only solution can be to decouple our economic activities from the consumption of limited resources, which is why we apply the principles of the circular economy to our portfolio of raw materials and products wherever possible. This entails the elimination of waste and environmental pollution, the circulation of nonrenewable resources in cycles and the sustainable extraction of renewable resources while simultaneously regenerating nature. Symrise applies the principles of the circular economy to each and every level of value creation, beginning with procurement, for which Symrise has developed a responsible sourcing strategy that encompasses all of the steps of the supply chain, takes environmental aspects into account and, more importantly, respects human rights.\n\nThe Symrise business model is based on the diversity of nature. We manufacture our approximately 35,000 products based on around 10,000 - mostly natural - raw materials such as vanilla, citrus products and /flower and plant materials. Nature is a source of inspiration and innovation for us. Symrise has therefore always been committed to protecting biodiversity. Going far beyond this, we aim to increase our sustainability performance along the entire value chain. In 2020, we set a milestone in our sustainability concept with the goal of having climate-positive operations starting in 2030. From this point forward, the business activities of Symrise are\n\nexpected to contribute to preventing or sequestering more greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere than we produce through our operating activities.\n\nThe integrated corporate strategy at Symrise is based on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and links our economic ambitions with the commitment to our four sustainability approaches:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnvironment / climate:\n\nMinimizing our environmental footprint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Innovation:\n\nMaximizing the environmental added value of our products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sourcing:\n\nMaximizing the sustainability of our supply chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployees / society:\n\nCreating lasting value for all stakeholders",

        "page_content": "Sustainability aspects play a role in the decision-making process across all levels and are a key factor with regard to the Executive Board's remuneration. Our routine materiality analysis carried out in summer 2022 consisted of expert interviews, an online employee survey and in-depth discussions with the management and is a con/firmation of this approach, as the issues of 'climate protection and climate change adaptation,' 'use of raw materials and the circular economy,' 'environmental protection and biodiversity' and 'procurement and human rights' are extremely important to Symrise. Please see the 'Sustainability & responsibility' chapter for additional information on this materiality analysis.\n\nIn economic terms, Symrise focuses on three drivers, i. e. growth, e/fficiency and portfolio. In order to gain market share, we aim to achieve above-average organic sales growth of 5 % to 7 % (CAGR). One strategy is early, committed involvement in rapidly emerging markets. For example, Symrise has been present in Brazil since 1956, in China since 1982 and in India since 1994. In addition, we want to further deepen the collaboration with our customers by bringing our broad product range to them in an even more targeted manner. Furthermore, we make sure that we remain innovation leaders in our core competencies. Symrise invested \u20ac 270 million in property, plant and equipment and in intangible /fixed assets (excluding acquisitions) in 2022 to reinforce its growth. In 2023, Symrise plans to implement projects in the\n\nUSA, China, Australia, Mexico and the Netherlands to expand the Pet Food business unit as well as establish a new liquid-/flavor production in Holzminden, expand production facilities in Spain and build a spray dryer for powder production in Mexico.\n\nThese measures to increase e/fficiency support our goal of becoming one of the most pro/fitable companies in the industry over the long term. They mainly concern the improvement of internal processes and optimization of the raw materials portfolio. When it comes to improving internal processes, the spectrum ranges from the Groupwide bundling of sourcing processes to warehousing and receivables management to the increased use of arti/ficial intelligence (AI) in research and development. Optimization of the raw materials portfolio involves reducing the number of raw materials used, improving yields, expanding the backward integration of strategic raw materials and also ensuring traceable, reliable and consistently high-quality supplies. Backward integration also enables long-term social commitment in regions where vanilla, citrus fruits and patchouli are grown, for example.\n\nWith our integrated corporate strategy, measures to increase e/fficiency often go hand in hand with an increased contribution to sustainability. E/fficient use of natural raw materials, for example, has a positive impact on both our pro/fitability and the environmental impacts of our activities.\n\n## THE INTEGRATED CORPORATE STRATEGY OF SYMRISE\n\nSustainability along the value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur activities along the value chain are connected to impacts and particular areas of in/fluence on speci/fic global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our corporate strategy is geared toward the SDGs especially relevant for Symrise (SDG 8, 13, 14, 15, 17).

Which of our products can achieve above-average margins thanks to our innovative strength and our expertise in sustainable product solutions? Which business areas outside the traditional fragrance and /flavor industry are opening up new growth potential? The third pillar of our integrated corporate strategy - continuous optimization of our business portfolio - addresses these questions. While the traditional /flavor and fragrance markets are growing very solidly at an average of 3 % to 4 % per year, the pet food market, for example, is expanding at an annual rate of 7 % to 8 %. Symrise was the /first company in the industry to begin moving into neighboring business areas years ago. Today, we generate more than 30 % of our sales in new divisions. We aim to increase this proportion to 50 % over the next few years, for growth and pro/fitability. This path of expansion is further reinforced by additional acquisitions and partnerships, including the purchase of Scha/ffelaarbos, a leading manufacturer of proteins sustainably sourced from eggs for pet food, and the acquisition of Wing Pet Food, which provides us with increased access to customers in the Asia / Paci/fic region.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScha/ffelaarbos is one of the leading producers of sustainably sourced proteins from eggs used in pet food.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE/fficient use of natural raw materials\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Making sustainability measurable\n\nThe European Union is introducing a new classi/fication system with the EU taxonomy that de/fines environmentally sustainable business activities. Starting in 2022, companies will have to demonstrate how they take account of two environmental targets in their production technologies or investments, and a total of six targets starting in 2023. This does not only pertain to environmental but also to social issues. Symrise is well prepared for the complete taxonomy.\n\n- 1. Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n- 3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. The transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nFurther environmental targets will follow in the coming years, as will a social taxonomy with targets in areas such as education and health. Only then all sustainability topics will be covered by the taxonomy, which Symrise summarizes under its pillars 'footprint,' 'sourcing,' 'inno vation' and 'care.'\n\n## Taxonomy eligible versus taxonomy aligned\n\nFor the taxonomy, companies must /first indicate whether they have taxonomy eligible economic activities. ' Taxonomy eligible' means that the activity potentially contributes most to the achievement of the six environmental targets. It must then be veri/fied whether these are actually taxonomy aligned - i. e., ecologically sustainable according to the criteria. To do this, they must comply with three central principles:\n\n  What does sustainability speci/fically mean in the context of economics - and what does it not? How can the company's own activities be assessed to determine which investments, for example in new plants or products, are sustainable? Companies have been asking these questions for some time. The EU taxonomy - the term represents a uniform classi/fication procedure - should be the answer. It is part of the 'European Green Deal,' which aims to make the EU the world's /first carbon-neutral economy by 2050. It aims to direct private and public investments so that they /finance the transformation to a sustainable economy.\n\nFor Symrise, the EU taxonomy is a good approach to this. 'With its precise de/finitions, it provides a speci/fic roadmap for how the European economy can become more sustainable,' says Bernhard Kott, Chief Sustainability O/fficer at Symrise. The development of the taxonomy is far from complete. So far, the EU has de/fined six overarching environmental targets, only the /first two of which have been given precise criteria:",

        "page_content": "- 1. Signi/ficant contribution: Companies must make a signi/ficant and measurable contribution to at least one of the environmental targets based on the speci/fic criteria.\n- 2. Do no signi/ficant harm: The 'Do no signi/ficant harm' principle (DNSH) applies to each target with regard to the /five others - climate change mitigation, for example, should not be ensured at the expense of species preservation.\n- 3. Minimum social standards: Before the social taxonomy is adopted, it should be ensured that the taxonomy eligible activities do not violate any minimum social standards - such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises or the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\n## In/fluence on Symrise\n\nThe EU taxonomy is burdensome for Symrise, but it /fits the company's activities. 'Transparency is a matter of course for Symrise,' says Head of Sustainability Bernhard Kott. 'We have been reporting on our sustainability performance for more than ten years in accordance with all relevant standards, which we see as a guideline and a learning /field.' Symrise therefore considers a uniform de/finition of the conditions under which economic activities are considered sustainable to be useful and helpful. 'For many years, experts have complained about the lack of clear de/finitions for sustainable action,' Kott says. 'The taxonomy now creates more comparability. Good sustainability performance becomes more visible and greenwashing more di/fficult. We also see these regulations as an opportunity for development.'\n\n## EU taxonomy integration and results\n\nThe regulation lists only those activities that can potentially make the greatest contribution to the six EU environmental targets. Symrise carries 2 % in taxonomy eligible sales or 8 % in taxonomy eligible capital expenditures in the books. However, this says little about the sustainability of the Group. 'We are more interested in the di/fference between taxonomy eligibility and alignment,' says Bernhard Kott: 'If it is small, this indicates a comparatively high degree of environmental compatibility in business and investment activities.' One reason why this di/fference tends to be small at Symrise is that the company relies on the ISO 14001 standard for its environmental management system and uses SMETA, an audit standard from the Sedex organization, to demonstrate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompliance with human rights, environment, health, occupational safety and business ethics requirements.\n\nIn the 2022 /fiscal year, approximately 2 % of annual sales and 3 % of operating expenses at Symrise were taxonomy eligible and aligned. Of the capital expenditures made (CapEx), 8 % were taxonomy eligible and 6 % were taxonomy aligned (for detailed information, see Sustainability Record 2022, p. 88 /ff.). They all supported environmental target 1, 'Climate change mitigation.' 'Based on our deep integration of taxonomy standards in all areas, we try to make our activities as sustainably measurable and transparent as possible. This will also be re/flected positively in the future,' Kott is certain. 'In particular, the environmental targets of 'Transition to a circular economy' and 'Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems' are highly relevant to us.'\n\n|                              | Taxonomy eligible  share   | Taxonomy aligned   share   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Sales                        | 2 %                        | 2 %                        |\n| Capital expenditure  (CapEx) | 8 %                        | 6 %                        |\n| Operating expenses   (OpEx)  | 3 %                        | 3 %                        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

To achieve this, we must design our processes so that they have as little impact on the environment as possible. We also live up to our social responsibility for employees and society. This is the only way our company can continue to be successful in the future.\n\n  Another year of crisis: That is probably the best way to describe 2022. Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine, rising in/flation and high energy prices, the still unresolved Covid-19 pandemic, volatility and uncertainty characterized the global economy. Despite all these challenges, we again achieved our goals in 2022. Our more than 12,000 employees around the world generated sales of \u20ac 4,618 million, an organic growth of 11.4 %. At 20 %, our EBITDA margin 1 is also within our target corridor. And, we are one of the most pro/fitable companies in the industry.\n\nWe also work very sustainably. We protect nature and its biodiversity worldwide by responsibly purchasing raw materials and processing them sustainably, increasingly using circular economy methods. This is how we simultaneously protect the foundations of our business. In all /five of our goal dimensions, we meet the requirements for non-/financial corporate reporting regulated by the CSR Directive Implementation Act (see the Sustainability & Responsibility chapter, on page 88 /ff. or www.symrise.com/sustainability).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\norganic sales growth generated by Symrise in 2022\n\nWe will achieve our long-term goals at all levels. The basis for this is our integrated corporate strategy. In 2025, we aim to achieve sales of \u20ac 5.5 billion to \u20ac 6.0 billion with annual growth of 5 % to 7 %. In doing so, we are constantly becoming more e/fficient and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to such an extent that we will be climate-positive as a company in 2030.",

How did Symrise overcome all of these challenges?\n\n  With sales of \u20ac 4,618 million, we achieved an EBITDA margin 1 of 20 % in a di/fficult environment. And what's equally important to us is the fact that we grew organically and at a faster pace than the competition, with a rate of 11.4 %. We're therefore approaching our medium-term goals with con/fidence: By 2025, we plan to achieve annual growth of 5 % to 7 %, with pro/fitability between 20 % and 23 %. By the end of the 2025 /fiscal year, we plan to generate sales of \u20ac 5.5 billion to \u20ac 6.0 billion.\n\nYou talk about growth as one of the three pillars of your strategy, the other two being portfolio and e/fficiency. What conditions are necessary to ensure healthy growth in the Group?\n\n  Let's take a look at the markets /first. For example, we increased our sales in emerging markets by more than 40 % as planned - our goal there is 50 %. We've also expanded our customer base as a whole without losing sight of our long-term goal. We plan to maintain our balanced portfolio that equally consists of global, regional and local customers, whom we serve from our 100 sites worldwide. New sales channels such as online retail, which is increasingly important, are interesting options for our customers and for us.\n\nNumerous acquisitions in recent years have contributed to growth at Symrise. Did you also acquire new business units in 2022?\n\n  We're always on the lookout for opportunities in fast-growing segments. While our growth last year was primarily organic, we invested in the right places, including /fine fragrances, which is experiencing double-digit growth again after the COVID-19 pandemic. We purchased two companies - Groupe N\u00e9roli and SFA Romani - in southern France near Grasse, the world capital of perfume production (see page 72). With a combined 200 employees, the two former competitors will operate under the shared name SFA N\u00e9roli in the future and will be able to leverage enormous synergies. They develop and produce fragrance compositions for customers around the world, from the /finest perfumes to household products, and jointly achieved sales of around \u20ac 40 million in 2022. In addition, we will combine their extraordinary knowhow with our revived Maison Lautier brand, for which we will be building a new factory just a few hundred meters away at the same site (see page 66).",

        "page_content": "Another pillar is the Symrise portfolio, which you have signi/ficantly expanded in recent years, particularly in terms of scope and beyond the traditional /flavor and fragrance business units. Have you already achieved your goals in this area?\n\n  In 2008, we achieved 10 % of our sales in new divisions. Now it's more than 30 %. We kicked o/ff this transformation process, which the entire industry is now following, with the purchase of Diana in 2015 and will continue to pursue this strategy. We plan to do more than 40 % of our business outside of the traditional areas by 2025. This will better prepare us for the future, as it will make us less dependent on individual business units as well as transform interdisciplinary collaboration in the Group into powerful synergies.\n\n## What measures are you taking to expand the portfolio?\n\n  For example, we acquired Dutch company Scha/ffelaarbos, which processes by-products from egg production into products for the pet food industry. These complement the portfolio of Nutrios, the nutrition brand of Symrise Pet Food (see page 58). This way, we've successfully expanded our areas of expertise and consolidated our leading position in the pet food industry, where we will continue to signi/ficantly expand our production and, over the medium-term, achieve sales of \u20ac 1.5 billion. For that reason, we also plan to grow in the /field of animal health, where our interest in the Swedencare company will come in handy.\n\n## Do you have such ambitious plans also in other areas of the portfolio?\n\n  We plan to further accelerate our sales growth in the Cosmetic Ingredients division, where we'll primarily bene/fit from innovations and expand our business model to include decorative cosmetics. And in terms of Consumer Health, we'll continue to research the microbiome - a collection of microorganisms that are di/fferent in each part of the body - in order to develop suitable pre-, pro- and postbiotics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Bertram is committed to the circular economy across the entire raw material and product portfolio. The CEO of Symrise wants to use raw materials as fully as possible in order to use natural resources e/fficiently.\n\nThe third pillar of your strategy is e/fficiency. How do you plan to improve Symrise in this area?\n\n  We purchase around 10,000 raw materials throughout all of the Group's divisions. We can improve e/fficiency signi/ficantly by optimizing procurement with an increase in cross-divisional thinking. At the same time, we plan to acquire our raw materials in accordance with the highest sustainability standards. This is an issue that goes far beyond high levels of quality, as biodiversity plays a key role throughout the entire process. We continue to promote backward integration and are working closely with partners throughout the value chain.",

        "page_content": "## Let's stick with the topic of e/fficiency for just a moment. Why did you add two new members to the Executive Board at the end of January?\n\n  Based on our size and our responsibilities, it was time to expand our Executive Board. For example, in addition to my work as Chief Executive O/fficer, I was temporarily in charge of the Scent & Care segment, which was always supposed to be a short-term solution. As the new Executive Board, we've now found a wonderful internal solution for this area. Dr. J\u00f6rn Andreas, who has a doctorate in economics and until recently managed the Cosmetic Ingredients division at Symrise, will take over. Dr. J\u00f6rn Andreas has held a wide range of management positions at the company and overseen numerous mergers & acquisitions as well as strategic initiatives. For the increasingly important, newly created Human Resources & Legal department, we've appointed experienced manager Stephanie Co\u00dfmann to the Executive Board. She has a doctorate in law and was most recently a member of the Board of Management and Head of HR at Lanxess AG.\n\nJust like time and sta/ff, raw materials are in short supply, which is what makes the circular economy all the more important. In fact, the current Corporate Report is entitled 'Creating resources with the circular economy.'\n\n## Why is there such a focus on this approach?\n\n  We can follow the principles of the circular economy throughout our entire portfolio of raw materials and products. There are so many raw material processes in which valuable materials go unused. But we want to use 100 % of raw materials wherever possible and thus use our natural resources much more e/fficiently, which will also allow us to avoid traditional recycling in many areas. Incidentally, these innovative concepts have always been part of our DNA. When chemists Wilhelm Haarmann and Ferdinand Tiemann /first produced synthetic vanillin from the sap of conifers in 1874, they used a raw material that no one else needed. Today, we'd describe that as value-adding upcycling. When Haarmann founded his company in 1875, he laid the foundation for the company now known as Symrise.\n\n\u00bb\n\n## Based on our size and our responsibilities, it was time to expand our Executive Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\n## How do you implement the circular economy today?\n\n  We use the principles of the circular economy in many areas - for example, with the aforementioned purchase of Scha/ffelaarbos in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment. We successfully implement similar business models there with by-products from meat production. Another example: Thanks to innovative methods, we can also use by-products from orange and sugar cane processing in the Scent & Care segment, resulting in many products that are renewable and biodegradable (see page 78). But it doesn't end there. As patented components, fragrance and ingredients o/ffer the bene/fit of making fragrance compositions unmistakable, thus protecting them from imitators.\n\n## So, sustainable processes are still a key component of your strategy?\n\n  Absolutely. Our approaches are sustainable in many areas of the Group and help us to continuously reduce our CO2 emissions. That will allow us to be climate-positive in energy supply and consumption by 2030 and climate-neutral throughout the supply chain by 2045 (see page 54). This way, we can continue our recipe for success, with sustainable business processes that bene/fit people and animals, the climate and the environment, while guaranteeing economic success.",

In addition to nature-identical L-menthol and L-carvone as well as a whole host of mint derivatives such as cooling substances, all of which come from backward-integrated production and have made Symrise a global leader in oral care, the company also uses natural mint oils. Sustainably cultivated and processed by partners in the USA, these natural mint oils provide a diverse range of taste pro/files. A visit to central Washington state provides insight into the mint industry.\n\nBIODIVERSITY AND INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  Extending for several hundred meters, the /fields are home to a dense network of small plants measuring just 40 to 50 centimeters in height. Though it does not look like much at /first glance, as you approach you see hundreds of bees buzzing in the green leaves and light-lilac blossoms - a paradise for insects. And it smells good too. Simply stroking the plants releases the fresh, intensive scent of chewing gum. Spearmint is cultivated on the /field near Royal City in Washington state and is used to /flavor popular brands of chewing gum and many other products.\n\nEssential oils are extracted from the di/fferent varieties of mint cultivated here and on hundreds of other /fields in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada and California in the northwestern US. Symrise incorporates these oils into a whole host of products, including desserts, cosmetics and, more importantly, oral care products. 'Natural mint can generate extensive diversity in taste,' says Arnold Machinek, turning over one of the leaves to reveal the small liquid bubbles that contain the oil. 'This raw material is truly fascinating,' the Symrise /flavorist explains. 'And here we can take a look at all of the varieties that are important to us, from spearmint and peppermint to wild mint.'\n\nThe experienced employee completed his chemical lab technician training in the late 1970s and has been with Symrise ever since. He is standing on the third /field he will be visiting today, having embarked on a tour of the northwestern US to meet with various suppliers. He visits farmers who cultivate mint as well as the companies that process it to produce valuable mint oils for Symrise. The experience out on the /field is important to him, as it allows him to better understand the product he works with on a daily basis. 'When it comes to essential oils, it's often an issue of o/ff-/flavors, which refers to the odors we want to keep out of the product,' says Arnold. They compromise the harmonious taste. Flavors like these often develop out on the /field, where despite the very best care other plants can grow alongside the mint, with their own essential oils /finding their way into the distillation process. Here in Royal City, Arnold is satis/fied. The raw material looks very good.\n\nHe is accompanied by Markus Diekmann, who is responsible for mint and a dozen other natural substances as a global buyer for Symrise. 'It's true of any raw material: You shouldn't be dependent on a single source,' says Markus. The two Symrise employees are visiting three of the company's",

'A visit like this is an important part of my work,' says the buyer. 'I need to see the companies and get to know the people - and I need to be able to understand how the technical processes work, from the /field to the lab and production.' Without that, Markus wouldn't have the insight he needs to expand the portfolio and negotiate prices.\n\nIt's a hot day, with the sun high in the sky. Je/ff Cochran explains to the two Symrise experts how mint cultivation works. The older of the two Cochran brothers also manages Jet Farms, whose /field the group is now looking at. He says that it takes a great deal of experience and knowledge to ensure proper, highquality harvests. When the time comes to plant a new /field, the farmers take rhizomes between 20 and 30 centimeters long from another new /field and cut them into small pieces. 'The mint puts down new roots, which provide plants for four to /five years,' says Je/ff. To ensure cultivation over the long term, the farmers employ crop rotation - for example, with potatoes or carrots. The /fields need to be free of mint for eight to ten years, which also prevents diseases. 'We swap cultivation areas with our neighbors to make that happen,' says Je/ff. For more than 40 years, he's been focusing on cultivating mint but also produces potatoes, beans and hay.\n\nTerry Cochran (center) shows Markus Diekmann (left) from Symrise the distillation process in the 'mint tub.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne harvest is possible in the /first year after planting, and two harvests in the years thereafter. It's not just about high yields. 'Cutting the plant twice lowers the concentration of menthofuran,' says Je/ff. The raw material then functions well in oral care applications. But if you cut the plant just once, the concentration of menthofuran increases. The mint oil extracted is better for desserts because it has a sweeter, earthier and oilier /flavor.\n\nThe plants have grown to a su/fficient size, and it has been dry as a bone for days, which means the harvest can begin today. First a machine is driven down the /field, cutting the plants and forming the clippings into long rows. After that, the mint is left out on the /field for two to three days, depending on the outside temperature. 'It has to dry out /first, otherwise we'd need much more heat for distillation,' explains Terry Cochran, manager of Norwest Ingredients, which he founded with his brother in 1998.\n\nMint is in their blood thanks to their father, who also cultivated the plant. 'Mint is something special. It doesn't need as much space as corn or wheat, but it does require a lot of knowledge, which also applies to processing,' says Terry. In the coming days, another machine will cut the plant parts on the /field into small pieces and load them into 'mint tubs,' which at /first glance look like conventional truck trailers, but are actually designed speci/fically to distill the mint right next to the /fields. Terry Cochran leads the group to a gravel area nearby, where there are a few tubs. 'We supply the distillation system with steam, which heats the plant parts for around one and a half hours,' he says, explaining the process. The steam extracts the essential oil from the plant, while subsequent condensation separates the water and oil. 'We use what's left over to increase sustainability,' says Terry. 'The farmers either spread it on the /fields as a soil nutrient or in some regions, it is added to cattle feed as a /fiber supplement.'",

All of the oils are analyzed in the lab of chemist and Head of Research David Beaver, who's well acquainted with the variations. He can even smell the slightest changes in the distillates, which he also examines with analysis instruments such as the gas chromatograph. 'The oils are often di/fferent. Soil, water supply and sunlight have a big impact,' says the 55-year-old, who has been with Norwest Ingredients for 16 years.\n\nHe works with the company's technicians to ensure consistent quality at all times. 'Our customers have very clear demands to ensure they receive their speci/fic mint oil that stands out from the competition.' He also works with universities to research mint plants. 'This could potentially allow us to achieve higher yields or increase plant resistance to fungus.' The company, which has Sedex and other certi/fications, is also always looking to improve its processes and thus increase the sustainability of its operations. One-third of the mint oils supplied by Norwest Ingredients is already FSA-veri/fied by the renowned Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) on a Gold and Silver level, a certi/fication that Symrise will soon expect of all its suppliers. The independent experts took a closer look at plant health, water and energy management, biodiversity and the working conditions on farms, among other things.\n\nChad Green/field, who is in charge of production at Norwest Ingredients, also vouches for the quality. He also believes that not all mint oils are the same. The 40-year-old chemist picks up two spearmint samples and smells them. 'The distillates have their very own properties, which we combine here into the mixes that our customers want.' Even Symrise has speci/fic demands for Norwest Ingredients, as these have an impact on products for its own customers. The level of quality and the taste need to be consistent at all times, so that the end products provide consumers with the same experience each and every time.\n\nArnold Machinek is satis/fied with what he sees - and smells. While mint varieties di/ffer signi/ficantly from each other in terms of their pro/file, even oils from the same variety can taste di/fferent, he says. 'It's much the same with wine. The same grape can produce very di/fferent wines depending on the growing location and processing method.' The concentration of menthofuran, for example, can make for a fuller /flavor, while\n\nother components increase the level of freshness, explains Arnold. That's also re/flected in the enormous diversity of the Symrise mint portfolio. 'Symrise purchases more than a dozen di/fferent mint oils,' says Markus Diekmann. The company o/ffers around 2,000 mint recipes. 'That's why we need the entire range of mint /flavors, from the essential natureidentical to the natural specialties like those sourced from this /field here in the USA,' adds Arnold Machinek.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00bb\n\n## The distillates have their very own properties, which we combine here into the mixes.\n\n\u00ab\n\nChad Green/field,\n\nProduction Manager Norwest Ingredients",

The pharmaceutical industry also uses menthol in a range of medications to cool, promote blood circulation and relieve pain.\n\nSymrise extracts menthol using a process that the company developed itself nearly 50 years ago and that separates L-menthol from d-menthol in the last stage of enhancement, beginning with the raw material thymol. Chemically speaking, L-menthol corresponds almost entirely to the oil of mentha arvensis - wild mint - and can be used in the same way.\n\nAt di/fferent points during the procedure, which no longer produces wastewater, intermediate products such as d-menthol are returned to the process. This form of the circular economy improves the yield and reduces the amount of waste products. Menthol is one of the most important individual products in the Symrise portfolio and is manufactured in Holzminden, Germany, and Bushy Park, USA, where the crystallization process that ultimately gives the menthol its form is now solvent-free. In addition, a combined heat and power plant in Bushy Park has reduced carbon emissions by 800 to 1,000 tons a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1 % - 1.5 %\n\nmint /flavor is present in a toothpaste.\n\n49",

In addition to taste and appearance, the /flower gives the tea other characteristics: It is also said to lower blood pressure, has a high vitamin C content and is often used in popular medicine for colds or circulatory problems. Now this mallow plant, of which there are several hundred species, is no longer used only in tea. Especially in Europe, consumers enjoy foods and beverages containing hibiscus, which has been named one of the ten most important food trends for 2022, such as in dairy products, baked goods, chocolate confectionery, sauces and, above all, innovative beverages.\n\nThe raw material has long played an important role for Symrise. Originally from Asia, hibiscus now grows around the world in tropical and subtropical regions. The company sources hibiscus from the Aswan region of Egypt, where it has worked with partner El Mahaba for more than 25 years. 'Thanks to the long-stand ing cooperation, we have direct access to raw materials and can obtain them permanently, reliably and in high quality,' says Rania Elmy, senior purchasing manager.\n\nNow the Group has taken another important step with the supplier. Symrise is the /first company in the industry to purchase hibiscus that has been veri/fied at Gold level of SAI-FSA (Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform - Farm Sustainability Assessment). Behind the SAI Platform is an association of many large companies and organizations working together for better agriculture. To retain the veri/fication, growers are evaluated by independent third parties every year.\n\nSymrise is closely working with El Mahaba to strengthen a network of farmers. In order to achieve this, it promotes sustainable agricultural practices in the cultivation and processing of raw materials. 'Our focus is on working conditions and the sustainable use of water and soil. In addition, we work in our facilities to reduce water usage.' says Wassim Salib, GMP Manager at Symrise Egypt. 'By conserving resources, we also contribute to climate protection.' Hibiscus cultivation is therefore another building block in the company's goal of sourcing all strategic biological raw materials exclusively sustainably by 2025.\n\n\u00bb\n\nOur focus is on working conditions and the sustainable use of water and soil.

One alternative is SymMollient \u00ae S green, a saturated wax ester of sustainably sourced nonanoic acid and cetearyl alcohol that feels much like silicone derivatives. This ingredient melts at skin temperature and produces a silky, non-greasy feeling on the skin. It can also be used in creams that are meant to provide the skin with moisture: SymMollient \u00ae S green demonstrably increases the moisture content in vivo.\n\nAnother important application is in sun protection products.

Therefore, it's important for us to look after the climate and biodiversity from an economic perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\nDr. Helmut Frieden, VP Corporate Sustainability\n\nSymrise bundles its global climate activities in the company headquarters in Germany. At the same time, many activities take place at all sites around the world. In Holzminden, a management group exists solely to determine how the company can reduce its CO2 output at the two plants there. For example, 25,000 tons of CO2 are expected to be saved every year by changing procedures for the disposal and reprocessing of by-products. Reforestation projects in Brazil neutralize more than 12,000 tons of CO2, thus compensating for emissions related to suppliers' packaging. These and other projects will be implemented across the Group starting in late April 2023.\n\n  When Symrise /first published a climate strategy some twelve years ago, it sounded very ambitious: By 2020, the Group wanted to position itself so as to reduce its carbon emissions by 33 %. Symrise achieved this target back in 2016. One year later, the company formulated new, even more ambitious objectives: Symrise became the /first company in the industry to focus on science-based targets. These targets, which are consistent with the latest climate science, create a scienti/fic basis for the minimization of global warming in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. 'We renewed our plans to a highly ambitious level once again in February 2022 and had them certi/fied by the Science Based Targets initiative,' explains Dr. Helmut Frieden, VP Corporate Sustainability at Symrise. Regarding Scope 1 and 2 emissions, Symrise is focused on reaching the target of less than 1.5 degrees. Scope 1 includes all emissions that are directly generated by production, and Scope 2 refers to the emissions generated through the procurement of energy. Greenhouse gases in the upstream and downstream supply chain are referred to as Scope 3 emissions. This includes the procurement of raw materials, transportation, business trips and waste disposal. Here, the company is pursuing the 2-degree target. 'In terms of Scope 1 and 2, we aim to be climate-positive starting in 2030. We will thus help sequester more greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere than we generate through our business activities. For Scope 3, we want to cut emissions by 30 %,' says Dr. Frieden. Ultimately, climate protection is also important for the Symrise business model: \" More than 80 % of our raw materials come from natural sources. Therefore, it's important for us to look after the climate and biodiversity from an economic perspective.'\n\nZ",

This roadmap is based on three essential pillars: We map greenhouse gases and introduce action plans to reduce emissions at industrial facilities, calculate the carbon footprint of products and opt for an eco-design of /finished goods with the involvement of our suppliers,' explains Marie Le Hena/ff, the segment's Sustainability Director.\n\nGiven that Symrise is growing in the area of pet food in particular, all new plants since 2020 have been built according to the LEED or BREEAM recognized standards. 'These standards are good levers to generate up to one-third fewer CO2 emissions than a conventional building,' says Thierry Lenice, who oversees the transition to sustainable operations as Low Carbon Transition Manager. In the past two years, Symrise has built new plants in Colombia, China and Brazil based on LEED / BREEAM standards.\n\nAt the same time, Symrise is upgrading older production sites by introducing low-carbon action plans to help reduce emissions. At the Naturals Business Unit within the Food & Beverage division, more than 3,000 tons of greenhouse gases will be saved yearly from 2020 to 2023. This is thanks to the switch from gas to wood for its boilers, optimization of refrigeration facilities and improved heat recovery.

These dried egg products contain valuable proteins and fats that promote growth as well as certain bioactive compounds which have a positive e/ffect on the health of animals. The company's approximately 50 employees have developed a functioning circular economy that processes sustainably used raw materials to create further value. The products complement the portfolio of Nutrios, the nutrition brand of Symrise Pet Food.\n\nINNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Chickens lay eggs on a daily basis at large hatcheries, with the hatched chicks sold to farmers as laying hens. However, there is a degree of unpredictability for the facilities, as 10 % to 15 % of the tens of thousands of eggs produced there do not contain an embryo and are therefore considered as side streams. The hatcheries that provide chickens for meat cannot use the unfertilized eggs either. This is where Scha/ffelaarbos comes into play. The Dutch company uses the eggs to obtain valuable ingredients for animal feed, among other things.\n\nSymrise purchased the company based in Barneveld, Netherlands, in 2022. It was established as a chicken hatchery in 1953 and has been active in the egg protein market for around 40 years. The com pany is a good /fit for the Group's pet food portfolio and, like many other Symrise business units, promotes the circular economy: For instance, the eggs that Schaffelaarbos uses are not approved for human consumption, but rather than being disposed of, they are processed as a by-product using a sophisticated technique.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales and marketing manager Ren\u00e9 Valks demonstrates how that works in the plant's sparkling clean halls around 20 kilometers east of the city of Amersfoort. Hundreds of thousands of eggs are processed here every day. 'We purchase them from more than 100 suppliers at various locations, from England, Scandinavia and Italy to Hungary, Poland and the Netherlands,' says Ren\u00e9 Valks standing in front of a row of silver 1,000-liter tanks containing around 18,000 broken eggs. The supplier immediately conserves and refrigerates them to keep them fresh, as microbiological processes would otherwise start and the eggs could spoil.\n\nA press at the Scha/ffelaarbos factory separates the shells from liquid egg - the yolk and egg white. Ren\u00e9 Valks demonstrates the di/fferent processing methods passing through a plant with almost no one inside. Of the 50 employees, around half of whom are drivers, only a few are at the production facility on a daily basis, as the processes are almost entirely automated. The evaporator heats the liquid eggs to the point where they lose about 40 % of their water content.

'Eggs are made up of very di/fferent components that can have a big impact on animal feed for example, for pets such as cats and dogs,' she says. For example, the yolk contains immunoglobins, which are e/ffective against disease-causing bacteria like salmonella and E. coli, as well as cholesterol, which helps young animals during their growth phase. The egg white, on the other hand, is full of the ovotransferrin protein and the lysozyme enzyme, which also promote animal health.\n\nThe logo of the Symrise pet food nutrition brand, Nutrios, is visible on the sacks. Intensive collaboration forms the foundation for the brand, says Nienke Bosma.

The company, which is set to grow in 2023, supplies around 80 pet food manufacturers primarily in Europe, with a /fifth of all production going to Asia mainly Thailand and Japan. Customers use Scha/ffelaarbos products in hundreds - if not thousands - of end products, Ren\u00e9 Valks informs. 'We supply egg proteins, which account for one to /five and sometimes even 30 % of a food mix.' The market is continuously expanding, and Scha/ffelaarbos bene/fits from several trends. With the global population growing, more and more people have pets and want them to have the best nutrition. The number of vegetarians is also on the rise worldwide, many of whom want to feed their cats and dogs without meat and /fish products. 'Our products with egg o/ffer a good protein alternative that's also 100 % natural and can feature a clean label,' Ren\u00e9 Valks says.\n\nAnimal welfare also plays an increasingly important role when it comes to raw materials. Take for instance hatcheries for laying hens, which cannot sell male chicks for obvious reasons. While these day-old chicks were often simply killed in the past, this can now be prevented with modern diagnostic methods. 'A variety of technologies are used to determine the sex of the embryo between 9 and 13 days,' explains Nienke Bosma. 'The 'male' eggs are removed, and we can process them into high quality protein ingredients for pets, too.' With research gaining ground, soon it will be possible to determine the sex of embryos even earlier - after three days.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNutrios is the Symrise brand for the pet food portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScha/ffelaarbos therefore helps to improve animal welfare, increasing its basis of raw materials in the process. The company is also working in a consortium with universities, other processing companies, suppliers and customers to update the classi/fication of raw materials. For example, current regulations prohibit the use of the remaining shells when chicks are hatched at hatcheries. 'We would like to develop a safe value chain for by-products with nutritionalphysiological potential, with the guarantee that these do not pose any risks to animal health,' says Nienke Bosma. 'Then we'll be better able to evaluate them, eliminate high disposal costs for the hatcheries and establish a complete circular economy in our supply chain model.'\n\nIn another project, Scha/ffelaarbos is attempting to extract the lysozyme enzyme from a special egg white by-product that can have a positive impact on animal health. 'As a natural antibiotic, the enzyme can kill certain bacteria,' explains Nienke Bosma, who works with the Dutch company Bioseutica on the state-funded research. She makes it clear that other Symrise brands can also bene/fit from this project. 'We learn and bene/fit from each other in many areas.'",

However, prices have fallen for the fruit of the coconut palm in recent years, which has resulted in continuously decreasing income for the farmers and their families a situation further exacerbated by a lack of modern cultivation and harvest technology and indirect access to the market.\n\nFor this reason, we launched a develoPPP-project with Symrise and GIZ in 2020 that is dedicated to protecting nature and biodiversity and to improving living conditions in the small farming communities. This project will run for an initial period of four years. In addition to working with local quali/fied partners to provide training courses on safe work practices, farm management and crop diversi/fication, we also pursue innovative paths to promote sustainable farming over the long term that bene/fits people. Initial success is already visible. In fact, farmers are cultivating coconuts as well as fast-growing vegetables like eggplants, broad beans and chili peppers on three demonstration farms in an e/ffort to eliminate dependence on a single fruit. In addition to helping 500 coconut farmers increase their income by an average of 15 % and their annual yield by 20 % by 2024, we also plan to improve access to water and sanitary facilities, thereby boosting overall living conditions and strengthening communities.",

As a result, we've been collaborating with many strong partners for years to improve living and working conditions for farmers and their communities in accordance with the United Nations' 17th Sustainable Development Goal. This goal describes sustainable operations with strong partners that bene/fit farmers in developing regions in particular.\n\nFor this reason, we work closely in many areas with the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, an experienced partner in international development cooperation. Together we implement various projects within the framework of the Public Private Partnership-Programme (develoPPP programme), a funding scheme with which the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) supports sustainable company initiatives in developing and emerging countries. One area of focus is the 'Bridging the Gap' activities - sustainable development partnerships between suppliers, farmers, Symrise and our customers. In doing so, we create sustainable, resilient agricultural and nutrition systems, support the farmers in our supply chains - including small and very small-scale farmers and enable them to generate income for their families. We are committed to all farmers who participate in our programs, no matter how small their operations are - and we can only do this by working together with our partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSOPHIE GRUNZE,\n\nPROJECT MANAGER FOR THE DEVELOPPP PROGRAMME AT THE DEUTSCHE GESELLSCHAFT F\u00dcR INTERNATIONALE ZUSAMMENARBEIT (GIZ) GMBH\n\n  We have worked in a spirit of mutual trust with Symrise since 2010. Our partnership began in Madagascar. Funded through the develoPPP programme that GIZ implements on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, we helped 500 farmers improve their living conditions and increase their incomes.\n\nSince then, we have continued to work together to launch new projects in Madagascar, which have by now bene/fited over 7,000 farmers. We train them in sustainable agricultural cultivation methods as well as business and /financial management and how to diversify their income. For this purpose, we have worked with Symrise and Unilever to support village communities in Madagascar since 2013. In addition, we entered into partnerships with national and international NGOs, as for example Save The Children, to complete our holistic approach.\n\nBesides addressing sustainable agricultural practices, the partners established a local health insurance and work on children rights and vocational training for youth. In this way, we are helping to increase the resilience for the future of the communities.\n\nIncidentally, Madagascar is representative of a whole series of other projects in collaboration with Symrise which support farmers and their families in Brazil, India and the Philippines.

The scent of the centifolia - the rose variety planted here - gives you some idea of the e/ffect when the entire 2.3-hectare /field is in full bloom. The rose has a strong, slightly sweet fragrance and is more at home in the region surrounding Grasse than just about any other plant. The married couple began cultivating roses in 2021 here in the global center of fragrance production where perfumes have been produced since the 16th century.\n\nAlbin Coulomb, now 36 years of age, completed farmer training when he was younger and then, just like his wife, worked in other areas. Now, the parents of three are interested in pursuing a career in the sector in which Albin Coulomb's grandfather and great-grandfather once supplied Grasse's fragrance industry with raw materials. 'We can o/ffer a wonderful, traditional product which makes cultivation all the more exciting,' says the farmer, who also grows jasmine in a large garden next to his house. These two plants have been basic materials in perfumery for centuries, as their oils fetch high prices and are used in countless perfumes. Floriane and Albin Coulomb have invested a great deal of time into their new career in an e/ffort to produce the best products, and will be planting a total of 12,000 new rosebushes over the next two years. They plow everything that grows in the vicinity to fertilize the soil, and then harvest around half a kilogram of /flowers per bush. No pesticides are used because the entire /field is certi/fied organic.\n\nCamille Quintin is eager to hear about the progress made on the couple's /field. As a manager, he is responsible for the entire supply chain that Symrise is currently developing under the renowned Maison Lautier brand, which the company has had in its portfolio for more than 20 years and never used. That is about to change, now that Symrise is breathing new life into the two-century tradition of fragrance production. The roses grown in the /field that Camille Quintin is visiting today will play a role in this change. 'We want to develop long-term partnerships with local farmers and thus also promote the diversity in /flowers and plants in our region,' says the manager.\n\nThe raw materials sourced from the region are one of the foundations for the new plant that the Group will be building for Maison Lautier in the years to come at a location just 30 minutes from the Coulombs' /field of roses. There, near the commune of SaintC\u00e9zaire-sur-Siagne, Symrise will manufacture extraordinary products - fragrance ingredients made exclusively from natural materials - which will form the 'Artisan' product line by Maison Lautier (see box on page 71). In the future, the company will market around 50 fragrance ingredients under this brand.\n\nIn the Maision Lautier laboratory, Dominique Maubant (in the background) works with an intern to develop fragrances from natural raw materials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This diversity is also re/flected in the raw materials such as resins from Somalia and raw materials from Madagascar. At the same time, Maison Lautier is picking up on a trend that has captured the entire industry. 'Customers set great store by regionally-produced fragrance ingredients, which also applies to France where there are traditionally many perfume manufacturers,' Camille Quintin says.

Business /flourished for hundreds of years and, in the 19th century, culminated in the Maison Lautier brand, one of the most popular brands in the fragrance industry. Symrise has now revived and revamped the brand, with a location near Grasse and with a high-quality basis of raw materials from all over the world, developed in close contact with growers.\n\nThe new brand now has three product lines. Based in Grasse, the Artisan line uses plants and /flowers that are cultivated primarily in the region, but also around the world, as raw materials. For its Madagascar line, Symrise uses its close connections to the African island, which are rooted in its 15-year procurement of the raw material vanilla. The value chain is backward-integrated, from the plant to the essential oil. Symrise therefore assumes responsibility for upstream production steps, working closely with local small-scale farmers who bene/fit on many levels, from education and health care to the development of sustainable, successful agriculture.\n\nThe Supernature line combines the best raw materials that nature has to o/ffer with process innovations, using groundbreaking procurement and processing techniques as well as upcycling to acquire materials from by-products in food production, for example. Symrise introduced its /first collection with raw materials from all three lines in summer 2022 at the World Perfumery Congress in Miami, Florida. This included vanilla, geranium and mandarin orange from Madagascar, strawberry, apple and cranberry from the Supernature series, and iris, sandalwood, jasmine and boya for the Artisan line.",

You simply have to cross two streets to get to the o/ffice of Yann Mabille, the former Managing Director of SFA Romani who now manages the new company's sales for the regions of Africa, North and South America as well as parts of Europe. He has had many meetings with his old and new colleagues and knows how and where the former competitors complement each other especially well.\n\nOne example is their markets. Though both companies served the whole world, they each had their areas of focus. While Groupe N\u00e9roli was very active in the Middle East and Africa, SFA Romani had many customers in Central America and especially strong roots in Italy, home to the company founders who ultimately made the brand the strongest in the country. There are also big di/fferences in the number of customers. 'At SFA Romani, we worked with 400 to 500 companies, while our Groupe N\u00e9roli colleagues had a more selective list of customers,' Yann says.\n\nThe two companies will work closely together in the future when it comes to raw materials. 'We've had perfumers from both companies analyze the portfolio,' Gabriel Ramos informs. Like Yann Mabille, he is respon sible for sales, but in Asia and the Middle East, which are the areas his colleague does not cover. They and other sta/ff form the team that should bring the former competitors closer together. 'When it comes to purchasing, we'll rely on the same raw material suppliers wherever possible. At the same time, we'll allow the employees to use the specialties they need for their compositions,' Gabriel Ramos says.\n\nSFA Romani primarily served niche markets that prioritize quality and creativity, with /fine fragrances accounting for 80 % of its sales. 'We were never willing to compromise,' says Yann Mabille, describing their approach. To reach customers, the company developed a sales network in 80 countries around the world. So even though it was a comparably small company, it began appearing at international trade shows early on. Groupe N\u00e9roli, on the other hand, specialized in larger volumes. What set the company apart were its very short reaction times to customer requests.

The fragrance was developed by Symrise Senior Perfumer Ali\u00e9nor Massenet, who intentionally built the wasabi note around the Spicatanate \u00ae compound. As odd as it may sound, the scent in its pure form is reminiscent not only of spearmint (Mentha spicata L., which is where the name comes from), but also of garlic and onion. But that is precisely what makes it so strong. Combined with other substances, it provides compositions with depth, freshness and fruitiness - and, in this case, the spiciness of wasabi. Spicatanate \u00ae also has an extraordinary origin story. The compound was developed using by-products of the orange juice industry more speci/fically, the peel of the fruit. Despite a concentration of just 0.001 % in the perfume oil, it still manages to make quite a statement.\n\nCompounds like Spicatanate \u00ae are referred to as captives in the technical world and are extremely important to Symrise. 'Most of the fragrance ingredients we sell to our customers in our formulations are commodity products. The components are no secret. Anyone could use them and purchase the compounds on the market or even produce them themself,'\n\nZ",

        "page_content": "Sarah Maria Kollenberg explains. Captives, on the other hand, are fragrance ingredients developed and patented by Symrise, which means Symrise is the only company that can use them for a period of 20 years. 'Perfumes that we develop entirely inhouse are protected if they contain a note based on a captive that is speci/fic to Symrise and cannot simply be recreated with other combinations,' Sarah Maria Kollenberg, Director New Ingredients Management, says. She oversees and optimizes the processes and promotes valuation of the compounds in the Group.\n\nSome of the captives are exceptionally e/fficient and used in the per mill range to enhance scents, while others may serve as a /filler to add volume and account for 10 % to 20 % of the mix. Unlike essential oils sourced from nature, captives are pure substances that are, wherever possible, derived from the by-products of other industries using complex processes based on the principles of green chemistry. Spicatanate \u00ae , for example, comes from D-limonene, a waste product of orange juice production. Pearadise \u00ae , which smells like pear, was developed from the by-products of corn fermentation. And raw sulfate turpentine oil, which occurs as a natural component of pine during the paper production process, is the base material for a new Symrise compound nearly at the end of its development stage. With its resinous, herbal and green scent, it adds another facet to the Symrise portfolio of sustainable captives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n50 % captives in 50 % of all fragrance\n\nSymrise uses compositions.\n\nDr. Nikolas Bugdahn leads the synthesis laboratories at Symrise, where the captives are created.\n\nCaptives are developed on a variety of foundations that are traditional at Symrise. 'Just as it was at the beginning of our company history, it's often an issue of identifying alternatives to expensive or rare ingredients,' Dr. Nikolaus Bugdahn says, referring to the development of vanillin, which has acquainted many people with the /flavor of vanilla for the /first time. Research is also inspired by the technologies used by Symrise, Dr. Bugdahn adds. He oversees the synthesis labs in which captives are produced. 'In Jacksonville, for example, we use by-products from the paper industry, in which we /find components that are attractive to perfumers,' adds head of the lab Dr. Philip Kraft, referencing aspects of the circular economy. In this way, seemingly worthless waste can be transformed into valuable products. Captives can also spark trends in the perfumery sector by replacing nonbiodegradable or nonrenewable fragrance ingredients, o/ffering another form of motivation.\n\nThat requires a great deal of work. Development takes at least three years when things move quickly, but can even take up to six or seven. It always begins at the synthesis lab, where chemists synthesize several hundred compounds and evaluate them with the perfumers. 'With our structured process, we can develop three or four new compounds a year,' says head of the lab Dr. Franziska Elterlein. While that does not sound like much at /first, captives are used in hundreds or even thousands of formulas, from shampoo and detergent to /fine fragrances.\n\n'We plan our research, read patent information and consider together which chemical structures make sense,' explains Philip Kraft, who has more than 25 years of experience in research and development. 'And we also have to keep an eye on costs at all times. Synthesis is a complex process and generally takes a while to get up and running.' What is more, the design process can be full of surprises. 'There's no way to know exactly what a substance will smell like before synthesis, which is why coming up with new ideas is a process of trial and error,' Franziska Elterlein adds. The development process is often dependent on the form of collaboration in the Group. 'For example, we have our colleagues in analytics examine the compounds,' Philip Kraft says. Certain secondary components are responsible for the primary scent because their thresholds are lower than those of the primary components. The substances therefore need to be exhaustively and precisely analyzed to ensure the right compound is patented.",

'Of course, we stop developing the compounds that are too weak or even unpleasant in the composition,' Nikolas Bugdahn says. Following olfactory valuation, a price estimation is provided to determine which cost-bene/fit ratio would make it e/ffective to use the fragrance ingredient in a composition. The fragrance ingredients are also assessed to determine the level of renewability and biodegradability. The perfumers in the Group assume a key role just before the process is completed, when there are only around 20 compounds left out of the hundreds initially developed. In addition to the experts in Holzminden, some of whom are already involved, the captives are then sent to 15 perfumers around the world, from Singapore and S\u00e3o Paulo to New York and Paris. 'This also includes applications in fragrance blends and di/fferent dosages,' Sarah Maria Kollenberg explains.\n\nToxicologists then carefully examine the substances favored by the global team of perfumers to identify any potential negative e/ffects on people or nature that were not considered during development of the compounds. A whole host of tests are conducted to collect data about the substance and its e/ffects in order to complete registration in di/fferent countries and regions on the basis of high standards. And at the very end, the team and production sta/ff get together to consider how to produce the captive on a large scale. 'Not even that is easy because many substances have di/fferent olfactory results in mass production, for example,' Philip Kraft says.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe team evaluates the molecules in an olfactory analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnce they have passed all of the tests, the compounds are introduced to the various business units in order to determine whether they should be launched as captives or specialties. The patent process takes place at the same time. Also interesting is the fact that not every substance developed is incorporated into the portfolio as a captive. 'For some of them, we or the business units might not see a current need,' says Nikolas Bugdahn. Many success stories are only written later. For example, the Lilybelle \u00ae compound which, like Spicatanate \u00ae , is derived from D-limonene - was stored in the archive for several decades. 'Employees developed it nearly 40 years ago, but didn't follow up on it because it's based on a /fivestage synthesis process,' Philip Kraft explains. 'Back then, that wasn't feasible.' But today it is, and Symrise successfully sells the compound with the /floral lily of the valley note as a specialty used in both simple household cleaners and high-end perfumes.\n\nThough complex, the processes are well worthwhile, as demonstrated by the fact that Symrise continues to increase the number of captives and their applications. Used as a 'Symrise Signature' in 7 % of all formulations in early 2018, they can now be found in more than 50 %. 'Our strategic goal is to protect our products with the captives,' Sarah Maria Kollenberg says. 'Our synthesis labs and the New Ingredients Management team are working tirelessly to achieve it.'\n\nSarah Maria Kollenberg supervises the process as Director New Ingredients Management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n15\n\nThe captives are sent to 15 experts around the world.",

Can you approach all these goals simultaneously or do you have to set priorities?\n\n  First of all, economic success, sustainability and social acceptance are inextricably linked for us. Sustainability is an integral component of the corporate strategy, which we observe and bolster in all our processes. Therefore, we work to ful/fill all the SDGs along our value chain in a transparent way for our shareholders. But we of course have to pool our resources in some areas and focus on certain processes and projects. Anything else would be ine/fficient.\n\n## How do you decide where to use which resources and what do you see as particularly important?\n\n  We launched a structured process in order to also be able to properly establish our priorities. In doing so, we placed the SDGs at the forefront and have formulated our ambitions in a systematic way, which is also relevant to our business. That is because we can only achieve what we set out to do if we combine economic success with sustainability e/fforts. Our /first step is to minimize our carbon footprint along the value chain. Then, we want to maximize the sustainability of our portfolio with regard to the procurement of raw materials in order to positively in/fluence society and the environment. Last but not least, we want to improve the living conditions of our stakeholders under the concept of 'care.' As part of that, we also de/fined an entire host of more concrete goals.\n\n## How do you include the stakeholders in these processes?\n\n  We used a materiality analysis to determine which sustainability topics are the most important to us. This entailed looking deeply into the four topics mentioned above. To achieve this, we surveyed 1,300 employees and experts, including customers, investors and suppliers. The key question was: 'What are the main e/ffects of our business activities on the environment, nature and society?'\n\n## What was the result?\n\n  We identi/fied four top priorities through the analysis: climate protection and climate change adaptation, procurement and human rights, use of raw materials and the circular economy as well as environmental protection and biodiversity.\n\n## How do you ful/fill them individually?\n\n  When it comes to the topic of 'climate protection and climate change adaptation,' for instance, we pursue the goal of reducing our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions so that we can become climate positive in this area starting in 2030. This includes energy sources such as oil and gas that are supplied to the company by energy service providers and the electricity generated by ourselves or purchased from electricity suppliers. And, incidentally, we have been sourcing electricity from renewable sources only since 2020. In terms of Scope 3, which comprises emissions arising from the procurement of raw materials or from transport, we intend to achieve an increase in e/fficiency compared to 2020 of 30 % by 2025. For this purpose, we developed a Low Carbon Transition Plan, which we address through many projects. Our targets are recognized as most ambitious by the Science Based Targets initiative (see also page 54). We thus intend to be climate-neutral along the entire supply chain, including the raw materials produced by suppliers, by 2045.",

        "page_content": "## When it comes to Scope 3, success also depends on the actions of suppliers. How can you in/fluence them?\n\n  We are in constant communication with our main suppliers regarding how they can approach our ambitious sciencebased targets. By now, 87 % of them have set their own climate protection targets. We also keep an eye on ESG criteria concerning our smaller suppliers - meaning the environmental, social and governance aspects.\n\n## This brings us to the topic of procurement and human rights. Where do we stand in this regard?\n\n  The German Supply Chain Act has been in place since the beginning of 2023, and we have to meet its requirements as of this year. We will need to report on our risks and remedial measures at the beginning of 2024. But we are already assuming responsibility for our suppliers concerning, for example, the observance of internationally recognized human rights and certain environmental standards. That's no small feat considering we work with more than 15,000 direct and indirect suppliers worldwide. We expect the supply chain act to be enacted at the EU level in late 2023, which is likely to contain more stringent requirements and will need to be translated into national law within a period of two years. We began with the introduction of a systematic process in 2021 that will allow us to identify human rights and environmental risks on our suppliers' side. Also, the Executive Board published the human rights policy statement at the beginning of last year. We also published guidelines on responsible sourcing and the Code of Conduct for suppliers in the middle of last year.\n\n## In addition to that, you introduced the position of human rights o/fficer in the Group.\n\n  Our 'Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee' (RSSC), in which our Corporate Sustainability team works with the segments' purchasing managers and their sustainability o/fficers to implement the requirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Law, took up activities back in April 2021. The human rights o/fficer recently appointed by the Executive Board monitors the manage ment of the risks associated with our suppliers as well as the remedial and preventive measures introduced. He has also introduced a grievance mechanism that allows external interest groups to anonymously report human rights and environmental violations to the Sustainability O/ffice without the fear of reprisals.\n\n## The third point, use of raw materials and the circular economy, also concerns the purchasing of products. How was the focus set on the circular economy?\n\n  It has been one of the main elements of our business model for a long time, but we never really talked much about it.\n\nWe implement the principles of the circular economy in our entire raw material and product portfolio by fully using raw materials wherever possible, avoiding by-products or reintroducing materials in production processes - thus also avoiding recycling costs. For example, the ingredients of one-third of our fragrance compositions are based on wood, which we utilize in this way. The circular economy will be decisive to reach our climate and environmental targets. Because one thing is very clear: We consume too many raw materials, create too much waste for the planet, and don't even fully use its resources. Let's take a look at the food industry, for example: Today, a third of global agricultural production is lost or wasted along the food chain. In addition, the mining and processing of raw materials is responsible for 50 % of global greenhouse gas emissions and 90 % of biodiversity loss.\n\n## These goals are enhanced by the last aspect: environmental protection and biodiversity. How do you want to progress in this area?\n\n  In 2010, Symrise de/fined a climate strategy that will make us more sustainable in all areas. That means we are well positioned. To maintain that, we pursue numerous certi/fications, align with the science-based targets and report on our sustainability activities in a transparent way. In addition, we participate in initiatives. Let me give you an example of this: In June 2022, Eder Ramos, our Global President of the Fragrance division, was appointed honorary Chairman of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), an international nonpro/fit organization that promotes the responsible sourcing of raw materials. We can thus make an active contribution here. Another example: We now integrate nature-related risks and opportunities into our decision-making process as speci/fied in the international Task Force on Naturerelated Financial Disclosure.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, it was announced that Symrise had once again earned top marks in the yearly sustainability ratings of renowned nonpro/fit organization CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project. How important are such accolades?\n\n  We are always happy to receive them because they show that our dedicated work is bearing fruit. For its protection of the climate, water, and forests, Symrise received three A grades in the annual CDP sustainability rating. Based on the CDP data from the 2022 program, Symrise is one of 13 companies to receive three A grades - out of 18,700 participating companies worldwide. Symrise has therefore ful/filled the stringent sustainability criteria for the third time in a row, building on its achievements in the previous year. This all means that we are on the right path, and we will continue to pursue it together with our employees and partners.",

In the index, Symrise ranked 24th out of 112 and scored 67.9 points - better than average in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, which was 64.6 points.\n\n## DQS\n\n## Winner in the 'Biodiversity' category\n\n  In 2022, six out of 60 nominated companies received the Sustainability Heroes Award, which the German Association for Quality (DGQ) and the German Federal Association for Sustainability (DQS) jointly award in six categories. Symrise won in the category of 'Biodiversity,' which the company works to preserve along with stakeholders from business, science and society.\n\n## Science Based Targets-Initiative\n\n## Highest standards met\n\n  The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature are the founders of the Science Based Targets initiative, which today includes more than 1,000 companies. They want to work together to set science-based climate targets. One of the initiative's committees regularly checks to see whether companies are helping to curb the rise in global temperatures. Symrise again meets the SBTi's highest standard.\n\n## BSB Innovation Awards\n\n## Five awards in the cosmetics sector\n\n  Symrise won /five prestigious European BSB Innovation Awards in 2022. Among other things, the cosmetic ingredient SymHair \u00ae Thermo was voted the most innovative natural product in hair care. The Track4Trust\u2122 app was honored for allowing the origin of ingredients to be tracked in a user-friendly and innovative way.

Our business activities ultimately depend on the responsible use and conservation of natural resources as well as the diversity of nature.\n\n## Sustainability as a business principle\n\nOur business processes follow the principles of the circular economy to a wide extent. We bundle the aspects of sustainability that are relevant to Symrise into the four pillars of environmental protection (Footprint), sustainable innovation (Innovation), raw material sourcing (Sourcing) and employees and society (Care). Concrete goals to be reached by 2025 have been established for each pillar (see page 35). These are directly related to our material topics and are derived from a number of programs, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our business model uses this comprehensive approach to combine economic success with sustainable governance and social acceptance.\n\n## We are all called upon\n\nAt Symrise, sustainability is the business of all employees. Everyone is called upon to constantly monitor the work processes in one's own /field of activity and responsibility for e/fficiency, safety and resource conservation, and to develop ideas for improvement. A global network of more than 150 Sustainability Ambassadors promotes targeted initiatives on energy and waste management, climate, water and environmental protection, and occupational health and safety at the corporate locations. Managers are responsible for operationalizing sustainability in their teams and laying out\n\nclear goals. Sustainability objectives are also a component of individual goals for all senior executives, including the members of the Executive Board. This advances our sustainability approach consistently in all divisions. The global cross-business Symrise Sustainability Board ensures the integration of our sustainability principles into the core processes: Under the chairmanship of the Chief Sustainability O/fficer (CSO), division and sta/ff department manage ment representatives come together multiple times per year to ensure that sustainability-related topics and the concerns of our important stakeholder groups are considered along the entire value chain. The Sustainability Board sets sustainability objectives, which are directly implemented in the respective divisions. To this end, the Executive Board and the Sustainability Board have appointed sustainability o/fficers for the Taste, Nutrition & Health and Scent & Care business segments, as well as one representative each for the sta/ff departments of Human Resources, Finance / Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and Corporate Sustainability. With a view to the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) coming into force in 2023, the Head of the Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee has also joined the Sustainability Board. Direct responsibility for strategy lies with the Chief Executive O/fficer of Symrise AG, who receives regular reports on the progress of all sustainability activities.",

For example, in 2022 we were presented with a Sustainability Heroes Award from the German Association for Sustainability for the third consecutive year. That same year, and also for the third time in a row, we received the top grade of 'A' in the climate, water and forests categories from CDP. In 2022, we exceeded the average value for our industry (Chemistry & Pharma) in the Purpose Readiness Index with a score of 67.9 and secured a solid 24th place out of a total of 112 assessed companies. We are proud of this, and it encourages us to intensify our sustainable activities. At the same time, we face mounting challenges, including the increasingly negative consequences of the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and the respon sible use of resources as well as the serious e/ffects of the global coronavirus pandemic and Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Symrise seeks a dialogue with all relevant stakeholder groups in order to discuss current developments and to meet the needs of various stakeholders regarding sustainable governance. Examples of this are the various WBCSD committees, global representative bodies IFRA and IOFI, and initiatives such as OP2B and the Development and Climate Alliance.\n\nWe exchange sustainability information particularly closely with the company's shareholders, investors, voting proxies and rating agencies. When it comes to the communication of our ESG performance to investors, rating agencies MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS ESG in particular o/ffer high quality and e/ffectiveness for our company. Moreover, our sustainability performance is regularly evaluated by internationally recognized institutions such as CDP, EcoVadis and Sedex. Customers as well as investors are interested in the continued development of our sustainability reporting, which will increase the transparency of our business processes and allow for better assessment of the opportunities and risks inherent to our business activities.\n\nC h i e f S u st a in a b ili t y O /ffi c e r C h i e f E x e c u t i ve O /ffi c e r\n\nDr. Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Bertram, CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBernhard Kott, CSO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Birch, Sustainability Taste, Nutrition & Health\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Stephanie Co\u00dfmann, Human Resources & LegalDr. Helmut Frieden, Corporate Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGa\u00eblle Bathany, Cosmetic Ingredients Marketing & Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Marcus Eh, Sustainability Aroma Molecules\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDoris Gattermann, Corporate Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJasper H\u00f6lzchen, Corporate Sustainability\n\nTobias Erfurth, Investor RelationsMarie Le Hena/ff, Sustainability Taste, Nutrition & Health\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichael Klamm, Global Procurement, Scent & Care\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFriedrich-Wilhelm Micus, Corporate Communications\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Philippa Smith, Sustainability Scent & Care\n\nMore than 150 Sustainability Ambassadors worldwide\n\nMore than 12,000 employees in more than 40 countries\n\nSascha Liese, Corporate Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the very top of our agenda: climate change mitigation, circular economy, biodiversity and human rights.\n\n  We updated our materiality analysis in the 2022 reporting year using a comprehensive analysis process consisting of multiple online surveys and qualitative interviews with key stakeholders.\n\nWhere appropriate, we revised and reclustered topic headings and content as part of this. For example, the 'Protection of biodiversity' topic has been expanded to 'Environmental protection & biodiversity,' while the previously separately evaluated topics of 'Sustainable partnerships' and 'Support of local communities' have been merged to create 'Partners & Communities' with a view to focusing the content. 'Employer attractiveness' has been integrated into related topics. Management of climate risks by Symrise is now explicitly addressed with the 'Climate change mitigation & adaptation' topic, addressing the\n\ntackling of the climate crisis and more.\n\n\u00bb\n\nThe results of our materiality analysis get to the heart of our strategic understanding of sustainability: climate, biodiversity, circular economy and human rights have the highest priority for Symrise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\nThe qualitative signi/ficance of this year's analysis has been further increased through 30 + interviews with managers, Executive Board members and experts in various stakeholder groups - investors, customers, NGOs, scientists, politicians and associations.\n\nThis allowed us to identify 'Climate change mitigation & adaptation,' 'Environmental protection & biodiversity,' 'Use of raw materials & recycling solutions' and 'Sourcing & human rights' as the four topics with the highest materiality and thus strategic precedence to Symrise. These four topics were rated high est in terms of both business relevance and prospect of having an impact. The contextual focus uni/fies employees and managers. Among all stakeholders, the topic of 'Climate change mitigation & adaptation' is the most material topic. Experts also designated 'Partners and Communities' a key lever, enabling Symrise to make a positive di/fference beyond the company itself with partners and thereby exert an impact and multiplier e/ffect on the industry. In particular, management emphasized the importance of the 'Product innovation & design' and 'Product quality & safety' topics for the company's value creation.",

For the /first time, 'Biodiversity' also became one of the top four topics at Symrise. 'Use of water' and 'Corporate Governance & Compliance' became comparatively less important this year.

Climate change mitigation and adaptation pose a considerable challenge, but also represent a major opportunity. One of those driving this topic internally is Dr. Helmut Frieden - Vice President Corporate Sustainability at Symrise. He is conscious of the need for companies to act to mitigate climate change and the necessity for the net zero strategy of Symrise, and also knows which are the biggest steps that have to be taken along the way.\n\n## To what extent is Symrise speci/fically addressing climate change mitigation and climate crisis adaptation?\n\n  'We are continuously de/fining new climate change mitigation measures and re/fining our targets. Since 2017, we have had our climate goals scienti/fically examined and endorsed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) - in other words, they have been externally validated to determine whether they are consistent with the target of limiting global warming caused by the greenhouse e/ffect to 1.5 \u00b0C. Symrise is therefore one of the world's /first 100 SBTicerti/fied companies and the /first SBTi member in its industry. Our current goals are clear: In terms of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we want to be climatepositive by 2030 - which means we intend to emit\n\n\u00ab\n\nSince 2017, the Science Based Targets initiative has validated the climate goals of Symrise AG, which were con/firmed with the highest ambition level in the most recent evaluation in 2022.\n\n\u00bb\n\nfewer emissions than we consume. And we want to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 30 % so that we can play our part in achieving the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement by 2045.'\n\n## What is the biggest challenge for Symrise on the path to net zero?\n\n  'When it comes to Scope 3 emissions, we have nearly 1.6 million tons of CO2 emissions to consider. An enormous e/ffort is required to reduce these. That is why we are taking part in the CDP Supply Chain Program, which helps our suppliers to share their environmental goals and data. Herein lies the biggest challenge we face in the short term until 2030 and in the long term until 2045: increasing the number of our suppliers within the CDP Supply Chain Program and improving their data quality.'\n\n## How have you integrated climate change mitigation into your corporate strategy?\n\n  'We have linked Executive Board remuneration to climate and sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs) since 2021. This way, we are incentivizing and anchoring the reduction of our emissions as well as climate change mitigation and sustainability measures within the personal goals of Executive Board members. The integration of climate change mitigation into our corporate strategy thus takes the form of a virtuous circle: We /first de/fine goals and KPIs, take the relevant measures and launch programs - and make their progress and success monetarily relevant for the Executive Board. Our Super visory Board explicitly requested such an implementation and investors are also increasingly calling for the same.'",

They ensure that sustainability messaging gets passed down from the top, but also transfer ideas from employees upwards. Important topics are conveyed to and internalized by all employees thanks to the e/fforts of the Ambassadors. And the Ambassadors forward ideas proposed by employees to Idea Management. This approach has proven successful in scenarios such as reducing the thermostat setting from fall onwards and more e/fficient lighting systems. The feedback and response have been very positive. The employees then put these ideas into practice in their private lives as well - perhaps by considering what they might do with their own thermostats or lights at home.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\nClimate change mitigation and sustainability KPIs have been embedded in the personal goals of Symrise Executive Board members since 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00bb\n\nDr. Helmut Frieden, VP Corporate Sustainability",

On the other hand, because our business model has long been closely linked with biodiversity and ecosystems and we want to make sustainable use of the treasures nature has to o/ffer in the future as well.'\n\n\u00ab\n\nIt is crucial that we at Symrise assert our principles and interests in sustainable sourcing and raw material use, for the bene/fit of people and nature in these di/fficult times.\n\n\u00bb\n\nEder Ramos,\n\nPresident of the Fragrance division and CEO of UEBT\n\nThe Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) is an international nonpro/fit organization that promotes responsible sourcing of natural raw materials.

Symrise has been a UEBT member for many years and Eder Ramos has been representing the UEBT Executive Board externally in his capacity as Chairman since June 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  Eder Ramos: 'For myself as President of the Fragrance division, biodiversity serves as an invaluable source of raw materials and inspiration for the creation of unique fragrance compositions. It is therefore in our interest to play our part in conserving biodiversity and making use of its components in a sustainable manner.\n\nThat is why Symrise has also set itself the global goal of obtaining an increasing share of strategically important biological raw materials from veri/fied sustainable sources. We are working closely on this with selected customers, suppliers and non-governmental organizations such as UEBT that are helping us to establish ethical and eco-friendly standards in our supply chains.'",

Social challenges, such as demographics, migration and human rights. Environmental challenges: the climate crisis, water scarcity, soil erosion, pollution and their negative consequences on the productive force of the ecosystems in the countries where we source our natural raw materials. This is why it is of crucial impor tance that we as a company assert our principles and interests in terms of responsible raw material sourcing and use, to the bene/fit of people and nature, in these di/fficult times.'\n\nWhat challenges, as well as opportunities, do you see in making your company's impact on natural diversity (more) measurable?\n\n  SL: 'The problem is that there is not one general indicator which can be used to measure biodiversity, and it is often not possible to directly quantify positive or negative changes in biodiversity at a local level as the indirect consequence of operational decisions. What we can already measure, evaluate and consider well in decision-making processes today is, for example, the conservation status of species and populations from which we obtain our raw materials and also the environmental integrity of growing regions. This also applies to the ecological footprint of raw materials and products - in the future, we will not only look at CO2, but also water use, land use and biodegradability. Another important aspect is the direct and indirect evaluation of the sustainability or unsustainability of farming and forestry practices, e.g. based on certi/fications, information from suppliers or on-site audits conducted by reliable partners with biodiversity expertise such as UEBT. All of these are helping us to identify sustainability risks at an early stage and take steps to deal with them.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\n## We want to use nature's treasury sustainably both now and in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00bb\n\nSascha Liese, Director Corporate Sustainability and biodiversity expert\n\nHow does Symrise prepare itself for possible raw material shortages and how does the company want to use raw materials more e/fficiently in the future?\n\n  ER: 'With respect to critical raw materials: By investing in the supply chain, no longer using particular materials on sustainability grounds, as we have already done in the past, and searching for alternatives in nature or investing in nature. Of course, other options would be to expand our supplier base, source from more countries and avoid the use of critical resources right from the start of product development through green chemistry and sustainable product design. There are many di/fferent approaches that can help to reduce the pressure on nature, ecosystems and biodiversity and may even have a positive impact on people and nature.'",

That is why our supply chains and the sourcing of raw materials need to be more resilient, and our material loops closed. Michael Klamm, Senior Vice President, Global Procurement, Scent & Care, at Symrise, explains what responsibility we bear in the 'race for resources' and how Symrise is constantly working towards more sustainable resource use.\n\n## How do you see Symrise positioned in the race for resources?\n\n  'Symrise is de/finitely well positioned in this race. However, I can only speak for the Scent & Care division, and there are obviously some touch points with renewable resources there. The raw materials and the products that we use and manufacture in North America for example, are derived from natural renewable resources. Take for instance arti/ficial mint, which we produce for toothpaste and other products from a by-product of orange juice production, namely the oils from the orange peel. This is one way in which we are contributing to resource conservation.'\n\n\u00ab\n\nThe revised Responsible Sourcing and Supplier Code of Conduct has served as a new guideline for suppliers and responsible sourcing at Symrise since 2022.\n\n\u00bb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How is Symrise speci/fically addressing the challenge of sustainable resource use?\n\n  'It is clear to us that we should continue to increase the share of products from sustainable resources. We have a team of engineers that is constantly optimizing the crude sulfate turpentine (CST) output of our suppliers so that we can increase the quantities of these resources. Crude sulfate turpentine, a natural oil obtained from conifers, is one of the biggest raw materials we purchase in Scent & Care - we therefore believe there is particular optimization potential here. We also support projects in various parts of the world where we work together with local farmers to improve their processes with a view to obtaining natural products. In addition, we empower other suppliers and engage closely with them on using more sustainable products as raw materials.'",

At the same time, this is good preparation for the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), which takes e/ffect from January 2023.'\n\nYou can improve your customers' sustainability performance by optimizing packaging and making it more sustainable, avoiding destruction and consolidating shipments. How are you already addressing these aspects?\n\n  'Wherever possible, we always buy in the largest packaging size or in bulk commodities and we never stop looking for ways to improve: For example, we get various deliveries during the week from one supplier, which we consolidate. We carry out such consolidations wherever possible. We are also constantly optimizing the freight and shipments to our customers.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Focus on materiality: Sourcing & human rights\n\nOur supply chains are complex and extensive. It is therefore all the more important to clearly de/fine general conditions for responsible sourcing and the protection of human rights. Doris Gattermann, Director Corporate Sustainability and a member of the Responsible Steering Committee, explains what these guidelines look like in practice and how Symrise is addressing current challenges.\n\nHow is Symrise addressing the two-fold challenge of respecting human rights while ensuring materials are sourced in the most eco-friendly way?\n\n  'Achieving full transparency and traceability across our extensive supply chains - we purchase more than 10,000 raw materials - is a challenge. The LkSG covers not only raw material suppliers, but also all of our own operations and what are known as 'indirect spend' supply chains. This further increases the complexity and scope.\n\n\u00ab\n\nGreater transparency in upstream supply chains and indirect procurement expenditure, aside from raw materials, as a particular challenge and opportunity.\n\n\u00bb\n\nSymrise has taken a number of steps, including establishing a due diligence approach, in order to obtain more information about our suppliers' business practices in addition to the various audit stages - also in view of the risks speci/fic to the respective countries and sectors. Before a supplier is even accepted, we ask about its business practices and its policies on anti-discrimination, child labor and workers' rights and protections. We also request information on environmental aspects. If the identi/fied risk is considered high, we conduct further evaluations, up to and including on-site audits. Before doing business with suppliers, we require assurance from them that they will comply with our supplier code, which explicitly sets out our expectations of suppliers.'\n\nWhat might a cross-divisional approach look like at Symrise in view of the LkSG? How can the various segments learn from each other in this regard?\n\n  'Our responsible sourcing strategy and management approach generally relate to suppliers and are independent of the segments. However, the experiences of the segments and the operational procurement areas are very valuable, as they have a better understanding of the general conditions that may lead to risks (root cause) on account of their close relationships and experience with business partners, also on-site. More targeted prevention or mitigation measures can then be drawn up. In addition, the segments are in close contact with suppliers and are able to directly address problems or work on improvements with them due to their long-standing relationships.'",

        "page_content": "In which areas of your supply chain do the biggest challenges still lie? How are you addressing these?\n\n  'On the one hand, we want to create more transparency in upstream supply chains - meaning with regard to our suppliers' suppliers. This primarily requires good collaboration and strong mutual trust with suppliers. On the other hand, there has to be greater transparency in respect of 'indirect procurement expenditure.' This means all purchases that are important to keeping a business running but do not go directly into the product. We are currently working with our colleagues in Technical Purchasing on new and pragmatic solutions for reviewing service providers in a wide range of sectors - also in close collaboration with Sedex. We can make much more progress quickly when we work together on these matters rather than alone.'\n\nHow can Symrise further increase its impact on sustainability matters beyond the company by encouraging others to improve their performance in this area?\n\n  'There is potential for this in the supplier / customer relationship: If both sides are interested in collaborating and growing in the long term, then the willingness of suppliers to improve represents a mutual advantage. After all, we are not the only ones who bene/fit when there are fewer risks in relation to our products and the employees in the relevant supply chains. Suppliers themselves also gain by becoming a more interesting partner for other customers through this. Also, there is potential in respect of Scope 3 emissions: We have the greatest climate impact through our products. That is why we are working on incorporating our downstream supply chains into our reduction plans as well, so that we can have an even greater impact there.'\n\n## Are you already encouraging suppliers to implement climate-relevant measures?\n\n  'We work with the CDP Supply Chain Program and invite further suppliers from our portfolio every year so that we can also encourage them to\n\n\u00ab\n\n## 226 Symrise suppliers participated in the CDP Supply Chain Program in 2022.

In addition, with the Cosmetic Ingredients and Aroma Molecules divisions, the company is active in the market for aroma chemicals and cosmetic ingredients, which grew from \u20ac 7.5 billion in 2021 to \u20ac 7.8 billion in 2022, according to reports of IAL (3rd Edition, December 2022). Together, these markets are also referred to as the AFF market, which would have a volume of \u20ac 39.0 billion. This market will grow by around 3 % to 4 % in the long term. In 2022, the growth of this relevant market was around 8 %. However, this was due to inflation-related price effects at approximately the same level.\n\nMore than 500 companies worldwide are active in the market relevant for Symrise. The four largest providers, which include Symrise, together have a market share of 64 %.\n\nThe F & F market is characterized worldwide by high barriers to entry. There is increasing customer demand for higher quality and more differentiated products with ever-shorter product life cycles. The majority of products and recipes are manufactured specially for individual customers. Furthermore, local taste preferences often dictate that there are many different recipes for a single end product that vary depending on the country in which it is marketed. Moreover, customer relations are often characterized by intensive cooperation in product development.\n\nIn addition to varying local taste preferences and consumer behaviors, there are other factors that also influence the demand for end products in which Symrise products are used. The population's increasing income in emerging markets is having a positive impact on the development of demand for products containing fragrances and flavorings or cosmetic ingredients. Market growth also depends on more basic products that meet everyday needs and already have an established presence in the markets of industrialized nations. In the developed Western European, Asian and North American markets, consumer trends such as beauty, health, well-being, convenience and naturalness determine the growing demand for products containing Symrise ingredients.",

This will enable Symrise to gradually increase the distance between it and smaller competitors and to gain market share.\n- Value orientation: Symrise wants to consistently be counted among the most profitable companies in the industry. The Group aims to achieve an average EBITDA margin of 20 % to 23 %.\n\nPerformance results are described in more detail in the corporate development section. Symrise ensures that its shareholders have an appropriate share in the company's success. The dividend policy is oriented toward the company's profitability.\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nThe corporate strategy of Symrise is based on three pillars: growth, efficiency and portfolio. It incorporates aspects of sustainability at all levels in order to enhance the Group's value over the long term and minimize risks. In this way, Symrise is making sustainability an integral part of its business model and turning it into a clear competitive advantage. The goal is a completely integrated corporate strategy.\n\n- Growth: Symrise strengthens cooperation with its strategic customers around the world and expands its business in emerging markets. The Group makes sure that it remains an innovation leader in its core competencies. This ensures its continued growth.\n- Efficiency: Symrise continually improves its processes and focuses on products with a high level of value creation. With backward integration for key raw materials, Symrise ensures a consistent, high-quality supply of these materials in sufficient quantities and at set delivery conditions. Symrise works cost-consciously in every division. This ensures the Group's profitability.\n- Portfolio: Symrise enhances its product portfolio and taps into new markets and related business activities. The Group continues to expand its expertise outside the traditional flavor and fragrances industry. This ensures its prominent market position.\n\nSymrise grows organically. When it makes sense, the Group engages in expansive acquisitions or enters into strategic partnerships for product development. At the same time, Symrise wants to ensure that the Group remains capable of taking advantage of any growth opportunities that arise without jeopardizing the company's financial stability.\n\n## VALUE-ORIENTED MANAGEMENT\n\nDifferent variables are at play within the framework of valueoriented management. The company is aiming for average organic sales growth of between 5 % and 7 % per year (CAGR) 1 in the long term. The EBITDA margin, for which  Symrise has defined a strategic target of 20 % to 23 % (until 2025), serves as an indicator of the company's profitability. In addition, the company introduced business free cash flow in 2018 as the primary internal control variable to assess its performance in order to strengthen the Group's cash flow orientation. Symrise aims to continuously increase the business free cash flow, which consists of EBITDA, investments (including cash effects from leasing) and changes in working capital. Increasing the value of the company is accounted for in the remuneration system for the Executive Board and selected manage rial staff. In addition, Symrise attaches great importance to the Group's financial stability. Management's focus, therefore, is guided by these financial control parameters. Non-financial performance indicators in the areas of environment, procurement, employees and innovation are reported separately in the Corporate Report. Further information on the non-financial benchmarks can be found in the separate non-financial report pur suant to Section 289b of the German Commercial Code (HGB), which is published on the website of Symrise AG. It can be found at https://symrise.com/corporatereport/2022/en/ sustainability-responsibility/sustainability-record.html .\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## GUIDELINES\n\nIn research and development (R & D), Symrise aims to connect the individual components of product development, such as market and consumer research, basic research and creation throughout the Group. In the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, new development potential is actively fostered through an incubator approach. Through the close linkup of R & D with business units, sales, marketing, purchasing and manufacturing/production, as well as quality assurance and regu latory issues, Symrise checks early on to see whether new products and technologies can be implemented, digitalized and if they",

Along with ideas from Open Innovation, Symrise also maintains a global project network with industrial, institutional and academic partners that covers every step of the innovative process - from basic research to marketing concepts.\n\nSymrise participates in numerous scientific research projects that are supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK), via the Research Group of the Food Industry (FEI)/Working Group for Industrial Research (AiF), the European Union (EU, Horizon 2020), TKI (Top Consortium for Knowledge and Innovation, Netherlands) the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), the French Cr\u00e9dit d'imp\u00f4t recherche (CIR) and other public and private funding institutions. Topics related to the following areas play a key role: sustainability, the establishment of cultures and the breeding of plants with special flavor properties, the development and sensory improvement of plant proteins, raw material sourcing and biotechnological processing and improvement, the added health value of food ingredients, technologies and sustainable ingredients for perfume oils and oral hygiene. Symrise has joined the Sustainable Food Initiative (SFI), founded by Wageningen University & Research, in which various universities and industrial companies conduct joint research in the field of future and sustainable food production.\n\nare profitable, in addition to assessing their sustainability aspects. Strategic research fields include the area of sustainable processes and products, such as green chemistry and the increased demand for perfumery ingredients based on renewable raw materials, as well as the area of taste optimization (taste balancing), the sensory optimization of preparations based on plant protein and the development of sustainable, resourcesaving manufacturing processes. Essential research results are secured by way of stringent IP management, such as protective rights. Furthermore, all R & D activities are geared to the guidelines of mega trends, consumer needs, customer requirements, naturalness & authenticity, sustainability, digitalization, innovation and cost efficiency.\n\n## ORGANIZATION\n\nFrom idea to marketable product, the innovation process at Symrise is organized around a uniform, stage gate process with decision filters, which has been implemented across the company. Here, more and more elements of agile project management are being used. In this context, a uniform project management system will be introduced for all business areas in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment. A business plan containing exact project descriptions, including the project's costs and resource usage, is developed for every project at TN&H and S&C. The research and development projects are also regularly evaluated based on criteria from the four pillars of the sustainability strategy (FISC) and prioritized accordingly. As part of this process in 2022, the area of fair use of biodiversity was further developed according to the provisions of the Nagoya Protocol. One future field is the utilization of legacy varieties of known agricultural raw materials in order to preserve and expand biodiversity. Symrise is also an active member of the OP2B consortium of various industrial companies. The two segments at Symrise each manage their own R & D activities due to the varying requirements of their respective markets and customers. At the same time, technologies, processes and findings are made available to all segments, in order to achieve synergies and improve resource efficiency. Multiple R & D centers around the world ensure that the regional activities of the segments are optimally supported. The research activities of the Scent & Care segment, especially the centers for development and application technologies, are located in Holzminden (Germany), Teterboro (USA), Singapore, Shanghai (China), Tokyo (Japan), Chennai and Mumbai (India), Paris (France), Antananarivo (Madagascar), S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) and Cuautitl\u00e1n (Mexico).

        "page_content": "## FOCUS AREAS\n\nIn the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, the research and technology strategy is implemented on the basis of various research platforms. A large number of key topics are being worked on with a special focus on sustainability aspects. In the Food & Beverage division, examples include the development and adaptation of new, gentle and environmentally friendly separation technologies (Selective Enrichment Technologies Flavors SETFlavors \u00ae ) and the expansion and elaboration of raw material sources for sustainable and natural product solutions for the Symrise Code of Nature \u00ae platform, which are primarily used for healthy food concepts; the continuous development of natural and sustainable raw materials for flavor solutions that lead to the sensory-preferred reformulation of low-sugar, low-salt and low-fat food concepts; and the development of energy-efficient and low-solvent methods for concentration, beginning with plant-based raw materials. In 2022, a special focus was placed on the challenge of improving the taste of plant proteins as meat substitutes or for use in dairy products. Another focus is on reducing sugar in beverages and dairy products as well as in savory applications. In this context, the selection of varieties and new cultivation methods for a sustainable supply chain were developed and established for specific plant-based raw materials for the Taste Balancing product platform. Another focus of research in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment is the development and application of modern digital tools for the rapid and targeted development of flavor solutions for selected food applications. The ProtiScan\u2122 process - developed by Symrise for recording the flavor release from innovative food preparations with vegetable protein - is noteworthy in this context. This process enables a significant reduction in project development times and forms a solid foundation for IT-based development concepts. In addition, work is being carried out on the continuous improvement of product safety and the targeted optimization of the use of flavor solutions for application in reduced sugar and plant protein-based foods. In recent years, particular attention has been given to the development of digital prediction tools to support flavor development and creation. A significant portion of this work has been completed this year and grouped under the umbrella term PropheSY.\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n15\n\nBASIC INFORMATION ON THE SYMRISE GROUP\n\nIn the Pet Food division, the Elven site was equipped with state-of-the-art extrusion equipment to develop more powerful and safer products. In addition, the VIDEKA \u00ae laboratory in Elven was designed for EAME customer support with shelflife studies, research and development and analytical requirements. This laboratory is used to carry out shelf-life studies for pet food and pet care compounds using the latest analytical instruments.\n\nIn the Aqua business, an important focus of product development was the utilization of shrimp shells as raw materials or functional ingredients. Projects for the development and application of flavor enhancers for carnivorous fish species were continued.\n\nProbi and Naturals have launched a joint project to develop new symbiotic products containing live microorganisms and polyphenols extracted from fruits.\n\nWith regard to its R & D strategy, the Scent & Care segment focuses on raw materials and technologies in accordance with the strategic research fields of efficiency, sustainability & naturals and health & emotion. Green chemistry is also an important factor when it comes to perfumery. Products are produced based on natural renewable raw materials. For example, with the Garden Lab, a disruptive approach was taken using the SymTrap \u00ae process to make vegetable scents accessible for perfumery as well. The SymTrap \u00ae platform was also expanded with additional products in 2022. In the field of extraction from natural raw materials, new qualities were developed and included in the perfumery range. Supported by R & D, the range of natural raw materials will be expanded further with the launch of La Maison Lautier. New and sustainable captives have also been developed. Among them is Pearadise \u00ae , which is produced on the basis of biotechnologically derived raw materials and using green chemistry. With Flowerpool \u00ae , a captive was developed that smells of white blossoms and purity. Diviniris is an iris-scented captive with velvety notes. Research is also being carried out to find inexpensive raw materials for perfumery. Symrise has also added Natural Neofresh \u00ae to its Neofresh platform to meet customers' desire for sustainable products made from renewable raw materials. The addition of substance mixtures, especially for fine fragrances, makes it considerably more difficult for our competitors to analyze and replicate our perfume oils. The new Cryptosym \u00ae technology was very well received by some customers.",

Research for capsules for fragrance oils is now heading to vegan capsules with improved efficacy for other areas of application as well.\n\nIn Oral Care, a new product was developed that combines biotechnological processes with knowledge of probiotic active ingredients. The research for new cooling agents for mouthwash, toothpaste and products for oral health was ramped up.\n\nA total of five research platforms exist in the areas of cosmetic ingredients, encapsulation and release systems for perfumery, green chemistry for sustainable products, bad odor management and oral care. Supporting platforms in the areas of sensory and analytical research, raw materials and byproducts from sustainable sources, performance, and receptor research form the basis for the capabilities at Symrise and for a constant innovation process. Newly developed technologies support the understanding of perfume oils in terms of longlasting fragrance experiences and blooming effects. In the Cosmetic Ingredients division, there is an interdisciplinary group of cell biologists, molecular biologists and microbiologists researching the human microbiome. The new research area is investigating the benefits and risks of interactions between humans and microorganisms, and is providing scientific and\n\n## Core functions of research and development at Symrise\n\n## Sustainability aspects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncross-divisional support in the development of new products for skin, scalp and oral care, or in the area of nutrition. The first products and product concepts have already been introduced to the market. In addition, in-depth analyses on healthy volunteers showed that neither multifunctional active ingredients nor modern UV filters have an effect on the microbiome. Furthermore, the portfolio of biotic ingredients was expanded to include the product SymFerment\u2122. This is a postbiotic skincare ingredient with hydration boosting properties. It is made from a process involving the use of a byproduct derived from the probiotic production of special lactobacilli that are rich in micronutrients.\n\n## PATENTS AND AWARDS\n\nThe number of patents filed (71 new applications in 2022) is used to measure innovation results and quality and to evaluate global coverage and competitive impact.\n\nIn 2022, as in previous years, Symrise research was recognized with awards for its high level of innovation. For example, Symrise received a European BSB Innovation Award for SymFerment\u2122 as an innovative cosmetic raw material in the raw materials category (moisturization and barrier). This is a postbiotic, which is obtained from the byproduct of the probiotic production process and has been shown to improve skin hydration. The product was introduced to the market in 2022. SymHair \u00ae Thermo was also launched in 2022: This product combining carbohydrates of different chain lengths provides excellent protection for the hair against heat damage.

In comparison to December 31, 2021 (11,151 employees), this represents an additional 892 employees. At 209, the number of apprentices and trainees was well above the previous year's figure of 125.\n\n## PERSONNEL STRATEGY\n\nA sustainable HR strategy is part of our corporate strategy it conveys goals and establishes common values. It includes the promotion of diversity in the workplace, supporting young families and enhancing the compatibility of professional and private life. The human resources department and its human capital strategy are responsible for developing and implementing our strategic HR policy objectives. We are currently developing further concepts to promote diversity in an even more targeted manner.\n\n## Number of employees by segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe demographic development trend in many countries toward an aging society, and a diversification of the population and thus the working workforce by people from other cultures and educational systems, are changing our living and working environments in many ways. People from over 60 nations work in the Symrise organization alone. For us as a global company, diversity is an added value of creative and innovative cooperation in diverse teams. Equal opportunities are more important than ever, and promoting diversity is central to the success of the company. Furthermore, promoting diversity is also essential so that employee recruitment is ensured now and in the future.\n\nWe put our commitment to diversity into practice with specific measures.

Succession planning discussions were held for the Board-1 and Board-2 levels. In addition, individual development plans continued to be available on the career platform.\n\nIn the 2022 fiscal year, Symrise also expanded the topic area of 'modern and digital learning' further. Employees were provided with a new, globally available 'Learning Management System' (LMS) and a digital learning platform ('Skillsoft'). More than 2,600 learning hours have now been completed worldwide on the Skillsoft platform. The platform has been well received internationally. The focus was on topics such as leadership, creating a positive work culture and professional improvement.\n\nAfter the end of the coronavirus pandemic, there was also increased demand for 'face-to-face training' in 2022. In addition, greater use was made of internally developed e-learning courses.\n\n## Age structure of the workforce in %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group strategic development of senior executives and employees\n\nSymrise has set up a global digital career development and succession planning process worldwide for the first two management levels as well as a wide range of focus groups, such as Flavorists and Key Account Managers. The aim of this crosssegment program is to sharpen and develop the job-related skills of the employees, to identify talent and prepare them to take on responsibility in key positions at Symrise. At the same time, the company uses talent development to ensure effective succession planning for business-crucial positions. Specifically, the process focuses on deriving company-wide training and development priorities, identifying talent and developing such talent through talent conferences with executives, along with succession planning for key business-crucial positions. This includes the:\n\n- Assessment of Group-wide competency development needs to achieve the strategic goals\n- Identification of the top talents and their individual development measures\n- Nomination of top talent for strategic development programs, such as the Leadership Accelerator Program\n- Robust succession planning in business-critical positions.\n\n## Number of employees by region\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS\n\nT\n\nN\n\nE\n\nM\n\nE\n\nT\n\nA\n\nT\n\nS\n\nL\n\nA\n\nI\n\nC\n\nN\n\nA\n\nN\n\nI\n\nF\n\nD\n\nE\n\nT\n\nA\n\nD\n\nI\n\nL\n\nO\n\nS\n\nN\n\nO\n\nC\n\n&\n\nT\n\nR\n\nO\n\nP\n\nE\n\nR\n\nT\n\nN\n\nE\n\nM\n\nE\n\nG\n\nA\n\nN\n\nA\n\nM\n\nP\n\nU\n\nO\n\nR\n\nG\n\nE\n\nH\n\nT\n\nM\n\nO\n\nR\n\nF",

To date, there are still fewer women than men in management positions. Symrise has set ambitious goals for itself to change the situation in the long term. Symrise has therefore put a special focus on fostering the careers of women as part of its personnel strategy.\n\nTo better leverage the potential of women at Symrise, the company is pursuing a strategy to ensure that Symrise will be able to advance the careers of its female employees. In 2022, various successful development workshops for high-potential female staff were piloted in Germany and France with the aim of rolling them out worldwide. There are also plans to integrate these workshops as part of a Female Leadership Accelerator Program. This also included a mentoring program and the targeted recruitment of women with equal qualifications.\n\n## Equitable remuneration for women and men\n\nIn 2021, Symrise carried out a gender-specific analysis of the wages for the employees at its largest site in Germany. In the in-depth analysis on the subject of equal pay, comparable job groups were formed and pay differences were analyzed against the backdrop of whether there is possible discrimination in this area. For this purpose, aspects such as length of service, age, schooling and vocational training and instruction were considered, along with the requirements level and professional position.\n\nIt was found that the average remuneration for women is not significantly different from the average remuneration for men. The unadjusted equal pay gap is 1.2 %. The remaining insignificant differences result from production-specific components of remuneration such as hardship allowances or activity-related wages such as foremen's or master craftsmen's allowances, or are prescribed by the various remuneration levels specified by wage agreements for commercial or technical professions.\n\nThe non-profit FPI Fair Pay Innovation Lab recognized Symrise for its fair pay in the 2021 reporting year.

        "page_content": "## Training and education\n\nEducating young people is of particular importance at Symrise. This is evidenced by multiple awards in company comparisons over the past four years. First, Symrise recruits qualified young individuals who it specifically trains with the company's needs in mind. With this commitment, Symrise is fulfilling an obligation that society as a whole has toward the next generation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, a total of 126 apprentices and trainees were employed at the sites in Germany.\n\nDepending on the occupation, training lasts two to three years. All trainees are taken on at least temporarily after completing their training if they meet the minimum requirements regarding the success of their training. With this investment in training, Symrise is meeting the demand for future specialists in chemical production and the laboratories as well as in commercial, marketing, IT and sales positions.\n\nSymrise has structured its training capacity in a way that allows around 45 young people to begin their training at the company every year. Of these, 25 are trained in chemicaltechnical professions, another 10 in technical and logistics professions and 12 in the area of business management/ information technology. Beyond initial training, Symrise opens up prospects through cooperative studies in business administration (five employees per year/a total of 15 on the path to a Bachelor of Business Administration). Due to what has now become a noticeable shortage of skilled workers, Symrise has added further professional fields to its range of vocational training. In Braunschweig, the third year of training as a Specialist for Food Technology began in 2022. Distillers are regularly trained in N\u00f6rdlingen, and the IT specialist training program has been offered in Holzminden since 2022. Symrise is thus working consistently to mitigate the demographic shift in the company. In addition, Symrise and its partner Kreisvolkshochschule Holzminden, the district adult education center, are also preparing a second year of its training program for chemical production specialists, starting in August 2023, in order to fill positions at the mixing plants.\n\nSymrise generally offers highly sophisticated training programs in all its regions. In 2022, the focus was on e-learning, which was managed using a 12-month Learning Nugget calendar. In addition to general training programs, Symrise also trains its employees via international assignments.\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n21\n\nBASIC INFORMATION ON THE SYMRISE GROUP\n\nSymrise constantly trains experts over a period of around three years at its own flavorist and perfumer school, where they master raw materials and their applications in Symrise products and then successfully use them in product development. In addition, our employees have a wide variety of opportunities for completing a bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree alongside their work through cooperation agreements with universities, academies and institutes.\n\n## Remuneration and wage agreements\n\nSymrise generally remunerates its employees on the basis of collective wage agreements concluded with the respective labor unions. For non-tariff employees, there is a job grade concept that classifies non-tariff roles and positions in accordance with clear principles and objective criteria. Each initial classification or later reclassification is subject to review by the works council. Through this double-checking, the Group ensures that gender plays no role in determining remuneration.\n\nIn Germany, Symrise takes guidance from the pay increases in the chemical industry.\n\nThe regularly scheduled collective bargaining on our collective wage agreements took place in 2022. As part of the successful negotiations, a collective wage agreement adapted to the economic challenges faced by companies and employees was concluded with a term of 1.5 years.\n\nIn May 2022, all full-time employees in Germany received a one-time payment of \u20ac 1,400. In December 2022, Symrise paid an inflation adjustment in the net amount of \u20ac 1,500 to all employees in Germany. Wage increases were also negotiated and will be implemented starting January 1 and July 1, 2023. A further inflation adjustment bonus of \u20ac 1,500 is planned for the end of 2023/early 2024.\n\nSymrise will also continue to give its employees in Germany's collective bargaining sector a share of the company's profits. The possible profit-sharing bonus linked to the EBITDA margin was also increased for 2023 and 2024.\n\nFor non-tariff employees, separate global performance bonus plans apply to our managers with global or regional responsibilities. These support the achievement of the set corporate goals through results- and performance-based variable remuneration. Our creative employees are also included in this management and incentive system.\n\nS\n\nT\n\nN\n\nE\n\nM\n\nE\n\nT\n\nA\n\nT\n\nS\n\nL\n\nA\n\nI\n\nC\n\nN\n\nA\n\nN\n\nI\n\nF\n\nD\n\nE\n\nT\n\nA\n\nD\n\nI\n\nL\n\nO\n\nS\n\nN\n\nO\n\nC\n\n&\n\nT\n\nR\n\nO\n\nP\n\nE\n\nR\n\nT\n\nN\n\nE\n\nM\n\nE\n\nG\n\nA\n\nN\n\nA\n\nM\n\nP\n\nU\n\nO\n\nR\n\nG\n\nE\n\nH\n\nT\n\nM\n\nO\n\nR\n\nF",

        "page_content": "## COMPANY DEVELOPMENT AT A GLANCE\n\nIMPORTANT EVENTS\n\nDespite the challenging political and economic environment, Symrise was able to stay the course with its strategy in the 2022 fiscal year. The consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and resulting disruptions in supply chains and shortages on the procurement markets as well as the war in Ukraine have only had a minor impact on the business development of Symrise so far. However, the persistently high level of inflation led to significant rises in costs at Symrise in some cases, which were largely offset by the consistent implementation of price increases.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Symrise expanded the fragrance ingredient production facility in Granada, Spain, which was acquired in 2021. As a first step, Symrise made a targeted investment in multifunctional cosmetic ingredients, an event which particularly reflected the growth in the global market for 1,2-alkanediols. The 1,2-alkanediol product range from Symrise consists of a number of multifunctional ingredients that are becoming increasingly popular in personal care products. With the recently commissioned production line, the site now provides both cosmetic ingredients as well as a wide range of fragrances from renewable raw materials.\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n23\n\nECONOMIC REPORT\n\nSymrise introduced SymHair \u00ae Thermo - a novel natural ingredient - at the in-cosmetics trade fair in Paris in April. It protects hair from heat and also shortens the time needed to use thermal appliances such as curling irons. The company thus developed a sustainable alternative to the synthetic silicones that had previously been used. SymHair \u00ae Thermo is suitable for use in shampoos, conditioners and care products that remain on the head and in the hair. The product also won first place from the BSB Innovation Award jury in the category 'Natural Products & Raw Materials.'\n\nIn June, Cosmetic Ingredients entered into a strategic partnership with the German biotech company evoxx technologies.

Philyra - the name stems from Greek mythology and represents 'creation support' - enhances the creative work of perfumers with sustainable facets. Over the past few years, Symrise has collaborated with IBM Research on evolving its cognitive creativity based on artificial intelligence in perfumery. Philyra 2.0 makes it possible for perfumers to create innovative fragrance creations with environmentally friendly and renewable raw materials. The AI system reinforces the position of Symrise as a digital trailblazer in the industry.\n\nIn December, the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment established a four-year research consortium with the Dutch Wageningen University & Research Institute and other industry partners. The purpose of the partnership is to develop meat alternatives with improved sensory quality. The partners want to focus on investigating the factors which affect the taste of meat alternatives. More and more consumers are turning to plantbased versions of popular meat products. And while the market is growing exponentially, it still offers considerable potential when it comes to developing new products. The research will provide the food industry with findings on how to create tastier alternatives for meat products - an important step on the path to more sustainable nutrition with more plant-based products.\n\nAs part of its portfolio management, Symrise was also active in the market for acquisitions and disposals in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n## GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE COURSE OF BUSINESS AND ON THE GROUP'S NET ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe Symrise Group generated sales of \u20ac 4,618 million in the 2022 fiscal year. Sales increased by 20.7 % in the reporting currency compared to the previous year. Excluding portfolio effects, organic sales growth amounted to 11.4 %. At a total of \u20ac 922 million, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA 1 ) were significantly higher than the previous year's figure of \u20ac 814 million. This corresponds to a margin of 20.0 % (2021: 21.3 %).\n\nConsolidated net income attributable to shareholders of Symrise AG amounts to \u20ac 280 million, which is \u20ac 95 million below the figure of the previous year due to the non-cash impairment of the associated company Swedencare. Without\n\nthe impairment for Swedencare, net income attributable to shareholders of Symrise AG would have been \u20ac 406 million. The earnings per share amounted to \u20ac 2.00. Without the Swedencare effect, earnings per share would have been \u20ac 2.91 (2021: \u20ac 2.74).\n\nIn light of the overall good business performance, Symrise AG's Executive Board will, in consultation with the Supervisory Board, propose raising the dividend from \u20ac 1.02 in the previous year to \u20ac 1.05 per share for the 2022 fiscal year at the Annual General Meeting on May 10, 2023.\n\n## A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND FORECAST COURSE OF BUSINESS\n\nAt the beginning of the 2022 fiscal year, Symrise had set the goal of achieving organic sales growth of 5 % to 7 % and thus noticeably above market growth (approx. 3 % to 4 %). Due to the good business performance, sales expectations for the full year were initially raised to well above 7 % and up to 10 % over time. Based on its own estimates, growth in the relevant market for Symrise was around 8 % in 2022, which was mainly attributable to inflation-related price effects.\n\nFor 2022, Symrise had expected an EBITDA margin of around 21 % despite rising raw material prices. Debt, as measured in terms of the key figure net debt (including provisions for pensions and similar obligations as well as lease liabilities) to EBITDA, should have been within the range of 2.5 and 2.7. For the business free cash flow in relation to sales, Symrise had set itself a target of 14 % at the beginning of the 2022 fiscal year. Over the course of the fiscal year, the 2022 target for business free cash flow was adjusted to 8 % to 10 %.\n\nWith organic sales growth of 11.4 % (excluding portfolio effects and currency translation effects), Symrise significantly surpassed its sales goals in 2022. Furthermore, the company was also able to exceed the ambitious corporate goal from 2019 (\u20ac 4.0-4.5 billion in sales in 2022). The EBITDA margin 1 of 20.0 % is slightly below the expected value for 2022. The net debt to EBITDA 1 ratio of 2.9 times is higher than the level expected for 2022 due to the acquisitions made and build-up of working capital to ensure supply availability. The business free cash flow as of the reporting date was 6.5 %. Symrise was not able to reach its target due to the strong sales growth in the reporting period and the expansion of safety stocks to ensure supply availability.",

Furthermore, the implemented price increases had a positive effect on the segment's sales development. Taking into account portfolio and exchange rate effects, sales in the reporting currency were \u20ac 2,913 million. Compared to the previous year, this corresponds to an increase of 24.8 %. The positive net effect of the acquisitions of Giraffe Foods Inc. (Mississauga/Canada), Schaffelaarbos B.V. (Barneveld/Netherlands) and Wing Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai/China) as well as the sales-reducing disposal of the Velcorin \u00ae and colors businesses totaled around \u20ac 99 million. Excluding currency and portfolio effects, the segment achieved organic growth of 15.3 %.\n\nThe Food & Beverage division achieved high single to low double-digit percentage sales growth in all regions. In particular, the continued strong demand for beverages and savory products ensured high growth rates in the relevant business units across all regions. The confectionery business recorded slight sales growth, and the Naturals business unit also contributed to the increase in sales with single-digit growth.\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n25\n\nECONOMIC REPORT\n\nTaste, Nutrition & Health segment EBITDA in \u20ac million\n\n1\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n631\n\n531\n\n471\n\n413\n\n376\n\n0\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\nThe Pet Food business continued its strong growth compared to the already excellent previous year. The development of the division benefited from an increasing pet population and the resulting high demand for pet food. The division achieved strong double-digit percentage organic sales growth in all regions.\n\nSales development in the Aqua Feed business unit was influenced by the continued low demand for aquafarming feed solutions. Sales remained slightly below the previous year.\n\nThe probiotics business, which includes the majority interest in the Swedish company Probi AB (Lund, Sweden), was unable to maintain the level of the strong previous year and recorded a slight decline in sales.\n\nEBITDA Taste, Nutrition & Health: EBITDA 1 of the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment amounted to \u20ac 631 million in the reporting year, significantly higher than in the previous year (2021: \u20ac 531 million). The EBITDA margin 1 of 21.6 % did not reach the level of the previous year (2021: 22.7 %), which was mainly attributable to the higher prices for raw materials and energy.\n\nS\n\nT\n\nN\n\nE\n\nM\n\nE\n\nT\n\nA\n\nT\n\nS\n\nL\n\nA\n\nI\n\nC\n\nN\n\nA\n\nN\n\nI\n\nF\n\nD\n\nE\n\nT\n\nA\n\nD\n\nI\n\nL\n\nO\n\nS\n\nN\n\nO\n\nC\n\n&\n\nT\n\nR\n\nO\n\nP\n\nE\n\nR\n\nT\n\nN\n\nE\n\nM\n\nE\n\nG\n\nA\n\nN\n\nA\n\nM\n\nP\n\nU\n\nO\n\nR\n\nG\n\nE\n\nH\n\nT\n\nM\n\nO\n\nR\n\nF",

Compared to the previous year, this represents an increase of 14.4 %. Excluding portfolio and currency translation effects, organic sales growth amounted to 5.1 %. The portfolio effects from the acquisition of the Fragrance and Aroma Chemicals business of Sensient Technologies C.V. (Elburg, Netherlands) and the acquisitions of Neroli Invest DL (Groupe N\u00e9roli) and Essence Ciel with its subsidiary SFA Romani (Romani) - both are based in Saint-C\u00e9zaire-sur-Siagne, France - contributed a total of around \u20ac 55 million to the sales of the segment.\n\nThe Fragrance division recorded solid organic growth in the single-digit percentage range and benefited in particular from strong demand in the Fine Fragrances business unit. It delivered a very robust performance and once again achieved double-digit percentage organic growth following a strong previous year. The growth rates in the Latin America and EAME regions were particularly pronounced. Sales performance in the Consumer Fragrance and Oral Care business units was not satisfactory. This development was mainly driven by the reduction in inventories by customers, who returned to normal levels after strong previous years due to the pandemic.\n\nDevelopment of sales in the Aroma Molecules division was subdued in the past fiscal year. The Menthols business unit achieved single-digit organic growth. The North America region in particular reported significant growth. In contrast, demand for fragrances was weaker than expected and led to an organic decline in sales.\n\nThe Cosmetic Ingredients division continued its robust performance and benefited from the strong demand for highquality cosmetic products. All business units and regions contributed to the business development. In particular, the strong demand for sun protection products and products with active cosmetic ingredients led to high organic growth in the double-digit percentage range.\n\nEBITDA Scent & Care: Scent & Care generated an EBITDA that was 3.0 % higher than in the previous year with \u20ac 291 million in 2022 (2021: \u20ac 283 million). The EBITDA margin amounted to 17.1 %, due primarily to substantially higher prices for raw materials and energy (2021: 19.0 %).",

The cost of goods sold increased slightly faster than sales, which was mainly attributable to higher raw material and manufacturing costs. Higher costs for logistics and energy as well as increased costs due to general inflationary developments had\n\na negative effect on gross profit. The gross margin in the reporting year was 36.9 %, which is 1.8 percentage points below the previous year's level (2021: 38.7 %). The share of selling and marketing expenses in Group sales remained unchanged from the previous year at 14.7 %. The R & D rate relative to sales decreased compared to the previous year from 5.8 % to 5.5 %, primarily as a result of the strong sales growth. Administration expenses as a share of Group sales decreased from 5.8 % in the previous year to 5.6 % in the reporting year.\n\nThe increase in other operating income is attributable primarily to positive one-time effects in connection with the sale of the Velcorin \u00ae business as well as the partial sale of the celery business in North America, each amounting to around \u20ac 18 million. Furthermore, one-time costs in connection with the  acquisition and disposal of companies or parts of companies in the amount of \u20ac 9.3 million were incurred in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n27\n\nECONOMIC REPORT\n\nS\n\nT\n\nN\n\nE\n\nM\n\nE\n\nT\n\nA\n\nT\n\nS\n\nL\n\nA\n\nI\n\nC\n\nN\n\nA\n\nN\n\nI\n\nF\n\nD\n\nE\n\nT\n\nA\n\nD\n\nI\n\nL\n\nO\n\nS\n\nN\n\nO\n\nC\n\n&\n\nT\n\nR\n\nO\n\nP\n\nE\n\nR\n\nT\n\nN\n\nE\n\nM\n\nE\n\nG\n\nA\n\nN\n\nA\n\nM\n\nP\n\nU\n\nO\n\nR\n\nG\n\nE\n\nH\n\nT\n\nM\n\nO\n\nR\n\nF",

The Group remains confident that it will continue to grow at a faster pace than the relevant market. The forecast long-term growth according to IAL Consultants is around 3 % to 4 % worldwide. For the Group, expected longterm growth of 5 % to 7 % (CAGR) remains unchanged and is also anticipated to be achieved in 2023. The company aims to generate sales of \u20ac 5.5 to 6.0 billion by the end of 2025.\n\nThe Group will continue to increase prices for its customers in order to further increase its earnings and ensure its profitability. The disciplined cost management and focus on highmargin business will also be continued. This includes initiatives to reduce the complexity of processes and workflows and the development of innovative sustainable products and technologies. Assuming that prices for raw materials remain on a moderate upward trend, the Group expects an EBITDA margin at the lower end of the targeted corridor of around 20 % for 2023. In the medium term, the Group is seeking to maintain an EBITDA margin between 20 % and 23 %. The ratio of net debt (including provisions for pensions and similar obligations as well as lease liabilities) to EBITDA should be between 2.5 and 2.7 at the end of 2023. For the business free cash flow, the Group is aiming for a rate relative to sales of 12 % in 2023. The medium-term target is a rate of 14 %.\n\nThe company will continue its earnings-oriented dividend policy and give its shareholders an appropriate share in the company's success.\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n37\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\n\n## GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Executive Board at Symrise AG sees the company as being optimally positioned to continue developing in every division and growth region. A proven strategy will be used to achieve the goals set. The three pillars of the strategy remain unchanged. They stand for the continued improvement of the competitive position and the sustainable expansion of the business:\n\n- Growth: Close cooperation with select customers, particularly as a way to further expand the share of sales in emerging markets.\n- Efficiency: The continuous improvement of processes and the expansion of backward integration with renewable raw materials.\n- Portfolio: Tapping into new markets and market segments beyond the traditional business with flavors and fragrances.\n\nSymrise aims to grow primarily organically. Where it is sensible and creates added value, the Group will make acquisitions or forge strategic alliances to ensure access to new technologies, new markets and customers or ensure that it can obtain sustainable, renewable raw materials.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Corporate Governance Statement has been made available on the Symrise AG website at: https://www.symrise.com/ corporate-governance-statement .",

The future course of business and the results actually achieved by Symrise AG and its a/ffi  liates are subject to a large number of risks and uncertainties and may therefore di/ff er substantially from the forward-looking statements. Many of these factors are outside of Symrise AG's sphere of in/fl uence and cannot be assessed in detail ahead of events. They include, for example, unfavorable development of the global economy, a change in consumer behavior, and changes to laws, regulations and o/ffi  cial guidelines. Should one of these uncertainty factors, named or otherwise, occur or should the assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based prove to be incorrect, the actual results may di/ff er signi/fi cantly from the results anticipated. Symrise undertakes no obli gation to update forward-looking statements contin uously and to adjust them to future events or devel opments.",
