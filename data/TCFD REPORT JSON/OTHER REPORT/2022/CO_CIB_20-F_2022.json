It is possible that the Bank's actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nInformation regarding important factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those in the Bank's forward-looking statements appear in a number of places in this Annual Report, including in Item 3. 'Key Information - D. Risk Factors' and Item 5. 'Operating and Financial Review  and  Prospects'.  These  factors  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  (i)  changes  in  general  economic,  business,  political,  social,  fiscal  or  other conditions in Colombia, or in any of the other countries where the Bank operates; taking into account (A) that despite a partial economic recovery from the  crisis  created  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  economic  challenges  persist  due  to  high  levels  of  inflation  globally  driven  in  part  by  supply  chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions such as the continuing armed conflict in Ukraine, which pose potential impacts such as higher prices for energy raw materials and agricultural items; and (B) an ambitious legal reform agenda that the new government of Colombia is implementing; (ii) changes in capital markets or in markets in general that may affect policies, overall liquidity or attitudes towards lending; (iii) unanticipated increases in financing and  other  costs  or  the  inability  to  obtain  additional  debt  or  equity  financing  on  attractive  terms;  (iv)  continued  increases  in  inflation  or  prolonged inflation,  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  interest  rates  and  unemployment  rates;  (v)  sovereign  risks;  (vi)  liquidity  risks;  (vii)  increases  in delinquencies by the Bank's borrowers; (viii) lack of acceptance of new products or services by the Bank's targeted customers; (ix) competition in the banking, financial services, credit card services, insurance, asset management or remittances businesses or other industries in which the Bank operates; (x) adverse determination of legal or regulatory disputes or proceedings and the consequences thereof; (xi) changes in official policies, regulations and the Colombian government's banking policy as well as changes in laws, regulations or policies in other jurisdictions in which the Bank does business; (xii) factors specific to the Bank, including changes to the estimates and assumptions underlying our financial statements; our success in identifying risks (such as the incidence of loan delinquencies) and managing risks; our inability to achieve our financial and capital targets, which may result in failure to achieve any of the expected benefits of our strategies; a reduction in our credit ratings, which would decrease our funding availability; failure to  achieve  regulatory  stress  testing;  and  changes  to  the  reliability  and  security  of  our  data  management,  data  privacy,  information  and  technology infrastructure, including cyber-attack threats which may impact our ability to serve clients; and (xiii) failure to attract, hire or retain key talent.\n\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are subject to change, and, except as required by law, the Bank does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events arising after the date of this Annual Report.\n\n## PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## Accounting Principles\n\nThe audited consolidated statements of financial position of the Bank as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the audited consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, and related notes (the 'Consolidated Financial Statements') included in this Annual Report were prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and the related interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee ('IFRS IC').

Accordingly, a slowdown in the economic growth rate, periods of negative growth, increases in inflation, changes in economic policy, or future judicial interpretations of policies involving exchange controls and other matters such as currency depreciation, inflation, interest rates, taxation, banking laws and regulations and other political or economic developments in such  jurisdictions  may  affect  the  overall  business  environment  and  may,  in  turn,  negatively  affect  the  Bank's  financial  condition  and  results  of operations. Analysts expect that during 2023 GDP growth in the economies in which the Bank operates will moderate. Colombian growth is expected to decrease from 7.5% in 2022 to 1.3% in 2023. Similarly, growth is expected to decrease from 8% to 4.2% in 2023 in Panama, from 2.5% to 1.5% in El Salvador, and from 3.6% to 3% in Guatemala.\n\nIn particular, the governments of Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala have historically exercised substantial influence on their economies, and in the future, they may implement decisions that could impact the business and results of companies in such countries (including the Bank), market conditions, and prices and rates of return on securities of local issuers (including the Bank's securities). Potential changes in laws, public policies and regulations may cause instability in Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala, and their respective markets. Future developments in government policies could negatively affect the Bank's business and financial condition and the market value of its securities.\n\nIn Colombia, there is uncertainty around the comprehensive reform agenda that the new government is implementing. In particular, a potential reduction of investment and production in the oil sector as a result of energy transition measures could lead to a reduction in exports and foreign exchange inflows to the economy. Furthermore, a potential pension reform could affect the dynamics of private savings could deteriorate the country's current account balance and reduce the supply of funding to the economy and capital markets, and a potential labor reform could increase the cost of the Bank's payroll, along with indirect impacts on the local labor market that may affect employment and the borrowers' repayment capacity.\n\nThe  downgrades  of  El  Salvador's  sovereign  ratings  by  Standard  and  Poor's  to  CCC+,  Moody's  to  Caa3  and  Fitch  to  CC  during  2022  reflects  a deterioration of the country's credit profile. In turn, this has led to an upward pressure on borrowing costs with potential negative effects on public finances. According to Focus Economics, the outstanding amount of public debt in El Salvador is expected to increase from 84.8% in 2021 to more than 90% of GDP in 2026. This in turn will lead to significant financing requirements amid challenging global financial conditions.\n\nThe  adoption  of  Bitcoin  as  El  Salvador  legal  tender  has  led  to  a  deterioration  in  the  relationships  between  El  Salvador's  Government  and  some multilateral organizations, such as IMF, which are a crucial source of financing for the country. In addition, the possible issuance of public debt in this cryptocurrency would expose the government's liabilities and payment commitments to its volatility. Thus, the adoption of Bitcoin not only represents risks for the financial stability of the country, but also potentially will lead to additional pressures on public finances. To date, the adoption of Bitcoin among companies and households in the country continues to be low, reducing the magnitude of the potential risks to which the country is exposed in the short term. Although there may be an impact on the economy in general, there is currently no significant exposure of the financial system to crypto assets.\n\nThe  economies  of  the  countries  where  the  Bank  operates  are  vulnerable  to  external  effects  that  could  be  caused  by  significant  economic difficulties experienced by their major regional trading partners or by more general contagion",

Therefore,  as previously mentioned, analysts expect that during 2023 GDP growth in the economies in which the Bank operates will moderate.\n\nDeterioration in the economic and political situation in neighboring countries could adversely affect the economy and cause instability in Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala by disrupting their diplomatic or commercial relationships with neighboring countries. Any future tensions may cause  political  and  economic  uncertainty,  instability,  market  volatility,  low  confidence  levels  and  higher  risk  aversion  by  investors  and  market participants that may negatively affect economic activity in any of those jurisdictions.\n\nEvents occurring in a market where we do not operate may cause international investors to have an increased risk perception of an entire region or class of investment, which could in turn negatively affect market prices and liquidity of securities issued or owned by the Bank.\n\nThe armed conflict in Ukraine could continue to pose risks to the economic prospects for Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala. One of the most  significant  potential  impacts  would  be  higher  prices  for  energy  raw  materials  and  agricultural  items,  segments  in  which  Ukraine  and  Russia together have a significant share in world production and trade. As a result, consumer inflation rose between 2021 and 2022 from 5.6% to 13.1% in Colombia, from 6.1% to 7.3% in El Salvador, and from 3.1% to 9.2% in Guatemala. Although year-end inflation in Panama moderated from 2.6% in 2021 to 2.1% in 2022, price increases created social unrest in mid 2022.\n\nWhile it is possible that high prices for energy raw materials may positively impact the trade balance, exchange rate and the fiscal balance of Colombia, such high prices would predominantly have an adverse impact on the economies of Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala, which are net importers of fuels. In addition, the decreased availability of certain agricultural items could lead to new pressures on the cost of living in the countries the Bank operates.\n\nIn addition to the factors mentioned above, Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala could be affected by the deceleration of growth and the high levels of inflation that the world economy is expected to experience in 2023. The IMF estimates that global growth will slow from 3.2% in 2022 to 2.7% in  2023,  while  consumer  inflation  will  moderate  from  8.8%  in  2022  to  6.5%  in  2023.  Despite  this  deceleration,  consumer  price  increases  in  many countries  will  remain  above  central  banks'  targets.  This  combination  may  soften  the  external  demand  for  goods  and  services  produced  by  these countries, reduce terms of trade, moderate remittances and investment inflows, keep interest rates high and create additional inflationary pressures. All of the above could affect aggregate income and business dynamics in the countries in which Bancolombia and its subsidiaries operate.\n\n## Colombia and El Salvador have experienced several periods of violence and instability that could affect the economy and the Bank.\n\nColombia has experienced periods of criminal violence over the past five decades, primarily due to the activities of guerilla groups and drug cartels. In 2016, a peace treaty was signed between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (' Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia ' or ' FARC ') and the Colombian government. The implementation process has started; however, the treaty is yet to be fully implemented. There are presently a number of other illegal armed groups in Colombia, such as the National Liberation Army (' Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional ' or ' ELN '), among others, and one of the main purposes of the government elected in year 2022 is to accomplish a series of peace treaties with all the illegal armed groups that still remain in the country. Notwithstanding the implementation of these peace treaties, the successful integration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society may not be achieved. An escalation of violence or drug-related crime may have a negative impact on the Colombian economy and on the Bank as a result of the downgrade of sovereign ratings increasing the funding costs, discouraging foreign investment, and leading to an economic slowdown.",

The suspension of constitutional guarantees has been extended thirteen times, with the most recent suspension occurring from March 17 to April 16, 2023.\n\n## Any  additional  taxes  resulting  from  changes  to  tax  regulations  or  the  interpretation  thereof  in  countries  where  the  Bank  operates,  could adversely affect the Bank's consolidated results.\n\nUncertainty  related  to  tax  legislation  represents  a  constant  risk  for  Bancolombia.  Changes  in  legislation  and  regulations,  as  well  as  developments resulting from court decisions could affect the Bank's tax burdens. For example, such changes may increase tax rates and fees, lead to new taxes, limit deductions and exemptions and eliminate incentives and non-taxed income.\n\nThe Bank does not take aggressive positions on tax law interpretation; however, the national or local tax authorities may not apply the tax law as we expect. Different interpretations of tax regulations could result in future tax audits, litigation, and associated costs, which could negatively affect our results.\n\n## Allegations of corruption against the government, politicians, and the private sector in the countries where we operate could create economic and political uncertainty and could expose us to additional credit risk.\n\nAllegations  of  corruption  against  the  government,  politicians,  and  the  private  sector  in  the  countries  where  we  operate  could  create  economic  and political uncertainty. For example, findings or convictions of illicit conduct committed by such entities or persons or alleged wrongdoings, could have adverse effects on the political and economic stability of the countries where the Bank operates. These adverse political and economic effects may negatively impact our business, by depressing business volumes, reducing our ability to recover amounts we have lent to persons or projects involved in illicit or allegedly illicit conduct.\n\n## Risk Factors relating to the Bank's Business and the Banking Industry\n\n## The Bank is subject to credit risk and estimating exposure to credit risk involves subjective and complex judgments.\n\nA number of our products expose the Bank to credit risk. These products include loans, financial leases, guarantees and lending commitments.\n\nThe  Bank  estimates  and  establishes  reserves  for  credit  risk  and  potential  credit  losses.  This  process  involves  subjective  and  complex  judgments, including projections of economic conditions and assumptions about the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. This process is also subject to human error as the Bank's employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit risk rating to a client, which may result in the Bank's exposure to a higher credit risk than one indicated by the Bank's risk rating system. The Bank may not be able to timely detect these risks before they materialize, or  due  to  limited  resources  or  available  infrastructure,  the  Bank's  employees  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  implement  its  credit  risk  management system, which may increase the Bank's exposure to credit risk. Moreover, the Bank's failure to continuously refine its credit risk management system may result in a higher risk exposure for the Bank, which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.\n\nOverall, if the Bank is unable to effectively control the level of non-performing or poor credit quality loans in the future, or if its loan loss reserves are insufficient to cover future loan losses, the Bank's financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe amount of the Bank's non-performing loans may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond the Bank's control, such as changes in the income levels of the Bank's borrowers, increases in the inflation rate or an increase in interest rates, the impact of macroeconomic trends and political events affecting Colombia and other jurisdictions where the Bank operates or has exposure (especially Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala) or events affecting specific industries. Any of these developments could have a negative effect on the quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, requiring the Bank to increase provisions for loan losses and resulting in reduced profits or in losses.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## The Bank is subject to risks from concentration in its loan portfolio. Problems with one or more of its largest borrowers may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Bank's 20 largest economic groups, on a consolidated basis, represented 112.7% of the Bank's Tier 1 and represented 12.4% of the Bank's loan portfolio. No single group exposure represented more than 1.5% of the loan book. Problems with one or more of the Bank's largest economic groups could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.\n\nThe value of the collateral securing the outstanding principal and interest balance of the Bank's loans may not be sufficient to cover such outstanding principal and interest. In addition, the Bank may be unable to realize the full value of the collateral or guarantees securing the outstanding principal and interest balance of its loans.\n\nThe Bank's loan collateral primarily includes real estate, owned assets used for financial leasing transactions and other assets that are located primarily in Colombia, El Salvador, Panama and Guatemala, the value of which may significantly fluctuate or decline due to factors beyond the Bank's control. Such factors include market factors, environmental risks, macroeconomic factors and political events affecting the local economy. In addition, the Bank may face difficulties in enforcing its rights as a secured creditor. Timing delays, procedural problems enforcing collateral and local protectionism may make foreclosures on collateral and enforcement of judgments difficult. Any decline in the value of the collateral securing the Bank's loans may result in a reduction in the recovery from collateral realization and may have an adverse impact on the Bank's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nDowngrades in the credit ratings of the Bank and its subsidiaries would increase their cost of borrowing funds and make their ability to raise new funds, attract deposits or renew maturing debt more difficult.\n\nThe credit ratings of Bancolombia and its subsidiaries' are an important component of the liquidity profile of the Bank and each of its subsidiaries. The Bank's ability to successfully compete depends on various factors, including the financial stability of each of its entities, as reflected by their credit ratings. A downgrade in the credit ratings of the Bank or its subsidiaries would increase the cost of raising funds from other banks, or in capital markets. Furthermore, purchases of Bancolombia's securities by institutional investors could be reduced if these securities experiment a decline in their credit ratings. The ability of the Bank or its subsidiaries to renew maturing debt could become restricted and the terms for such renewal could become more expensive if their credit ratings were to decline. The Bank's, lenders and counterparties in derivative transactions are also sensitive to the risk of a credit rating downgrade. A downgrade in the credit rating of the Bank or its subsidiaries may adversely affect perception of their financial stability and their ability to raise deposits, which could make each entity less successful when competing for deposits and loans in the marketplace.\n\n## The Bank's results of operations are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.\n\nThe Bank holds a substantial portfolio including loans, deposits, securities, bonds, long-term debt and short-term borrowings that have both fixed and floating interest rates. Therefore, changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margins as well as the value of the debt instruments. Increases in interest rates may reduce the market value of the Bank's debt instruments, leading to smaller gains or larger losses on these investments. Sustained high interest rates have historically discouraged customers from borrowing and have resulted in increased delinquencies in outstanding loans and deterioration in the quality of assets. On the other hand, cuts in interest rates may cause margin compression and lower net interest income as the Bank usually holds more assets than liabilities at variable rates. Decreasing interest rates also may trigger loan prepayments which could negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. Generally, in a declining interest rate environment, prepayment activity increases, reducing the weighted average maturity of the Bank's interest earning assets and adversely affecting its operating results.\n\nPrepayment  risk  also  has  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  the  Bank's  earnings  from  its  credit  card  and  collateralized  mortgage  obligations,  since prepayments  could  shorten  the  weighted  average  life  of  these  portfolios,  which  may  result  in  a  mismatch  in  funding  or  in  reinvestment  of  the prepayment proceeds at lower yields. In addition, these risks could significantly impact the Bank's portfolio as well as portfolios managed by the Bank and owned by third parties. To the extent we experience withdrawals of third-party assets, our asset management revenues and related income could be adversely affected.",

High levels of inflation increase the interest rates, generating effects such as increases in the cost of funding, increases in credit risk, a slowdown in the placement of loans and, the potential reduction of net interest income. Additionally, high levels of inflation reduce the market value of the Bank's debt instruments, while increasing the market risk. Another impact of inflation is its effect on the real interest rate. When the inflation rate is higher than the nominal interest rate, negative real interest rates discourage savings, and increase uncertainty and risk in the loan market and the stock market.\n\nAlthough high levels of inflation  in  2022  increased  interest  rates  and  generated  a  rise  in  the  cost  of  funds,  the  Bank's  net  interest  margin  was  not adversely affected because of the increase in the loan portfolio rate due to its repricing and higher loan disbursements. Despite the increase in interest rates  reducing  the  market  value  of  the  Bank's  debt  instruments,  the  overall  results  were  positive  due  to  the  action  plan  implemented  to  reduce  the portfolio's duration and the impact of the increase on the exchange rate in the forex portfolio.\n\nIt should be noted that the challenge of the inflationary context that Colombia is experiencing is such that the 12-month increase in consumer prices (by CPI) closed 2022 at 13.12%, the maximum record since March 1999. Initially, in the second quarter of 2021 the acceleration of inflation was the result of problems on national roads that complicated the logistics of food distribution and caused production losses that pushed up food prices. Then, there was a sharp increase in the costs of key imported agro-inputs in the second half of 2021 and the conflict in Ukraine put additional pressures, as Russia is one of the main fertilizer producers in the world. With this, food prices continued to grow at an increasing rate until the middle of 2022 and, after that first food-focused inflationary shock, a strong recovery in demand in the economy, a logistics chain hit by lockdowns in China, the increase in the prices of many other commodities and the devaluation of the Colombian peso led to a broader-based inflation across all groups of goods and services, beyond just food.\n\n## The Bank is subject to market risk and its income from its proprietary trading activities is highly volatile.\n\nThe Bank is directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk, or the risk of losses in positions arising from movements in market prices, is inherent in the products and instruments associated with our operations, including securities, bonds, proprietary trading in assets and liabilities  and  derivatives,  among  others.  Changes  in  market  conditions  that  may  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  include fluctuations  in  interest  and  currency  exchange  rates,  securities  prices,  and  changes  in  the  implied  volatility  of  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency exchange rates, among others.\n\nThe Bank derives a portion of its profits from its proprietary trading activities. Income from this activity is highly volatile and depends on numerous factors beyond the Bank's control, such as the general market environment, overall market trading activity, interest rate levels, fluctuations in exchange rates, oil prices and general market volatility. A significant decline in the Bank's trading income, or the incurrence of a trading loss, could adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank has significant exposure to sovereign risk, and especially Colombian and Salvadoran sovereign risk, and the Bank's results could be adversely affected by decreases in the value of its sovereign debt instruments.\n\nThe Bank's debt portfolio is primarily composed of sovereign debt securities. Therefore, the Bank's results are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risk associated with sovereign debt, in particular risk associated with securities issued or guaranteed by the Colombian Government. As of December 31,  2022,  the  Bank's  total  debt  instruments  represented  7.76%  of  its  total  assets,  and  25.79%  of  these  securities  were  issued  or  guaranteed  by  the Colombian Government. A significant decline in the value of the securities issued or guaranteed by the Colombian Government could adversely affect the Bank's debt portfolio and consequently the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\nIn  addition,  during  the  last  year,  the  sovereign  risk  associated  with  the  securities  issued  or  guaranteed  by  the  Colombian,  Panama  and  El  Salvador Governments have increased. Colombia, Panama and El Salvador 5-year credit default swap, credit derivative contracts that enable investors to swap credit risk on a company, a country or another entity, showed an",

The securities issued or guaranteed by the governments of Colombia, Panama and El Salvador represented 25.79%, 5.45% and 9.58% of the Bank's total debt instruments, as of December 31, 2022, and a significant decline in the value of these securities could affect the Bank's debt instruments portfolio.\n\n## The Bank is subject to credit risk with respect to its  non-traditional  banking  businesses  including  investing  in  securities  and  entering  into derivatives transactions.\n\nNon-  traditional  sources  of  credit  risk  can  arise  from,  among  other  things:  investing  in  securities,  entering  into  derivative  contracts  under  which counterparties have obligations to make payments to the Bank, executing securities, or currency trades from the Bank's proprietary trading desk that fail to settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty or system failures by clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. A significant increase in exposure to any of these non-traditional risks, or a significant decline in the credit quality or the insolvency of any of the counterparties, could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank is subject to market, liquidity, operational and structural risks associated with its derivative transactions.\n\nThe Bank enters into derivative transactions for hedging purposes on its own account and for its customers. The Bank is subject to market, liquidity (due to the difficulty in closing out a trade prior to maturity if bid-ask spreads are too large, representing a significant cost) and operational risk associated with these transactions, including basis risk (the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost) and credit or default risk (the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder). In addition, the market practice and documentation for derivative transactions is less developed in the jurisdictions where the Bank operates as compared to other more economically developed countries, and the court systems in such jurisdictions have limited experience in dealing with issues related  to  derivative  transactions.  As  a  result,  there  are  increased  operating  and  structural  risks  associated  with  derivatives  transactions  in  these jurisdictions.\n\nIn  addition,  the  execution  and  performance  of  derivatives  transactions  depend  on  the  Bank's  ability  to  develop  adequate  control  and  administrative systems, and to hire and retain qualified personnel. Moreover, the Bank's ability to adequately monitor, analyze and report these derivative transactions depends, to a great extent, on its information technology systems. These factors may further increase the risks associated with these transactions and could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank is subject to cyber-security risks.\n\nBancolombia  uses  the  acronym  CIA,  which  stands  for  confidentiality,  integrity,  and  availability  and  represents  the  components  of  its  information security system. The Bank aims to protect these components by managing the risks of data loss, identity theft, reputational damage, and legal liability. The  materialization  of  these  risks  could  lead  to  data  recovery  costs,  loss  of  customers,  monetary  fines,  and  the  possible  shutdown  of  services  by regulators. For this reason, the Bank's cybersecurity risk assessment includes providers, new hybrid working models (remote and hybrid working for employees), cloud infrastructure, and agile development, among other factors.\n\nThe Bank works alongside multiple vendors, using third-party software, developing products, and relying on their systems. These external vendors provide new services and technologies, such as Blockchain, Banking as a Service and AI, however they also introduce significant risks to the company's information security. Reliance on third-party business partners could spread malware through the products and services across the supply chain. For instance, a ransomware attack can cause costly disruptions to operations and the permanent loss of critical information, leading to the loss of clients and the costs of new infrastructure. Additionally, IT personnel managing Blockchain infrastructure could exploit security vulnerabilities in the process of exchanging crypto assets, and manipulate data, thereby causing financial loss.\n\nBancolombia also faces the risk of cybercriminals who exploit new vulnerabilities in software before vendors release a fix for such software. These attacks,  known as zero-day attacks, are occurring more frequently and represent a threat to the organization due to the exposure of services on the internet.",

Notwithstanding  this,  the  Bank  continues  to  face  the  challenge  of  early  and  continuous identification and mitigation of risks related to the availability of such services. These risks can generate negative impacts on service availability that could damage the reputation of the organization, as well as result in monetary losses and sanctions.\n\nSimilarly, new remote and hybrid work models increase the cybersecurity risk of data manipulation and unauthorized access to sensitive information. The main reason for this is that working remotely involves new challenges in managing remote software updates and controlling backdoors that could generate data breaches. The use of home devices and unprotected networks for business purposes leaves employees and the organization open to email phishing,  social  engineering  and  the  use  of  vulnerable  applications.  As  a  result,  the  remote  workforce  represents  an  increased  risk  of  insider cybersecurity risk resulting from malicious behavior or negligence. For example, unauthorized disclosures of sensitive data (whether intentional or not) can result in financial penalties and lawsuits.\n\nThe adoption of emerging technologies will be paramount for the strategic growth of the organization. However, these technologies can impact the organization  from  a  reputational  and  legal  perspective,  as  well  as  in  terms  of  the  quality  of  services.  Therefore,  cyber  risks  associated  with  these technologies,  require  greater  effort  in  the  way  the  organization  manages  and  faces  these  threats.  The  bank  is  committed  to  the  early  detection, prioritization, and closure of vulnerabilities, as well as the implementation of holistic processes that contribute to the identification and management of cyber risk factors, creating a resilient culture to protect against cyber threats and increase customer trust in the bank.\n\nFor further information see ' ITEM 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.9. Cybersecurity framework '.\n\n## Our financial results may be negatively affected by changes to assumptions supporting the value of our goodwill.\n\nWe test for impairment, at least annually, the goodwill that we have recognized with respect to the financial positions of our operating segments. Our impairment test in respect of the assets recognized as of December 31, 2022, indicated that our goodwill balances are not impaired. The impairment test requires that we make assumptions regarding estimated earnings, discount rates and long-term growth rates impacting the recoverable amount of the goodwill associated with each operating segment and on estimates of the carrying amounts of the operating segments to which the goodwill relates. Additionally,  the  impairment  test  requires  that  we  analyze  the  macroeconomic  and  political  environment  of  the  geographies  in  which  each  cashgenerating unit (' CGUs ') is located. If the actual results in future periods deviate from the earnings and other assumptions on which our impairment testing is based, the value of the goodwill in any one or more of our businesses may become impaired in the future, resulting in expense charges.\n\nThe downgrade of El Salvador's sovereign rating, the weakening of public institutions, the concentration of power in the presidency and the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, added additional uncertainty to the goodwill impairment test in respect of Banagr\u00edcola S.A. Accordingly, in connection with the evaluation of economic budgets, forecasts and other assumptions commonly used to determine the recoverable value of goodwill, the Bank considered various  macroeconomic  circumstances  and  ran  multiple  weighted  scenarios  for  assessing  the  expected  future  cash  flows  for  that  CGU,  taking  into consideration the macroeconomic and political environment of El Salvador. However, depending on the evolution of this situation and the uncertainty thereof, there could be an adverse impact on goodwill in future years.\n\nFor further information, see Note 2. Significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risks relating to the use of quantitative models and information may adversely impact the Bank's business strategies and results.\n\nIn recent years, the use of mathematical and statistical models has spread rapidly in different areas of the Bank. The use of these models brings benefits such as objectivity, automation and efficiency, but also entails costs related to the resources required for their development as well as heightened risks.",

Methodological  errors  in  the  design  of  the  model  such  as  volatility  in  the  estimates,  inadequate  simplifications  or  approximations,  erroneous hypotheses, bias identification/fixing and incorrect design.\n- 3. The  inappropriate  use  of  the  model  which  may  include  the  application  outside  of  its  intended  use,  implementation  errors,  lack  of  updating  or recalibration.\n\nThe use of models always carries model risk, which is defined as the potential for adverse consequences, including losses, from decisions based on incorrect  or  misused  models.  Decisions  based  on  inadequate  models  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  implementation  of  business  strategies,  risk identification and measurement, position valuation, stress testing, capital adequacy assessment, customer asset management, compliance with internal limits or compliance with financial or regulatory information requirements and issuance of public information.\n\n## The Bank is exposed to ESG risks that could affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWhile the  Paris  Climate  Protection  Agreement  and  the  United  Nations'  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  are  not  industry-specific,  other initiatives are contemplated that specifically involve financial services, challenging the Bank's strategies to incorporate ESG factors.\n\nThere is also an increasing focus on topics such as climate change, social inequality, and corporate misconduct, which is generating rapid changes in market sentiment and could have adverse impacts on the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe number of investors demanding sustainable products has been increasing significantly around the world. This focus on ESG factors is influencing the reputational and business success of financial institutions in the countries where the Bank operates.\n\nIn recent years social inequities have intensified due to the lack of access to opportunities and the meeting of basic needs, generating gaps in equity, diversity, and inclusion and exacerbating the risk of increasing polarization and resentment within societies resulting in both peaceful and non-peaceful demonstrations against institutions.\n\nIn terms of corporate misconduct, in recent years the importance of good governance practices has been highlighted, associated with the evaluation and supervision of non-financial and emerging risks, to comprehensively manage risks, identifying, monitoring, and controlling their impacts.\n\nFinally, among the ESG issues, climate change is a critical concern, it exposes the Bank to physical and transition risks, which impact or exacerbate other typical risks, such as credit, market, liquidity, operational, and reputational risk.\n\nThe Bank is vulnerable to financial risks related to the consequences of climate change through physical impacts arising from the increase in the frequency and severity of climate events such as droughts, storms, floods and heatwaves as well as events that cause gradual deterioration such as changes in precipitation levels and rising sea levels. Such events and long-term shifts may damage, destroy or otherwise impact the value or productivity of the Bank's properties and other assets, including the Bank's branches, data centers and operations; reduce the availability of insurance; and/or disrupt the Bank's operations and other activities through prolonged outages. It may also have a significant impact on our customers, which could amplify credit risk by diminishing borrowers' repayment capacity or collateral values, and other businesses and counterparties with whom we transact, which could have a broader impact on the economy, supply chains and distribution networks. This has the potential to lead to reputational risk for products or services or clients that may damage the environment. Environmental risks can also have an impact on the value of the guarantees and properties received in settlement of payment in case they are affected by contaminated soils that might require investment in environmental decontamination processes and payment of environmental fines or sanctions resulting in losses for the Bank.",

These risks may result from changes in policies; laws and regulations; technologies; and/or market preferences to address climate change. Such changes could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and our reputation, in addition to having a similar impact on our customers. Banking regulators and supervisory authorities, investors and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their customers, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies  as  the  economy  transitions  to  a  less  carbon-intensive  environment,  the  Bank  faces  regulatory  risk  of  increasing  focus  on  our  resilience  to climate-related risks, including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk, severe weather events that cause macro-economic shocks may increase liquidity demand and refinancing risk.\n\nFinally, if the Banks fails to appropriately measure and manage the various risks resulting from climate change or fails to adapt its strategy and business model to the changing regulatory requirements and market expectations, its reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Changes  in  banking  regulations  in  Colombia  and  in  other  jurisdictions  in  which  the  Bank  operates  could  adversely  affect  the  Bank's consolidated results.\n\nBanking laws and regulations, or their official interpretation, in Colombia and in other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates, have a material effect on the Bank's business and operations. Banking laws and regulations may change frequently, and changes may be adopted, enforced or interpreted in a manner that may have an adverse effect on the Bank's business.\n\nIn August 2022, Colombia shifted to a new government with a political agenda that could affect the financial sector and have impact on capital-intensive industries.  Additionally,  post-pandemic  social  and  economic  difficulties,  and  the  increasing  tendency  to  improve  financial  consumer  protection standards among legislators, regulators and higher courts, could result in additional operational costs and a reduction in the Bank's income.\n\nThe government, through Decree 1533 of 2022, adopted the Basel Committee's international standard on Large Exposures (LEX), which from 2025, will  modify  the  current  rules  of  legal  lending  limits  and  establish  a  25%  exposure  limit  of  Tier  1  Capital  with  respect  to  the  same  counterparty  of economic groups or connected counterparties. Stress testing has been carried out to evaluate how these new limits might affect corporate clients. No material impact has been observed to date. In addition, the Colombian government is considering a new regulatory proposal which would introduce criteria for the purposes of defining a 'counterparty' in the context of banking institutions.\n\n## Future restrictions on interest rates or banking fees could negatively affect the Bank's profitability.\n\nIn prior years, the regulators of the jurisdictions in which the Bank operates have considered various legislative and/or regulatory initiatives regarding interest  rates  and  banking  fees.  Although  most  of  such  initiatives  have  not  been  adopted  in  the  past,  there  may  be  renewed  attempts  to  impose restrictions on interest rates or banking fees in the future. If we are prohibited or otherwise limited (including by limits with respect to pricing) from continuing to charge our clients for certain products or services, including specified types of transactions, or from imposing charges for products or services that might be introduced in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.",

While today responsibility for compliance is covered by different divisions of the Bank that work as an integrated compliance framework, the Bank is in the process of implementing a special unit for overseeing and ensuring regulatory compliance in general. To ensure compliance for personal data law, the Bank has developed a comprehensive data protection program.\n\nThe risk of non-compliance or non-fulfillment of these laws and regulations may result in significant sanctions.\n\nThe Bank may not be able to prevent all risks associated with regulatory compliance or detect all instances of non-compliance with the regulations described above. Any failure by the Bank to detect and prevent the practices in a timely manner could damage the Bank's reputation and cause it to incur substantial fines and penalties which could adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank's policies and procedures may not be able to detect money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption or other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis.\n\nThe  Bank  is  required  to  comply  with  applicable  anti-money  laundering,  anti-terrorism  and  anti-corruption  laws  and  regulations.  These  laws  and regulations require the Bank, among other things, to adopt and enforce ' know your customer ' policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions  to  the  applicable  authorities.  While  the  Bank  has  adopted  policies  and  procedures  (including  ultimate  beneficial  owners  identification) aimed at preventing and detecting the use of its banking network for money laundering and terrorism financing activities and by terrorists and terroristrelated  organizations  and  individuals  generally,  as  the  methods  used  by  criminals  evolve  and  become  increasingly  sophisticated,  such  policies  and procedures may not completely eliminate the risk that the Bank may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption or other illegal or improper activities.\n\nThe Bank is subject to laws and regulations that prohibit corrupt payments to public officials and other forms of corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  Colombian  regulations  on  transnational  bribery,  domestic  bribery  and  others  forms  of  corruption.  The  Bank  has  anticorruption  policies  and  procedures,  aimed  at  preventing,  detecting  and  responding  to  acts  of  corruption  potentially  committed  by  our  directors, employees, suppliers and other relevant constituencies. These include anti-corruption policy, training and reporting channels such as the Ethics Line, monitoring, internal investigations, and sanctions. While this system is designed to prevent and detect corrupt behavior, it does not completely eliminate the risk that the Bank's directors, employees, suppliers and other relevant counterparts may engage in corrupt practices.\n\nIf the Bank fails to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, it may face fines, penalties or other liabilities including restrictions on its ability to  conduct business.

In the event of non-compliance with applicable regulations, the Bank could be subject to fines, sanctions or the revocation of licenses or permits to operate its business. In Colombia, for instance, if the Bank encounters significant financial problems or becomes insolvent or in danger of becoming insolvent, banking authorities would have the power to take over the Bank's management and operations.

The financial sector is particularly vulnerable to different forms of fraud, due to the ease of monetization and the conversion of proceeds of fraud into cash, including through new technological applications used by customers. The products and services that involve transfers or withdrawals of cash are constantly affected by new fraud schemes.\n\nThe Bank has an extensive network of third-party providers necessary for the provision of financial services. The failure or inability of financial service providers  to  adequately  manage  risks  may  negatively  affect  the  Bank's  operations  by  increasing  costs  or  compromising  the  confidentiality  of information, the quality of services, or the continuity of products or certain operations critical to the success of the business.\n\nAs our client-base continues to grow, there is increased pressure on the technological systems developed to manage such growth. For example, the offering of services through digital channels and the introduction of new business models derived from Banking as a Service (BaaS)), assist in managing the rapid growth in customers. However, these services also create pressure on the technological systems, as there is an increased possibility of technical errors, obsolescence, and imbalance between the speed of growth and the needs of the business.\n\nDue to the nature of financial activities and their reliance on systems for the processing, authorization and registration of operations, the Bank may experience interruptions and technological failures in the operations that affect the availability and quality of products and channels to customers, in both live and digital scenarios.\n\n## Acquisitions and strategic alliances may not perform in accordance with expectations or may disrupt the Bank's operations and adversely affect its profitability.\n\nAn element of the Bank's business strategy is to identify and pursue growth-enhancing strategic opportunities. The Bank may base assessments of potential  acquisitions  and  alliances  on  assumptions  with  respect  to  operations,  profitability  and  other  matters  that  may  subsequently  prove  to  be incorrect, and any future acquisitions, investments and alliances may not produce the anticipated synergies or perform in accordance with the Bank's expectations which could adversely affect its operations and profitability. In particular, the Bank holds a minority financial investment, through a private equity fund, in an infrastructure project located in Colombia. In previous years, the main shareholder of the project and the concession company faced negative press related to irregular practices. If any of these situations result in sanctions or convictions then the company in which the Bank indirectly holds a minority stake, which is the holder of a toll road concession, may suffer a reputational harm, which in turn may have an adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition and the return on the Bank's investment.\n\n## The Bank is subject to increasing competition which may adversely affect the results of its operations.\n\nThe Bank operates in a highly competitive environment and management expects increasing competition in the jurisdictions where the Bank operates.\n\nIntensified  merger  activity  in  the  financial  services  industry  has  produced  larger,  better  capitalized  and  more  geographically  diverse  firms  that  are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. Also, the emergence of new financial technologies (known as ' FinTech '), unregulated financial intermediaries (known as ' shadow banking ') and the recent enactment of regulations aimed at enabling non-Colombian residents (other than individuals) to offer loans in COP, may increase competition for the Bank.\n\nThe Bank's ability to maintain its competitive position depends mainly on (i) its ability to fulfill new customers' needs through the development of new products and services, (ii) the ability to offer adequate services and strengthen its customer base through cross-selling and (iii) the ability to attract and retain human talent. For that reason, the Bank's business will be adversely affected if the Bank is not able to maintain efficient service strategies.",

Additionally, in March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that the publication of LIBOR on a representative basis will cease for the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings immediately after December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately after June 30, 2023. This announcement may trigger future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks or lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to assets and liabilities linked to the calculation of LIBOR. For more information, see Item 5 ' Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - B. Liquidity and Capital Resources - B.1 Liquidity and Funding '.\n\nAny failure by market participants, such as the Bank to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in disruption of the financial and capital markets. In addition, the transition process to an alternative reference rate could impact the Bank's business, financial condition or result of operations, as a result of:\n\n- \u25cf An adverse impact in pricing, liquidity, value, return and trading for a broad array of financial products, loans and derivatives that are included in the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\n- \u25cf Extensive changes to internal processes and documentation that contain references to LIBOR or use formulas that depend on LIBOR.\n- \u25cf Disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in LIBOR-based products such as fallback language or other related provisions.\n- \u25cf The transition and development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition the Bank's risk management processes from LIBORbased products to those based on one or more alternative reference rates in a timely manner; and\n- \u25cf An increase in prepayments of LIBOR-linked loans by the Bank's clients.\n\nFrom January 2022, the Bank began to offer products indexed to the SOFR rate and determined not to offer new products indexed to the LIBOR rate.\n\n## The Bank's ability to attract and retain specialized talent could impact some business objectives.\n\nThe  current  economic  landscape  requires  workforces  to  exhibit  new  skills  and  attributes  such  as  creativity,  innovation  and  flexibility,  which  are necessary to adapt the Bank's operations to constant technological advances, and to update the Bank's business models and strategies to develop new products  and  services.  To  respond  to  these  trends,  many  companies,  including  financial  institutions  such  as  the  Bank,  are  struggling  to  engage employees  with  specialized  knowledge  in  a  variety  of  technological  information  areas,  including  data  science,  quantitative  resources,  information security and other technical areas, in which it is becoming more difficult to acquire and retain staff on a cost-effective basis.\n\nThe Bank's strategic objectives are linked to their human talent. Specifically, the development of new products, services and digital tools demands that the Bank's human talent have specialized capabilities to carry out the relevant process, enabling the Bank to achieve competitive advantages.\n\nWhile  the  Bank  has  implemented  strategies  to  attract  and  retain  experienced  and  skilled  professionals,  the  lack  of  a  specialized  workforce  to  fill positions that require this kind of knowledge in various areas could negatively affect the Bank's ability to deal with future challenges, slow the digital business strategy execution, including development of new products and affect the Bank's results of operations.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Digital misinformation could adversely affect the Bank's reputation as well as its operational and financial results.\n\nThe increase in digital interconnectedness has increased the spread and distribution of digital content across social media networks. References to the Bank increased by over 11% in 2022 compared to 2021. The Bank was mentioned in mediums such as, texts messages, photos, audio, and videos. Some of these references to the Bank were used with the intent to, among other purposes, commit fraud. The spread and distribution of digital content in 2022 is 220% higher than it was in 2019, prepandemic. Managing the risk of digital misinformation remains challenging as the spread and distribution of digital content will not return to pre-COVID times.\n\nSuch digital misinformation is related to inaccurate, exaggerated, or untrue information which increases negative sentiment towards the brands that can impact organizations, such as the Bank, if used to blackmail or defame the Bank's reputation to negatively affect the trust of customers and other interest groups in the financial services industry. Such developments could lead to reduced business for the Bank which would negatively affect the operational, economic, and reputational performance of the Bank.\n\n## The Bank may be exposed to increased costs and liabilities in the event of the failure of its services providers to perform their obligations under key services contracts.\n\nThe  Bank  enters  into  contracts  with  third  parties  who  provide  certain  key  services  that  are  essential  to  its  business.  These  services  include  online banking platforms, data processing and payment services, clearing and settlement services, software for processing credit and debit card services, and technological infrastructure, among others. The Bank faces the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on such  third-party  vendors  for  certain  components  of  its  systems.  While  the  Bank  conducts  due  diligence  prior  to  engaging  with  third  party  service providers and performs ongoing monitoring of vendor controls, it does not control their operations. If any of the Bank's key service providers fail to fulfill any of their contractual obligations or causes disruptions in services, (including, failure to handle current or higher volumes, or poor performance of services and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations), the Bank's ability to conduct its businesses could be adversely affected and could also negatively impact its results of operations and financial position. In addition, the Bank may be required to incur significant additional costs to find  replacement  providers.  Furthermore,  the  unavailability  of  the  services  provided  by  some  technology  and  other  vendors  could  result  in  the unavailability of certain channels through which our clients execute transactions with us until a replacement provider is engaged, which could result in lost revenue, additional costs and, potentially, adverse regulatory consequences and reputational harm.\n\n## The Bank's businesses rely heavily on data collection, processing and storage systems, the failure of which could materially and adversely affect the effectiveness of its risk management, reputation and internal control system as well as its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAll of the Bank's principal businesses are highly dependent on the ability to timely collect and process a large amount of financial and other information at  its  various  digital  and  physical  channels  across  numerous markets, at a time when transaction processes have become increasingly complex with increasing  volume. The proper functioning of financial control, accounting or other data collection and processing systems is critical to the Bank's businesses and to its ability to compete effectively.\n\nA  partial  or  complete  failure  of  any  of  these  primary  systems  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  Bank's  decision-making  process,  its  risk management and internal control systems, the quality of its service, and the Bank's ability to respond on a timely basis to changing market conditions. If the Bank cannot maintain effective data collection, processing, storage and management systems, its business operations, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe Bank is also dependent on information systems to operate its website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. The Bank may experience operational problems with its information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer hackers or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of its systems could cause information, including data related to customer requests and other client information, to be lost, compromised, or to be delivered to the Bank's clients with delays or errors, which could reduce demand for the",

To guarantee service continuity, the Bank plans and implements exercises related to business continuity and disaster recovery as well as cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities' management, according to internal and external control areas requirements. There can be no assurance that these measures will successfully eliminate or substantially mitigate the risk associated with failure of our data collection, processing, and storage systems.\n\n## The Bank is subject to operational and strategic risks associated with new services on digital platforms such as Banking as a Service (BaaS) and Open Banking.\n\nThe financial services industry is undergoing massive digital disruption due to market expectations, which include new digital services and changes in regulation  and  business  models  allowing  third-party  alliances.  The  development  of  new  services  on  digital  platforms  creates  challenges  in  risk management which may generate economic and reputational impacts.\n\nAmong the strategic risks are the non-traditional new competitors and their ability to gain traction in the new services and digital platforms during initial development. Other risks arising from this evolution are the occurrence of fraud, failures in processes, legal compliance and data protection due to the increasing initiatives related to services on digital platforms in which data, processes, and business functionalities are made available in an ecosystem of banks, customers, and third parties.\n\n## Risks Relating to the Preferred Shares and the ADSs.\n\n## Preemptive rights may not be available to holders of American Depositary Receipts (' ADRs ') evidencing ADSs.\n\nThe Bank's by-laws and Colombian law require that, whenever the Bank issues new shares of any outstanding class, it must offer the holders of each class  of  shares  (including  holders  of  ADRs)  the  right  to  purchase  a  number  of  shares  of  such  class  sufficient  to  maintain  their  existing  percentage ownership of the aggregate capital stock of the Bank. These rights are called preemptive rights. United States holders of ADRs may not be able to exercise their preemptive rights through The Bank of New York Mellon, which acts as depositary (the ' Depositary ') for the Bank's ADR facility, unless a  registration  statement  under  the  Securities  Act  is  effective  with  respect  to  such  rights  and  class  of  shares  or  an  exemption  from  the  registration requirement thereunder is available. The Bank is obligated to file a registration statement or find a corresponding exemption only if it determines to extend the rights to holders of the ADRs. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Bank intends to consider at the time of any rights offering the costs and potential liabilities associated with any such registration statement, the benefits to the Bank from enabling the holders of the ADRs to exercise those rights and any other factors deemed appropriate at the time before it makes a decision as to whether to file a registration statement. Accordingly, the Bank may in some cases decide not to file a registration statement.\n\nUnder the deposit agreement between the Bank and the Depositary, only the Depositary is entitled to exercise preemptive rights, and the Depositary has no  obligation  to  make  available  preemptive  rights  to  holders  of  ADRs.  If  the  Bank  offers  or  causes  to  be  offered  to  the  holders  of  any  deposited securities, including preferred shares of the Bank, any rights to subscribe for additional preferred shares of the Bank or any rights of any other nature, the Depositary has discretion as to the procedure to be followed in making such rights available to any holders of ADRs or in disposing of such rights on behalf of any holders of ADRs and making the net proceeds available to such holders of ADRs. If by the terms of such rights offering or for any other reason, the Depositary does not either make such rights available to any holders of ADRs or dispose of such rights and make the net proceeds available to such holders of ADRs, then the Depositary will allow the rights to lapse. Whenever the rights are sold or lapse, the equity interests of the holders of ADRs will be proportionately diluted.",

The  Central  Bank  maintains  the  power  to  intervene  in  the  exchange  market  in  order  to consolidate or dispose of international reserves, and to control any volatility in the exchange rate. From time to time, and in particular during 2022, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Colombian peso and the U.S. dollar. Unforeseen events in the international markets, fluctuations in interest rates, volatility of the oil price in the international markets, or changes in capital flows, may cause exchange rate instability that could generate sharp movements in the value of the peso. Because a portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in, or indexed to, foreign currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, sharp movements in exchange rates may negatively impact our results. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact the value of dividends paid to holders of our ADSs as well as the market price and liquidity of ADSs.\n\n## The Bank's preferred shares have limited voting rights.\n\nThe Bank's corporate affairs are governed by its by-laws and Colombian law. Under the Bank's by-laws and Colombian law, the Bank's preferred stockholders may have fewer rights than stockholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction. Under the Bank's by-laws and Colombian corporate law, holders of preferred shares (and, consequently, holders of ADRs) have no voting rights in respect of preferred shares, other than in limited circumstances as described in ' Item 10. Additional Information - B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Voting Rights - Preferred Shares '. Holders of the Bank's preferred shares, including holders of ADRs, are not entitled to vote for the election of directors or to influence the Bank's management policies.\n\n## Holders of the Bank's ADRs may encounter difficulties in the exercise of dividend and voting rights.\n\nHolders of the Bank's ADRs may encounter difficulties in the exercise of some of their rights with respect to the shares underlying ADRs. If the Bank makes a distribution to holders of underlying shares in the form of securities, the Depositary is allowed, in its discretion, to sell those securities on behalf of ADR holders and instead distribute the net proceeds to the ADR holders. Also, even in those limited instances in which the preferred shares represented  by  the  ADRs  have  the  power  to  vote,  under  some  circumstances,  ADR  holders  may  not  be  able  to  vote  by  giving  instructions  to  the depositary. This may occur if ADR holders do not receive from the Depositary a notice of meeting sufficiently prior to the instruction date to ensure that the  Depositary  will  vote  the  preferred  shares  represented  by  the  ADRs  in  accordance  with  instructions  received  from  such  holders.  There  are  no circumstances in which holders of ADRs may vote in a way other than by providing instructions to the Depositary.\n\n## Relative illiquidity of the Colombian securities markets may impair the ability of an ADR holder to sell preferred shares.\n\nThe Bank's common and preferred shares are listed on the Colombian Securities Exchange, which is relatively small and illiquid compared to securities exchanges in major financial centers. In addition, a small number of issuers represent a disproportionately large percentage of market capitalization and trading volume on the Colombian Securities Exchange. A liquid trading market for the Bank's securities might not develop on the Colombian Securities Exchange. A limited trading market could impair the ability of an ADR holder to sell preferred shares (obtained upon withdrawal of such shares from the ADR facility) on the Colombian Securities Exchange in the amount and at the price and time such holder desires and could increase the volatility of the price of the ADRs.\n\n## Changes in Colombia's tax regime may affect ADRs tax treatment.\n\nADRs do not have the same tax treatment as other  equity  investments  in  Colombia.  ADRs  represent  Bancolombia's  preferred  shares  and  are  held through a fund of foreign capital in Colombia which is subject to a specific tax regulatory regime. Accordingly, the applicable law in Colombia to equity investments, in particular, those relating to dividends and profits from sale, do not apply to ADRs, including the Bank's ADRs.",

All  the  SEC  filings  made  electronically  by registrants including Bancolombia can be accessed at www.sec.gov.\n\n## RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## Acquisition of additional interest in the 'FONDO INMOBILIARIO COLOMBIA' (Real Estate Fund)\n\nOn August 22, 2022, Bancolombia entered into an agreement with PSPIB COLCONDOR S.A.S. for the acquisition of an additional interest of 30.40% of the outstanding participation units in Fondo de Capital Privado Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia FIC, a real estate fund. As a result of the acquisition, Bancolombia became the owner of the 80.32% of the total  units  in  Fondo  Inmobiliario  Colombia,  which  is  one  of  the  largest  real  estate  funds  in Colombia.\n\n## Authorization from the Financial Superintendency of Colombia to form NEQUI S.A Financial Company\n\nOn July, 2022, the SFC authorized the establishment of Nequi S.A. Financial Company. The new company was incorporated in September 2022 and is wholly owned by Grupo Bancolombia, but will operate as an independent entity from Bancolombia S.A., once the SFC authorizes its operation. In order to obtain the referred operating license, it has been stablished, since 2022, a Project Management Office which purpose is to fulfill the SFC requirements regarding technology, processes, policies, among others.  Those requirements are part of the scope that includes Anti-money laundering policies, risk management, accounting and tax policies, information security and cybersecurity, and compliance programs in general. Once the previous conditions are met, Nequi will apply for the operating license, which is estimated on the second half of year 2023.",

This application offers a service experience that enables agile mobilization of resources, adapted to the client needs. It allows persons to open a savings account from their mobile phones, mobilize and manage their resources, and make transactions by accessing different services offered in the application by Nequi itself or third-party allies. As part of the process, the next step will be obtaining the operating license that will enable Nequi to operate as a 100% digital financing company.\n\n## Commencement of operations as Broker-Dealer and Registered Investment Advisor in the United States\n\nOn August 10, 2022, Bancolombia started the operations of its subsidiaries in the State of Florida, Bancolombia Capital LLC and Bancolombia Capital Advisers  LLC,  as  broker-dealer  and  registered  investment  adviser,  respectively.  The  products  and  services  that  these  entities  offer  are  performing transactions on different types of capital markets assets, derivatives and foreign exchange, as well as portfolio management on a discretionary or nondiscretionary basis, among others.\n\n## PUBLIC TAKEOVER OFFERS\n\nIn 2022, and as of the date of this Annual Report, there have been no public takeover offers by third parties with respect to the Bank's shares or by the Bank with respect to other companies' shares.\n\n## CAPITAL ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\nDuring 2022, total capital expenditures amounted to COP 402.7 billion. Such investments were mainly focused on fixed assets driven by investments in distribution channels (COP 122.9 billion), and on strategic projects related to digital transformation and technology (COP 102.8 billion).\n\nIn  2023,  the  Bank  expects  to  invest  approximately  COP  469.9  billion  mainly  focused  on  the  investment  in  fixed  assets,  and  on  the  evolution  and transformation of products, channels, technological infrastructure, and cybersecurity, as part of the Bank's strategic projects. These figures represent only an estimate and may change because of the continuing assessment by the Bank of its project portfolio. No assurance can be given that all such capital expenditures will be made and, if made, that such expenditures will be in the amounts currently expected.\n\nIt is possible that in the medium-term capital expenditures associated with fixed assets and technology will show a slower growth. Mainly explained by the current trend of remote work and because of the evolution of the hiring models with technology providers. The first decreases the investment in buildings and administrative headquarters, and the second evolves towards a hiring modality of services such as software which includes not only the use of licenses but also updates, maintenance, support and charging for use. The above does not necessarily represent a decrease in investments.",

This process will involve the following two stages: (i)  formation  of  the  financing  company,  consisting  of  the  incorporation  upon  registration  of  the  public  deed  of  incorporation (which has been completed according to the authorization granted by SFC) and operational authorization procedure before the SFC (in process); and (ii) once the operational authorization is obtained, the assignment of assets, and contracts corresponding to Nequi's business from the Bank to the newly incorporated financing company.

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nNew Fund Renta Alternativo Global: Bancolombia launched an alternative assets fund, which invests in infrastructure, real estate and credit assets. The fund also invests globally and allows our clients to have some periodic exit periods. Morgan Stanley is an advisor for the investment process and is a manager with extensive experience in this area.\n\nBancolombia Pay: In 2022, the Bank launched the digital wallet as a service through application programming interfaces (API). This service includes two main functionalities; it allows customers to synchronize their Bancolombia savings account with a third-party's digital wallet and then allows the making of one-click payments within the third-party's platform. In October 2022, our first client completed its integration to this service, launching to the market its own digital wallet for their customers. We are currently supporting the integration process for additional clients.\n\nOrdinary Loans in UVR: Ordinary Loans in UVR is a line of credit which was launched in June 2022 and is linked to the UVR (Real Value Unit), which is a certificated rate from Colombia's Central Bank and reflects the costumers purchasing power based on the variation of the consumer price index.  This  line  of  credit  generates  a  natural  coverage  for  those  corporate  clients  whose  income  is  tied  to  inflation,  since  their  income  and  credit fluctuations are based on the same variable. This type of loan has the possibility of creating flexible financial conditions appropriate to the client's cash flow.\n\nMicrocr\u00e9dito + El\u00e9vate: In August 2022, we launched 'Microcr\u00e9dito + El\u00e9vate', which is a financial education program offered in conjunction with the Independent Microcredit product. The purpose of this program is to support the growth of entrepreneurs, providing them with business training tools for the proper management of their businesses and credits they have with the Bank. The duration of this financial education program is six months and includes two counseling sessions per month with a personalized tutor from El\u00e9vate. The tutor evaluates the business to determine the appropriate topics and content necessary for our clients to improve their sales and strengthen their business. Once the client has successfully completed the counseling and complies with their payment obligations, Bancolombia grants the client a rate reduction on their microcredit product.\n\nProtected-Agriculture Plan: In  April  2022,  we  launched  'Plan  Agro  Protegido',  which  is  an  insurance  policy  for  Bancolombia  clients  who  have already completed a credit assessment for the 'Finagro' or 'Agrof\u00e1cil' credit lines through our allies, Suramericana and HDI, which are insurance companies. This type of insurance is designed to support agricultural crops against climate disasters or natural events that cause damage to the plant or generate crop loss while interrupting production cycles.\n\nMultifamily Rent: Multifamily for rent is a building management model where you pay rent for residential property and can request other services such as installing furniture, electrical appliances, or other additional services.\n\nSolar Panel Rent: Agreements where a payment is made for the temporary (usually 10 to 15 years) use of the solar panel. The tenant uses the solar technology to produce or/to sell energy.\n\nESG Derivatives: This  is  a  hedging  product  that  seeks  to  provide  a  more  favorable  rate  when  negotiating  interest  rate  swaps  to  clients  who  meet sustainable requirements, such as having a credit through our sustainable line, being a B-Corp, or having certain selected certifications. In addition to meeting the sustainability requirements, the client is assessed in terms of, for example, credit risk and must be part of certain business segments. The benefit is limited according to the availability of resources and conditions provided by certain departments of the Bank.\n\n## MAIN LINES OF BUSINESS\n\nThe Bank manages its business through nine main operating segments: Banking Colombia, Banking Panama, Banking El Salvador, Banking Guatemala, Trust, Investment Banking, Brokerage, International Banking, and All other.\n\nFor a description and discussion of these segments, please see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - A. Operating Results - Results by Segment'.",

This behavior is explained primarily by the increased liquidity provided by the Central Bank and the Colombian National Treasury at year end, as economic activity tends to be higher during this period resulting in a greater number of transactions.\n\nDuring 2022, the programs and measures that had been implemented by the Central Bank in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were eliminated, which led to a normalization of monetary policy characterized by interest rates hikes in order to control the increase in inflation. These interest rate hikes caused a lower preference for liquidity, which was reflected in the increase in term deposits in the last quarter of the year.\n\nHowever, we do not consider the seasonality of demand deposits to have a significant impact on our business, since the excess/shortage of liquidity has been managed through the treasury portfolio.\n\n## B.4            RAW MATERIALS\n\nThe Bank is not dependent on sources or availability of raw materials.\n\n## B.5            DISTRIBUTION NETWORK\n\nBancolombia provides its products and services through a traditional branch network, sales, and customer representatives as well as through mobile branches (or 'Puntos de Atenci\u00f3n M\u00f3viles'), an ATM network, online and computer banking, telephone banking, mobile phone banking services, and points of sale (or 'Puntos de Atenci\u00f3n Cercano'), among others. Transactions performed through electronic channels represented more than 95.59% of all  transactions  in  2022,  compared  to  94.52%  of  all  transactions  in  2021.  In  addition,  as  of  December  31,  2022,  Bancolombia  had  a  sales  force  of approximately 12,740 employees.\n\nThe following are the distribution channels offered by Bancolombia as of December 31, 2022",

Moreover, in the same year Grupo Aval acquired 100% of the Guatemalan Reformador Financial Group (the transaction was valued at USD 411 million) and acquired BBVA Panama for USD 490 million. Also, some  competitors  in  2013  started  operations  in  Colombia:  Itau  BBA  entered  the  market  with  an  investment  bank,  as  did  BNP  Paribas;  Credicorp acquired Correval (a local brokerage firm); Brazilian broker-dealer BTG Pactual acquired Bolsa y Renta; Banco Santander returned to the Colombian market with a bank; and the Chilean company Larrain Vial started operations with a brokerage firm.\n\nDuring 2014, the entry of new entities continued as the financing company Hipotecaria, specialized in mortgage loans, which began operations in March 2014; also, in June, Corpbanca completed the acquisition of Helm Bank, keeping Corpbanca's brand. During the same year, the bank GNB Sudameris acquired 99.9% of the capital of HSBC Colombia and started to operate under the brand GNB Colombia, while an agreement was signed to operate in Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. In 2015, the Chilean group CorpBanca merged with the Ita\u00fa of Brazil and Bancolombia sold 50% of its shares in Tuya SA to Grupo Exito. In addition, Bancolombia also acquired an additional 20% interest in Grupo Agromercantil, bringing its interest to 60% in total.\n\nSome banks suffered transformations during the time, an example is Serfinanza that until January was a commercial financing company and in February of that year it began to operate as the 26th bank in the financial system. Additionally, in 2020 four financing companies went through changes in their shareholdering structures: in January, Credifinanciera acquired Procredit Bank rebranding it Banco Credifinanciera; in April, Coltefinanciera acquired the  rights  and  obligations  of  Multibank  which  ceased  to  act  as  a  bank;  Leasing  Bancoldex  merged  with  Arco  Bancoldex  in  August;  and  Pagos Internacional was acquired by Banco W in November. Additionally, in 2021 Lulo Bank began to operate as the first digital bank, and in December 2021 BTG Pactual changed from an insurance brokerage to begin to operate as the 28th Bank in the financial system. Finally, in 2022 Banco Uni\u00f3n, before called 'Giros y Finanzas', went to be a commercial financing company to operate as the 29th Bank in the financial system.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, according to the SFC, the main participants in the Colombian financial system were 29 commercial banks (18 domestic private banks, 10 foreign banks, and 1 domestic state-owned bank), 5 financial corporations and 16 financing companies. In addition, trust companies, cooperatives,  insurance  companies,  insurance  brokerage  and  securities  intermediaries,  special  state-owned  institutions,  and  severance  payments  and pension funds also participate in the Colombian financial system.\n\n## Market and Credit Institutions' Evolution in 2022\n\nIn 2015, Colombian financial institutions began reporting their consolidated financial results under IFRS framework. However, in the case of credit institutions (including banks, financial corporations, financing companies and 38 financial cooperatives), the SFC has allowed the presentation of standalone financial statements under Colombian Banking GAAP basis, following Decree 1851 of August 2013, which regulates the Law 1314 of 2009 concerning the technical regulatory framework for the institutions that report their financial results. Accordingly, the following information includes figures under Colombian Banking GAAP regulation, as reported by Colombian credit institutions.\n\nLoan growth at Colombian credit institutions was 16.9% in 2022, compared to 10.3% in 2021. Commercial loans grew by 16.7% in 2022, compared to 7.8% in the previous year. Consumer loans increased 18.3% in 2022, more than the 12.8% showed in 2021. Mortgage loans increased 14.6% in 2022, more than 2021 (14.3%), and small business loans grew 14.6% in 2022 from 8.9% in 2021.\n\nThe credit institutions level of past-due loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio, decreased from 3.93% in December 2021 to 3.67% in December 2022. In addition, the coverage, measured by the ratio of allowances for loans losses (principal) to PDLs (overdue 30 days), ended 2022 at 159.94%, compared to 166.08% at the end of 2021.\n\nAt the end of 2022 the loans portfolio represented 63.97% of the assets, more than the previous year proportion which was 61.42%. The investments and derivatives transactions, as a percentage of total assets decreased from 22.49% at the end of 2021 to 21.15% at the end of 2022. Deposits decreased its participation in the total balance of loans from 72.13% in 2021 to 70.61% in 2022.",

With the effectiveness of Decree 1477 of 2018.\n\n## Bancolombia and its Competitors\n\nThe following table shows a comparison between the key profitability, capital adequacy and loan portfolio quality indicators for Bancolombia and its main competitors unconsolidated, based on IFRS information as applicable under Colombian regulations and published by the SFC.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                    | ROE (1)   | ROE (1)   | ROA (2)   | ROA (2)   | Past-due loans/ Total loans   | Past-due loans/ Total loans   | Allowances/ Past-due loans   | Allowances/ Past-due loans   | Capital Adequacy   | Capital Adequacy   |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                    | Dic-22    | Dic-21    | Dic-22    | Dic-21    | Dic-22                        | Dic-21                        | Dic-22                       | Dic-21                       | Dic-22             | Dic-21             |\n| Bancolombia (3)    | 17.9 %    | 13.1 %    | 2.8 %     | 2.0 %     | 3.2 %                         | 4.1 %                         | 192.1 %                      | 184.1 %                      | 18.3 %             | 21.1 %             |\n| Banco de Bogot\u00e1    | 15.0 %    | 17.7 %    | 2.0 %     | 4.0 %     | 3.7 %                         | 4.1 %                         | 168.0 %                      | 167.0 %                      | 17.0 %             | 29.8 %             |\n| Davivienda         | 7.9 %     | 9.2 %     | 0.8 %     | 1.0 %     | 4.8 %                         | 4.0 %                         | 128.9 %                      | 141.5 %                      | 19.9 %             | 22.0 %             |\n| BBVA               | 15.1 %    | 15.7 %    | 0.9 %     | 1.1 %     | 2.7 %                         | 3.1 %                         | 187.9 %                      | 190.8 %                      | 13.3 %             | 13.8 %             |\n| Banco de Occidente | 10.6 %    | 10.5 %    | 0.9 %     | 1.0 %     | 3.0 %                         | 3.5 %                         | 167.9 %                      | 178.2 %                      | 12.4 %             | 11.4 %             |\n| Banco Corpbanca    | 1.8 %     | 3.2 %     | 0.2 %     | 0.3 %     | 3.7 %                         | 4.2 %                         | 154.6 %                      | 162.5 %                      | 15.8 %             | 13.7 %             |\n| Banco Colpatria    | 5.3 %     | 6.6 %     | 0.4 %     | 0.5 %     | 3.7 %                         | 3.9 %                         | 124.9 %                      | 127.7 %                      | 11.5 %             | 12.6 %             |\n\nThe following tables illustrate Bancolombia and its main competitor's market share on an unconsolidated basis with respect to various key products, based on figures published by the SFC for the years 2022 and 2021:\n\n## Total Net Loans Market Share\n\n| Total Net Loans - Market Share (%)   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Bancolombia                          | 26.8 % | 26.4 % |\n| Davivienda                           | 16.7 % | 16.6 % |\n| Banco de Bogot\u00e1                      | 11.4 % | 11.7 % |\n| BBVA                                 | 10.9 % | 10.5 % |\n| Banco de Occidente                   | 6.5 %  | 6.2 %  |\n| Scotiabank Colpatria                 | 5.3 %  | 5.5 %  |\n| Ita\u00fa Corpbanca                       | 3.2 %  | 3.8 %  |\n| Others                               | 19.2 % | 19.3 % |\n\nSource: Ratios are calculated by Bancolombia based on figures published by the SFC.",

Multiple agencies are vested with the authority to regulate the financial system, including the board of directors  of  the  Central  Bank,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Public  Credit  (the  'Ministry  of  Finance'),  the  SFC,  the  SIC  and  the  Self-Regulatory Organization ('Autoregulador del Mercado de Valores' or 'AMV'). The following is a description of their functions:\n\nThe Central Bank exercises the customary functions of a central bank, including price stabilization, monetary policy, regulation of currency circulation, regulation of credit, exchange rate monitoring and management of international reserves. Its board of directors is the regulatory authority for monetary, currency exchange and credit policies, and is responsible for the direction of the Central Bank's duties. The Central Bank also acts as lender of last resort to financial institutions.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has the function, among others, of regulating, through the Unit of Financial Regulation, all aspects of financial and insurance activities.  It  is  responsible  for  regulations  relating  to  capital  adequacy,  legal  lending  limits,  authorized  operations,  disclosure  of  information  and accounting of financial institutions on a high level, which matters are then regulated in detail by the SFC.\n\nThe SFC is the authority responsible for licensing, supervising and regulating financial institutions, the Bank. The SFC has broad discretionary powers to  supervise  financial  institutions,  including  the  authority  to  impose  fines  on  financial  institutions  and  their  directors  and  officers  for  violations  of applicable regulations. The SFC is also responsible for monitoring, supervising and regulating the market for publicly traded securities in Colombia.\n\nThe AMV is the self-regulatory organization of Colombia. The AMV may issue mandatory instructions to its members and supervise its members' compliance and impose sanctions for violations. All capital market intermediaries, including the Bank, must become members of the AMV and are subject to its instructions.\n\nThe SIC is the authority responsible anti-trust and data protection matters and has jurisdiction over the Bank.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Regulatory Framework for Colombian Banking Institutions\n\nThe basic regulatory framework of the Colombian financial sector is described below.\n\nDecree 663 of 1993, as amended, defines the structure of the Colombian financial system and establishes the permitted forms of business entities and their  authorized  activities.  Furthermore,  Decree  663  of  1993  sets  forth  (i)  licensing  requirements,  (ii)  the  procedure  applicable  for  mergers  and acquisitions, spin-offs, and other corporate reorganizations of the aforementioned entities, (iii) specific regulations that apply to the issuance and sale of shares and other securities by such entities, and (iv) certain rules regarding the activities of officers and directors of such institutions, among others.\n\nDecree  2555  of  2010  compiles  regulations  that  were  previously  issued  in  separate  decrees,  including  regulations  regarding  banking,  insurance  and securities market activities, capital adequacy requirements, principles relating to the determination, dissemination and publication of rates and prices of products and financial services, and lending activities.\n\nExternal Circulars 029 of 2014 and 100 of 1995 compile the rules and regulations issued by the SFC that apply to financial institutions and other entities under its supervision.\n\nFinancial institutions are subject to further rules if they engage in additional activities. Law 964 of 2005 (securities market law) regulates securities activities,  which  may  be  performed  by  banks,  and  securities  offerings.  External  Resolution  1  of  2018  (foreign  exchange  regulations),  and  External Resolution 4 of 2006 issued by the board of directors of the Central Bank, defines the different activities that banks, including the Bank, may perform as foreign exchange market intermediaries, including lending in foreign currencies and investing in foreign securities.\n\nViolations of any of the above statutes and their relevant regulations are subject to administrative sanctions and, in some cases, criminal sanctions.\n\n## Financial Conglomerates\n\nLaw 1870 of 2017 ('Law 1870') implemented the legal framework for the regulation and supervision of financial conglomerates in areas such as regulatory capital, related party transactions, corporate governance principles, conflicts of interest and risk management, among others. According to Law 1870, a financial holding company may acquire that status by either (i) having significant influence over a financial institution or (ii) controlling a financial institution. A financial holding company (1) has significant influence over a financial institution when it directly or indirectly, holds more than fifty  percent  (50%)  of  the  voting  capital  of  the  financial  institution,  excluding  from  the  calculation  voting  capital  held  by  entities  that  under  their regulations are not allowed to control a financial institution (such as pension funds), and (2) controls a financial institution, when it has (i) more than 50% of the voting capital of the financial institution, (ii) the majority of the votes in the Board of Directors of the financial institution or the right to elect a majority of its members or (iii) a dominant influence over the decisions made by the financial institution as a result of an agreement with the financial institution or its shareholders as established in articles 260 and 261 of the Colombian Code of Commerce.\n\nThe Government has issued several decrees pursuant to its authority under Law 1870, including Decree 774 of 2018, which regulates capital adequacy requirements for financial conglomerates, and Decree 1486 of 2018, which regulates the criteria to determine related parties, risk concentration limits and conflicts of interest. These regulations provide that when financial institutions fulfill capital adequacy requirements and solvency ratios on a stand alone basis, authorities may not impose solvency ratios on the financial conglomerate as a whole.\n\nThe law also reinforced the mechanism for the resolution of credit institutions - deposit-taking institutions under Colombian Law - by establishing the concept of the bridge bank, an entity used to facilitate the purchase of assets and transfer of liabilities from failing institutions.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nPursuant  to  the  financial  conglomerates  regime,  Grupo  de  Inversiones  Suramericana  S.A.  has  significant  influence  and,  therefore,  is  the  financial holding company of Bancolombia only for the purposes of the financial conglomerates framework. These new regulations require Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana  S.A.  to:  (i)  continue  strengthening  the  Bank's  Corporate  Governance  System  as  a  Financial  Conglomerate;  (ii)  review  the  risk management and capital adequacy models; and (iii) strengthen the internal control and information reporting systems of the companies that make up the conglomerate  under  this  framework.  The  SFC  has  authority  to  implement  applicable  regulations  and,  accordingly,  from  time-to-time  issues administrative resolutions and circulars.\n\n## Key interest rates\n\nArticle 884 of the Colombian Commercial Code provides for a limit on the amount of interest that may be charged in commercial transactions. The limit is 1.5 times the current banking interest rate ('inter\u00e9s bancario corriente'), certified and calculated by the SFC as the average rate of interest ordinarily charged by banks for loans made during a specified period. The current banking interest rate for small business loans and for all other loans is certified by the SFC. As of December 31, 2022, the banking interest rate for small business loans was 36.95% and for all other loans was 27.64%.\n\n## Capital adequacy requirements - Basel III\n\nCapital adequacy requirements for Colombian financial institutions (as set forth in Decree 2555 of 2010, as amended) are based on most of the Basel III standards. This regulation provides for a gradual implementation plan beginning in 2021 and ending in 2024 for requirements regarding solvency ratios and  capital  buffers.  The  SFC  issued  External  Circular  020  of  2019  which  sets  requirements  in  relation  to  capital  adequacy  requirements  for  credit institutions and information reporting to the SFC. Some of the highlights of this regulation are as follows:\n\n- \u25cf The technical capital ('Technical Capital') is calculated as the sum of Common Equity Tier One Capital (the 'patrimonio b\u00e1sico ordinario'), the Additional Tier One Capital ('patrimonio b\u00e1sico adicional') and the Tier Two Capital ('patrimonio adicional').\n- \u25cf Revised criteria for debt and equity instruments to be considered Common Equity Tier One Capital, Additional Tier One Capital, and Tier Two Capital were established. Additionally, the SFC must review whether a given instrument adequately complies with the applicable criteria in order for an instrument to be considered Tier One Capital or Tier Two Capital, upon request of the issuer. Debt and equity instruments that have not been classified by the SFC as Tier One Capital or Tier Two Capital shall not be considered Tier One Capital or Tier two Capital for purposes of capital adequacy requirements.\n- \u25cf The Capital Adequacy Ratio is set at a minimum of 9% of the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets; however, each entity must comply with: (i)  a  minimum  basic  solvency  ratio  of  4.5%  (which  is  defined  as  the  ordinary  basic  capital  after  deductions  divided  by  the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items); (ii) a minimum additional basic solvency ratio (which is defined as the sum of Common Equity Tier One Capital after deductions and Additional Tier One Capital, divided by the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items) of 4.875% which began on January 1, 2021, increasing gradually up to 6% as of January 1, 2024; (iii) a capital conservation buffer (which is defined as the Common Equity Tier One Capital after deductions divided by the financial institution's  total  risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items) of 0.375% which began on January 1, 2021, increasing gradually up to 1.5% as of January 1, 2024; (iv) a systemically important institution buffer (which is defined as the Common Equity Tier One after deductions divided  by  the  financial  institution's  total  risk-weighted  assets  and  off-balance  sheet  items)  of  0.25%  which  began  on  January  1,  2021, increasing gradually up to 1% as of January 1, 2024 (Bancolombia was recognized by the SFC as a domestic systemically important institution in Colombia); and (v) a combined buffer equivalent to the sum of the aforementioned buffers as of January 1, 2024. These ratios apply to credit institutions individually and on a consolidated basis.",

The leverage value is the sum of all net assets, the net exposures in all repo, simultaneous transactions and temporary transfer of securities, the credit exposures in all derivative instruments, and the exposure value of all contingencies.\n- \u25cf Credit establishments must comply with minimum capital requirements for operational risk. This new capital requirement will be determined by the product of the Business Indicator ('indicador de negocio'), the Operational Risk Coefficient ('coeficiente de riesgo operacional') and the Internal Loss Multiplier ('indicador de p\u00e9rdida interna'). The Operational Risk Coefficient will be 12% of the Business Indicator, but if the Business Indicator exceeds COP 3 billion, the coefficient will be 15% for the excess amount. Each entity was required to comply with the requirement as of January 1, 2021.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - B1 Liquidity and Funding. Capital Adequacy.'\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for banks on an unconsolidated basis is established  in  Article  80  of  Decree  633  of  1993.  The  minimum  capital requirement for banks, including Bancolombia, for 2022 is COP 107,849 million. Failure to meet such requirement can result in the taking of possession ('toma de posesi\u00f3n') of the Bank by the SFC (see Item 4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8 -Supervision and Regulation Bankruptcy Considerations').\n\n## Mandatory Investments\n\nCentral  Bank  regulations  require  financial  institutions,  including  the  Bank,  to  hold  minimum  mandatory  investments  in  debt  instruments  issued  by Fondo para el Financiamiento del Sector Agropecuario ('Finagro'), a Colombian public financial institution that finances production and rural activities to support the agricultural sector. The amount of these mandatory investments is calculated by applying a fixed percentage (ranging from 4.3% to 5.8%, depending on the type of liability) to the quarterly average of the end of day balances of certain liabilities, primarily, deposits and short-term debt. The investment balance is computed at the end of each quarter. Any required adjustment (due to a change in the quarterly average between periods) results in the purchase of additional securities or may result in redemption by Finagro at of securities in excess of the requirement. The purchase of additional securities takes place during the month following the date as of which the computation was performed.\n\n## Foreign Currency Position Requirements\n\nAccording to External Resolution 1 of 2018 issued by the board of directors of the Central Bank as amended or supplemented ('Resolution 1 of 2018'), a  financial  institution's  foreign  currency  position  is  the  difference  between  such  institution's  foreign  currency-denominated  assets  and  liabilities (including any off-balance sheet items). In the case of foreign exchange market intermediaries that consolidate financial statements and have controlled foreign investments, such as the Bank, the value of controlled foreign investments, and (ii) the value of derivatives and other liabilities designated by the intermediary as hedging instruments for the controlled foreign investments are excluded from its foreign currency position.\n\nAlso, Resolution 1 of 2018 provides foreign currency position limits, so that their positions may not exceed certain percentages of their technical capital in specific periods; and requires banks to calculate a gross position of leverage ('posici\u00f3n bruta de apalancamiento') as it relates to its foreign currency position.\n\n## Reserve Requirements\n\nCredit institutions are required to satisfy reserve requirements with respect to deposits and other cash demands which are held by the Central Bank in the form of cash deposits. According to Resolution 11 of 2008 issued by the board of directors of the Central Bank, as amended, the reserve requirements for Colombian banks are measured bi-weekly and the amount depends on the class of deposits.",

These rules apply to Bancolombia's financial statements on a stand-alone  basis  for  Colombian  regulatory  purposes.  Non-performing  loan  allowances  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  calculated according to IFRS.\n\n## Lending Activities\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010, as amended, sets forth the legal lending limits, which provide for the maximum amounts that a financial institution may lend to a single borrower (including for this purpose all related fees, expenses and charges). These maximum amounts may not exceed 10% of a bank's technical capital. However, the limit is raised to 25% when amounts lent above 5% of technical capital are secured by guarantees that comply with the financial guidelines provided in Decree 2555 of 2010, as amended.\n\nAlso, in no event may a loan to a shareholder holding directly or indirectly 20% or more of the Bank's capital stock exceed 20% of the Bank's technical capital. In addition, no loan to a single financial institution may exceed 30% of the Bank's technical capital, with the exception of loans funded by Colombian development banks which are not subject to such limit.\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010 also sets a maximum limit of 30% of the Bank's technical capital for single-party risk, the calculation of which includes loans, leasing operations and equity and debt investments.\n\nThe government, through Decree 1533 of 2022, adopted the Basel Committee's international standard on Large Exposures (LEX), which from 2025, will  modify  the  current  rules  of  legal  lending  limits  and  establish  a  25%  exposure  limit  of  Tier  1  Capital  with  respect  to  the  same  counterparty  of economic groups or connected counterparties.\n\n## Ownership and Management Restrictions\n\nThe Bank is organized as a stock company ('sociedad an\u00f3nima'). Its corporate existence is subject to the rules applicable to commercial companies, principally the Colombian Commercial Code which requires stock companies (such as the Bank) to have a minimum of five shareholders at all times and provides that no single shareholder may own 95% or more of the Bank's subscribed capital stock. Article 262 of the Colombian Commerce Code prohibits the Bank's subsidiaries from acquiring stock of the Bank.\n\nPursuant to Decree 663 of 1993, as amended, any transaction resulting in an individual or entity holding 10% or more of the outstanding shares of any Colombian financial institution, including, in the case of the Bank, transactions resulting in holding ADRs representing 10% or more of the subscribed capital stock of the Bank, is subject to the prior authorization of the SFC. For that purpose, the SFC must evaluate the proposed transaction based on the criteria and guidelines specified in Decree 663 of 1993. Transactions entered into without the prior approval of the SFC are null and void and cannot be recorded in the Bank's stock ledger. These restrictions apply equally to Colombian and foreign investors.\n\n## Bankruptcy Considerations\n\nColombian banks and other financial institutions are subject to special rules regarding insolvency, restructuring and liquidation. Pursuant to Colombian banking law, the SFC has the power to intervene in the operations of a bank in order to prevent it from, or to control and reduce the effects of, a bank failure. The SFC also conducts periodic visits to financial institutions and may impose capital or solvency obligations on financial institutions without taking control of such financial institutions.",

The SFC has the power to determine that such suspension will affect all of the obligations of the bank, or only certain types of obligations or even obligations up to or in excess of a specified amount.\n\nAs a result of a taking of possession, the SFC must appoint as special agent the person or entity designated by Fogafin to administer the affairs of the bank while such process lasts and until it is decided whether to liquidate the bank.\n\nIf the underlying problems that gave rise to the taking of possession of the bank are not resolved within a term not to exceed two years, the SFC must order the liquidation of the bank.\n\nDuring a taking of possession (which period ends when the liquidation process begins), Colombian banking laws prevent any creditor of the bank from: (i) initiating any procedure for the collection of any amount owed by the bank; (ii) enforcing any judicial decision rendered against the bank to secure payment of any of its obligations; (iii) constituting a lien or attachment over any of the assets of the bank to secure payment of any of its obligations; or (iv) making any payment, advance or compensation or assuming any obligation on behalf of the bank, with the funds or assets that may belong to it and are  held  by  third  parties,  except  for  payments  that  are  made  by  way  of  set-off  between  regulated  entities  of  the  Colombian  financial  and  insurance systems.\n\nIn the event that the bank is liquidated, the SFC must, among other measures, provide that all term obligations owed by the bank are due and payable as of the date when the order to liquidate becomes effective.",

Each category of creditors will collect in the order indicated above, whereby distributions in one category will be subject to the full satisfaction of claims in the prior category.\n\n## Deposit insurance-Troubled Financial Institutions\n\nSubject to specific limitations, Fogafin is authorized to provide equity (whether or not reducing the par value of the recipient's shares) and/or secured credits to troubled financial institutions, and to insure deposits of commercial banks and certain other financial institutions.\n\nTo protect the customers of commercial banks and certain financial institutions, Resolution 1 of 2012 of the board of directors of Fogafin, as amended, requires mandatory deposit insurance. Banks must pay an annual premium of 0.30% of total funds received on saving accounts, checking accounts, certificates of deposit and other deposits, which is paid in four quarterly installments. If a bank is liquidated, the deposit insurance will cover the funds deposited by an individual or corporation with such bank up to a maximum of COP 50 regardless of the number of accounts held.\n\n## Risk Management Systems\n\nCommercial banks must have risk administration systems to meet the SFC minimum standards for compliance and to avoid and mitigate the following risks: (i) credit; (ii) liquidity; (iii) market; (iv) operational; (v) money laundering and terrorism; and (vi) counterparty.\n\nThrough  Circular  018  of  2021,  the  SFC  issued  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  Comprehensive  Risk  Management  System  ('Sistema  Integral  de Administraci\u00f3n de Riesgos', or 'SIAR'), which will be effective as of June 1, 2023, except for certain provisions related to risk data aggregation and reporting, which will be effective as of December 31, 2023, at the latest. These provisions require financial entities to have a global vision of the risks to which they are exposed, since it integrates the management of credit, market, operational, liquidity, counterparty, guarantee, insurance and country risks. Thus, in compliance with this regulation, on December 22, 2022, the Bank's internal SIAR implementation plan was sent to the SFC.\n\nCommercial banks generally have several risk measurement methods, including the risk weighted assets measurement which is calculated according to weight percentages assigned to different types of assets. There are some exceptions in which the weight percentage is higher and is calculated based on the associated risk perception of the evaluated asset. Provisions, which are calculated on a monthly basis, are another risk measurement method. The above only applies to stand-alone financial statements.\n\nWith respect to market risks, commercial banks must follow the provisions of the Circular Externa 100 of 1995 issued by the SFC ('Basic Accounting Circular'),  which  defines  criteria  and  procedures  for  measuring  a  bank's  exposure  to  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange,  and  market  risks.  Under  such regulations,  banks  must  submit  to  the  SFC  information  on  the  net  present  value,  duration,  and  interest  rate  of  its  assets,  liabilities,  and  derivative positions. Colombian banks are required to calculate, for each position on the statement of financial position, a volatility rate and a parametric value at risk ('VaR'), which is calculated based on net present value, modified duration and a risk factor computed in terms of a basis points change. Each risk factor is calculated and provided by the SFC.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nWith respect to liquidity risk, financial entities must meet a liquidity coverage test that ensures their ability to hold liquid assets sufficient to cover potential  net  cash  outflows  for  a  period  of  30  days.  Net  cash  outflows  for  this  purpose  are  contractual  maturities  of  assets  (interbank  borrowings, financial  assets  investments,  loans  and  advances  to  customers,  derivative  financial  instruments)  minus  contractual  maturities  of  liabilities  (demand deposits, time deposits, interbank deposits borrowings from other financial institutions, debt instruments, derivative financial instruments) occurring within  a  period  of  30  days.  For  purposes  of  this  calculation,  liabilities  do  not  include  projections  of  future  transactions.  The  maturity  of  the  loan portfolio is affected by the historical default indicator and the maturity of deposits is modeled according to the regulation.\n\nFinancial entities are also required to meet the Net Stable Funding Ratio ('Coeficiente de Fondeo Estable Neto' or 'NSFR') requirements. The NSFR will require credit institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets. The NSFR is a ratio that seeks to limit excessive dependency on unreliable financing sources for strategic assets which are often illiquid. The NSFR is defined as the amount of Available Stable Funding, which includes equity and liabilities that will remain with the credit institution for more than one year. This ratio should be equal  to  at  least  100%  on  an  ongoing  basis  (Fondeo  Estable  Disponible  or  'FED')  of  the  amount  of  Required  Stable  Funding  ('Fondeo  Estable Requerido'). The ratio started to be reported on March 31, 2020. Nonetheless, the External Circular 015 of 2021 maintained until March 31, 2023 the 25% weighting for the FED in demand and term deposits (less than six months) of financial entities and open collective investment funds, noting that this does not affect the schedule of convergence and compliance with the regulatory minimum of the NSFR in the terms established in External Circular 019 of 2019.\n\nWith  respect  to  operational  risk,  commercial  banks  must  assess,  according  to  principles  provided  by  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular,  each  of  their business lines (such as corporate finance, purchases and sales of securities, commercial banking, asset management, etc.) in order to record the risk events that may occur and result in fraud, technology problems, legal and reputational problems and problems associated with labor relations at the applicable bank.\n\nFollowing international best practices to better manage adverse movements in interest rates, External Circular 025 of 2022 recently incorporated (within the SIAR), includes requirements related to interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). To adequately manage the present or future risk on capital and earnings, the CE takes into account the Economic Value of Equity (EV) affected by possible changes in the value of assets/liabilities and the Net Interest Margin (NIM), affected by possible changes in income/expenses.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering Provisions\n\nThe regulatory framework to prevent and control money laundering is contained in, among others, Decree 663 of 1993; the External Circular 029 of 2014 issued by the SFC; and the Colombian Criminal Code, as amended.\n\nColombian laws adopt the latest guidelines related to anti-money laundering and other terrorist activities established by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ('FATF'). Colombia, as a member of the GAFI-SUD (a FATF-style regional body), follows the FATF's recommendations. In 2022,  the  SFC  introduced  new  requirements  for  financial  entities  and  their  risk  management  systems  for  Anti-Money  Laundering/Combating  the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) - in Colombia referred to as the 'Sistema de Administraci\u00f3n del Riesgo de Lavado de Activos y de la Financiaci\u00f3n del Terrorismo' ('SARLAFT'). The new SARLAFT requirements include due diligence on ultimate beneficial owners and politically exposed persons; countermeasures to circumstances that involve high-risk countries; information requirements in international and domestic transactions; supervision in correspondent activities; enhancement of technology tools and digital use of potential customer's identity, among others.\n\nFinancial  institutions  must  cooperate  with  the  appropriate  authorities  to  prevent  and  control  money  laundering  and  terrorism  financing.  Finally,  the Colombian Criminal Code introduced criminal rules and regulations to prevent, control, detect, eliminate and adjudicate all matters related to financing terrorism and money laundering, including the omission of reports on cash transactions, mobilization or storage of cash, and the lack of controls.",

This law also gives foreign banks more flexibility to operate in Colombia through 'branches'. Following its adoption, credit institutions are allowed to operate leasing businesses and banks were allowed to extend loans to third parties so that borrowers could acquire control of other companies.\n\nPursuant to External Circular 023 of 2021 issued by the SFC, Smartsupervision technology was implemented to provide a mechanism for the detailed monitoring of petitions, complaints or claims ('Peticiones, Quejas & Reclamos' or 'PQR').

In addition, certain subsidiaries of Bancolombia located in other countries have transmitted directly to the IRS the information required pursuant to FATCA, since those other countries have not entered into an IGA.\n\n## CRS\n\nThe CRS, approved by the OECD Council in 2014, is applicable to signatory countries of the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement ('MCAA') and  requires  signatory  countries  to  obtain  information  from  their  financial  institutions  and  automatically  exchange  that  information  with  other jurisdictions on an annual basis. The CRS defines (i) which financial institutions are required to report; (ii) the types of accounts covered; and (iii) the due diligence procedures that financial institutions must follow to identify the reporting information.\n\nAmong the countries where Bancolombia operates, Colombia and Panam\u00e1, have entered into the MCAA.\n\nCompliance  with  the  terms  of  the  international  conventions  signed  for  the  exchange  of  information  under  CRS,  the  laws  or  any  other  regulations enforced in the relevant jurisdictions may increase Bancolombia's compliance costs.",

In accordance with the Law Decree, as amended, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama, as the banking supervisor, has the power to issue agreements and resolutions to regulate the banking system. These regulations are mainly focused on matters such as licensing of banks, corporate governance, banking supervision (consolidated and individual or sub-consolidated), capital requirements, capital adequacy, liquidity requirements, risk management (credit, market,  liquidity,  country,  asset  and  liability,  operational,  information  technology,  electronic  banking),  external  audit,  on-site  inspections,  reporting, compliance, change of control, mergers and acquisitions, confidentiality, money laundering, voluntary wind up, administrative and operational control, reorganization, bankruptcy, penalties, customers protection and dispute resolution.\n\nIn order to implement Basel III capital standards, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama issued in January 2015 an agreement on Capital Adequacy. This agreement sets forth the new composition of a banking institution's capital base, as well as the new capital adequacy ratio, including tier 1 core capital ratio and tier 1 capital ratio, all consistent with Basel III standards. This agreement became effective in June 2016 and as of January 1, 2019, the new standards became fully applicable. Regarding liquidity, banks operating under a general banking license, or General License Banks, are currently required to maintain 30% of their global deposits in liquid assets (which include short-term loans to other banks and other liquid assets) of the type prescribed by the Superintendency of Banks. Additionally, General License Banks are required to maintain assets in Panama of no less than 60% of their local deposits or any other percentage fixed by the Superintendency of Banks. Under the Banking Law, deposits from central banks and other similar depositories of the international reserves of sovereign states are immune from attachment or seizure proceedings. However, in 2018, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama, moving forward with the implementation of Basel III liquidity standards, issued an agreement on Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), also requiring General License Banks to maintain high quality liquid assets in relation to its short-term net  cash  outflows.  Daily  compliance  with  the  LCR  (High  Quality  Liquid  Assets  as  a  percentage  of  net  cash  outflows)  is  being  implemented progressively, beginning in December 2018 with a compliance percentage of 25%, until achieving a 100% compliance percentage in December 2022.\n\nThe Superintendency has also issued regulations, consistent with Basel III standards, regarding capital requirements for market risk on the trading book; and regulations to improve country risk management and operational risk management, as well as governance and controls regarding investment in securities.\n\nPanamanian regulations also require all financial institutions to maintain a legal reserve for certain obligations.

Corporations and other entities wishing to offer securities denominated in foreign currency must obtain prior authorization from the Monetary Board.\n\nDecree No. 67-2001, the Law against the Laundering of Money or Other Assets (Ley Contra el Lavado de Dinero u Otros Activos), and Governmental Agreement No. 118-2002, Regulations to the Law against the Laundering of Money or Other Assets (Reglamento de la Ley Contra el Lavado de Dinero u  Otros  Activos),  were  promulgated  for  the  purpose  of  preventing,  controlling,  monitoring  and  punishing  the  laundering  of  money  or  other  assets derived from the commission of any crime, as well as:  These regulations created the Financial Intelligence Unit within the Superintendency of Banks under the name of Special Verification Inspectorate (IVE), which is responsible for ensuring the purpose and compliance with this law.\n\nResolution JM-180-2002, which is the Regulation of operations that can be carried out among the companies of the Financial Group (Reglamento de operaciones que pueden efectuar entre s\u00ed las empresas del Grupo Financiero), regulates the financial operations and / or provision of services that may be carried out among the companies of the financial group, in accordance with the provisions of the Banks and Financial Groups' Law.\n\nResolution JM-117-2009, which is the Regulation for the Management of Liquidity Risk (Reglamento para la Administraci\u00f3n del Riesgo de Liuidez), has the purpose of establishing the minimum aspects that must be observed by banks, financial companies and offshore entities, for the management of liquidity risk, for liquidity risk management strategy that incorporates the credit profile of the institution, with prudential policies and processes that identify, quantify, monitor and control this risk and be able to manage liquidity on a day-to-day basis, as well as contingency plans to deal with liquidity problems.\n\nResolution  JM-104-2021,  which  is  the  Regulation  for  the  Management  of  Technological  Risk  (Reglamento  para  la  Administraci\u00f3n  de  Riesgo Tecnol\u00f3gico), aims to establish the minimum guidelines that banks and other financial entities must comply with to manage technological risk. The relevant  aspects  brought  by  the  new  regulation  include:  i)  regulating  the  obligations  that  financial  institutions  have  when  contracting  services  that process  and/or  store  information  with  third  parties,  ii)  ordering  matters  related  to  the  alternate  computer  center,  establishing  that  it  must  be  in  a geographical  location  different  from  the  main  computer  center,  iii)  establishing  the  requirements  to  obtain  authorization  to  process  and/or  store information outside the national territory,  among  which  is  to  obtain  the  legal  opinion  of  a  lawyer  of  the  jurisdiction  where  the  information  will  be processed and/or stored, and iv) indicating the minimum aspects that must contain the backups of the information of the IT infrastructure, Information system and database.\n\nDecree 8-2022, the Insolvency Law (Ley de Insolvencia), creates a legal framework that allows individuals and legal entities who have not been able to pay their debts to reorganize financially, administratively and operationally, without losing their assets and renegotiate their debts, in order to generate income that allows them to pay said debts. One of the important modifications with this rule is that it centralizes the payment of all civil, commercial, tax and labor debts, which the debtor has with or without guarantee through the bankruptcy judicial process.",

It  is  important  to  note  that  banks  and  entities authorized to grant credits, will collect the subsidy, applying the corresponding discount in their monthly income tax return or payment of other taxes caused, therefore the State will not make any disbursement for the subsidy to financial institutions, transferring the burden to the banks for the collection of the same.\n\nResolution JM-93-2005, which is the Regulation for Credit Risk Management (Reglamento para la Gesti\u00f3n del Riesgo de Cr\u00e9dito), regulates the aspects that  must  be  observed  by  banks,  offshore  entities  and  companies  of  a  financial  group  that  grant  financing,  such  as  the  minimum  information  of applicants and financing debtors, and the valuation of credit assets.\n\nResolution JM-47-2022, which will be the new Regulation for Credit Risk Management (Reglamento para la Administraci\u00f3n del Riesgo de Cr\u00e9dito), has among its main objectives is to issue new regulation for the following aspects: (i) management of reserves or specific and dynamic provisions; (ii) measurement with model of expected loss given non-compliance (\"PDI\"); and (iii) provide a new segmentation of credit assets such as consumer loans, mortgage loans for housing, productive loans and business loans. It is important to note that financial institutions will have a prudent period for the necessary  adaptation  with  respect  to  the  new  standard,  starting  its  validity  on  January  1,  2024,  and  they  must  carry  out  the  pertinent  actions  and developments before the expiration of the term granted, likewise, this resolution will replace the one mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\n## B.9        CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK\n\nAs cybersecurity incidents in the financial industry increase exponentially in frequency and impact, affecting the organization's reputation, banks must deploy defenses to discourage attacker's plans. Materialization of cybersecurity risks may result in the unauthorized access to confidential information, technological  breaches  of  the  infrastructure  of  the  Bank  with  the  aim  of  stealing  information,  fraud  due  to  exploitation  of  vulnerabilities  and  the interruption of the Bank's services.\n\nThe  Bank's  internal  policies  define  cybersecurity  risk  as  the  possibility  of  an  economic  or  non-economic  loss  arising  from  a  violation  of  the confidentiality, integrity,  and  availability  of  the  information  that  the  Bank  processes.  However,  the  Bank  does  not  have  control  over  or  manage  our customer desktops, laptops or other devices, therefore, any occurrence of a cyber risk in those systems cannot be attributed to the Bank, unless at least one of the following events occurs: (i) intentional interruption of the Bank's informational and technological infrastructure, excluding technological or operative failures; (ii) successful unauthorized access to information or to a system; or (iii) unauthorized change in the Bank's hardware, firmware, or software. Bancolombia implemented a strategy designed to protect and maintain the operations of the company's business processes, mitigating the security risks to which the organization was exposed by these new conditions, including those related to the interruption, exposure, leak, or damage to the integrity of critical business information, as well as the lack of availability of resources and customer service.\n\nThis strategy includes the implementation of a documented management process, designed to oversee cybersecurity and information security, providing a framework that manage the information's risks according to the objectives, strategies, regulations, and industry best practices. The framework used to manage cybersecurity risks is designed under practices of international frameworks and standards issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in NIST SP 800-30 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in ISO/IEC27032,  as  well  as  the  definitions  established  by  the  Bank.  The  cybersecurity  and  information  security  division  of  the  Bank  is  responsible  for cybersecurity risk management, a function performed together with the business, technology, risk, and internal audit teams. The team considers the nature of the financial business, its risk appetite, customer needs, business strategy and the environment of the financial industry. The framework seeks to ensure that the risks are identified, measured, controlled, monitored and considers the international and regional best practices and regulations. The cyber-security risk management system is designed as a three line of defense model, distinguishing between three groups involved in effective risk management: (i) a first line of defense, which is responsible for identification, evaluate, control",

This  Committee  is  formed  by  eight  vice  presidents  of  the  following  functions:  Bancolombia's  Corporate  Services,  Banistmo's  Corporate Services, BAM's Corporate Services, Banco Agr\u00edcola's Corporate Services, Bancolombia's Clients and Employees Services, Bancolombia's Corporate Human Resources, Bancolombia's Corporate Risk and Nequi's Corporate Services.\n\nThe Risk Corporate Vice Presidency is responsible of defining the methodology, procedures and tools for cybersecurity related risks management and the  management  policies  which  is  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  ensuring  that  an  appropriate  cybersecurity  risk  management  process  is maintained and keeping the Board of Directors informed of its effectiveness according to the approved guidelines and methodologies; and analyzing periodically  the  reports  that  are  submitted  by  the  senior  management  on  cybersecurity  risk  exposure,  exposures  substantial  changes,  tolerance  level compliance and mitigation and management measures adopted by the Bank. Through the Risk Committee and also the Audit Committee, in which members of the Board of Directors participate, members receive regular reports on cybersecurity and information security relevant issues, the level of compliance with the approved policies and procedures for cybersecurity risk management, as well as relating to the causes of any breaches and the measures adopted to address the gaps identified by the Cybersecurity and Information Security Committee, to consider any corrective actions required. In addition, the Board of Directors has a member with background in IT and training in cyber-security and information security issues who is a member of the Audit Committee.\n\nThe  new  reality  that  the  pandemic  let  us  such  as  hybrid  working  models  (a  combination  of  remote  and  on-site  work)  plus  the  accelerated  digital transformation, the increasing adoption of cloud solutions and cryptocurrency in some countries like El Salvador, have brought additional challenges with new threats and increased the probability that the existing ones could occur. In this new environment, the security perimeter extends to employees, outsourced  staff  and  third  parties  outside  the  organization,  working  from  any  device  from  anywhere  in  the  world  and  accessing  the  organization's information and services. Some of the practices to keep the organization safe in the new environment were: enabling secure schemes for remote work with multiple authentication factors, third party security strategy, identification and protection of critical assets, risk management of our assets and those of  third  parties,  the  strengthening  of  access  control  and  identity  management,  secure  application  development,  and  securing  the  technological infrastructure, business operations and human resources. Likewise, the practices adopted by the Bank include the deployment of controls and strategies for  data  loss  prevention,  information  lifecycle  management,  actions  to  mitigate  phishing,  smishing  and  identity  theft,  protection  of  emails  and collaborative  tools,  and  the  adjustment  of  rules  regarding  safe  browsing.  Threat  hunting,  and  threat  intelligence,  the  use  of  penetration  tests  and management  of  vulnerabilities,  event  monitoring,  business  resilience  including  the  response  and  recovery  of  capabilities  or  services  affected  in  a cyberattack, and cloud security are also part of the practices implemented in the organization. In 2022 the Bank deployed a new endpoint detection and response (XDR) solution and a better secure web gateway solution, buying next generation solutions from the market leaders and Gartner's top rated solutions, that enhanced the capability of protection, visibility, pre-execution analysis, cloud sandboxing and user endpoint behavior analytics (UEBA), protecting against malware and advanced threats. Additionally, we increased and improved the different capabilities of prevention and detection of cyber threats in browsing (proxy with better capabilities), threat analysis, information security (DLP- Data Lost Prevention on workstations, lockdown, email exchange  with  third  parties,  database  monitoring),  identity  management,  and  increased  capabilities  in  the  Bug  Bounty  program  (paid  rewards  for enhancement or vulnerabilities).",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn 2022 the Bank had a specific interdisciplinary project team with staff from cybersecurity, procurement and risk divisions, dedicated to strengthen third party security, including identification and classification of the information assets that Bancolombia exchanges with its most critical third parties, security assessment to third parties, security scorecards made to their public websites, requiring external auditors reports on the operational effectiveness of key suppliers' controls over one or more of the following security principles: availability, integrity and confidentiality. In this initiative, the processes for continuous review of the security status of third parties were defined throughout their life cycle: before contracting, during the term of the contract and at the end of the contractual relationship. An updated inventory is being developed and maintained, compliance with the controls required for its protection  is  being  evaluated,  and  the  cybersecurity  and  information  security  risks  that  are  being  identified,  assessed  and  treated.  In  addition,  our cybersecurity teams work on educate, support, and equip our employees and third parties with the knowledge and the tools to prevent, mitigate, and report cyber-attacks and incidents, and keep the Bank and customer's data protected.\n\nAs every year, during 2022 a series of awareness and training activities were carried out for all our employees and a large number of third parties, in some cases with the support of experts in the field. There is a mandatory annual cybersecurity and information security virtual course that was approved by  99.5% of  the  Group's  employees.  In  2022,  Bancolombia  invested  USD  35.9  million  in  activities  related  to  preventive,  detective,  and  corrective efforts  for  cybersecurity  management,  including:  insurance  policies,  human  resources  costs,  security  solutions  licensing  and  the  administration  and maintenance  of  cybersecurity  controls  for  the  Bank.  Additionally,  cybersecurity  and  information  security  reports  are  generated  periodically  for  the review by the members of Bancolombia's Board of Directors, where the status of cybersecurity and information security is reported. In 2022 there was a significant increase (compared with 2021) in phishing attacks on our clients in which the Bank identified and dismantled 17.184 fraudulent sites. In 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, the Bank has not faced a cyber-attack with a material impact on its business or customers that materially affected  the  Bank  in  an  economic  or  non-economic  manner,  in  accordance  with  the  definition  and  criteria  defined  by  the  Bank  for  that  purpose. Therefore,  there  were  no  costs  associated  with  its  remediation  or  consequences.  However,  we  can  give  no  assurance  that  the  previously  described measures,  initiatives,  and  procedures  will  be  100%  effective  in  preventing  or  mitigating  potential  future  attacks  or  threats  to  our  technology infrastructure. Any new threat or omission by the Bank to detect, mitigate or prevent cyber-security risk in a timely manner could result in a negative impact  on  the  Bank's  results  of  operations  and  financial  position,  or  in  problems  with  information,  including  data  related  to  customers  being  lost, compromised, or delivered to the Bank's customers with delays or errors.\n\nFor  the  year  2023,  work  will  continue  on  the  following  focuses:  strengthening  the  cybersecurity  of  the  entire  ecosystem  of  Grupo  Bancolombia companies in all its geographies, reducing the surface area exposed to advanced threats, renewing the SOC (Security Operation Center) at the corporate level,  evolving  the  secure  development  practices,  implementation  of  automation  of  access  processes,  continue  strengthening  the  comprehensive management of cyber risk in third parties and the effects that the SEC regulation proposal of March 2022 could have.\n\n## B.10        COVID-19 CONSIDERATIONS\n\nSince the beginning of March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted the Bank's operations, customers, suppliers, and employees. COVID-19 and  the  resulting  government,  public  health  authority  and  other  reactions  to  it,  affected  the  Bank's  Colombian  and  Central  American  operations. However, the impact of the pandemic has been decreasing in the countries where the Bank operates beginning in 2021 and continuing throughout 2022.\n\nIn Colombia, the Debtor Support Program (DPS) was in force until August 31, 2021. Since then, the impact of COVID-19 has significantly declined across  all  segments  (such  as  retail,  SMEs,  and  corporate),  and  economic  recovery  began  in  2021  and  continued  into  2022.  During  2022,  the  Bank continued to individually monitor and respond to client's needs through measures such as extending the maturity date on loans, and granting deferrals and grace periods. Similar measures were taken by the Bank in its operations in Central America. As of December 2022, there were no material credit reliefs or structured solutions related to COVID-19 in either the Colombian or in Central American operations.\n\nFor more information on the impact of COVID-19 on the Bank, refer to Item 3.D.

We are committed to incorporating these criteria as a fundamental and integral element in all our investment processes. Since 2014, we have sought to deepen  the  integration  of  sustainability  criteria  in  our  product  offering,  our  recommendations  to  the  market  and  our  investment  strategy.  This commitment is aligned with a global agenda, which is to comply with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), designed to achieve more prosperous societies and protect the planet.\n\nLeading indexes worldwide constantly monitor the performance of companies in environmental, social, economic, and corporate governance terms. Bancolombia is included in many of these indexes, encouraging the implementation of ESG practices.\n\nIn Bancolombia we understand ESG as environmental, social and governance issues that are relevant for the company to endure over time, balancing risks, opportunities and efficiencies that arise from this concept. With respect to environmental issues, the report includes our climate change strategy, decarbonization strategy and eco-efficiency strategy.   In the social aspects there are issues of financial inclusion, gender, human rights and Talent and culture strategies, and in the economic and governance issues there are the issues of Board of Directors Governance, tax strategy, codes of ethics and conduct and sustainable business strategy.\n\n## Environmental Dimension\n\nWe seek to identify the direct and indirect impacts of our activities and encourage the prevention, mitigation, correction, and compensation for those impacts.\n\nThe strategy of our environmental management model is directly related to our business strategy. We have set up environmental policies, which include environmental and social risk analysis, Environmental Management, Controversial issues in financing and investment, Responsible investment, Climate change and sustainable procurement.\n\nRegarding regulation of ESG matters, in Colombia, the Government issued Decree 151 of 2021, which reformed the information disclosure regime by securities issuers, such as the Bank, providing a two-year transition period for its implementation.  Furthermore, the SFC issued at the end of 2021 the External  Circular  031requiring,  no  later  than  2024,  the  disclosure  of  information  related  to  ESG  matters  from  a  financial  materiality  perspective. Likewise, on March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed rules that would require registrants, including foreign private issuers, such as the Bank, to include climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. This proposal, which is modeled in part on the recommendations of the TCFD and upon the GHG Protocol, would require disclosure of climate-related risks, greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial metrics. The Bank is currently analyzing the potential impacts and reviewing the potential disclosure roadmap to be followed in response to these new and upcoming regulations.\n\nAccording to our analysis, these regulatory actions will take some time to be implemented within the bank due to the great effort in terms of traceability in the systems to be aligned with local and international taxonomies, the training of the teams and the additional capabilities that will be required within the bank.\n\nClimate Change: As a field in constant evolution, climate occupies a top position in our broader environmental agenda, and we recognize that managing climate-related risks and opportunities is vital to the long-term sustainability of the Bank. For this reason, Bancolombia became one of the founding  banks  of  the  Net  Zero  Banking  Alliance.  This  is  an  industry-led  Alliance,  hosted  by  the  United  Nations  Environment  Program Finance  Initiative  (UNEP  FI)  and  co-launched  by  the  Financial  Services  Taskforce  (FSTF).  Under  this  alliance  (NZBA),  Bancolombia committed to; (1) transition all operational and attributable GHG emissions from our lending and investment portfolios to align with pathways to net-zero by mid-century, or sooner, including CO2 emissions reaching net-zero at the latest by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise  of  1.5\u00b0C  above  pre-industrial  levels  by  2100;  (2)  use  decarbonization  scenarios  from  credible  and  well-recognized  sources;  and  (3) prioritize our efforts",

For more information on these risks, please refer to Item 3.D. Risk Factors - 'The Bank is exposed to ESG risks that could affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations'. On February 2021, Bancolombia launched its Climate Change Policy to support our clients in the transitioning to a low carbon economy. This policy includes the following sectors: coal extraction, coal power generation, oil extraction, livestock, cement manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, air transport, maritime transport, and vehicle manufacturing.\n\n## Direct and indirect emissions:\n\nWe measure and mange our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\nFor scope 1 and scope 2, we have defined a target of reducing our emissions by 95% for 2030 against a baseline for 2019. 2022 saw a reduction of 30% of scope 1+2 emissions against 2021.\n\nScope 3, categories 1 and 6 (purchased goods and services, business travel) emissions increased 77% in 2022 against 2021 because of the resuming of business travel after the Covid-19 pandemic. Emissions from these activities have decreased 48% in total from baseline year 2019 until 2022.\n\nFor scope 3, category 15, Financed Emissions, in 2022 we updated our financed emissions quantification and definition of targets set for 2030 and produced our first submission to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which is expected to be reviewed and verified by SBTi in April 2023. The targets set for 2030 align with 1.5\u00b0C scenarios under SBTi and net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe main contributing sectors to financed emissions, with 2021 defined as base year, are in order of highest to lowest financed emissions:\n\nOil & Gas, Power, Manufacturing, Livestock, Building and Infrastructure, Cement.\n\nThe cement and power sector targets have been defined using the Sectoral Decarbonization Approaches (SDA) published by SBTi. The remaining sectors have been analyzed using a Temperature Rating approach but we expect to update them as new SDA guidance and tools are released. This distribution may evolve as higher quality of data is incorporated into the analysis, e.g. emissions directly reported by clients, improved emission factors, among others.\n\nA strategy will follow in which we will engage the main clients from the critical sectors (i.e. those that have the highest financed emissions) to define science based targets, pathways for mitigating emissions, and commit to sectoral decarbonization approaches aligned with 1.5\u00b0C scenarios.\n\nFrom the investment perspective through the asset management business, Bancolombia has joined the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative by committing to align investment portfolios with carbon-neutral scenarios by 2050 and we have implemented actions to achieve our goals. We measure the CO2e emissions financed by our investment portfolio, and we defined our science-based targets, submitted for validation by Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi).\n\nThe emissions are coming mainly from investments in Private Debt, followed by ETFs and Mutual Funds.\n\nBancolombia also defined a goal of financing the transition to a low carbon economy for an amount of COP 40 trillion by 2030.\n\nWe are working to engage clients and ensure an adequate transformation of their practices towards a low-carbon economy. In terms of physical risk, Bancolombia has developed assessments to quantify physical risks related to our clients and our",

These  assessments  consider  the  effect  of  physical  risks  on  real  estate  guarantees,  effects  on  loans  guaranteed  by  trust  vehicles  and impacts on clients or industries affected by extreme climate events.\n\nDisclosure of climate change risks is extremely important in our effort to be transparent with our stakeholders. For this reason, Bancolombia adopted the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) commitments in 2019 to meet the call for financial institutions to build a more resilient financial  system  through  the  implementation  and  dissemination  of  climate  change  management  issues.  We  also  disclose  our  climate  performance through the CDP (Climate Disclosure Program) platform.\n\nReputational risk may result from changes in customers' perceptions or increasing attention and scrutiny from investors and regulators on the Bank's contribution to the transition to a low carbon economy.  The Bank has established a corporate policy for its loan portfolio related to sectors with a high impact on climate, such as coal extraction and coal power generation. The policy includes qualitative risk identification and risk mitigation measures. Some of the mitigation measures include:\n\n- \u25cf Permanent social networks and mass media monitoring to identify alerts that may damage the trust of any of the Bank's stakeholders.\n- \u25cf A narrative  which  focuses  on  the  Bank's  purpose  and  its  ESG  strategy,  used  to  guide  commercial  teams  in  its  relationship  with  different stakeholders and the advice they provide to affected clients through the transition process for the next 10 years.\n- \u25cf Conversations  with  opinion  leaders,  editors,  and  journalists  from  the  mass  media,  so  that  they  understand  the  positive  impacts  on  the environment and economy that will be obtained from the Bank's transition strategy.\n- \u25cf A methodology to identify and measure the ESG risks to which the organization is exposed, and which takes into account that ESG risk management requires a wide degree of implementation within the entity as most of the risks are transversal, with presence in all areas of the organization.\n\n## Physical and Transition Risks\n\nIn  line  with  our  commitment to address climate change, we have defined the methodological process for physical and transition risks management, through the identification and prioritization of economic sectors that generate high levels of greenhouse gases. The aim is to assist our clients with processes and guidelines that lead to a transition to renewable energy.  The Bank seeks to identify, using projection modeling, companies that have a positive impact on climate change and that will establish strategies for customer service and the financing of renewable energy. This methodological process also includes mechanisms for customer treatment and the definition of risk appetite.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis risk framework is intended to be applied to the physical risks to which our fixed assets are exposed (for example, branches, ATMs, buildings, etc.), with the goal of developing strategies necessary to guarantee continuity of our business, as well as the equity value of our assets.\n\nThis analysis will be integrated by different areas such as business continuity, insurance, risks and others. The Bank seeks to identify the physical risks associated with climatic events that may affect the continuity of the financial business. This involves establishing a vulnerability prioritization model related to the location of fixed assets, as well as establishing strategies and mechanisms to prevent climate risks and ensure the provision of financial services.",

The main reason for conducting a stress test is to determine the resilience of the climate risk model under unusual or unexpected macroeconomic and climatic scenarios, so that the Bank may or may not take actions to strengthen the methodologies used to measure the Bank's material risks.\n\nIn 2022, we initiated a detailed analysis of the power generation sector with a medium and long-term focus to create a projection of how clients in this sector  would  be  affected  by  physical  and  transition  risks.  With  this  analysis,  we  have  elements  to  define  our  risk  appetite  and  the  development  of strategies to assist the most exposed clients in achieving a satisfactory transition. To proceed with the analysis of climate risks, we need to understand how these risks affect the evaluated sector. We then determine the risk appetite, which means the amount of climate risk that the Bank is willing to accept in accordance with its strategy.\n\nIn order to effectively manage ESG risks, we are currently integrating the policies associated with socio-environmental and good governance processes to  facilitate  their  administration,  control  and  monitoring.  This  includes  the  integration  of  the  Environmental  and  Social  Risks  Assessment,  the Controversial Issues in Business and the Industries Sensitive to Climate Change policies. In particular, the Policy for Industries Sensitive to Climate Change, in line with the purpose of portfolio decarbonization, establishes conditions that limit the financing of activities related to coal extraction and coal-based electricity generation.\n\nEcoefficiency: With our operational ecoefficiency program, we seek to reduce the direct impact to the environment associated with the consumption of natural  resources  required  for  our  operations  through  the  implementation  of  strategies  to  reduce  our  water,  energy,  paper,  and  business  travel consumption and to reduce waste generation.\n\nWe have established  long  term  goals  to  align  our  actions  and  performance  with  worldwide  standards  such  as  the  SDGs  (Sustainable  Development Goals). We have defined targets related to climate change for scope 1 and 2, i.e. for our direct operations. We are committed to reducing our emissions by 73 % by 2024 compared to our 2019 emissions. This target was established in accordance with SBTi - Science Base Target Initiative- methodologies.\n\n## Social Dimension\n\nWe promote financial inclusion, gender equality and investment in initiatives that reduce social gaps and improve the communities' wellness in the countries where we operate.\n\nSince 2013, by declaring our Human Rights Policy, we made public our commitment to \"respect, promote and remediate human rights\" in compliance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the ILO and the law of the countries where we operate. The Risk Committee supervises compliance, and all employees receive training regarding the policy.\n\nOne of our strategic goals is to develop our Culture and Talent to be competitive. We have set conditions that maximize the potential and well-being of our  Talent.  We  also  have  established  policies  and  protocols  related  to  Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion,  along  with  training  on  discrimination  and harassment in the workplace.\n\nWe actively measure emotional variables that allow us to monitor the success of those strategies and adjust actions according to the results based on the Employee's Voices and their daily experiences. In 2022, with a scale of 1 to 10, we obtained an engagement result of 9.29, Satisfaction of 9.34 and Recommendation of 9.61, corresponding to an employee net promoted score (ENPS) of 87.85%.\n\n## Wellness, Harmony and Employee Experience in a Hybrid World of Work:\n\n- \u25cf We have analyzed the demographics of our employees at the corporate level concerning matters such as gender, minority status, age, position level, nature  of  the  position,  pay  gap  and  others.  The  data  used  for  these  analyses  were  provided  voluntarily  and  are  processed  following  the authorizations given by their owners.\n- \u25cf Our strategy contributes to the quality of life of employees, suppliers, and customers. We have established safe workplaces, benefits and wellness programs for our employees, in addition to promotional and empowering initiatives to enhance individual, familiar and communitarian healthy behaviors.",

The internal audit department also monitors compliance, ensuring respect for human rights and increasing the organization's sustainability.\n\nThe Bank delivers different tools that increase the awareness of self-care and favour a balance between the employees' work and personal spaces. Such as:\n\n- -Periodic occupational evaluations and executive medical checks.\n- -Accommodations to employees with particular health conditions.\n- -Programs that promote mental and cardiovascular health and activities that prevent stress and mitigate the effects of psychosocial factors.\n- -Epidemiological surveillance systems monitor the main risks that impact health.\n- -Investigation of incidents and implementation of remediation actions, evacuation drills and emergency prevention plans.\n- -Training of the employees and promotion on issues of emergency care and generating awareness about health and Safety at work\n- -Promotion of financial welfare through education and personalized advice according to the monitoring and analysis of economic indicators of employees.\n- -Sport, recreational, cultural and vocational activities for employees and their families.\n- -Guidance to the elderly (Senior Talent) in early retirement and retirement plans.\n- -Positioning of the welfare strategy (talks and training) with a gender approach.\n\n## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Human Rights:\n\n- \u25cf We also have empowerment programs for women to help their growth within the organization so that they identify and express what they want to  be  Personally  and  Professionally.  As  part  of  this  strategy,  we  have  set  targets  for  2030  for  the  number  of  women  represented  in  Top Positions.\n- \u25cf We increased by 5% the participation of women in senior management, from 38% in 2021 to 42% in 2022, This result occurs mainly for 2 reasons:\n- -Implementation of strategies based on women's empowerment and professional development.\n- -Adjustment of the definition of senior management aligned to international standards\n- \u25cf The Contigo ( With You ) support line for all employees provides psychological guidance, especially in cases of violence and discrimination.",

Remedial measures were immediately implemented, including psychological first aid, legal advisory, reports to authorities and disciplinary and administrative decisions.\n\n## Talent Attraction and Engagement:\n\n- \u25cf Talent attraction and Employee Turnover Rate: We have processes designed to attract Talent with the skills, abilities, and attitudes required to achieve our Purpose. One of our goals is to ensure the professional development of our employees through an equitable vacancy procedure. 53% of our vacancies are filled with internal selection processes.\n- \u25cf Our recruitment indicator average at the corporate level shows a natural process of talent renewal and allows us to attract new employees with innovative knowledge and new proposals. The company's total and voluntary turnover rates for 2021 were 10.1% and 5.1%, respectively, for 2022 were 11.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Various events and initiatives were carried out to strengthen our brand and position ourselves as one of the Best Companies to work for in the countries where we operate. These initiatives were also focused on retaining employees with Key knowledge  and,  in  turn,  attracting  new  professionals  in  strategic  areas,  such  as  technology,  cybersecurity,  design,  analytics  and  artificial intelligence.\n\n## B Movement, our Culture Strategy:\n\nIn 2022, we encouraged \"to Make a Difference,\" including being dynamic, collaborating and responding to uncertainty, adversity, and challenges from a place of empathy and trust. Over 2,000 leaders and 20,000 employees across four countries were part of a program to strengthen objectives focused on Purpose, Dynamism, and Well-being.\n\n## The Learning Strategy as a lever for personal and professional growth:\n\nFor us, knowledge is an asset that arises from experience, collective construction, experimentation, improvement, and interaction with others. For this reason, managing it is our priority to enhance team performance and thus mitigate the impact due to the brain drain.\n\nWe define  different  mechanisms  that  seek  the  democratization  of    knowledge,  facilitating  the  evolution  of  profiles  and  their  enrichment  through  a structured, intentional and comprehensive offer of content (Schools, training maps by vice-presidencies, digital strategies, scholarships and strategic knowledge definitions) that guarantees that employees manage to develop their learning-behaviours following the skills that will be necessary for today and for the future.\n\nIn 2022 we invested more than 1 million hours in training our employees, with a value of more than USD 3,303,952. 93% of our leaders acquired new knowledge and strengthened their skills in our Leadership Institute, close to 9,000 employees took part in our schools, and 98% of employees completed their annual virtual training plan, with an average of 49 hours of training.\n\nKey material factors in the social dimension related to our clients and the community include:\n\n- \u25cf Through  our  financial  inclusion  initiatives,  we  provide  free  financial  services  for  people  to  access  savings  and  credit  in  order  to  become financially empowered and improve their quality of life.\n- \u25cf Our inclusion platforms such as, A la mano , have brought us closer to people of different ages, socioeconomic levels and geographic regions, as deposits are managed at no cost and 100% digitally.

This policy seeks to ensure that in the final shortlist of candidates applying for senior management positions, there is at least  one  woman.  This  initiative  has  allowed  us  to  reach  40%  female  representation  in  senior  management  roles.  We  are  committed  to increasing this figure through mentoring programs which encourage women to develop their skills, and network with leaders both within and outside the company.\n- \u25cf In  2022,  we  developed  virtual  courses,  events,  webinars  and  other  spaces  for  conversation  about  unconscious  biases,  masculinities  and nonviolent behavior and female empowerment, aimed at raising awareness and train employees about diversity, equity and inclusion. These initiatives were made available to over 20,000 people.\n- \u25cf In 2020, we set up a psychological and legal advisory support line available to all employees, called 'Contigo', which means 'With you'. This support line comprehensively monitors cases of gender-based violence, mental health, and discrimination. In 2022, this line expanded its scope to advise people who are experiencing a gender transition.\n- \u25cf In recent years, we have launched more than four different credit products for women, including the Sustainable Gender Line, for projects with a sustainability focus developed by women; Agro para Todas ('Agro for all women'), aimed at female businesses in rural areas; Microcr\u00e9dito para Todas ('Microcredit for all women'), with resources to support female entrepreneurs; and the Ordinary Portfolio Line for companies led by women.\n- \u25cf In 2022, to encourage female leadership and companies to implement gender equality within professional contexts, we launched a new line of credit with the benefit of an interest rate 100 basis points below the traditional ordinary portfolio line for clients certified with the Equipares seal. This line of credit is granted by the Colombian Ministry of Labor, the High Presidential Council for Gender Equality and the UNDP to companies that implement best practices in their gender equality management systems.\n- \u25cf Through the Bancolombia Foundation, we have reached rural communities in Colombia's 32 departments to continue building capacities that promote growth and well-being for  all.  We  seek  to  make  the  Colombian  countryside  an  engine  of  prosperous,  innovative  and  sustainable development for our country.  Some of our programs developed in 2022 are:\n\n## Education and training for employability\n\n- -Scholarship Program: we support the access and permanence of rural youth to higher education\n- -Financial  education:  we  develop  financial  skills  in  rural  communities  through  a  program  called  ' Cuentas  Sin  Cuento '  (Accounts without Story).",

This framework is established by the Board of Directors, serving as the body responsible for defining the strategy and long-term objectives of the company. Either directly or through its Committees, the Board oversees compliance with our sustainability strategy, supervision of the measures undertaken to mitigate climate change risk, adoption of principles for responsible investment and education of employees to make them aware of these principles and implementation of policies designed to ensure compliance with applicable law in the countries where we operate.\n\nAdditionally, the Executive Committee serves as the Bank's sustainability committee (the 'Sustainability Committee').  The Sustainability Committee analyzes the business opportunities, risks and challenges related to sustainability and discusses the progress of our ESG agenda, in alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure.\n\nThe Bank has a sustainability division that coordinates and drives the ESG agenda following our corporate strategy and policies. This division is led by a senior manager who sits on the Sustainability Committee.\n\nRegarding the diversity of the Board of Directors, Bancolombia seeks to promote a mix of experience, knowledge, and innovative and challenging visions,  in  accordance  with  the  economic,  social,  and  business  environment.  Bancolombia  aims  for  diversity  in  the  composition  of  its  Board  of Directors, particularly in gender and nationality. Currently, women represent 29% of our Board of Directors (2 out of 7 board members) and 29% are non-Colombian directors (2 out of 7 members). The directors' profiles can be consulted in Item 6.A. - 'Directors and Senior Management'.\n\nBancolombia believes that the criteria considered by the shareholders in nominating candidates to the Board of Directors must include an awareness of the  need  for  an  integrated  business  management  which  combines  a  commitment  to  sustainable  business  activity  with  the  proper  management  of government resources. One factor to consider in this regard is the director's professional skills. Given this, it was essential to the Board that one of the directors have a background in ESG matters.  Accordingly, since 2016 Arturo Condo Tamayo has been assigned to sustainability and cybersecurity issues.",

This Code sets forth six behavioral traits that employees must comply with and put into practice whenever we engage with one another and with stakeholders. As part of our strategy to raise awareness about this Code, the mandatory training plan for Bancolombia's employees includes an annual assessment of our Code of Ethics and Conduct guidelines. In addition, as part of the strategy, we are raising awareness among our commercial and  administrative  teams  so  that  they  increasingly  incorporate  the  guidelines  of  our  Code  of  Ethics  and  Conduct.  Throughout  the  year,  we  also disseminate different pieces of communication discussing the specific guidelines of our Code of Ethics and Conduct.\n\nIn addition to the Good Governance Code and the Code of Ethics and Conduct, we have established the following policies to promote ethical behavior; Anti-Fraud  Policy  on  Asset  Misappropriation,  Anti-Fraud  Policy  on  Financial  Reporting,  Anti-Fraud  Policy  on  Anti-Corruption,  Policy  of  Zero Tolerance  to  Fraud  and  Policy  on  Contributions  to  Democracy  and  Political  Activity.  We  also  have  the  Integrity  and  Compliance  Manual,  which contains the framework for the Anti-Fraud Program. These documents are available to the whole organization, and some of them are published on our corporate web site for our stakeholders and the general public at: https://www.grupobancolombia.com/corporate/corporate-governance/code-ethics\n\nAs a mechanism to support the promotion of our culture, we have different reporting channels for our employees and different stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, suppliers, allies and competitors, among others, to report any fact or suspected violation of the Code of Ethics and Conduct or related policies.  We also have a phone line called the 'ethics line' ('l\u00ednea \u00e9tica'), which is an anonymous and confidential service for employees and other stakeholders to report potential fraud, ethics violations and related issues.\n\nWe also have a point of contact through which we provide ongoing support and advice to all employees on ethical dilemmas that may arise in their work, as well as on the interpretation of our Code of Ethics and Conduct.\n\nIn addition, we have a Corporate Ethics Committee which aims to provide guidelines on ethics, conduct and integrity. The Committee also sets forth the necessary mechanisms to implement decisions under the highest internal standards of ethical conduct. The Corporate Ethics Committee is supported by local ethics committees, in each of the countries where we operate.\n\nWe also  know  that  declaring  ourselves  a  client-centered  organization  involves  considerable  challenges.  We  incorporated  into  our  client  experience quality measurement an understanding of their willingness to recommend us to third parties, using the net promoter score (NPS) methodology as the chief indicator in the group of metrics that allow us to assess the organization's overall performance in this regard. Using this indicator allows us to understand not only our clients' satisfaction but also their brand loyalty. This metric is measured on the standard parameters from 0 to 100%. In 2022, our NPS indicator was 72.94%.",

We  know  that  ESG  has  an  important  role  in  addressing  sustainability  challenges  by facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy and stimulating sustainable development. To that end, we have set a goal to finance COP 500 trillion before  2030  through  credit  and  other  financial  services.  This  goal  to  incorporate  ESG  variables  extends  to  all  our  business  segments  and  includes processes of due diligence, engagement, knowledge of clients and finance through innovative products for sustainable solutions.\n\nSome of the ESG aspects we have included in our business strategy include:\n\n- \u25cf We developed the Sustainability credit line, which is a special financing line designed to support our customers in the development of projects that promote clean technologies, gender equality, renewable energies, efficient use of energy, clean fuels, and reduction of waste, emissions, and discharges, among other ESG-related uses of funds.\n- \u25cf We finance  SMEs  and  entrepreneurs,  supporting  them  in  their  growth  to  increase  their  productivity  and  employment  opportunities  while having positive impact on the country's economy.\n- \u25cf We also have been implementing a sustainable funding strategy. To date, we have issued six green or ESG-themed bonds for gross proceeds of USD  2.7  million  that  we  have  used  to  finance  initiatives  related  to,  among  others,  clean  energy,  sustainable  construction,  and  cleaner production.\n\nRegarding  our  approach  to  risks,  we  have  adopted  the  Equator  Principles  and  the  Performance  Standards  of  the  World  Bank  and  the  International Finance Corporation - IFC, as standards for the identification, evaluation and management of environmental and social risks and impacts implicit in the operations and projects we finance. During 2022, 102 operations were evaluated through the Social-Environmental Risk Analysis process.\n\nIn addition to complying with the requirements of the Equator Principles (Project Finance and Corporative Loans), our environmental and social risks policy covers credit and leasing operations in excess of USD 1 million, and if there is any operation with a risk that generates a warning below this amount, an evaluation over such operation must be made. Also, our environmental and social risk assessment covers liens, assets received as guarantees and those that are under lease agreements and received as payment in defaulted operations.\n\nThe  ESG risk  process  begins  with  the  identification  and  prioritization  of  sectors  sensitive  to  environmental  and  social  risks  and  impacts  and  their potential  impact  on  natural  resources,  the  community  and  the  credit  granted.  Once  these  sensitive  sectors  have  been  selected,  through  the  metrics established in the credit study process, the credit operations of clients located in these sectors are channeled so that they have an ESG risk study. This study is carried out by a team specialized in Environmental Engineering, which identifies the main risks of a productive activity or project, validates the programs and action plans prepared for the prevention, mitigation or compensation of environmental and social impacts and generates the commitments and  environmental  obligations  that  are  included  in  credit  agreements,  with  the  purpose  of  carrying  out  due  diligence  in  monitoring  environmental obligations and best practices, in accordance with the defined conditions.\n\nSimilarly, Bancolombia has a Financing Policy on Controversial Issues that defines the activities that we are not willing to finance because of their high social and environmental impact, and the conditions for financing and investing in economic sectors with high environmental and social impact.",

Volume and rate variances have been calculated based on movements in average balances over the period and changes in nominal interest rates on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities. Net changes attributable to changes in both volume and interest rate have been allocated to the change due to changes in volume.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|

It is possible that the Bank's actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements because of several risks and uncertainties. Please see 'Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements'.\n\nIn addition, please refer to the discussion in Item 3. 'Key Information - D. Risk Factors' for a description of risks and uncertainties affecting the Bank's business and financial results and to Item 4 B. 'Business Overview, B.9 - Cybersecurity Framework', for a description of the Bank's cybersecurity framework.\n\n## IMPACT OF ECONOMIC AND MONETARY POLICIES ON BANCOLOMBIA'S RESULTS\n\nBancolombia's operating results are affected by macroeconomic factors, mainly in Colombia but also in the other countries where the Bank operates. The  most  important  variables  include  GDP  growth,  interest  rates,  inflation,  and  exchange  rates,  mostly  the  USDCOP.  The  following  discussion summarizes the trends of these measures in Colombia in 2022.\n\n## Economic activity\n\nColombia's real GDP growth was 7.5% in 2022, a positive second year of strong growth after the 10.7% expansion recorded in 2021. This remarkable rate of growth was possible owing to the strong level of private consumption, leveraged by the position of the credit portfolio, government subsidies, the recovery of labor income and strong remittances inflows. Also, continuing return to normalcy in the operation of the productive sectors and the low basis of comparison as per 2021 results, played an important role.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe behavior of key GDP components in the first three quarters of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021 in constant-prices figures was as follows: fixed investment grew 12.4%, consumption 10.4%, imports 29.2%, and exports 21.0%.\n\nThe sectors that showed more dynamic growth in the first three quarters of 2022 (compared to the same period of 2021) were artistic, entertainment and recreation activities and other service activities (37%), the information and communications segment (17.6%), and retail and wholesale, transportation, accommodation, and food services (15.1%).\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Colombian Central Bank's benchmark interest rate stood at 12%, after a 900-bp increase over the year amidst a process of monetary policy tightening that is not over yet.\n\nGiven  the  actual  level  of  the  local  monetary  policy  interest  rates  is  considered  contractionary  as  per  the  evolution  of  the  economic  activity,  it  is reasonable to think that the interest rate hikes might end in the first half of the year.\n\n## Inflation\n\n2022  year-end  inflation  stood  at  13.12%,  which  was  noticeably  higher  than  the  5.62%  recorded  in  2021.  The  components  leading  the  increase  in inflation in 2022 were food and nonalcoholic beverages (27.81% increase), restaurants and hotels services (18.54% increase), and items for the home and for ordinary household maintenance (18.25% increase). Prices of the information and communication services (0.25% increase) and the educational services (5.98% increase) grew the least.\n\nThe high level of inflation at the end of 2022 as well as the fact that the level is above the upper limit of the Central Bank's tolerance range (4%) and is still on an upward trend are key factors behind the expectation that interest rates will remain high for the next quarters.\n\n## Exchange rate\n\nThe  Colombian  peso  depreciated  20.82%  against  the  USD  during  2022,  with  the  USDCOP  closing  at  COP4,810.2,  compared  to  a  depreciation  of 15.98% in 2021, when the USDCOP closed at COP3,981.16. The COP ended 2022 reflecting the impact of the high level of financial stress that the world faced during the year and the local uncertainty due to the changes that Colombia's economic policy will undergo following under the election of the new government.\n\n## Outlook\n\nProspects for the Colombian financial sector in general, and for Bancolombia in particular, are expected to depend on the factors listed below:\n\nFavorable factors for the Colombian economy - medium-term\n\nUnfavorable factors for the Colombian economy - medium term",

This was experienced across all geographies where Bancolombia operates. In Colombia particularly, the banking industry reported strong loan origination throughout 2022. Higher interest rates additionally benefitted margins for banks.\n\nIn  2022,  net  income  attributable  to  equity  holders  of  Bancolombia  totaled  COP  6,783  billion  (COP  7,053  per  share,  including  both  common  and preferred shares, and USD 5.86 per ADR), which represents an increase of 65.99% as compared to COP 4,087 billion of net income attributable to equity holders of Bancolombia for the fiscal year 2021.\n\nBancolombia' s average return on stockholders' equity for 2022 was 19.80%, up from 14.03% in 2021.\n\nThe net interest and valuation income margin increased in 2022 and stood at 6.80% for the year, up from 5.09% in 2021.\n\nCredit impairment charges, totaled COP 3,792 billion for 2022, up 56.65% from COP 2,421 billion in 2021.This increase during 2022 is due mainly to the lower provision releases when compared to 2021 and a gradual normalization of the credit cycle. In the second half of the year the Bank experienced a significant increase in provision expenses in line with the expansion of the loan portfolio.\n\nLoans and advances to customers and financial institutions increased 22.51% during the year. Besides the effects of depreciation of the local currency in Colombia  against  USD,  the  Bank  experienced  a  stronger  credit  demand  from  clients  that  extended  the  recovery  that  had  started  a  year  earlier. Commercial loans showed greater growth in the second half while the retail portfolio had a consistent growth throughout the year. The total loan book denominated in COP grew 18.15% and USD-denominated loans grew 8.11% for the year.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nAllowance for loans and lease losses represented 5.47% of total loans (excluding accrued interest) and 168.73% of 30-day past-due loans (excluding accrued  interest)  at  the  end  of  2022  compared  with  6.73%  of  total  loans  and  166.29%  of  30-day  past-due  loans  (excluding  accrued  interest)  on December 31, 2021. The Bank expects that these allowances will provide adequate coverage for expected credit losses.\n\nCapital adequacy was 12.79% (Tier 1 ratio of 10.37%), lower than the 15.49% (Tier 1 ratio of 11.92%) reported at the end of 2021, in spite of the generation of profits, the growth of the loan portfolio and the depreciation of the COP versus the USD that impacted the consumption of capital.\n\nDeposits by customers increased 19.30% during 2022, while the ratio of net loans to deposits was 101.4% at the end of the year, up from 97.2% on December 31, 2021.\n\n## Net interest margin and valuation income on financial instruments before impairment on loans and financial leases and off-balance sheet credit instruments\n\nAs noted above, the Colombian Peso depreciated sharply in 2022 closing at COP 4810.20 per USD, an increase of 20.82% in the year.\n\nIn  addition,  and  due  to  inflationary  pressures,  The  Central  Bank  of  Colombia  adopted  a  contractionary  monetary  policy  stance,  raising  the  interest reference rate 900 percentage points during the year, up to 12% by the end of 2022. Likewise, U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System raised the Federal Funds Rate by 425 percentage points to 4.25%-4.50% in the same period.\n\nInterest income, which is the sum of interest on loans, financial leases, overnight funds and interest and valuation income from investment securities was COP 26,797 billion, up 66.07% from 16,136 billion in 2021 on the back of higher market rates, loan growth, - mainly in commercial and consumer segments, and foreign exchange rate effect.\n\nThe larger share of consumer loans as to the total loan portfolio recorded for the end of the year is the result of a deliberate strategy implemented in the last 7 years to capture higher risk adjusted returns that contribute to broader income generation.\n\nAs a result, the weighted average nominal interest rate on loans and financial leases was 10.2 %, up from 7.5% in 2021.\n\nIn  turn,  interest  expense  was  COP  8,442  billion,  up  94.01%,  mainly  due  to  higher  market  rates  and  volume  growth  in  savings  accounts  and  time deposits, triggered by heftier financing needs to meet loan origination growth. This caused the interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities to increase to 3.2%, up from 1.9% recorded in 2021.\n\nTotal valuation on financial instruments was COP 1,363 billion, up 189.59% from 2021. This growth was driven by an increase in debt instruments at fair  value,  mainly  on  United  States  government's  treasury  bonds,  COP  denominated  bonds  and  derivatives.  Interest  on  debt  instruments  using  the effective interest method totaled COP 589 billion in 2022, up 89.03% from 2021, mainly due to higher market rates.\n\nAs a result, net interest income and valuation for 2022 was COP 18,354 billion, a 55.76% increase from COP 11,784 billion in 2021. This represents a net interest and valuation income margin from continuing operations of 6.80%, increasing 171 basis points from 5.09% recorded in 2021. Despite the increase in interest expense during the year on deposits, -time deposits and saving accounts in particular-, income generation grew due to loan growth and interest on loans, financial leases, overnight funds and interest and valuation income from investment securities held in the portfolio.",

This increase was driven primarily by an increased level in fees and commissions income, higher than the increase in fees and commissions expenses. An increase in fees and commissions derived from credit, debit card and commercial establishments represented the main factors in the income performance. It's mainly due to the increase in the interbank rate generated by greater national and international, manual and electronic purchases of MasterCard, Amex and Visa.",

        "page_content": "The operation in Colombia provided the largest contribution to fees as a result of the increase in the volume of transactions due to the dynamism in the retail activity, as well as an important growth in the number of clients. The incremental demand in consumer loans and credit card outstanding also added to the positive performance in fees related to these products; mainly due to a higher interchange rate generated by a greater volume of purchases online and at the point of sale through affiliated networks.\n\nOther revenue lines had an important contribution to fee generation. Bancassurance presented positive results during 2022 thanks to continued growth on distributed products, largely associated to disbursement of retail loans. Banking services added to the strong performance during the year following a growing demand in transactional products and use of digital channels.\n\nPayment fees reported an increase in a yearly basis due to the incremental demand of services such as invoice collection from individual clients, leasing operations, and a higher volume of incoming remittance transfers.\n\n## Other Operating Income\n\nFor 2022, total other operating income was COP 2,053 billion, 1.55% higher than the COP 2,022 billion in 2021.\n\nCurrency hedging balances are reported under other operating income resulting in a negative net effect in a highly volatile period of time in terms of foreign exchange. Revenues from operating leases totaled COP 1,363 billion in 2022, an increase of 45.50% compared to 2021. The higher amount from this revenue line is mainly explained by an increase on customer financial lease agreements and customer rental contracts in the renting business.\n\nGains on sale of assets was COP 171 billion, decreasing 24.61% when compared to 2021 due to a lower amount of sale operations.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nThe following table summarizes the principal components of Bancolombia's operating expenses for the last two fiscal years:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                           | For the years ended December 31,   | For the years ended December 31,   | Growth             | Growth             |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                           | 2022                               | 2021                               | 2022-2021          | 2022-2021          |\n|                                           | In millions of COP                 | In millions of COP                 | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| Operating expenses                        |                                    |                                    |                    |                    |\n| Salaries and employee benefits            | 4,417,656                          | 3,782,596                          | 635,060            | 16.79 %            |\n| Other administrative and general expenses | 4,559,900                          | 3,740,506                          | 819,394            | 21.91 %            |\n| Taxes other than income tax               | 929,512                            | 719,593                            | 209,919            | 29.17 %            |\n| Impairment, depreciation and amortization | 980,575                            | 920,558                            | 60,017             | 6.52 %             |\n| Total operating expenses                  | 10,887,643                         | 9,163,253                          | 1,724,390          | 18.82 %            |",

Annual Wage raises and social benefits adjustments contributed mostly to such variation. Additionally, bonuses increased 15.28% year over year incorporating quarterly a higher provisioning in the light of a performance-based model rewarding employee contributions towards company profitability.\n\nOther administrative and general expenses totaled COP 4,560 billion in 2022, up 21.91% as compared to 2021, for the most part associated to the digital transformation in place demanding higher technology costs. Furthermore, the Renting business division demanded higher payments of premiums and charges associated with maintenance of assets due to the vehicle fleet growth and higher expenses related to insurance policies partially due to increased rates.\n\nImpairments, depreciation, and amortization totaled COP 981 billion in 2022, up 6.52% as compared to 2021.  This increase is primarily due to the increase in operating leases and consequently higher asset depreciation.\n\nAs a result of the changes in expenses and revenues, the cost to income ratio of Bancolombia for 2022 was 44.58%, a decrease when compared to 52.16% in 2021.\n\n## Provision Charges and Credit Quality\n\nFor the year 2022, total credit impairment charges, net totaled COP 3,792 billion (or 1.6% of average loans), which represents an increase of 56.65% as compared to COP 2,421 billion (or 1.2% of average loans) in 2021. This variation is basically explained by the low basis of comparison in 2021. The bank has gradually moved closer to a normalized level of cost of risk. The volume of provision releases a year earlier were much higher in the light of the economic recovery experienced and the better-than-expected clients' performance. In 2022, the significant growth in the loan portfolio contributed to a higher provision expense in a yearly basis under the expected loss models.\n\nNet loan charge-offs totaled COP 6.165 billion in 2022 up 22.41% from the 5.036 billion in 2021.\n\nAn important amount of the charge-offs in the last year is related to customers not being able to honor their credit obligations after the end of the credit reliefs  granted  during  the  COVID-19  crisis  and  were  considered  unlikely  to  be  collected.  On  the  other  hand,  the  bank  has  made  significant improvements  in  the  collection  procedures  to  recover  the  balances  of  borrowers  that  become  delinquent,  coupled  with  the  execution  of  collaterals guaranteeing the debt. Net Charge-offs have two important features first, they reduce the balance of the loan portfolio, and second, they help reduce the amount of past due loans.\n\nPast-due loans amounted to COP 9,578 billion as of December 31, 2022, down 4.41% as compared to COP 10,020 billion as of December 31, 2021.",

The decrease in this ratio is mainly due to; first, better customer payment habits when compared to a year earlier and the execution of procedures throughout the credit cycle to anticipate actions on non-performing clients that allowed to improve the efficiency in the collection process, and second, an increase in the volume of charge-offs that reduced the amount of past due loans.\n\n## Income Tax Expenses\n\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year 2022 totaled COP 2,748 billion, 54.73% higher than COP 1,776 billion in 2021. The effective tax rate for 2022 was 28.20%.\n\nIncome tax expense in 2022 was impacted mainly by the operation in Colombia. The lower tax rate when compared with the statutory tax rate results from tax benefits. For Colombia, there are exemptions related to the mortgage portfolio for social housing, investments in productive fixed assets and untaxed  dividends.  For  the  remaining  operations,  tax  benefits  were  associated  with  the  exempt  income  from  returns  on  securities  issued  by  the Governments of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Panama.\n\nFor further details please see Note 12 of Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RESULTS BY SEGMENT\n\nThe Bank manages its business through 9 main operating segments: Banking Colombia, Banking El Salvador, Banking Panama, Banking Guatemala, Trust, Investment Banking, Brokerage, International Banking and All Other.\n\nThe segment information in this Annual Report reflects the reporting structure in place at the reporting date in accordance with the segment information in Note 3.

3,712  billion  in  2021,  due  to  the  reasons described below.\n\nTotal  interest  and  valuation  increased  by  80.27%  to  COP  20,727  billion,  mainly  explained  by  interest  income  growth  on  loans  and  financial  leases operations resulting from growth in the loan portfolio which grew at 18.71% and the Central Bank's reference rate hikes during the year that impacted margins because of the asset-sensitive  nature  of  the  Bank's  balance  sheet.  This  increase  was  mainly  reflected  in  interest  income  from  commercial, consumer and mortgage loans.\n\nTotal interest expenses increased by 137.50% to COP 6,334 billion, due to a by 68.8% increase in time deposits in line with the Central Bank's reference rate hike in 2022. Net interest margin and valuation of financial instruments reflected an increase by 62.99% to COP 14,394 billion.\n\nTotal  credit  impairment  charges,  net  increased  by  40.09%  to  COP  2,972  billion.  This  variation  is  mainly  due  to  loan  portfolio  growth,  credit deterioration in the consumer portfolio, and additional charges by macroeconomic variables estimated in the risk models.\n\nTotal fees and commission net, increased by 11.58% to COP 2,585 billion, mainly driven by a better performance in bank acceptances and guarantees which increased by 32.90%, Bancassurance by 27.96%, credit and debit cards by 22.62%, banking services by 15.96%, and payments-collections by 17.79% (digital channels) as a result of higher transaction flows associated with the economic recovery. Such increases were partially offset by fees and commission expenses that increased by 37.71% when compared to the previous year.",

        "page_content": "Other operating income decreased by 111.16% to COP (72,994) billion becoming an expense, mostly due to the lower income from foreign exchange derivatives  because  of  higher  volatility  levels  on  the  FX  market  in  line  with  the  uncertainty  related  to  political  risk  and  macroeconomic  variables worldwide, as well as the depreciation of the Colombian peso.\n\nDividends and net profits from capital investments decreased by 108.59% to a loss of COP (8) billion from a profit of COP 94 billion in 2021, mainly due to lower income from dividends and from the equity method of associated companies and joint ventures, as a result of macroeconomic conditions that generated lower profits.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 18.67% to COP 7,214 billion, largerly due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits by 15.68% to COP 2,960 billion.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Colombia grew by 17.7% during the year, mainly driven by loan book growth, and in particular due to strong commercial and consumer portfolio performance.\n\nFinally, liabilities attributable to Banking Colombia grew by 16.98% during 2022, driven by an increase in deposits, particularly time deposits.\n\n## Banking El Salvador through Banco Agr\u00edcola S.A. :\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|

        "page_content": "The financial statements expressed in Colombian pesos are affected by the depreciation of the COP against the USD, which reached 20.82% during the last year.\n\nTotal  interest  and  valuation  expressed  in  COP  increased  by  27.98%  to  COP  1,528  billion  (12.65%  when  expressed  in  USD)  mainly  due  to  higher accrued interest income from the commercial portfolio and the effect of depreciation.\n\nMoreover, the loan book in COP grew 33.79% and 10.73% in USD on an annual basis, mainly driven by the commercial and consumer portfolio which grew 14.81% and 9.25% respectively when expressed in USD. On the other hand, deposits grew by 4.80% mainly driven by saving accounts in retail segments. Furthermore, borrowings from other financial institutions also increased to strengthen the liability structure and partially offset the decrease observed in bonds as a result of maturities.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net substantially increased to COP 103 billion from COP (4) billion in 2021, primarily due to growth in consumer portfolio origination and less provisions reversal when compared to 2021.\n\nTotal fees and commissions, net increased by 12.54% to COP 274 billion despite fees and commission expenses growing by 46.28% due to higher transactional fees charged by card associations which cannot be passed through completely to clients.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 18.28% to COP 746 billion, primarily caused by increases in salaries, employee benefits, and general expenses.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking El Salvador grew by 27.25% during the year, mainly driven by growth in loans and by the depreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD dollars.\n\n## Banking Panama:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                                                                                             | Year ended

However, when measured in USD, interest and valuation increased by 5.98% mainly due to an expansion of 6.84% in the commercial portfolio and 3.21% in the mortgage portfolio. The overall loan book grew by 3.72% in USD in spite of a reduction of 3.49% in the consumer portfolio.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net increased by 68.62% to COP 545 billion compared to COP 323 billion in 2021. This variation is mainly due to the higher provision charges in the consumer portfolio and a specific provision in the construction and real estate segment.\n\nTotal fees and commission, net increased by 18.47% to COP 237 billion, mainly driven by higher income generated by merchant acquiring services and ATM fees in spite of an increase in banking services expenses.\n\nTotal  operating  expenses  increased  by  12.76%  due  to  increases  in  labor  expenses  and  outsourcing  contracts  for  transformation  projects  which  are partially offset by reductions in bonuses.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Panama increased by 29.30% during the year, mainly driven by the depreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD.\n\n## Banking Guatemala :\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|

The loan portfolio expressed in USD grew by 11.75%, with loans increasing by 4.11% in commercial, 44.94% in consumer, and 16.02% in mortgages.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net increased by 571.06% to COP 169 billion from COP (36) billion in 2021, due to higher provision charges in line with the consumer portfolio growth and lower provision reversals from the commercial portfolio when compared to 2021.\n\nTotal fees and commission, net increased by 15.82% to COP 127 billion mainly due to fees income growth from banking services, electronic services, and ATMs despite the increase in banking services expenses.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 11.51% to COP 632 billion, mainly due to a reduction in administrative and general expenses that offsets the growth in salaries and bonuses. Assets attributable to Banking Guatemala increased by 34.00% during the year, mainly due to the growth in the loan book and the depreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD dollars\n\n## Trust :\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                                                           | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   | Year

125  billion  in  2021  due  to  the  reasons described below.\n\nThe financial statements expressed in Colombian pesos are affected by the depreciation of the COP against the USD, which reached 20.82% during the last year. As a result, total interest and valuation increased in COP terms by 104.04%, to COP 512 billion from COP 251 billion in 2021, mainly due to significant growth in the loan book.\n\nTotal  credit  impairment  charges,  net  increased  by  66.92%  to  COP  (25)  billion  from  COP  (15)  billion  in  2021,  mainly  due  to  a  higher  volume  of provision reversal as a result of better asset quality, shorter duration on the loan portfolio and better macroeconomic variables in the risk models.\n\nTotal fees and commissions, net increased by 27.07%, to COP 34 billion, mainly due to a higher volume of transactions consequently with the increase in the number of clients in the international banking segment.",

by an increase in operating lease income from renting Colombia.\n\nDividends and net income on equity investments increased from COP 197 billion to COP 221 billion in 2022 because of a better performance from the Viva Malls real estate portfolio.\n\nTotal  operating  expenses  increased  by  29.80%  to  COP  946  billion  mainly  due  to  an  increase  in  administrative  and  general

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## B.1        LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING\n\n## Liquid Assets\n\nOne of the main principles of the Bank is to maintain a solid liquidity position. Accordingly, the ALCO Committee has established a minimum level of liquid assets, based on the funding needs of each subsidiary, to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Bank's reputation.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Bank seeks the optimum level of liquid assets to assure not only the proper operation under normal conditions but also to operate under stress market scenarios. During 2022, the Bank maintained a solid liquidity position, with high liquidity levels during the first half of the year.\n\nThe following table shows the composition of the liquid assets in the last two years:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| Liquid Assets  (1)             | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| High quality Liquid Assets *   |                     |                     |\n| Cash                           | 26,299,990          | 22,641,516          |\n| High quality liquid securities | 17,739,501          | 18,258,002          |\n| Other Liquid Assets            |                     |                     |\n| Other securities **            | 4,019,688           | 3,299,371           |\n| Total Liquid Assets            | 48,059,179          | 44,198,889          |\n\n* High-quality liquid assets: cash and shares that are eligible to be reportable or repo operations, in addition to those liquid assets that the Central Bank receives for its monetary expansion and contraction operations described in paragraph 3.1.1 of the Foreign Regulatory Circular DODM-142 of the central bank.\n\n## ** Other Securities: Securities issued by financial and corporate entities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, liquid assets showed a growth of COP 3,860 billion, mainly due to the increase in cash and high-quality liquid securities. This change is a consequence of higher demand deposits, resulting in higher reserve requirements (cash) and excess liquidity, which has been managed through the treasury portfolio with purchases of high-quality liquid securities.\n\nThe Bank measures liquid assets on a daily basis and compares this result to an objective target set by the Risk Committee. Under this rule, daily liquid assets must be equal to or higher than such target. In the event the limit is not reached, there is a five-day period to increase liquidity levels.\n\nCash is important to guarantee branch and ATM operations. The Bank's expansion across the Colombian territory requires considerable levels of cash; however,  cash  levels  are  daily  monitored  in  order  to  minimize  opportunity  costs.  Additionally,  cash  is  considered  in  the  mandatory  bank  reserve established by the Central Bank.\n\nSecurities that comprise liquid assets are reviewed by the ALCO considering the Bank's liquidity objective. Even though available for sale and held to maturity debt securities cannot be sold, they can be pledged as collateral in repurchase agreements. Some of them are mandatory investments that can be posted to the Central Bank as collateral.\n\nSFC requires financial entities to have liquid assets greater than the contractual liquidity cumulative one-month gap. This contractual gap reflects the maturity of the current positions of assets and liabilities and does not reflect projections of",

The  maturity  of  the  loan  portfolio  for  this  purpose  is  affected  by  the  historical  default  indicator  and  the  maturity  of  deposits  is modeled according to the regulation.\n\nThe  Bank's  management  believes  that  the  current  level  of  liquidity  is  adequate  and  will  seek  to  maintain  its  solid  deposit  base  and  the  access  to alternative sources of funding such as borrowings from domestic and international development and commercial banks, repurchase agreements, bond issuances, overnight funds and Central Bank funds, considering market conditions, interest rates and the desired maturity profile of liabilities.\n\n## Funding Structure\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Bank's  liabilities  reached  COP  312,817  billion,  a  22.23%  increase  compared  to  December  31,  2021.  Liabilities denominated in Colombian Pesos increased by 16.24%, and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars increased by 31.25%. These changes are principally the result of the increase in both COP and USD denominated time deposits and USD denominated saving accounts and borrowings from other financial institutions, offset by a decline in debt securities in issue and COP denominated checking accounts. However, although USD denominated liabilities increased by 31.25%, this increase was affected by the depreciation of the USD/COP exchange rate (20.82% in 2022).\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                     | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                     | 2022                 | 2021                 |\n|                     | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Total funding       |                      |                      |\n| Peso-denominated    | 178,861,272          | 153,871,797          |\n| Dollar-denominated. | 133,955,910          | 102,057,793          |\n| Total Liabilities   | 312,817,182          | 255,929,590          |\n\nIn 2022, the Bank experienced a growth in deposits which reached COP 250,992 billion at year-end, an increase of COP 40,601 billion, or 19.30% compared to the level at December 31, 2021. COP denominated deposits increased by 14.20%, explained mainly by the rise in COP denominated time deposits, while USD denominated deposits increased by 28.12% as a result of the rise in USD denominated saving accounts and time deposits. The ratio of deposits to total assets was 71.14%, decreasing by 144 basis points compared to 2021.\n\n|                | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                | 2022                 | 2021                 |\n|                | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Total Deposits | 250,992,323          | 210,390,848          |\n\nThe following table sets forth checking accounts, savings accounts and time deposits as a percentage of the Bank's total liabilities for the years 2022 and 2021:\n\n|                                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Checking accounts               | 12.9 % | 15.9 % |\n| Time deposits                   | 27.9 % | 23.2 % |\n| Saving accounts                 | 37.8 % | 41.5 % |\n| Other deposits                  | 1.5 %  | 1.6 %  |\n| Percentage of Total Liabilities | 80.1 % | 82.2 % |",

This change is primarily explained by the increase in net loans and advances to customers, that rose from COP 204,459 billion in 2021 to COP 254,444 billion in 2022, which was higher compared with the growth in deposits (the increase was COP 51,742 billion reaching an amount of COP 270,684 billion in 2022).\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                       | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                       | 2022                 | 2021                 |\n| Net Loans to Deposits | 94.00 %              | 93.38 %              |\n\nThe Bank also funds its operations with borrowings from financial institutions, which were used to replace debt securities due in 2022. Nevertheless, in order to maintain a lower cost of funds, the growth of loans was financed mainly by deposits. Additionally, Bancolombia's borrowings from financial institutions are linked to different market rates/indexes like the IBR, (a short-term benchmark interest rate of Colombian money market liquidity that reflects the price at which banks are willing to lend or borrow funds from financial market), DTF, IPC1, LIBOR and SOFR.\n\nIn 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement has resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR which is used as interest rate benchmark. On December 31, 2022, Bancolombia had USD 605 million of liabilities linked to LIBOR, which represents 0.93% of total liabilities as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIt is important to highlight that two years after the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures and restrictions that were implemented by the government and the Central Bank were eliminated. This led to a normalization of the monetary policy and recovery of economic activity, resulting in the improved performance of the loan portfolio.\n\nIn addition, compliance with the Net Stable Funding Ratio in 2022, the increase in inflation and local and international political uncertainty generated additional pressure on the cost of financing operations in the short and long term.\n\nOn the  other  hand,  during  the  second  half  of  the  year  the  Bank  issued  sustainability  linked  bonds,  the  funds  from  which  will  be  used  to  provide financing to 1.5 million low-income people and reduce Co2 emissions by 36% over the next three years.\n\n## Debt instruments in issue\n\nIn  2022,  Bancolombia  issued  COP  640  billion  aggregate  principal  of  senior  notes  (Sustainability  Linked  Bonds),  while  Bancolombia  Panam\u00e1  and Banistmo issued notes in amounts of USD 70.8 million and USD 96.6 million, respectively. The carrying amount of debt securities in issue decreased by COP 1,517 billion.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total outstanding aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Bank was COP 19,575 billion.\n\nThe following table shows the Bank's debt securities in issue maturity profile:",

This increase is mainly explained by the generation of profits during 2022 and the depreciation of the COP versus the USD.\n\nThe Bank's capital adequacy ratio on a consolidated basis was 12.79% as of December 31, 2022, down from 15.49% in 2021.\n\nThe Bank's capital adequacy ratio exceeded the requirements of the Colombian government and the SFC by 379 basis points above the minimum 9% required  by  the  Colombian  regulator.  The  basic  capital  ratio  (Tier  1)  was  10.37%  and  the  tangible  capital  ratio,  which  is  equal  to  the  ratio  of  the difference between equity and goodwill and intangible assets to tangible assets, was 8.21% at the end of 2022.

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## B.2       FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TREASURY ACTIVITIES\n\nThe  Bank's  treasury  division  is  responsible  for  the  sales  and  trading  activities  in  Bancolombia,  Banistmo,  Banco  Agr\u00edcola,  Bancolombia  Panam\u00e1, Bancolombia Puerto Rico, and BAM. It is accountable for the execution of all transactions in domestic and foreign currencies legally authorized in Colombia and in all the countries where the Bank has presence. These include derivatives transactions, fixed income and indexed securities trading, repurchase or resale transactions, short sales, temporary securities transfers, as well as FX trading.\n\nThe Bank monitors treasury division activities through policies regarding the management of liquidity, market, legal, credit and operational risks. Such policies are monitored by the Vice-President of Risk Management. With the aim to control market and liquidity risks, the Bank sets limits intended to keep its exposure levels and losses within certain ranges determined by the Bank's Board of Directors. The Bank's investment policies do not include restrictions regarding the maturity of the securities held in the portfolio, except for those related to the liquidity portfolio and over the counter ('OTC') derivatives transactions held by Bancolombia and Banistmo.\n\nBefore taking any additional position, the Bank's treasury division also verifies, with respect to investments in domestic and in foreign currencies, the availability of funds for investment and each investment's suitability with the Bank's liquidity structure.\n\nAs mentioned in Item 11. 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk', the market risk stated in the treasury book is measured with value at risk (VaR) metrics, and the position limits are based on the results of these methodologies. The Bank has defined VaR limits that follow a hierarchical structure, which avoids the concentration of market risk in certain groups of assets and also takes advantage of portfolio diversification. In addition to VaR limits, the Bank uses stop loss signals, except for GFA, to inform senior management when accumulated losses are close to certain predefined  thresholds  in  the  trading  book.  Moreover,  for  the  options  portfolio  in  Bancolombia,  the  Bank  has  set  limits  based  on  the  sensitivity  of  the portfolio to the underlying volatility, underlying currency and interest rates.\n\nAs  part  of  its  operations,  the  Bank  holds  cash  and  cash  equivalents  primarily  in  Colombian  pesos,  U.S.  dollars  and  Guatemalan  quetzals.  These positions,  as  well  as  any  other  currency  position,  are  determined  by  the  treasury  division  in  connection  with  the  Bank's  foreign  exchange  rate  risk assessment and management. Specifically, the Bank's exposure to FX risk primarily arises from changes in the USD/COP exchange rate. The exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is managed by the Bank's Treasury Division. The Bank estimates VaR metrics to limit the exposure to foreign exchange rate  risk  of  its  balance  sheet  in  Bancolombia,  Valores  Bancolombia, Banco Agr\u00edcola, Banistmo and BAM. These limits are supervised daily by the Bank's Market Risk Management Office. The Bank's Treasury Division manages a derivative portfolio in Bancolombia and Banistmo, which includes forward in FX with the purpose, among others, of hedging its overall currency exposure.\n\nThe Colombian Chief Treasury Officer ('CTO'), centralizes all the reports from the Treasury Directors in the subsidiaries in all geographies, in which they are responsible for FX, investment and risk taking.\n\nThere are several communications channels between the Treasury divisions and the CTO, which are: Investment Committee; the participants in this meeting, which is held monthly, are: CTO, Proprietary Trading Director, Market Risk Director, Treasury Directors from each Bank, and the Head of each desk in Colombia (Fixed Income, FX and Derivatives). This committee reviews the investment strategy portfolios, profit and loss figures, VaR levels, Benchmark portfolios, based on the framework and risk appetite, defined by the Board of Directors.\n\nPerformance is measured against the 'Benchmark' approved for each treasury, which includes a target position for each asset and limits for every product and market, in which the treasury operation can invest. There is a continuous follow up of the portfolios in the investment committee, which runs monthly.\n\n## B.3       COMMITMENT FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\n\nSee Item 4. 'Information on the Company - A.

TREND INFORMATION\n\nFollowing  the  strong  performance  of  the  economies  in  which  Bancolombia  operates,  2022  was  a  year  of  continued  expansion  in  revenues,  loan originations, and fees. Net interest and valuation income in 2022 grew 55.52%. This was mainly due to the following factors: growth of the credit portfolio, higher inflation and higher interest rates that contributed to an increase in margins, coupled with a sound asset quality that allowed to keep provision expenses under control. The following is a brief discussion of recent trends in the company and the economy.\n\n## Loan Volume Performance\n\nGross Gross loans and financial leases (i.e., before allowance for loans and financial lease losses) topped COP 269,924 billion increasing 22.51% year over  year.  Depreciation  of  the  Colombian  Peso  against  the  US  dollar  was  20.82%,  partially  impacting  the  increase  in  the  balance  considering  that 37.29% of total loans are denominated in foreign currencies. When excluding the FX effect, the actual variation was 14.64%.\n\nAll  the  geographies  in  which  Bancolombia  operates  reported  an  annual  increase  in  real  terms  in  its  portfolio.  All  loan  categories  exhibited  good performance; in particular commercial loans experienced accelerated growth when compared to 2021. Consumer loans grew 23.21%, commercial loans 22.57%, mortgages 21.94% and micro lending 3.59%.\n\nLoans in Bancolombia S.A. were 18.7% up on annual basis, performing better than expected, supported by the general positive economic climate in Colombia and by our established strategy to offer preapproved lines of credit with substantial results in the effectiveness ratio. The Colombian economy displayed consistent growth of gross domestic product boosted by private consumption and reflected in the demand for credit. During the second half, a deceleration in loan disbursements following the interest rate hikes by the central bank, especially impacting the consumer book.\n\nLoans in Banco Agricola expanded 10.73% in dollar terms during 2022. Lending activity was strong mostly in the commercial segment, allowing in Banco Agricola to retain the leadership position in the market. After a sharp pandemic-related contraction in 2020, the economy of El Salvador had a significant rebound in 2021 and has continued its recovery in 2022 with satisfactory growth in household consumption that was reflected in a faster development of retail credit demand at Banco Agricola on an annual basis.\n\nBanistmo's loan book increased 3.72% during 2022 when measured in dollars. Panama has been the country most impacted by the pandemic in Central America, although in the last two years the country has begun to recover from the crisis leading to growth in GDP. Thanks to strong performance in the corporate  sector,  commercial  loans  have  expanded  and  contributed  the  most  to  loan  growth,  while  remaining  the  largest  share  of  the  portfolio  in Banistmo. Retail contracted in 2022 as a result of Banistmo's tightening the origination risk parameters as a conservative approach aimed at prioritizing asset quality.\n\nBanco Agromercantil reported an increase of 11.75% in its credit portfolio with mixed performance in the various segments. Consumer expanded the most as well as mortgages while commercial reflected slower growth (4.11% increase). Growth in retail loans reached 44.94% year over year and is explained due to the implementation of strategies based in",

As a result, consumer reflected a gradual increase in the proportion of the total portfolio. Guatemala posted a strong recovery in 2021 and continued to have a good performance in 2022, -even though at a slower rate, due to solid internal consumption, growth of gross capital formation and a balanced dynamism performance across most sectors of the economy.\n\nForeign-denominated  loans  increased  8.11%  during  2022.  The  performance  of  the  portfolio  in  the  international  banking  operation  of  Bancolombia Panama, Puerto Rico, the USD denominated loans in Colombia, and the operation of Guatemala contributed primarily to the expansion of the dollar denominated portfolio for the consolidated figures.\n\nThe loan portfolio may not continue to grow at a similar pace in 2023, due to a slowdown in the global economy.\n\n## Net Interest Margin and Valuation\n\nMost of the Bank's loan book has a variable rate and the re-pricing pace of our assets tends to be faster than that of the Bank's liabilities.\n\nThe annualized net interest margin in a consolidated basis was 6.80% for 2022, an increase increasing when compared to the ratio of 5.09% reported in 2021.\n\nInterest income increased due to the performance of the investment securities portfolio and the loan portfolio. The main factor resulting in the expansion of the net interest margin was the rate hikes and the monetary policy in place during the year by the Colombian Central Bank that caused a significant repricing of loans indexed to floating rates in local currency and higher rates on new originations. To a lesser extent, the change in the mix of the portfolio  between  segments  has  contributed  to  a  higher  normalized  margin  over  the  last  few  years.  The  strategy  of  the  Bank  has  been  to  focus  on increasing the share in retail. The goal of this strategy is to defend margins, optimize the capital allocation and maintain the credit quality within the risk appetite boundaries.\n\nFollowing the trend of interest rates hikes, the interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased during the year. A change in the composition of the funding mix also added to the higher funding cost, in which time deposits gained share due to an increasing appetite from customers for higher yields  as  well  as  an  appetite  from  the  bank  to  Bank  to  secure  longer  maturity  deposits  to  support  liquidity  and  comply  with  recent  regulatory requirements. Customer deposits account for more than 85% of the Bank's funding needs, offering a cost-competitive and stable source of funding.\n\n## Cost of credit\n\nFor the year 2022, the cost of credit was 1.56% of average loans, an increase when compared to the 1.18% recorded in 2021. This value continued to be below a normalized level relative to the volume of the credit portfolio on a consolidated basis. During the year, the improvement of macroeconomic variables in Colombia, coupled with better asset quality metrics from clients previously covered under COVID-19 credit reliefs, contributed to a lower than usual provision expense. Bancolombia maintains a strong balance sheet supported by an adequate level of loan loss reserves, reporting a coverage ratio to PDLs (overdue 30 days) of 168.7% as of December 2022.\n\n## E.

MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\n\nSet forth below is certain information concerning the Bank's capital stock and a brief summary of certain significant provisions of the Bank's bylaws and  Colombian  corporate  law.  This  description  does  not  purport  to  be  complete  and  is  qualified  by  reference  to  the  Bank's  bylaws  (an  English translation of which is attached as Exhibit 1 to this Annual Report) and to Colombian corporate law.\n\n## Bancolombia's Corporate Purpose\n\nPursuant to Article 4 of its bylaws, Bancolombia's corporate purpose consists of all kinds of banking operations, business, acts and services. Subject to applicable law, Bancolombia may carry out all the activities and investments authorized to banks. Bancolombia is also authorized to participate in the capital stock of other companies, subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nAs of the date of filing of this Annual Report, Bancolombia's board of directors is composed of seven directors, elected for a two-year term, with no alternate directors. For additional information regarding Bancolombia's current directors please see Item 6.A, 'Directors and Senior Management'.\n\nAfter being designated, all of the members of the Board of Directors need an authorization from the Superintendency of Finance. The Superintendency of Finance assesses whether the director has an adequate profile for the position according to the requirements under Colombian Law.\n\nAccording to Decree 3923 of 2006, the election of independent directors must be in a separate ballot from the ballot to elect the rest of directors, unless the reaching of the minimum number of independent directors required by law or by the by-laws is assured, or when there is only one list that includes the  minimum  number  of  required  independent  directors.  According  to  Law  964  of  2005,  25%  of  the  members  of  the  board  of  directors  shall  be independent. An 'independent director' is a director who is NOT: (i) an employee or director of the issuer or any of its parent or subsidiary companies, including all those persons acting in said capacity during the year immediately preceding that in which they were appointed, except in the case of an independent member of the board of directors being re-elected; (ii) shareholders, who either directly or by virtue of an agreement direct, guide or control the majority of the entity's voting rights or who determine the majority composition of the administration, the board of directors or other corporate bodies  of  this  same  entity;  (iii)  a  partner  or  employee  of  any  association  or  firm  that  provides  advisory  or  consultancy  services  to  the  issuer  or  to companies who belong to the same economic group to which the issuer in question belongs, in the event that income obtained from such services represent  for  said  association  or  firm  twenty  percent  (20%)  or  more  of  its  total  operating  income;  (iv)  an  employee  or  director  of  a  foundation, association  or  institution  that  receives  significant  donations  from  the  issuer.  The  term  'significant  donations'  is  quantified  as  being  twenty  percent (20%) or more of the total amount of donations received by the respective institution; (v) an administrator of any entity on whose board of directors a legal  representative  of  the  issuer  participates;  and  (vi)  any  person  who  receives  from  the  issuer  any  kind  of  remuneration  different  from  fees  as  a member of the board of directors, of the audit committee or any other committee set up by the board of directors.\n\nIn January and November 2022, the Corporate Governance Code was modified by the Board of Directors in order to strengthen the independence of the board. As part of this, the following criteria were added to those required to qualify a director as non-independent:\n\n- i. Employees or managers of Bancolombia or of any of its affiliates, subsidiaries or controllers, or former employees or managers of Bancolombia or of any of its affiliates, subsidiaries or controllers, during the two year period immediately prior to the appointment, except in the case of the re-election of an independent person.",

Votes may not be cast for particular nominees in a group; they may be cast only for the entire group; (v) the total number of votes casted in the election is divided by the number of directors to be elected. The resulting quotient is the quota of votes necessary to elect particular directors. For each time that the number of votes cast for a group of nominees is divisible by the quota of votes, one nominee from that group is elected, in the order of the list of that group; and (vi) when no group has enough remaining votes to satisfy the quota of votes necessary to elect a director, any remaining board seat or seats are filled by electing the highest remaining nominee from the group with the highest number of remaining votes cast until all available seats have been filled.\n\nThe directors of Bancolombia must abstain from participating, directly or through an intermediary, on their own behalf or on behalf of a third party, in activities that may compete against the Bank or in conflict-of-interest transactions that may generate a conflict of interest situation, unless the general shareholders meeting expressly authorizes such transactions.\n\nFor such purposes, the directors shall provide the shareholders' meeting with all the relevant information necessary for the shareholders to reach a decision.

In the general annual shareholders meeting the shareholders are responsible for determining, the compensation of the members of the board of directors.\n\nPursuant to the by-laws of Bancolombia, the board of directors has the power to authorize the execution of any agreement, within the corporate purpose of Bancolombia, and to adopt the necessary measures in order for the Bank to accomplish its purpose, except for agreements that, by law, can only be authorized at the Shareholders 'Meeting. Furthermore, the board of directors must authorize certain transactions such as the issuance of Bank's bonds or common shares up to the total amount of authorized capital stock.\n\n## Description of Share Rights, Preferences and Restrictions\n\nBancolombia's bylaws provide for an authorized capital stock of COP 700 billion divided into 1,400,000,000 shares of a par value of COP 500 each, which must belong to one of the following classes: (i) common shares, (ii) privileged shares; and (iii) shares with preferred dividend and no voting rights ('preferred shares').

If a quorum is not present, a subsequent meeting is called at which the presence of one or more holders of shares entitled to vote at the relevant meeting constitutes a quorum, regardless of the number of shares represented. General shareholders' meetings may be called by the board of directors, the CEO or the external auditor of Bancolombia.\n\nIn addition, according to Bancolombia's Good Governance Code, two or more shareholders representing at least 10% of the outstanding shares have the right  to  request  that  a  general  meeting  be  convened.

In this event, holders of such shares shall retain their voting rights until the corresponding dividends have been fully paid to them. (iii) if at the end of a fiscal period, the Bank's profits are not enough to pay the minimum dividend and the Superintendency of Finance, by its own decision or upon petition of holders of at least ten percent (10%) of preferred shares, determines that benefits were concealed or shareholders were misled with regard to benefits received from the Bank by the Bank's directors or officers decreasing the profits to be distributed, the Superintendency of Finance may resolve that holders of preferred shares should participate with speaking and voting rights at the general shareholders' meeting, in the terms established by law. (iv) when the registration of shares at the Colombian Securities Exchange or at the Superintendency of Finance, is suspended or canceled. In this event, voting rights shall be maintained until the irregularities that resulted in such cancellation or suspension are resolved.

Common shares that are only partially-paid participate in a dividend or distribution in the same proportion as the shares that have been fully paid in at the time of the dividend or distribution.\n\nThe general shareholders' meeting may allocate a portion of the profits to welfare, education or civic services, or to support economic organizations of the Bank's employees.\n\n## Preferred Shares\n\nHolders of preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends based on the net profits of the preceding fiscal year, after deducting losses affecting the capital and once the amount that shall be legally set apart for the legal reserve has been deducted, but before creating or accruing for any other reserve, of  a  non-cumulative  minimum  preferred  dividend  equal  to  one  percent  (1%)  yearly  of  the  subscription  price  of  the  preferred  share,  provided  this dividend is higher than the dividend assigned to common shares. If this is not the case, the dividend shall be increased to an amount that is equal to the per  share  dividend  on  the  common  shares.  The  dividend  received  by  holders  of  common  shares  may  not  be  higher  than  the  dividend  assigned  to preferred shares.\n\nPayment of the preferred dividend shall be made at the time and in the manner established in the general shareholders' meeting and with the priority indicated by Colombian law.\n\nIn the event that the holders of preferred shares have not received the minimum dividend for a period in excess of two consecutive fiscal years, they will acquire  certain  voting  rights.  See  Item  10.  'Aditional  Information  -  B.  Memorandum  and  Articles  of  Association  -  Description  of  Share  Rights, Preferences and Restrictions - Voting Rights - Preferred Shares'.\n\n## General Considerations Relating to Dividends\n\nIn  the  general  shareholders'  meeting,  shareholders  will  determine  the  effective  date,  the  system  and  the  place  for  payment  of  dividends,  including payment in installments.\n\nDividends  declared  on  the  common  shares  and  the  preferred  shares  will  be  payable  to  the  record  holders  of  those  shares,  as  they  are  recorded  on Bancolombia's stock registry, on the appropriate record dates as determined in the general shareholders' meeting.\n\nAny dividend in shares payable by Bancolombia will be paid in common shares to the holders of common shares and in preferred shares to the holders of preferred shares. Nonetheless, Shareholders at the general shareholders' meeting may authorize the payment in common shares to all shareholders.\n\nAny dividend in shares requires the approval of 80% or more of the shares present at a shareholders' meeting, which will include 80% or more of the outstanding preferred shares. In the event that such voting majority is not obtained, shareholders may individually elect to receive a stock dividend or a cash dividend.",

In addition, the Superintendency of Finance has the power to take over the operations and assets of a bank and proceed to its liquidation under certain circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the 'Estatuto Org\u00e1nico del Sistema Financiero', Decree 663 of 1993. For more information see Item 4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8. Supervision and Regulation - Bankruptcy Considerations'.\n\n## Preemptive Rights and Other Anti-Dilution Provisions\n\nUnder the Bank's bylaws, the holders of common shares determine in their meeting the amount of authorized capital stock, and the board of directors has the power to (a) order the issuance and regulate the terms of subscription of common shares up to the total amount of authorized capital stock and (b)  regulate  the  issuance  of  shares  with  rights  to  a  preferential  dividend  but  without  the  right  to  vote,  when  expressly  delegated  at  the  general shareholders' meeting. The issuance of preferred shares must always be first approved at the general shareholders' meeting, which shall determine the nature and extent of any privileges, according to the bylaws and Colombian law.\n\nThe Bank's bylaws and Colombian law require that, whenever the Bank issues new shares of any outstanding class, it must offer the holders of each class of shares the right to purchase a number of shares of such class sufficient to maintain their existing percentage ownership of the aggregate capital stock of the Bank. These rights are called preemptive rights. See Item 3. 'Key Information - D. Risk Factors - Preemptive rights may not be available to holders of American Depositary Receipts ('ADRs') evidencing ADSs'.\n\nShareholders at a general meeting of shareholders may suspend preemptive rights with respect to a particular capital increase by a favorable vote of at least 70% of the shares represented at the meeting. Preemptive rights must be exercised within the period stated in the share placement terms of the increase, which cannot be shorter than 15 business days following the publication of the notice of the public offer of that capital increase. From the date of the notice of the share placement terms, preemptive rights may be transferred separately from the corresponding shares.\n\nThe  Superintendency  of  Finance  will  authorize  decreases  in  the  outstanding  capital  stock  decided  by  the  holders  of  common  shares  only  if:  (i) Bancolombia  has  no  liabilities;  (ii)  Bancolombia's  creditors  consent  in  writing;  or  (iii)  the  outstanding  capital  stock  remaining  after  the  reduction represents at least twice the amount of Bancolombia's liabilities.\n\n## Limits on Purchases and Sales of Capital Stock by Related Parties\n\nPursuant to the Colombian Commerce Code, the members of the Bank's board of directors and certain of the Bank's principal executive officers may not,  directly  or  indirectly,  buy  or  sell  shares  of  the  Bank's  capital  stock  while  they  hold  their  positions,  except  when  dealing  with  nonspeculative operations  and  in  that  case  they  need  to  obtain  the  prior  authorization  of  the  board  of  directors  passed  with  the  vote  of  two-thirds  of  its  members (excluding, in the case of transactions by a director, such director's vote) or when deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the Bank with the authorization of the Shareholders Meeting the affirmative vote of the ordinary majority foreseen in the bylaws, excluding the vote of the petitioner.\n\n## No Redemption\n\nColombian law prohibits Bancolombia from repurchasing shares of its capital stock, including the preferred shares.",

Any transfer of shares equal to or greater than 5% of the Bank's capital stock or any person acquiring a percentage of shares that would make him the beneficial owner of 5% or more of the Bank's capital stock, is a material event, and therefore, must be disclosed to the Superintendency of Finance.\n\n## Changes in the Capital of the Company\n\nThere  are  no  conditions  in  the  Bank's  by-laws  governing  changes  in  the  Bank's  capital  stock  that  are  more  stringent  than  those  required  under Colombian law.\n\n## C.                 MATERIAL CONTRACTS\n\nBancolombia has not entered into any contract, other than those entered in the ordinary course of business or that are not considered to be material, to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party, for the two years immediately preceding the date of this Annual Report.\n\n## D.                 EXCHANGE CONTROLS\n\nThe Central Bank has consistently made foreign currency available to Colombian private sector entities to meet their foreign currency obligations. Nevertheless, in the event of shortages, foreign currency may not be available to private sector companies and the amounts needed by the Bank to service foreign currency obligations may not be purchased in the open market without substantial additional costs.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Statute, Law 9 of 1991, outlines the Colombian foreign exchange regime which relates to matters such as imports and exports of goods, foreign indebtedness, and guarantees in foreign currencies, among others. Additionally, Decree 1068 of 2015 and Decree 119 of 2017, as amended, sets forth an International Investments Regime which provides for rules applicable to foreign residents who invest in the Colombian securities markets and undertake other types of investments, prescribes registration with the Central Bank of certain foreign exchange transactions, and specifies procedures pursuant to which certain types of foreign investments are to be authorized and administered. Both, the Foreign Exchange Statute and the International Investments Regime are regulated by External Resolution No. 1 of 2018 and External Regulating Circular DCIP-83, both as amended, of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank.\n\nUnder Colombian law and the Bank's by-laws, foreign investors receive the same treatment as Colombian citizens with respect to ownership and the voting rights of ADSs and preferred shares.

TAXATION\n\n## Colombian Taxation\n\n## ADRs do not have the same tax treatment as other equity investments in Colombia.\n\nAlthough ADRs represent Bancolombia's preferred shares, they are held through a foreign capital fund in Colombia, subject to a specific tax regulatory regime. Accordingly, the applicable law in Colombia to equity investments, particularly those relating to dividends and profits from sales, are not applicable to ADRs, including the Bank's ADRs.\n\nUnder Section 18-1 of the Colombian Tax Code, modified by Law 2010 of 2019, dividends were subject to a dividend tax, as follows:\n\n## Foreign Portfolio investment\n\nTo determine the income tax concerning the profits earned from the foreign portfolio investments, regardless of the method or vehicle used to invest by the investor, the following rules shall apply:\n\n- i. Dividends subject to CIT at the corporate level are  taxed at 10%.\n- ii. Dividends that did not pay CIT at the corporate level are subject to the equalization tax at 25% upon distribution, plus a 10% dividend tax on top of it.\n- iii. The tax is to by collected via withholding tax on the accrual or cash basis.\n\n## Tax residence for Individuals\n\nFor Colombian tax purposes, an individual is considered a tax resident if the individual meets any of the following requirements:\n\n- \uf02d He or she remains in Colombia (continuously or not) for an aggregate period of 183 calendar days or more, including entry and departure days from the country, within a period of 365 consecutive calendar days. If that requirement is met by considering the days spent in Colombia over two successive fiscal years, the individual would be viewed as a tax resident as of the second fiscal year.\n- \uf02d Individuals  who  work  for  the  Colombian  Foreign  Services  in  other  countries  under  the  Vienna  Conventions  on  Diplomatic  and Consular Relations and their income and capital gains are exempt from taxation in the country they serve.\n\nIf the individual is a Colombian citizen and falls within any of the following scenarios:\n\n- a) The spouse or dependents are tax residents in Colombia\n- b) 50% or more of their income is a Colombian-sourced income.\n- c) 50% or more of their assets are managed in Colombia.\n- d) 50% or more of their assets are physically located in Colombia.\n- e) If the Colombian Tax Office (DIAN) requests evidence of the fiscal residency status in another country and the individual does not provide it.\n- f) The  individual  has  a  fiscal  residence  in  a  non-cooperative  jurisdiction,  a  place  of  null  or  minimum  taxation,  or  a  preferential  tax  regime jurisdiction (Tax havens).\n\nColombian citizens are not considered tax residents for any of the scenarios above if:\n\n- a) 50% or more of their annual income has been sourced where they are domiciled; or",

Companies incorporated in Colombia under Colombian Laws qualify as National Companies and are taxed on their worldwide income. For Colombian tax purposes, a non-resident entity that is effectively managed in Colombia would be considered as a Colombian entity (effective place of management).\n\n## Preferred shares\n\nPreferred shares will have the same treatment as financial liabilities for the issuer's tax purposes. The treatment will be the same as financial assets for the  holder.  This  treatment  will  not  apply  to  listed  shares  that  do  not  comply  with  the  rest  of  the  requirements  established  by  Section  33-3  of  the Colombian Tax Code.\n\n## Other Tax Considerations\n\nAs of the date of this report, there is not a Double Taxation Treaty between Colombia and the United States.\n\n## United States Federal Income Taxation Considerations\n\nThis section describes the material United States federal income tax consequences generally applicable to a U.S. holder (as defined below) of owning preferred  shares  or  ADSs.  It  applies  to  you  only  if  you  hold  your  preferred  shares  or  ADSs  as  capital  assets  for  United  States  federal  income  tax purposes. This discussion addresses only United States federal income taxation and does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including:\n\n- \u25cf A dealer in securities or currencies,\n- \u25cf A bank,\n- \u25cf A trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings,\n- \u25cf A tax-exempt organization,\n- \u25cf A life insurance company,\n- \u25cf A person that actually or constructively owns 10.00% or more of the combined voting power of the Bank's voting stock or of the total value of the Bank's stock,\n- \u25cf A person that holds preferred shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction for United States federal income tax purposes,\n- \u25cf A person that purchases or sells preferred shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for United States federal income tax purposes, or\n- \u25cf A person whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\n\nThis section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published rulings and court decisions.

In  addition,  this  section  is  based  in  part  upon  the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nIf an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the preferred shares or ADSs, the United States federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding the preferred shares or ADSs should consult its tax advisor with regard to the United States federal income tax treatment of an investment in the preferred shares or ADSs.\n\nYou are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of preferred shares or ADSs and you are:\n\n- \u25cf A citizen or resident of the United States,\n- \u25cf A domestic corporation (or an entity treated as a domestic corporation),\n- \u25cf An estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source, or a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more United States persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\nIn general, and taking into account the earlier assumptions, for United States federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing ADSs, you will be treated as the owner of the preferred shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of preferred shares for ADRs, and ADRs for preferred shares generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax.\n\nThe tax treatment of your preferred shares or ADSs will depend in part on whether or not we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes. Except as discussed below under 'PFIC Rules', this discussion assumes that we are not classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes.\n\nYou should consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state and local and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of preferred shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\n\n## Taxation of Distributions\n\nUnder the United States federal income tax laws, if you are a U.S. holder, the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes), other than certain pro-rata distribution of the Bank's preferred shares, including the amount of any Colombian tax withheld, will be treated as a dividend that is subject to United States federal income taxation. If you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, dividends paid to you that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at preferential rates  applicable  to  long-term  capital  gains  provided  that  you  hold  the  preferred  shares  or  ADSs  for  more  than  60  days  during  the  121-day  period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date (or, if the dividend is attributable to a period or periods aggregating over 366 days, provided that you hold the preferred shares or ADSs for more than 90 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date) and meet other holding period requirements. Dividends we pay with respect to the ADSs generally will be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. The Bank believes that its ADSs, which are listed on the NYSE, are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States; however, there can be no assurance that the Bank's ADSs will continue to be readily tradable on an established securities market. Because the preferred shares are not listed on any United States securities market, it is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to the preferred shares will also be qualified dividend income. If dividends we pay with respect  to  the  Bank's  preferred  shares  are  not  qualified  dividend  income,  then  the  U.S.  dollar  amount  of  such  dividends  received  by  a  U.S.  holder (including dividends received by a non-corporate U.S. holder) will be subject to taxation at ordinary income tax rates.\n\nYou must include any Colombian tax withheld from the dividend payment in this gross amount even though you do not in fact receive it.

The  dividend  will  not  be  eligible  for  the  dividends-received  deduction  generally  allowed  to United States corporations in respect of dividends received from other United States corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income as a U.S. holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the Colombian Peso payments made, determined at the spot Colombian Peso / U.S. dollar rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the dividend is distributed to the date you convert the payment into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or  loss  generally  will  be  income  or  loss  from  sources  within  the  United  States  for  foreign  tax  credit  limitation  purposes.  Distributions  in  excess  of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in the preferred shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not expect to calculate earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to generally treat distributions with respect to preferred shares or ADSs as dividends.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the Colombian tax withheld and paid over to Colombia will be creditable or deductible against your United States federal income tax liability. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to preferential rates. To the extent a refund of the tax withheld is available to you under Colombian law, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against your United States federal income tax liability. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances.\n\nFor foreign tax credit purposes, dividends will generally be income from sources outside the United States and will generally be 'passive' income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you.\n\nThe rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.\n\n## Taxation of Capital Gains\n\nIf you are a U.S. holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your preferred shares or ADSs, you will recognize capital gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount that you realize and your tax basis, determined in U.S. dollars, in your preferred shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the property is held for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\n## PFIC Rules\n\nWe believe that preferred shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes, and we do not expect to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. In addition, our current position that we do not expect to be a PFIC is based on our position that we qualify for a special rule that treats income recognized by a bank in the active conduct of a banking business as active income for PFIC purposes (the 'active bank exception'). It is possible, however, that we may not satisfy the requirements of the active bank exception in the current or a future taxable year, or that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service may issue guidance in the future under which we would not satisfy the requirements of the active bank exception. In such a case, our interest income would be treated as passive income for PFIC purposes and we would therefore be treated as a PFIC. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become a PFIC in the current taxable year or in a future taxable year.\n\nIt is therefore possible that we could become a PFIC in a future taxable year. If we were to be treated as a PFIC, unless you elect to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to your preferred shares or ADSs, the following rules would apply. With certain exceptions, your preferred shares or ADSs would be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during your holding period in your preferred shares or ADSs.",

Any gain recognized would not be treated as capital gain.\n\nIf you own preferred shares or ADSs in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, you may make a mark-to-market election. If you make this election, you will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above. Instead, in general, you will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of your preferred shares or ADSs at the end of the taxable year over your adjusted basis in your preferred shares or ADSs. These amounts of ordinary income will not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital gains. You will also be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of your preferred shares or ADSs over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). Your basis in the preferred shares or ADSs will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts.\n\nIn  addition,  notwithstanding  any  election  you  make  with  regard  to  the  preferred  shares  or  ADSs,  dividends  that  you  receive  from  us  would  not  be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income if we are treated as a PFIC with respect to you either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead would be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.\n\n## Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets\n\nOwners of 'specified foreign financial assets' with an aggregate value in excess of USD 50,000 (and in some circumstances, a higher threshold) may be required  to  file  an  information  report  with  respect  to  such  assets  with  their  tax  returns.  'Specified  foreign  financial  assets'  include  any  financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are held for investment and not held in accounts maintained  by  financial  institutions:  (i)  stocks  and  securities  issued  by  non-United  States  persons  (including  the  preferred  shares  and  ADSs),  (ii) financial instruments and contracts that have non-United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign entities. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of this reporting requirement to their ownership of the preferred shares or ADSs.\n\n## FATCA Withholding\n\nUnder  FATCA,  a  30%  withholding  tax  will  be  imposed  on  certain  payments  to  certain  non-U.S.  financial  institutions  that  fail  to  comply  with information reporting requirements or certification requirements in respect of their direct and indirect United States shareholders and/or United States accountholders.  To  avoid  becoming  subject  to  the  30%  withholding  tax  on  payments  to  them,  we  and  other  non-U.S.  financial  institutions  may  be required  to  report  information  to  the  IRS  regarding  the  holders  of  preferred  shares  or  ADSs  and  to  withhold  on  a  portion  of  payments  under  the preferred shares or ADSs to certain holders that fail to comply with the relevant information reporting requirements (or hold preferred shares or ADSs directly or indirectly through certain non-compliant intermediaries). However, under proposed Treasury regulations, such withholding will not apply to payments made before the date that is two years after the date on which 133 final regulations defining the term 'foreign passthru payment' are enacted. The rules for the implementation of this legislation have not yet been fully finalized, so it is impossible to determine at this time what impact, if any, this legislation will have on holders of the preferred shares and ADSs.\n\nFATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, the intergovernmental agreement between the United States and Colombia and official guidance, which are subject to change, and the provisions described above may be implemented in a materially different form. Holders of preferred shares or ADSs should consult their own tax advisors regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in the preferred shares or ADSs.",

SUBSIDIARY INFORMATION\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM 11        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe following section describes the market risks to which Bancolombia is exposed and the tools and methodology used to measure these risks as of December 31, 2022. Bancolombia faces market risk as a consequence of its lending, trading and investments businesses. Market risk represents the potential loss due to adverse changes in market prices of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and other risk factors, such as sovereign risk.\n\nBancolombia's risk management strategy, called the Integrated Risk Management Strategy, is based on principles set by international bodies and by Colombian  regulations,  and  is  guided  by  Bancolombia's  corporate  strategy.  The  main  objective  of  the  Integrated  Risk  Management  Strategy  is  to identify  measure,  coordinate,  monitor,  report  and  propose  policies  for  market  and  liquidity  risks  of  the  Bank,  which  in  turn  serve  to  facilitate  the efficient administration of Bancolombia's assets and liabilities. Bancolombia's board of directors and senior management have formalized the policies, procedures, strategies and rules of action for market risk administration in its 'Market Risk Manual'. This manual defines the roles and responsibilities within each subdivision of the Bank and their interaction to ensure adequate market risk administration.\n\nThe  Bank's  Market  Risks  Management  Office  is  responsible  for:  (a)  identifying,  measuring,  monitoring,  analyzing  and  controlling  the  market  risk inherent  in  the  Bank's  businesses,  (b)  analyzing  the  Bank's  exposure  under  stress  scenarios  and  confirming  compliance  with  Bancolombia's  risk management policies, (c) analyzing the methodologies design by the official price vendor for valuation of the market value securities and financial instruments, (d) reporting to senior management and the board of directors any violation of Bancolombia's risk management policies, (e) reporting to the senior management on a daily basis the levels of market risk associated with the trading instruments recorded in its treasury book (the 'Treasury Book'), and (f) proposing policies to the board of directors and to senior management that ensure the maintenance of predetermined risk levels. The Bank  has  also  implemented  an  approval  process  for  new  products  across  each  of  its  subdivisions.  This  process  is  designed  to  ensure  that  every subdivision is prepared to incorporate the new product into their procedures, that every risk is considered before the product is incorporated and that approval is obtained from the board of directors before the new product can be sold.\n\nThe Bank's assets include both trading and non-trading instruments. Trading instruments are recorded in the Treasury Book and include fixed income securities, foreign exchange (FX) and bond futures, and over-the-counter plain vanilla and exotic derivatives. Trading in derivatives includes forward contracts on foreign currency operations, forward contracts on fixed income securities, plain vanilla options on foreign currency, Asian options on U.S. dollar/COP, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Non-trading instruments are recorded in the Bank's banking book (the 'Banking Book'), which includes primarily loans, time deposits, checking accounts and savings accounts.",

The board of directors is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR based on its assessment of the appropriate level of risk for Bancolombia. The Propietary Trading Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR by type of investment. These limits are supervised daily by the Market Risk Management Office.\n\nThe  Bank  is  exposed  to  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  risk  as  a  result  of  mismatches  between  assets  and  liabilities  and  off-balance  sheet  items denominated in different currencies, either as a result of trading or in the normal course of business. Our principal foreign currency exposure is the U.S. dollar, which is managed by Treasury Division and monitored by measuring positions, VaR and daily results.\n\nFor managing the interest rate risk from banking activities, the Bank analyzes the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities, and the impact of interest rate shocks on the change of economic value of equity and net interest income. In addition, the foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the Banking Book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## Trading Instruments Market Risk Measurement\n\nThe  Bank  currently  measures  the  Treasury  Book  exposure  to  market  risk  (including  over-the-counter  derivatives  positions)  as  well  as  the  foreign exchange rate risk exposure of the Banking Book, which is provided to the Treasury Division, using a VaR methodology established in accordance with 'Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular', issued by the SFC.\n\nThe VaR methodology established by 'Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular' is based on the model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee of 2005, which focuses on the Treasury Book and excludes investments measured under amortized cost which are not being given as collateral and any other investment that comprises the Banking Book, such as non-trading positions excluding the foreign exchange rate risk position stemming from investment in affiliated but not consolidated entities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the methodology aggregates all risks by the use of correlations, through an allocation system based on defined zones and bands, affected by given sensitivity factors.\n\nThe total  market  risk  for  the  Bank  is  calculated  by  the  arithmetical  aggregation  of  the  VaR  calculated  for  each  subsidiary.  The  aggregated  VaR  is reflected in the Bank's Capital Adequacy (Solvency) ratio, in accordance with Decree 2555 of 2010.\n\nFor purposes of VaR calculations, a risk exposure category is any market variable that is able to cause potential changes in the portfolio value. Taking into account a given risk exposure, the VaR model assesses the maximum loss not exceeded at a specified confidence level over a given period of time. The fluctuations in the portfolio's VaR depend on volatility, modified duration and positions changes relating to the different instruments that are subject to market risk.\n\nThe relevant risk exposure categories for which VaR is computed by Bancolombia according to the 'Chapter XXI, appendix 1 of the Basic Accounting Circular' are: (i) interest rate risks relating to local currency, foreign currency and UVR; (ii) foreign exchange rate risk; (iii) stock price risk; (iv) fund risk and (v) credit default swaps.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk (Treasury Book)\n\nThe interest rate risk is the probability of decrease in the market value of the position due to fluctuations in market interest rates. Bancolombia calculates the interest rate risk for positions in local currency, foreign currency and UVR separately, in accordance with Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular issued by the Superintendency of Finance. The calculation of the interest rate risk begins with determining the net position in each instrument and estimating its sensitivity, which is calculated by multiplying its net present value ('NPV') by its 'modified duration' and by the interest rate's estimated fluctuation (as defined by the SFC.). The interest rate's fluctuations are established by the SFC according to historical market performance, as shown in the following table:\n\nFigure 1. Interest Risk - Sensitivity by Bands and Zones",

A net sensitivity is then calculated for each band, by determining the difference between the sum of all long-positions and the sum of all short-positions. Then a net position is calculated for each zone (which consists of a series of bands) determined by the Superintendency of Finance. The final step is to make adjustments within each band, across bands and within each zone, which results in a final number that is the interest rate risk VaR by currency. Each adjustment is performed following the guidelines established by the Superintendency of Finance.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to interest risk primarily arises from investments in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES) and other securities issued by the Colombian government.\n\nThe interest rate risk VaR decreased from COP 404 billion on December 31, 2021 to COP 340 billion on December 31, 2022, due to the reduction in the position in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES) and United States government's treasury bonds. During the year 2022, the average interest rate risk VaR was COP 381 billion, the maximum value COP 411 billion, and the minimum value COP 340 billion.\n\n## Currency (Treasury and Banking Book), Equity (Treasury Book) and Fund Risk (Treasury Book)\n\nThe VaR model uses a sensitivity factor to calculate the probability of loss due to fluctuations in the price of stocks, funds and currencies in which the Bank maintains a position. As previously indicated, the methodology used in this Annual Report to measure such risk consists of computing VaR, which is derived by multiplying the position by the maximum probable variation in the price of such positions (' glyph<c=0,font=/DejaVuSans> p'). The glyph<c=0,font=/DejaVuSans> p is determined by the Superintendency of Finance, as shown in the following table:\n\nFigure 2. Sensitivity Factor for foreign exchange rate Risks, Equity Risks and Fund Risks\n\n| Currency             | Sensitivity Factor   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|\n| USD                  | 12.49 %              |\n| Euro                 | 11.00 %              |\n| Other currencies     | 13.02 %              |\n| Equity and Fund Risk | 14.70 %              |\n\nThe foreign exchange rate risk VaR decreased from COP 88 billion as of December 31, 2021 to COP 78 billion as of December 31, 2022 due to the decrease in the position in United States Dollars in Bancolombia' s portfolio. Between December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, the average foreign exchange rate risk VaR was COP 119 billion, the",

Current foreign exchange rate risk primary arises from the USD exposure of Bancolombia in foreign exchange derivatives.\n\nThe equity risk VaR decreased from COP 100 billion as of December 31, 2021 to COP 85 billion as of December 31, 2022 mainly due to the decrease in the  brokerage  firm's  trading  position,  and  a  reduction  of  the  market  value  of  the  assets.  Between  December  31,  2021  and  December  31,  2022,  the average equity VaR was COP 98 billion, the maximum value COP 105 billion, and the minimum value COP 85 billion.\n\nThe fund risk, which arises from investment in mutual funds, increased from COP 225 billion as of December 31, 2021 to COP 388 billion as of December 31, 2022 mainly due to the increased exposure of the Fund Colombia Inmobiliario. Between December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, the average fund risk VaR was COP 294 billion, the maximum value COP 388 billion, and the minimum value COP 225 billion.\n\n## Total Market Risk VaR\n\nThe total market risk VaR is calculated as the algebraic sum of the interest rate risk, the foreign exchange rate risk, the stock price risk, fund risk and the credit  default  swaps risk which are calculated as the algebraic sum of Bancolombia and each of its subsidiaries' exposure to these risks. Currently, Bancolombia does not present exposure to credit default swaps risk.\n\nThe total market risk VaR, increased 9.1%, going from COP 817 billion in December 31, 2021 to COP 892 billion as of December 31, 2022, and due mainly to increase in the fund risk mentioned above.\n\n## Assumptions and Limitations of VaR Models:\n\nAlthough VaR models represent a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as predictive of future results. The Bank may incur in losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by the Bank's VaR models. A VaR model does not calculate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the reasonable judgment of the Bank's risk management personnel.\n\nThe chart below provides information about Bancolombia's consolidated VaR for trading instruments at the end of December 2021 and December 2022.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                | 2022                 | 2021                 |\n|                                | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Interest Rate Risk VaR         | 340,107              | 403,556              |\n| Foreign Exchange Rate Risk VaR | 78,165               | 88,477               |\n| Equity Risk VaR                | 85,345               | 99,895               |\n| Fund Risk VaR                  | 387,952              | 225,373              |\n| Total VaR                      | 891,569              | 817,302              |\n\nBetween December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, the average Total VaR was COP 893 billion, the maximum value COP 1,059 billion, and the minimum value COP 783 billion.\n\n## Non-Trading Instruments Market Risk Measurement\n\nThe Banking Book's relevant risk exposure is interest rate risk, which is the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income as a result of a change in market interest rates.

A negative sensitivity denotes a higher sensitivity of liabilities than of assets and implies that a rise in interest rates will negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. In the event of a decrease in interest rates, the impacts on net interest income would be opposite to those described above.\n\n## Total Exposure\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the net interest income sensitivity in local currency for the banking book instruments, entered for other than trading purposes with positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points was COP 515 billion. The change in the net interest income sensitivity between 2022 and 2021 is due to the increase in the sensitivity of float loans.\n\nOn the other hand, the net interest income sensitivity in foreign currency, assuming the same parallel shift of 100 basis points, was USD 13 million at December 31, 2022, compared with USD 22 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in net interest income sensitivity was due to the increase of the liabilities sensitivity due to the rise of loans with other banks.",

As a result, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Bank files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the  SEC  and  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  such information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  management,  including  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  to  allow  timely decisions regarding disclosure.\n\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  The  Bank's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe Bank's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u25cf Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank;\n- \u25cf Provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Bank's management and directors; and\n- \u25cf Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Bank's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework version). On this assessment, management concluded that the Bank's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.",

AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT\n\nThe board of directors of Bancolombia appointed Silvina Vatnick as the audit committee financial expert in accordance with SEC rules and regulations.\n\nThe Bank's audit committee financial expert, along with the other members of the Bank's Audit Committee, is considered to be independent according to applicable NYSE criteria.\n\nMrs. Vatnick has served as the Bank's audit committee financial expert since May 2021,in replacement of Mrs. Sylvia Escovar. There is no business relationship between her and the Bank, except for standard personal banking services. Further, there is no fee arrangement between Mrs. Vatnick and the Bank, except in connection with hers capacity as a member of the Bank's board of directors and as a member of the Audit Committee.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nBancolombia, as a listed company that qualifies as a foreign private issuer under the NYSE listing standards in accordance with the NYSE corporate governance  rules,  is  permitted  to  follow  home-country  practice  in  some  circumstances  in  lieu  of  the  provisions  of  the  corporate  governance  rules contained  in  Section  303A  of  the  NYSE  Listed  Company  Manual  that  are  applicable  to  U.S.  companies.  The  Bank  follows  corporate  governance practices  applicable  to  Colombian  companies  and  those  described  in  the  Bank's  Corporate  Governance  Code,  which  in  turn  follows  Colombian corporate governance  rules. An  English  translation of the Corporate Governance  Code  is  available  at  Bancolombia's  website  at www.grupobancolombia.com. The Spanish prevails for all legal purposes.\n\nIn Colombia, a series of laws and regulations set forth corporate governance requirements. External Circular 029 of 2014, issued by the SFC, contains the corporate governance standards to be followed by companies issuing securities.\n\nAdditionally,  Law 964 of 2005 established mandatory corporate governance requirements for all issuers whose securities are publicly traded in the Colombian market, and Decree 2555 of 2010, the External Circulars 031 of 2021 and 012 of 2022 regulate the information disclosure requirements, including relevant and periodical information for the Colombian securities issuers. Bancolombia's corporate governance standards comply with these legal requirements and Bancolombia",

Under NYSE corporate governance rules, a majority of a U.S. company's board of directors must be composed of independent directors. Regarding Colombian legislation, Law 964 of 2005 requires that at least 25% of the members of the Bank's board of directors are independent directors, and Decree 3923 of 2006 regulates their election. Additionally, Colombian law requires that all directors exercise independent judgment under all circumstances. Bancolombia's Corporate Governance Code includes a provision stating that directors shall exercise independent judgment, and requires that at least 5 of the 7 directors must be independent. The Corporate Governance Code also includes additional independence standards that must be met by 5 of 7 directors. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank's board of directors included a majority of independent members (5 members of 7). For the independence test applicable to directors of Bancolombia, see Item 10. 'Additional Information. - B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Board of Directors'.\n- \u25cf Non-Executive Director Meetings. Pursuant to the NYSE listing standards, non-executive directors of U.S. listed companies must meet on a regular basis without management present. There is no prohibition under Colombian regulations for officers to be members of the board of directors; however, it is customary for Colombian companies to maintain separation between the directors and management. Bancolombia's board  of  directors  does  not  include  any  management  members;  however,  the  CEO  attends  the  monthly  meetings  of  the  Bank's  board  of directors, and members of senior management may attend the meetings of the board of directors and committees to guarantee an adequate flow of information between employees, management and directors; in both cases, the CEO and members of senior management are not allowed to vote. In accordance with Law 964 of 2005 and the Bank's by-laws, no executive officer can be elected as chairman of the Bank's board of directors.\n- \u25cf Committees of the Board of Directors. Under NYSE listing standards, all U.S. companies listed on the NYSE must have an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating/corporate governance committee and all members of such committees must be independent. In each case, the independence of directors must be established pursuant to highly detailed rules enacted by the NYSE and, in the case of the audit committee, the NYSE and the SEC. The Bank's board of directors has a Designation, Compensation and Development Committee, a Corporate Governance Committee, a Risk Committee and an Audit Committee, each of which is composed exclusively of directors (Audit Committee and Corporate Governance Committee are composed exclusively of independent directors, whereas the other committees have both independent  and  non-independent  directors).  For  a  description  of  the  Designation,  Compensation  and  Development  Committee,  Corporate Governance  Committee,  Audit  Committee  and  Risk  Committee,  see  Item  6.  'Directors,  Senior  Management  and  Employees  -  C.  Board Practices'.\n- \u25cf Stockholders'  Approval  of  Dividends. While  NYSE  corporate  governance  standards  do  not  require  listed  companies  to  have  stockholders approve  or  declare  dividends,  in  accordance  with  the  Colombian  Code  of  Commerce,  all  dividends  must  be  approved  by  Bancolombia's stockholders.\n\n## H.

A.\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Bancolombia S. A. and its subsidiaries (the 'Bank') as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of income, other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). We also have audited the Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for  each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Bank maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Bank's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and on the Bank's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Bank in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Allowance for loans, advances and lease losses\n\nAs described in Notes 2 (section D.7.4.5, E.1 and E.10), 6 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on evaluations of the loan portfolio utilizing objective and subjective criteria. As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan losses was COP$15,479,640 million on total loans of COP$269,923,739 million. As disclosed by management, Expected Credit Losses (ECL) are calculated using individual and collective models and methodologies based on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current borrower situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios. In addition, for loans individually assessed in Stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, information on the credit behavior, and the future cash flows expected from the client.\n\nPwC Contadores y Auditores S.A.S., Calle 7 Sur No. 42-70, Torre 2, Piso 11, Edificio Forum, Medell\u00edn, Colombia.\n\nTel: (60-4) 6040606, www.pwc.com/co\n\n\u00a9 2023 PricewaterhouseCoopers.

In addition, for loans individually assessed in Stage 3 analysis of the debt profile of each debtor, information on the credit behavior and the future cash flows expected from the client, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to these assumptions, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming the overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Bank's allowance for loans, advances and leasing losses estimation process, which included controls over the data, models and assumptions used in the estimation process. These procedures also included, among others: testing management's process for estimating the allowance for loan, advances and lease losses by (i) evaluating the appropriateness of  the models utilized for the estimation of the expected loss parameters and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions, such as default at 12 months and lifetime, loss given default and exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios, and evaluating the adjustments, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the estimate and the mathematical accuracy of the impairment calculation for the credit portfolios; and (iii) evaluating individual credit files to determine the reasonableness of management's estimation of the future cash flows expected from the client, estimated by management in the impairment for the credit portfolios. The procedures included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the models utilized by management, methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the credit loss estimates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessment\n\nAs described in Notes 2 (sections D.13, E.2 and E.10) and 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank's consolidated goodwill balance was COP$9,836,661 million as of December 31, 2022. The Bank tests goodwill recognized upon business combinations for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the cash generating units may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined by management by reference to market value, if available, by pricing models, or with the assistance of a valuation specialist. Determination of recoverable amount requires management to make assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flows for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment of the appropriate discount rate and growth rate, estimation of the recoverable amount of cash generation units and the valuation of the separable assets of each business whose goodwill is being reviewed.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of all reporting units is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the recoverable amount measurement of the cash generating units. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management's cash flow projections and significant assumptions, related to discount rate and growth rate, and other assumptions commonly used to determine the recoverable value of the goodwill. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\n\nPwC Contadores y Auditores S.A.S., Calle 7 Sur No. 42-70, Torre 2, Piso 11, Edificio Forum, Medell\u00edn, Colombia.\n\nTel: (60-4) 6040606, www.pwc.com/co\n\n\u00a9 2023 PricewaterhouseCoopers.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## A. Basis for preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Bank are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (hereinafter, IFRS) issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (hereinafter,  IASB),  as  well  as  the  interpretations  issued  by  the  International  Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (hereinafter, IFRS-IC).\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. Therefore, the estimates and assumptions are constantly reviewed. Any revision is recognized in the same period if it affects the reviewed period; or in the reviewed period and future periods if it affects all the current and future periods.\n\n## Preparation of the consolidated financial statements under going concern basis\n\nManagement has assessed the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern and confirms that the Bank has adequate liquidity and solvency to continue operating the business for the foreseeable future, which is at least, but is not limited to, 12 months from the end of the reporting period. Based on the Bank's liquidity position at the date of authorization of the consolidated financial statements, Management maintains a reasonable expectation that it has adequate liquidity and",

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise those classified as assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, debt instruments and equity securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('OCI') and derivative instruments. Likewise, the carrying value of assets and liabilities recognized as a fair value hedge are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Almost all investments in associates and joint ventures are measured using the equity method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are stated in Colombian pesos ('COP') and figures are stated in millions or billions (when indicated), except earnings  per  share,  diluted  earnings  per  share  and  the  market  exchange  rate,  which  are  stated  in  units  of  Colombian  pesos,  while  other  currencies (dollars, euro, pounds, etc.) are stated in thousands.\n\nThe  Parent  Company's  financial  statements,  which  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  'Normas  de  Contabilidad  e  Informaci\u00f3n  Financiera' ('NCIF') applicable to separate financial statements, are those that serve as the basis for the distribution of dividends and other appropriations by the shareholders.\n\nThe separate financial statements are those presented by the Parent Company in which the entity recognizes and measures the impairment of credit risk through allowances for loans losses, the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments (such as debt securities and equity instruments) and  the  recognition  of  provisions  for  foreclosed  assets,  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  required  by  the  SFC,  which  differ  in  certain  accounting principles from IFRS that are used in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## B. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Bank presents the consolidated statement of financial position ordered by liquidity and the consolidated statement of income is prepared based on the nature of expenses. Revenues and expenses are not offset unless such treatment is permitted or required by an accounting standard or interpretation and described in the Bank's policies.\n\nThe consolidated statement of comprehensive income presents net income and items of OCI classified by nature and grouped into those that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and those that will be reclassified when specific conditions are met. The Bank discloses the amount of income tax relating to each item of OCI.\n\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows was prepared using the indirect method, whereby net income is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, changes during the period in operating assets and liabilities, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows.\n\n## C. Consolidation\n\n## 1. Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Bancolombia S.A. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Parent Company consolidates the financial results of the entities over which it exerts control.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements, a subsidiary is an entity controlled by any of the entities that comprise the Bank, as long as the controlling entity has:",

Reporting entity.\n- (20) On July 22, 2022, the Parent Company, through its subsidiary Sistemas de Inversiones y Negocios S.A. SINESA, incorporated this vehicle whose purpose is to provide technology services. For further information, see Note 1. Reporting entity.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the accounting principles in the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Bank's accounting policies, in order to prepare consolidated financial statements using uniform accounting policies.\n\nAll intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Bank are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling interests in controlled entities are presented in profit or loss and equity separately from the Parent Company's shareholders equity and profit or loss. When the Bank loses control over a subsidiary, any residual interest remaining on the Bank's balances is measured at fair value; gains or losses arising from this measurement are recognized in net income.\n\nThe loan and financial leases originated by Banistmo and Bancolombia Panama are subject to prudential regulation in Panama by the Superintendencia de Bancos de Panam\u00e1 ('SBP') requiring the maintenance of minimum reserves as a countercyclical capital buffer. In the second quarter of 2020, this regulation was suspended, through the General Resolution of the Board of Directors SBP-GJD-0007-2020, to provide financial relief to the banks. For the years ended as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the reserves recognized amounted to COP 1,036,919 and COP 1,428,964. The establishment of these reserves restrict the ability of the aforementioned subsidiaries to pay dividends to Bancolombia S.A., the ultimate parent, except in the event of liquidation.\n\n## 2. Transactions between entities under common control\n\nCombinations of entities under common control, i.e., transactions in which all the combining entities are under the control of the Bank both before and after  the  combination,  and  that  control  is  not  transitory,  are  outside  the  scope  of  the  IFRS  3  Business  combinations.  Currently,  there  is  no  specific guidance for these transactions under IFRS, therefore, as permitted by IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the Bank has developed an accounting policy considering the pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies. The assets and liabilities recognized as a result of transactions between entities under common control are recognized at the carrying value of the acquirer's financial statements. The Bank presents the net assets received prospectively from the date of the transfer.\n\n## 3. Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nA joint venture is an entity that the Bank controls jointly with other participants, where the parties maintain a contractual agreement that establishes joint control over the relevant activities of the entity (which only exists when decisions about those activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control) and the parties have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the excess of the acquisition cost of the associate or joint venture shares exceeding the Bank's share of the net fair value of identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  investee  is  recognized  as  goodwill  and  is  included  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  and  it  is  not amortized.  When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment  of  assets.  Impairment  losses  are  recognized  in  net  income  and  are  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  recoverable  amount  of  the associate or joint venture, using the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal, and its carrying value.\n\nThe results and assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in",

When an investment in an associate or joint venture is held by, or is held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organization, or a mutual fund, unit trust or similar entities, and such investment is measured at fair value through profit or loss in that entity, the Bank may elect to measure investments in those associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. This election is applied on an investment-by-investment basis.\n\nUnder the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Bank's share of the profits or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or join venture after the date of acquisition, less any impairment loss on the investment. When the Bank's share of losses of an associate or joint venture exceeds the Bank's interest in that associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance,  form  part  of  the  Bank's  net  investment  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture),  the  Bank  discontinues  recognizing  its  share  of  further  losses. Additional losses are recognized only to the extent that the Bank has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nWhen the equity method is applicable, adjustments are considered in order to adopt uniform accounting policies of the associate or joint venture with the Bank. The portion that corresponds to the  Bank  for  changes  in  the  investee's  other  comprehensive  income  items  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated statement of comprehensive income as 'Unrealized gain/(loss) on investments in associates and joint ventures using equity method' and gains or losses of  the  associate  or  joint  venture  are  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  as  'Dividends  and  net  income  on  equity  investments',  in accordance with the Bank's participation. Gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Bank and its associate or joint venture are recognized in the Bank's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the unrelated investor's interest in the associate or joint venture. The equity method is applied from the acquisition date until the significant influence or joint control over the entity is lost.\n\nThe unrealized gain or loss of an associate or joint venture is presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, net of tax. Changes in the investment's participation that arise from changes in other comprehensive income of an associate or joint venture are recognized directly in the investor's statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe dividends received from the associate or joint venture reduce the investment carrying value.\n\nWhen the significant influence on the associate or the joint venture is lost, the Bank measures and recognizes any residual investment that remains at its fair value. The difference between the associate or joint venture carrying value (taking into account the relevant items of other comprehensive income), the fair value of the retained residual investment and any proceeds from disposing of a partial interest in the associate or joint venture, is recognized in the  consolidated  statement  of  income.  The  currency  translation  adjustments  recognized  in  equity  are  reclassified  to  net  income  at  the  moment  of disposal.\n\nFor further information, please see Note 8. Investments in associates and joint ventures.\n\n## 4. Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\nThe  Bank  recognizes  and  measures  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  in  relation  to  its  interest  in  joint  operations  in  accordance  with  the applicable IFRS for the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\n\nIf the Bank acquires an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in IFRS 3, or when an existing business is contributed to the joint operation on its formation by one of the parties that participate in the joint operation, the Bank will apply all of the principles of IFRS 3. In this case, the Bank recognizes goodwill in the event that consideration transferred exceeds the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.",

Non-controlling interest\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately within the Bank's equity. Similarly, net income and other comprehensive income are also attributed to non-controlling interest and equity holders of the Parent Company. The amount of non-controlling interest may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquirer's identifiable net assets. The option for recognition is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\n\nAny purchase or sale of shares in subsidiaries that does not imply a loss or gain of control is directly recognized in equity.",

The principal place of business of FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia is Bogot\u00e1 (Colombia).\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, returns were delivered to the non-controlling interest in quarterly installments due to the nature of its business, which mainly comprises a long- term investment in real estate which is considered a low-risk portfolio. The return delivered amounted to COP 41,219 and COP 64,717, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe following table summarizes the assets, liabilities, net assets, net income and cash flows as of December 31 2022 and 2021, and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, related to the FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2021 In millions of COP   |                    |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Assets                                         | 5,023,316                 | 4,415,509                                    |                    |\n| Liabilities                                    | 1,729,798                 | 1,509,275                                    |                    |\n| Net assets                                     | 3,293,518                 | 2,906,234                                    |                    |\n|                                                | Year-Ended 2022           | Year-Ended 2021                              | Year-Ended 2020    |\n|                                                | In millions of COP        | In millions of COP                           | In millions of COP |\n| Condensed statement of income                  |                           |                                              |                    |\n| Income                                         |                           |                                              |                    |\n| Valuation of investment properties             | 229,512                   | 85,148                                       | (8,251)            |\n| Valuation of trust rights                      | -                         | -                                            | 4                  |\n| Rents                                          | 181,454                   | 187,194                                      | 186,528            |\n| Profits of equity method investees             | 188,148                   | 105,439                                      | 56,116             |\n| Other income                                   | 75,543                    | 92,298                                       | 38,135             |\n| Total Income                                   | 674,657                   | 470,079                                      | 272,532            |\n| Expenses                                       |                           |                                              |                    |\n| Interest on loans                              | (151,470)                 | (73,201)                                     | (78,008)           |\n| Other administrative and general expenses      | (157,851)                 | (212,385)                                    | (141,430)          |\n| Total Expenses                                 | (309,321)                 | (285,586)                                    | (219,438)          |\n| Net Income                                     | 365,336                   | 184,493                                      | 53,094             |\n| Condensed cash flow  (1)                       |                           |                                              |                    |\n| Net cash used in operating activities          | (350,456)                 | (34,442)                                     | (172,003)          |\n| Net cash provided by financing activities      | 307,754                   | 21,882                                       | 235,214            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year | 50,808                    | 63,368                                       | 157                |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at end of year       | 8,106                     | 50,808                                       | 63,368             |\n\nThe information above represents the amounts before inter-company eliminations.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  2021  and  2020,  the  accumulated  non-controlling  interest  of  the  FCP  Fondo  Inmobiliario  Colombia  amounted  to  COP 605,611, COP 1,369,084 and COP 1,340,317, respectively and the profit allocated to non-controlling interest amounted to COP 71,354, COP 92,353 and COP 26,599, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## D. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe significant accounting policies that the Bank uses in preparing its consolidated financial statements are detailed below:\n\n## 1. Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Bank's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Colombian pesos, which is the functional currency for the Parent Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. All transactions and balances in other currency than pesos are considered as foreign currency.\n\n## 2. Transactions and balances in foreign currency\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are generally recognized in net income. They are deferred in equity (other comprehensive income) if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured at cost are held at the exchange rate at the transaction date, while those which are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in net income, any exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognized in net income.\n\n## 3. Foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the Bank's presentation currency is translated into the presentation currency, as follows:\n\n- \u25cf Assets  and  liabilities  for  each  statement  of  financial  position  presented  are  translated  at  the  closing  rate  at  the  date  of  that  consolidated statement of financial position;\n- \u25cf Income and expenses for each statement of income and statement of comprehensive income is translated at average exchange rates; and\n- \u25cf All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income in translation adjustment reserve.\n\nAs part of the consolidation process, exchange differences arising from debt securities in issue and the portion of other financial securities designated as hedges of foreign operations that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income in 'Translation adjustment' reserve.  When  a  foreign  operation  is  sold  or  any  debt  securities  in  issue  forming  part  of  the  net  investment  are  repaid,  the  associated  exchange differences are reclassified to net income, as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing exchange rate.\n\nThe table below sets forth the exchange rate used by the Bank and its subsidiaries to convert consolidated statement of financial position accounts and transactions in U.S. dollar into Colombian pesos:",

Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Bank considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash and balances at banks and the Central Bank, interbank assets and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending that have original maturities up to 90 days, as shown in Note 4. Cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## 5. Security deposits\n\nSecurity deposits  are  assets  pledged  as  collateral  that  correspond  to  cash  guarantees  made  by  the  Bank  to  other  financial  institutions.  The  carrying amount is increased when a margin call is issued or when it is necessary to increase the trading quota; conversely, it is decreased when the aim is to lower that quota. The security deposits are recognized as other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position at the amount paid in favor of the counterpart and these assets are subject to interest recognition. These assets are included in the consolidated statement of financial position as 'Other assets, net'.\n\n## 6. Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are those transactions where an acquirer obtains control of a business (e.g., an acquisition or merger).\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as follows: a) identifiable acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the acquisition are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition; b) acquisition costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of income  as  expenses  in  the  periods  in  which  the  costs  are  incurred  and  the  services  are  received;  and  c)  goodwill  is  recognized  as  an  asset  in  the consolidated statement of financial position or a gain from a bargain purchase.\n\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the Bank (if any).\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the value of any non-controlled interest and, when applicable, the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity, over the net fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.\n\nFor each business combination, at the date of acquisition, the Bank measures the non-controlling interest by the proportional share of the identifiable assets acquired, as well as liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed by the acquired company, or by their fair value.\n\nAny contingent consideration in a business combination is classified as a liability or as equity and is recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition, the  liability  is  remeasured  at  subsequent  reporting  dates  in  accordance  with  IAS  37  Provisions,  contingent  liabilities  and  contingent  assets,  and  the consideration classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.\n\nThe goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at the date of acquisition, to the Bank's cash-generating units (or group of cash generating units) which are expected to benefit from the combination, regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units or group of units.\n\nFor business combinations achieved in stages, any previous equity interest held by the Bank in the acquiree is remeasured at its fair value at the date of acquisition and any resulting gain (or loss) is reported in the consolidated statement of income or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. Amounts related  to  such  investments  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  that  must  be  recycled  through  net  income  are  reclassified  to  the consolidated statement of income,",

When the associate had other comprehensive income, which was not reclassified to profit or loss, the amounts were reclassified within equity to 'Retained earnings' once the investment was sold.\n\nThe Bank effected the following business combinations during 2021 and 2022:\n\n- \u25cf On  November  30,  2021,  the  Bank  acquired  control  of  WOMPI  S.A.S.  (before  'VLIPCO  S.A.S.'),  a  company  that  provides  technology services.\n- \u25cf On March 1, 2022, the Bank completed the acquisition of the PA FAI Calle 77 Trust.\n\nFor further details of these transactions, see Note 9.3. Business combination.\n\n## 7. Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\n## 7.1. Recognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  when  the  Bank  becomes  party  to  the  contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way purchases and sales, which are those purchases and sales of financial assets that require the delivery  of  assets  within  the  time  frame  established  by  regulation  or  convention  in  the  marketplace.  The  Bank  uses  settlement  date  accounting  for regular way contracts when recording financial asset transactions.\n\n## 7.2. Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are reported on a net basis on the consolidated statement of financial position if and only if (i) there is currently a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and (ii) there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Bank does not offset income and expenses, unless required or permitted by an IFRS.\n\n## 7.3. Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the consolidated statement of financial position date, for recognition or disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nTo determine fair value, characteristics of the asset or liability are taken into account in the same way that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date; the following items are taken into consideration to assess the estimates:\n\n- \u25cf Based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to which the Bank can access at the measurement date (level 1).\n- \u25cf Based on inputs of valuation methodologies commonly used by the market participants, these inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly; considering inputs as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  assets  or  liabilities  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  that  are observable for the assets or liabilities like interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities and credit spreads, and market-corroborated inputs (level 2).\n- \u25cf Based on internal valuation techniques of discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies, where one or more inputs are unobservable and therefore estimated by the Bank for the assets or liabilities, in the absence of observable inputs (level 3).\n\nThe accounting judgments used in determining fair value relate to matters such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. The changes in estimates related to these factors could affect the recognized fair value of the financial instruments.",

Fair value of assets and liabilities, an analysis is provided of the fair values of financial instruments and non-financial assets and liabilities, including further details about the measurement of fair value, hierarchy levels and transfers between levels, if any.\n\n## 7.4. Financial assets\n\nAt initial recognition, the Bank measures financial assets at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets. Financial assets are then classified considering their subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss, fair value through OCI or amortized cost on the basis of the business model for managing the  financial  assets  and  the  contractual  cash  flow  characteristics  of  the  instrument.  In  addition,  for  particular  investments  in  equity  instruments,  in accordance  with  IFRS  9  Financial  instruments,  the  Bank  made  the  irrevocable  election  to  present  subsequent  changes  in  fair  value  in  other comprehensive income.\n\n## 7.4.1 Money market operations\n\n## Interbank assets and interbank deposits\n\nThese are funds that the Bank lends to other financial institutions or borrows from the Central Bank and other financial institutions. The transactions in an asset position with maturity of up to ninety days are classified as cash equivalents, as long as they are not impacted by market fluctuations. The operations in an asset position with maturity greater than ninety days and all the operations in a liability position are measured at amortized cost and presented as 'Other assets, net' or 'Interbank deposits', respectively, in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Repurchase agreements and other similar secured transactions\n\n## \u25cf Asset Position\n\nAsset position refers to transactions accounted for as collateralized lending in which the Bank purchases securities with an agreement to resell them back  to  the  seller  at  a  stated  price  plus  interest  at  a  specified  date,  not  exceeding  one  year.  Repos  in  asset  position  are  initially  recognized  at  the consideration paid and they are subsequently measured at amortized cost. The difference between the purchase value and resale price is recorded in net interest income and accrued over the life of the agreement using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## \u25cf Liability Position\n\nLiability  position  refers  to  transactions  accounted  for  as  collateralized  borrowing  in  which  the  Bank  sells  debt  securities  with  an  agreement  to repurchase them back from the buyer at a stated price plus interest at a specified date, not exceeding one year.\n\nThe securities sold under those agreements are not derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position when the Bank substantially retains  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the  securities.  However,  the  securities  are  disclosed  as  pledged  assets.  The  amounts  received  are  initially recognized, at fair value, as a financial liability and subsequently measured at amortized cost. The difference between the sale value and the repurchase value is treated as interest expense and accrued over the life of the agreement by the effective interest rate method.\n\n## 7.4.2 Debt and equity securities\n\n## Securities at amortized cost\n\nDebt securities are classified at amortized cost only if the asset is maintained within a business model whose objective is to hold it in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the security give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The subsequent measurement of its interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe effective interest method is a method used to calculate the amortized cost of an asset and to assign the income or cost in interest during the relevant period.  The  effective  interest  rate  is  the  discount  rate  at  which  the  present  value  of  future  estimated  cash  payments  or  those  received  through  the expected life of the financial instrument, or, when appropriate, in a shorter time frame, are equal to the net carrying value at the beginning. To calculate the effective interest rate, the Bank estimates cash flows considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument, including transaction costs and premiums granted minus commissions and discounts, but without considering future credit losses.\n\n## Securities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThese  are  equity  securities  and  debt  securities  that  are  not  subsequently  measured  at  amortized  cost  or  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income. The difference between the current fair value and the immediately preceding fair value of the respective security is recorded as a higher or lower value of the asset, affecting the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nInvestments in debt securities are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are maintained under a business model whose objective is achieved by both obtaining the contractual cash flows and selling the instruments and, in addition, the instruments give rise, on specific dates to cash flows that correspond only to payments of capital and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nChanges in fair value of the investment are recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is written off, the accumulated gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the consolidated statement of income. Interest income from these financial assets  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  as  'Interest  and  valuation  on  financial  instruments'  of  the  consolidated  statement  of income, using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## 7.4.3 Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nThe Bank has made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income, subsequent changes in fair value of some equity instruments that are not held for trading. Dividends from this type of instrument are recognized in net income only when the entity's right to receive payment of the dividend is established.\n\n## 7.4.4 Loans and advances to customers and financial institutions, leases and other receivables\n\nThese  are  financial  assets  that  consist  primarily  of  corporate  loans,  personal  loans  (including  mainly  consumer  finance  and  overdrafts),  residential mortgage loans and financial leases. The Bank established that loans, advances to customers and other receivables are held within a business model whose objective is to hold them to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. They are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs and origination fees that are directly attributable to the acquisition. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## 7.4.5 Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 'FVTOCI'\n\n## 7.4.5.1 Allowance for loans, advances and leases\n\nExpected  credit  losses  are  calculated  using  individual  and  collective  models  and  methodologies  based  on  assumptions  and  judgements  considering historical  credit  data,  current  borrower  situation  and  reasonable  and  supportable  forecasts  of  future  economic  conditions.  Collective  models  include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation (when the loan is classified as stage 2), loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the prospective approach that includes assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible",

In addition, for loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, the fair value of guarantees granted, information on the credit behavior and the future cash flows expected from the client.\n\nAt the end of each period, the Bank assesses the impairment model based on the expected loss of a financial asset or a group of them measured at amortized cost, where the impairment loss will be measured from 'day 1' after its initial recognition. The model is structured in three stages in which the financial asset can be categorized, from its initial recognition, considering the degree of credit risk, and the circumstances that have produced a significant increase in it, as described below:\n\n- \u25cf Stage 1: Financial instruments that have not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, or that have low credit risk at the reporting date.\n- \u25cf Stage 2: Financial instruments that have had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (unless they have low credit risk at the reporting date), but that do not have objective evidence of impairment.\n- \u25cf Stage 3: Financial assets that have objective evidence of impairment (OEI) at the reporting date.\n\nFor each of the stages, an expected credit loss (ECL) will be calculated which will include current and future conditions, both of the behavior of the portfolio and of different associated macroeconomic conditions. For stage 1, a 12-month ECL will be calculated which will acknowledge the expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date, while for stage 2 and 3 a Lifetime ECL will be calculated which contains the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument.\n\n## Significant increase in risk\n\nTo establish whether an asset presents a significant increase in risk, since the initial recognition, and is therefore classified as Stage 2, the Bank performs an assessment of quantitative and qualitative factors and reviews, for each portfolio, the rebuttable presumption of more than 30 days of default. The way in which the Bank determines whether the credit risk of financial instruments has increased significantly since the initial recognition is as follows:\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nLifetime  PD  assessment:  The  Bank  has  determined  that  the  most  suitable  quantitative  way  to  establish  the  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  is  by comparing the residual lifetime PD at the initial recognition and the current lifetime PD. To measure this difference, two thresholds are defined:\n\n- \u25cf Absolute  threshold:  Is  the  absolute  difference  between  the  current  lifetime  PD  and  the  value  of  the  residual  lifetime  PD  at  the  initial recognition. This threshold determines the value from which a positive absolute variation identifies an increase in the risk of the instrument.\n- \u25cf Relative  threshold:  It  is  a  percentage  variation  between  the  value  of  the  the  current  lifetime  PD  and  the  residual  lifetime  PD  at  the  initial recognition. This threshold determines the value from which a positive percentage variation identifies an increase in the instrument risk.\n\nIn the event the comparison of PD's results in the surpassing of one threshold but not the other, it is not considered that there is a significant increase in the risk for the instrument.\n\nIf the instrument does not exceed the threshold, other qualitative criteria are assessed, which can identify a significant increase in credit risk even when the obligation is very close to expiration. These criterions are the following:\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\n- \u25cf The assets restructured by risk, where the client is experiencing financial difficulties, are classified in stage 2 and provisioned by lifetime expected credit loss until the instrument is canceled, or cured, or it is transferred to stage 3 because it fulfills the definition of default.\n- \u25cf Customers that cease to be in default (stage 3) remain in stage 2 for a period of 12 months.",

The basis for refuting this presumption is that there is historical evidence that shows that the default occurs at 120 days.\n\n## Measurement of expected credit losses by collective methodology\n\nThe quantification of the expected credit losses collectively is done according to the stage classification, the homogeneous groups defined in each type of portfolio and the client's risk level.\n\nThe segmentation of homogeneous groups is carried out by type of client;  for  individuals  it  is  grouped  by  product  and  for  companies  by  industry segments defined from the sales level of the client.\n\nSimilarly, risk level is assigned based on the type of client. For individuals, the risk is measured using a behavioral scoring model for consumer products and a behavioral scoring for housing products; the function of these models is to rank the clients according to risk and thus have a better follow-up with them. Scoring is based on historical behavior and management variables for each one of the products. In Colombia, Guatemala and Panama, the rating system  for  the  consumer  portfolio  is  assessed  using  random  forest  methodology,  which  are  mathematical  models  that  allow  a  greater  number  of variables related to the client and that have more precise rating consistent with the level of risk. These methodologies have a fundamental role in the evaluation and monitoring of credit risk.\n\nFor companies, the level of risk is measured based on an internal rating model, which uses qualitative and quantitative variables as financial indicators of the client, with ranking on a scale between level 1 and 19.

In  Colombia,  a  random  forest methodology model is used for rating the SME portfolio; these are mathematical models which allow the use of a greater number of variables related to the client such as financial information, internal and external payment behavior, non- financial variables (such as: partners, seniority), sociodemographic and transactional information, imports, exports, among others, and have more precise rating consistent with the level of risk. These methodologies have a fundamental role in the evaluation and monitoring of credit risk.\n\nFor further details, please see 'Risk Management', 'Description of Loans and Financial Leases'.\n\nTo estimate the expected credit losses (ECL) under the collective methodology, the following formula is used:\n\n## ECL = Probability of Default * Loss Given Default * Exposure At Default\n\nThe factors are estimated using statistical models developed from internal historical information of the entity and then adjusted with forward-looking information as described below:\n\n- \u25cf Probability of Default (PD): Estimated probability of occurrence of a default of an instrument. IFRS 9 proposes the specification of this parameter and its application according to the classification of stages 1, 2 and 3.\n- o PD 12 months: The estimated probability of occurrence of a default in the next 12 months of the instrument's life as of the date of analysis. The Bank defines the use of PD 12 months for current portfolio that does not present a significant increase in credit risk or any  impairment  evidence  (portfolio  classified  in  stage  1).  To  estimate  the  probability  of  default  for  12  months,  the  Bank  uses traditional techniques such as logistic regression, modeling the behavior of the portfolio by level of risk for each of the segments.\n- o Lifetime PD: The estimated probability of occurrence of a default over the remaining life of an instrument, being dependent on the conditions of the product and the level of risk. The Bank defines the use of lifetime PD for portfolio with a significant increase in credit risk (portfolio classified in stage 2).\n- The Bank estimates this factor using survival models which propose a statistical analysis to quantify the survival rate of a portfolio for a given period. One of the advantages of the methodology is the inclusion of prepaid models.\n- o PD stage 3: The customers evaluated by the collective methodology in stage 3 have an associated probability of default of 100.00%.\n- \u25cf Loss Given Default (LGD): The severity of Loss Given Default is the percentage of exposure that the entity ultimately expects to lose in the event of a default in a financial instrument. The general formulation for the calculation of the LGD is equal to (1 - Recovery Percentage), where the recovery percentage refers to the sum of the flows received from the transaction discounted at the rate for the client on the date of analysis on the total of the exposure at the time of default, including contractual debt sales and other recovery strategy. For secured products, this is primarily based on collateral type and projected collateral values, the use of appraisals to determine the value of the collateral and time to repossession and recovery costs observed.\n- \u25cf Exposure at Default (EAD): The exposed value of the asset valued at amortized cost (includes the balance of capital, interest and accounts receivable), this is based on the contractual repayments owed by the borrower over a 12 month or lifetime basis.\n\nFor  revolving products and those with available borrowing that is likely to be used in its entirety, the Exposure at Default (EAD) estimate considers the use of the CCF (risk conversion factor), in order to find a relationship corresponding to the used and unused component of the instrument. To estimate the expected credit losses (ECL), a component of probability of becoming loan is included.",

Cash flows are discounted at the effective interest rate or an approximation of it.\n\n## Forward-looking information incorporated in the ECL models\n\nTo incorporate the prospective information to the factors defined for the estimation of the expected loss, the Bank uses methodologies that correlate the historical behavior of the portfolio with certain economic variables. The Bank uses projections based on three macro scenarios (base, pessimistic and optimistic); each scenario has a plausible probability of occurrence to evaluate the best estimate of the expected loss under possible future economic conditions.\n\nTo make the projections, the Corporate Economic Research team has defined a process for the generation of estimates under two perspectives: thematic and analytical.\n\n- \u25cf Thematic Perspective: In the first instance, a series of external variables are defined, which are those whose values are established at a global level and in whose definition the idiosyncratic dynamics of the analyzed country have no incidence. As these are issues whose detailed study is beyond the scope of the Corporate Economic Research team, the Bank uses as reference the estimates made by external analysts.\n- \u25cf Analytical Perspective: This consists in the compilation of the historical information for the most important economic and financial variables of  the  country.  The  information  bases  are  compiled  from  official  sources,  which  mostly  correspond  to  official  authorities,  such  as  the Superintendency or Central Bank of each country. The Bank estimates forecasts based on time series models widely used in econometrics.\n\nAs a result, projections are obtained for the economic variables of interest, which are formulated monthly in a time horizon that includes the current year and five subsequent years. After five years, given the technical difficulties and the high uncertainty, the projection of the economic variables for the total remaining useful life of each instrument corresponds to the value of the last projection.\n\nThe Bank considers that a five year projection horizon continues to be reasonable and that maintaining the fifth-year estimate for subsequent periods is a good approximation. This is based on the natural behavior of any statistical or econometric exercise of variable projection, in which the series tend towards a reversion to the mean or, in this case, to the long-term trend or equilibrium level. Then, in subsequent periods they remain there once the macroeconomic projections reach that steady state and only the materialization of a shock (unpredictable, so it is not possible to project when it will happen) would cause a deviation.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that in a period of 5 years, the macroeconomic variables projection would already be at a level very close to their equilibrium, since  historically  the  maximum  periods  of  consecutive  deviation  above  or  below  the  long-term  trend  (more  or  less  0.25  standard  deviations  of  the variable) of the economic cycle (from the series of annual economic growth in the period 1972-2022) has been precisely a period of 5 years. With the current  projections  as  of  December  31,  2022,  although  the  economic  shock  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  was  of  unprecedented  magnitude,  the subsequent  economic  recovery  has  also  occurred  at  an  unprecedented  speed,  so  the  scenario  that  incorporates  the  figures  for  the  fifth  year  of  the projection proposes records very close to the long-term levels of the variables and allows this assumption to remain valid.\n\n## Economic scenario weightings\n\nTo incorporate not only a perspective, but also to recognize the uncertainty surrounding the short and medium-term economic context that the country will experience, the projection work incorporates three scenarios: base, optimistic and pessimistic.",

simultaneous occurrence of economic and extra-economic shocks. Factors such as the global logistics crisis, escalating geopolitical tensions, China's continued adherence to a zero-covid policy, Russia's invasion in Ukraine, political changes in major Latin American economies, and the \"La Ni\u00f1a\" Phenomenon, were among the atypical and largely unpredictable events that impacted economic forecasts in the year. These elements presented an influence that are not usual in years with more stable international and local contexts from political, social, and financial perspectives.\n\n## Special methodologies applied in stage 3\n\n## Collateral methodology\n\nFor defaulted loans (stage 3), when it is determined that the fundamental source of collection is a mortgage guarantee or a leased asset, the amount of the loss is estimated as the balance owed minus the weighted net present value of the market value of the collateral, estimated through appraisals with an age no longer than one year, minus the costs of obtaining,",

Significant  financial  assets  are considered in default when, based on current or past information and events, it is probable that the entity will not be able to recover all the amounts described in the original contract, including the interest and commissions agreed to in the contract. When a significant financial asset has been identified as being in default, the amount of the loss is measured as the balance due minus the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence.\n\nCustomers classified as individual methodology will be evaluated at least twice a year and, additionally, each time a relevant event occurs that reflects in significant changes in their level of risk and that leads to a change in the scenarios previously analyzed. The relevant events can be:\n\n- \u25cf Significant changes in the value of the guarantee,\n- \u25cf Expected or adverse changes in the business,\n- \u25cf Potentially shocking regulatory changes for the business,\n- \u25cf Changes they make in their commercial and operational dynamics, and\n- \u25cf Significant amount of payments made by the client.\n\nTo establish the future cash flows expected from the client, two approaches are presented, which may be via cash flow generation or via execution of some type of guarantee or liquidation of assets, that is, 'Going Concern' or 'Gone Concern' approach.\n\nApproach via cash flow: This refers to an analysis under the premise of \"Going concern\", that is, it is assumed that the payment of the obligation will be made through the client's cash flow. The expected NPV calculation with a cash flow approach includes:\n\n- \u25cf Financial projections of the client.\n- \u25cf Debt simulator.\n- \u25cf Expected NPV calculation.\n\nApproach via guarantee recovery: This refers to the \"Gone concern\", that is, it is assumed that the payment of the obligation will be given through the execution of guarantees, liquidation of assets, the execution of personal guarantees and adjudication of assets through judicial processes. The calculation of the NPV with guarantee approach includes:\n\n- \u25cf Analysis of the guarantee.\n- \u25cf Future value of the guarantee.\n- \u25cf NPV calculation.\n- \u25cf Recovery times.\n\nFuture cash flows are estimated based on two scenarios (base and alternative) that can be affected by the aforementioned variables.\n\n7.4.5.2 Impairment of investments measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income\n\nAt  the  end  of  each  period,  the  Bank  evaluates  the  impairment  model  based  on  the  expected  loss  of  a  financial  asset  or  a  group  of  assets  that  are measured  at  fair  value  with  changes  in  other  comprehensive  income,  where  the  impairment  loss  will  be  measured  from  \"day  1\"  after  its  initial recognition.",

The loan restructuring is implemented through amendments to the contractual terms, resulting in changes of rates and payment terms. However, at the time of restructuring, the Bank seeks to retain and enhance the collateral available if possible.\n\nIn  a  restructuring,  real  and  personal  property  can  be  received  as  foreclosed  assets  in  partial  or  total  cancellation  of  the  receivables.  The  terms  are reviewed in each negotiation to determine if the client should continue in the portfolio and, if so, the terms to restore the business relationship after a certain time.\n\nRestructuring  due  to  a  customer's  credit  risk  difficulties  is  typically  assessed  as  a  non-substantial  modification  and  therefore  does  not  lead  to derecognition. When a financial asset is restructured, the difference between the original contractual cash flow and the new cash flow of the restructured asset discounted at the original effective interest rate is recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of income as 'Interest income on loan and financial leases', and the costs and fees are deferred and will be amortized by the remaining life of the modified asset.\n\n## Modifications\n\nFor other modifications that do not address credit risk, the Bank assesses whether the modification is substantial, given the fact that the changes in contractual terms differ substantially from the original contract, based on the analysis of qualitative variables (including returns based on profit sharing, guarantees, other collateral, or credit enhancements that significantly affect the credit risk profile associated with the loan, changes in currency and/or debtor) and quantitative assessments in some cases. When the modifications result in a derecognition, the renegotiated contract is a new loan and the impairment is evaluated in accordance with the Bank's risk policy, initially recognizing the loan in stage 1 and evaluating the significant increases in credit risk from the date of modification onwards. Likewise, the costs and fees are written off, which are recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income. New credit-impaired loans purchased or originated are not recognized.\n\nModifications that do not result in derecognition are assessed as non-substantial modifications, and the carrying amount is recalculated as the present value of the modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original interest rate, recognizing the effect of modification in the consolidated statement of income as 'Interest income on loans and financial leases'. Similarly, costs and fees are deferred and will be amortized for the remaining life of the modified asset.\n\n## 7.4.7 Leases\n\n## 7.4.7.1 The Bank as lessee\n\nOn entering a new lease contract, the Bank recognizes a right-of-use asset and a liability. Both the right-of-use asset and the lease liability are measured at  the  present  value  of  the  remaining  lease  payments,  discounted  using  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing  rate.  Additionally,  the  right-of-use  asset includes  1)  the  amount  of  the  initial  measurement  of  the  lease  liability;  2)  lease  payments  made,  or  costs  incurred  by  the  lessee  at  or  before  the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; and 3) costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the contract.\n\nSubsequently, the Bank measures the right-of-use asset at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The Bank measures the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made, and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any new expectation or lease modifications. Each lease payment has been allocated between the liability and interest expenses. The accrued interest on the lease liability for each",

The lease payments related to these exemptions are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## 7.4.7.2 The Bank as lessor\n\nThe lease agreements entered into by the Bank are classified at the initial recognition as financial or operating leases.\n\nThe Bank classifies a lease as a financial lease when according to the agreement substantially all the inherent risks and benefits are transferred to the lessee. Financial leases are recognized as the sum of the minimum payments to be received and any unguaranteed residual value, discounted at the lease interest rate. Otherwise, the lease is classified as an operating lease, which is classified in the consolidated statement of financial position as premises and equipment or investment property. The initial direct costs incurred in the negotiation of an operating lease are added to the carrying value of the leased assets and recorded as a cost during the lease term on the same basis as the lease income. The contingent rents of the leases are recorded as income in the period in which they are obtained.\n\nAmong the risks transferred are the possibilities of losses through underutilization, technological obsolescence, decrease in profitability or changes in the economic environment. Among the benefits derived from the use are the expectation of profit over the economic life of the asset and eventually, the appreciation of the changes of its residual value or realization of the asset.\n\nThe following are indications of transfer of risk and rewards of ownership to the lessee:\n\n- \u25cf The agreement indicates that the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be equal to or less than 10% of the fair value of the asset, upon termination of the lease.\n- \u25cf The term of the lease covers most of the economic life of the asset, even when the lease does not transfer the ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the end of the lease term, i.e., when the minimum lease term represents 75% or more of the economic life of the leased asset.\n- \u25cf At the inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least 90% of the fair value of the leased asset.\n- \u25cf The  leased  assets  are  of  such  a  specialized  nature  that  only  the  lessee  has  the  possibility  of  using  them  without  making  significant modifications.\n\nIf during the lease term, the lessor and the lessee decide to modify the initial conditions, and the agreed changes result in a different classification, then the  modified  agreement  will  be  considered  a  new  lease  with  new  clauses  that  will  lead  to  the  classification  of  a  financial  or  operating  lease,  as appropriate.\n\n## 7.5. Financial liabilities\n\nAt initial recognition, the Bank measures its financial liabilities at fair value. The transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial liability are deducted from its fair value if the instruments are subsequently recognized at amortized cost or will be recognized in the consolidated statement of income if the liabilities are measured at fair value.\n\nDerivative liabilities are measured at fair value through profit and loss and the gains or losses of those liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statement of income for subsequent measurements. Non-derivative financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate. Interest expenses are recognized in the consolidated statement of income unless the financial liability is designated as at fair value through profit or loss, for which it is required to present the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 7.5.1 Compound instruments\n\nCompound financial instruments that are comprised of both a liability and equity component must be separated and accounted for separately. Therefore, for  initial  measurement,  the  liability  component  is  the  fair  value  of  a  similar  liability  which  doesn't  have  an  equity  component  (determined  by discounting future cash flows using the market rate at the date of the issuance). The difference between the fair value of the liability component and the fair value of the compound financial instrument, considered as a whole, is the residual value assigned to the equity component. After initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition. The liability component corresponds to the preferred dividend related to 1% of the subscription price, which is the payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares for each period in accordance with the Bank's bylaws.\n\n## 7.5.2 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nIn  order  to  meet  the  needs  of  its  customers,  the  Bank  issues  financial  standby  letters  of  credit,  bank  guarantees  and  loan  commitments.  Loan commitments are those agreements under which the Bank has an irrevocable obligation to grant the loan. The financial guarantee contracts issued by the Bank are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due to accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nBoth financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments are initially recognized as liabilities at fair value, which is normally the fee received, adjusted for the directly attributable transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, liabilities are measured at the higher of the provision amount measured according to  IFRS  9,  and  the  amount  initially  recognized,  less  the  accumulated  amortization  recognized  according  to  IFRS  15  Revenue  from  contracts  with customers.\n\nIncome derived from guarantees is recognized as fees and commission income in the consolidated statement of income over the term of the contract, in accordance with the method and frequency of commission's payments.\n\n## 7.6 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred, and the Bank has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or when the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership but it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between (a) the carrying amount (measured at the date of derecognition) and (b) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) is recognized in net income.\n\nIn  transactions  in  which  the  Bank  neither  transfers  nor  retains  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  of  a  financial  asset,  the  Bank continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred financial asset.\n\nA financial liability is removed from the consolidated statement of financial position when it is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## Debt exchange\n\nThe Bank assesses whether the  instruments  subject  to  exchange  are  substantially  different  from  each  other,  considering  qualitative  aspects  such  as currencies, terms, rates, conditions of subordination, regulatory framework, among others; and quantitative aspects, including whether the present value of discounted cash flows under the conditions of the new instruments (including any commission paid net of any commission received) and using the original effective interest rate to calculate the discount, is at least 10 percent different from the discounted present value of the cash flows that still remain of the original financial liability.",

        "page_content": "When it is determined that the instruments subject to debt exchange are not substantially different (based on the analysis of qualitative variables such as changes in currency or emission market, and quantitative assessments in some cases), the transaction is recognized as a debt modification. In this case, the amortized cost of the modified liability is adjusted to the present value of the estimated contractual cash flows which are discounted at the original effective interest rate of the financial instrument, and a gain or loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Incremental costs and commissions adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortized over the remaining life of the modified liability; its subsequent measurement continues at amortized cost. In debt exchanges where the new instrument is considered substantially different, the liability is derecognized against the consolidated statement of income, and a new financial liability arises.\n\n## 7.6.1 Written-Off loan portfolio\n\nLoans are written off when the Bank concludes there is no realistic expectation of recovery of the loans and receivables balances from a client or third party, i.e., there is no possibility of recovery due to the debtor's lack of ability or willingness to pay or in the absence of open guarantees granted by the debtor. In general, this characteristic will be fulfilled when the following delinquency conditions are present:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                     |                                    | Length of delinquency (days)     | Length of delinquency (days)      | Length of delinquency (days)    | Length of delinquency (days)   |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Type                | Collateral                         | Grupo Agromercantil Holding S.A. | Banistmo S.A.                     | Banco Agr\u00edcola S.A.             | Bancolombia S.A.               |\n| Commercial          | Without/Whit collateral            | N/A (1)                          | 360                               | 360                             | 360                            |\n| Consumer            | Without collateral With collateral | 180 540 for vehicles collateral  | 180 1,080 for mortgage collateral | 180 720 for mortgage collateral | 180                            |\n| Small Business Loan | Without collateral With collateral | 180                              | 180 1,080 for mortgage collateral | 180                             | 180                            |\n| Mortgage            | With collateral                    | 1,440                            | 1,080                             | 720                             | N/A (1)                        |\n\nAmong the reasons underlying a loan's non-recoverability are the estimated recovery time of the obligation, the probable recovery percentage given the existence or lack of collateral and the inability to locate the client. When default conditions are present, it is initially necessary to evaluate whether the collateral that supports the loan generates a reasonable expectation of recovery; if so, the necessary steps are taken to realize on the collateral prior to writing-off the loan. In cases where the collateral net fair value indicates that there are no reasonable expectations of recovery, loans are written-off in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 7.7. Derivatives financial instruments\n\nA financial derivative is an instrument whose value changes in response to changes in a variable such as an interest rate, exchange rate, the price of a financial instrument, a credit rating or a credit index. This instrument requires no initial payment, or a smaller investment than would be required for other financial instruments with a similar response to changes in market conditions, and it is generally settled at a future date. The Bank recognizes its derivatives  financial  instruments  at  fair  value  based  on  the  prices  and  methodologies  provided  by  the  official  pricing  services  provider  (Precia). Counterparty credit-risk adjustments are applied to derivatives when the Bank's position is a derivative asset and the Bank's credit risk is incorporated when the position is a derivative liability. For further information, see Note 30. Fair value of assets and liabilities, section d. Credit valuation adjustment.\n\nThe Bank carries out derivative transactions to facilitate the business of clients related to the Management of their market and credit risk, managing the exposure in its own position to changes in interest rates and risks in exchange rates, or to obtain benefits from changes in valuations experienced by these instruments in the market. Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value through profit or loss, unless such derivatives are designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges or as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.

All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.\n\n## 7.7.1 Hedge accounting\n\nFair  value  hedges  are  used  by  the  Bank,  through  its  Panamanian  subsidiary,  Banistmo,  to  protect  against  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  investment securities that are attributable to interest rate variability. When the hedging relationship is considered to be highly effective, the changes in value of the hedging derivative are accounted for according to their classification, as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of net investment in foreign operations, as set out in the paragraph below.\n\nThe Bank assesses at the inception of the hedge and on a monthly basis during the life of the instrument, whether the hedge used in the transaction is expected to be aligned with the hedge effectiveness requirement (prospective effectiveness):\n\n- \u25cf Economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\n- \u25cf The effect of credit risk does not predominate over the value of the economic relationship.\n- \u25cf Designated hedge ratio is consistent with risk management strategy.\n\nThe Bank discontinues the hedge accounting when the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria provided for hedge effectiveness or when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. Consequently, the item no longer complies with the hedge accounting conditions or the hedging relationship no longer complies with the risk management objective.\n\nWhen hedge accounting for  a  fair  value  hedge  is  terminated,  the  previous  adjustments  related  to  the  changes  in  fair  value  of  the  hedged  item  are\n\nsubsequently recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of that asset.\n\nWhen hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge is terminated, the accumulated gains and losses recorded in equity will be reclassified to the consolidated statement of income in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows are realized.\n\nBefore the establishment of hedge accounting, the Bank documents the relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments, as well as its risk management  objectives  and  hedging  strategies,  which  are  approved  by  the  Risk  Management  Committee  as  the  body  designated  by  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nHedge relationships are classified and accounted for in the following ways:\n\nFair value hedges are designated to protect against the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or unrecognized firm commitments.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments in fair value hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as interest and valuation on financial instruments. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is included as part of the carrying value of the hedged item, and it is also recognized in the aforementioned item of the consolidated statement of income.\n\nFor  fair  value  hedges  that  are  related  to  items  accounted  for  at  amortized  cost,  the  adjustments  to  the  carrying  value  are  amortized  through  the consolidated statement of income during the remaining term until their expiry. The amortization of the effective interest rate shall begin as long as there is an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.\n\nAmortization of adjustments to carrying value is based on the recalculated effective interest rate at the amortization commencement date.

If the hedged item is derecognized, the remaining value to amortize is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nWhen an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income.\n\nCash flow hedges are used mainly to manage the exposure to variability related to the cash flow attributable to a specific risk associated with an asset or liability recognized on the consolidated statement of financial position or to a highly probable forecast transaction.\n\nThe portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, without replacement or rollover into another hedging instrument, or if the hedging designation  no  longer  meets  the  criteria  provided  for  the  hedge  effectiveness  requirements  after  any  subsequent  rebalancing  adjustment,  any accumulated gain or loss previously recognized in OCI remains in OCI, until the planned operation or the firm commitment affects the result.\n\nThe  Bank  ceases  hedge  accounting  when  the  hedging  relationship  ceases  to  meet  the  objective  of  managing  the  hedged  risk  when  the  hedging instrument  expires  or  is  sold,  terminated,  or  exercised,  or  when  it  no  longer  qualifies  for  hedge  accounting.  Any  gain  or  loss  recognized  in  other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized in other comprehensive income when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in net income. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in net income.\n\nHedges of a net investment in a foreign operation: In accordance with IFRS 9 and IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the Bank has decided to apply the hedge accounting of the foreign exchange rate risk arising from currency translation of consolidated financial statements and goodwill of its net investment in Banistmo, designating as a hedging instrument of certain debt securities issued by the Parent Company. The hedge accounting requires that the Bank accounts for the gain or loss derived from the foreign exchange differences related to the debt securities that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income, as is the currency translation adjustment of the Banistmo operation into the presentation currency as required by IAS 21 Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates as detailed in 2.

However, the fair value of the financial asset or financial liability can be different from the transaction price at initial recognition. When the amounts are not equal, the asset or liability should be measured at fair value and the difference between the transaction price and fair value is required to be recognized as follows:\n\n- \u25cf If the fair value is assessed as Level 1 based on the inputs or the valuation technique uses only data from observable markets, therefore Bank recognizes the difference as a gain or loss on initial recognition.\n- \u25cf In  all  other  circumstances,  the  Bank  defers  day  one  gain  or  loss  recognition  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  over  the  life  of  the transaction.",

Premises and equipment and depreciation\n\nPremises and equipment include tangible items that are held for use, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and are expected to be used for more than one period.\n\nItems  of  premises  and  equipment  are  expressed  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  losses.  Depreciation  is  calculated  using  the straight-line  method,  in  order  to  derecognize  the  depreciable  amount  of  promises  and  equipment  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets.  The depreciable amount is the cost of an asset less its residual value. The estimated useful lives for each asset group are:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| Asset group             | Useful life range   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Buildings               | 10 to 75 years      |\n| Furniture and fixtures  | 3 to 20 years       |\n| Computer equipment      | 3 to 20 years       |\n| Equipment and machinery | 2 to 40 years       |\n| Vehicles                | 3 to 10 years       |\n\nThe asset's residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. When there is a significant change, the depreciation and the charge to the consolidated statement of income are adjusted based on the new estimation.\n\nThe Bank assesses at the end of each year whether there is any indication of external or internal reduction in the asset's recoverable value. If there is any indication of impairment, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of the assets and then recognizes the impairment loss in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recognized  for  the  amount  by  which  the  asset's  carrying  amount  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount  and  is  recognized  in  the consolidated statement of income as 'Impairment, depreciation and amortization'.\n\nWhen the carrying value exceeds the recoverable value (the greater of fair value less the costs of sale and value in use), the carrying value is adjusted to its recoverable value, modifying the future charges for depreciation, according to its new remaining useful life.\n\nIn a similar way, when indications exist that the value of an asset has been recovered, reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the consolidated  statement  of  income  and  consequently  the  future  charges  for  the  asset's  depreciation  are  adjusted.  In  any  case,  the  reversal  of  the impairment loss of assets cannot increase it carrying value above the amount that it would have if impairment losses in previous periods had not been recognized.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the smallest identifiable group that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). The evaluation can be carried out at the individual asset level when the fair value less the cost of sale can be reliably determined and the value in use is estimated to be close to its fair value less costs to sell and fair value less costs to sell can be determined.\n\nMaintenance expenses of the premises and equipment are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred and are registered in the consolidated statement of income as ' Other administrative and general expenses'.\n\nGains and losses in the sale of premises and equipment are registered in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating income' or 'Other operating expenses'.\n\n## 9. Investment properties\n\nLand and buildings that the Bank holds to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both rather than for their use in the supply of services or sale in the ordinary course of business are recognized as investment properties.",

The  carrying  value  includes  the  cost  of  replacement  or substitution  of  a  part  of  an  investment  property  at  the  time  the  cost  is  incurred,  if  the  cost  meets  the  recognition  criteria;  and  it  excludes  the  daily maintenance costs of the investment property which are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating expenses'.\n\nAfter the initial recognition, the investment properties are measured at fair value which reflects the market conditions at the consolidated statement of financial position date and are valued by external experts using valuation techniques based on comparable prices, direct capitalization, discounted cash flows and replacement cost. The gains and losses that arise from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating income'.\n\nThe investment properties are derecognized, either at the moment of their disposal or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of the investment properties and the carrying value is recognized in net income in the period the disposal occurs.\n\nTransfers of an asset to or from the investment properties are only made when there is a change in its use. For a transfer from an investment property to premises and equipment, the cost taken into account for its subsequent accounting is the fair value at the time of the change in use. If a premise and equipment becomes an investment property, it will be accounted for at its fair value.\n\n## 10. Intangible assets\n\nAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset with no physical appearance. Separately acquired intangible assets are measured initially at their cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is their fair value at the date of acquisition. After the initial recognition, the intangible assets are accounted for at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment loss. The costs of internally generated intangible  assets,  excluding  the  costs  from  development  that  meet  the  recognition  criteria,  are  not  capitalized  and  the  expense  is  reflected  in  the consolidated statement of income as it is incurred.\n\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are determined as finite or indefinite. The intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives. The amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at least annually. The expected changes in the useful life or in the pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits of the asset are accounted  for  when  changing  the  period  or  amortization  method,  as  appropriate,  and  they  are  treated  as  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates.  The amortization expense of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. The useful lives of the intangible assets with finite life ranges between 1 and 10 years.\n\nWhen  intangible  assets  with  finite  useful  life  are  written-off,  the  expected  future  economic  benefits  period  is  reduced  to  increase  the  amount  of amortization, resulting in the derecognition of the intangible asset in a shorter period than initially estimated.\n\nThe Bank assesses annually its intangible assets with finite life in order to identify whether any indications of impairment exist, as well as possible reversal of previous impairment losses.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization but are periodically tested to identify any impairment, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of the indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine if it continues being supportable. In the event that the assessment was not valid, the change from indefinite useful life to finite useful life is recognized prospectively.\n\nThe gain or loss that arises when an intangible asset is derecognized is measured as the difference between the disposal value and the carrying value of the asset and is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.",

Goodwill and intangible assets, net). Intangibles of indefinite useful life include Goodwill.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, the Bank acquired control of WOMPI S.A.S. (before 'VLIPCO S.A.S.'), a company that provides technology services, and as a result of this transaction an intangible asset was recognized corresponding to entity's software developments. For further details of this transaction, see Note 9.3. Business combination.\n\n## 10.1 Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs  are  recorded  as  expenses  as  they  are  incurred.  Costs  directly  related  to  the  development  of  a  stand-alone  project  are  recognized  as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u25cf It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;\n- \u25cf Management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;\n- \u25cf There is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- \u25cf It can be demonstrated how the asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n- \u25cf Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available; and\n- \u25cf The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured.\n\nIn the  consolidated statement of financial position, the related capitalized costs are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nCosts are capitalized during the application development stage and amortized on a straight-line basis from the beginning of the production stage over the period of expected future economic benefits. During the development period, the asset is subjected to impairment testing at least annually to determine if impairment indications exist.\n\nThe research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalization are recorded as expenses in the consolidated statement of income of the period (see item 13. Impairment of non-financial assets and cash-generating units and goodwill, set below).\n\n## 11.  Inventories\n\nThe inventories of returned property are those assets that come from an early termination of a lease (returned properties) or those upon which the lease has already concluded (premises and equipment), which are expected to be sold in the normal course of business. These are controlled by the Bank and are expected to generate future economic benefits.\n\nThe inventories of returned property are recognized as an asset from the date on which the Bank assumes the risks and benefits of the inventories, provided that the cost of the asset can be reliably measured, and it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits.\n\nThe inventories of returned property are valued using the specific identification method and their costs include the carrying value at the time the asset is returned.\n\nThe carrying value of returned property is measured at the lower value of cost and net realizable value (NRV). The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to sell. The adjustment in the carrying value to reflect the NRV is recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the period in which the goods are returned. The value of any reversion that comes from an increase in the NRV in which the increase occurs is recognized as a lower expense in the period.\n\nOther new inventories are measured initially at acquisition cost which comprises the sum of the purchase price, the import costs (if applicable), the nonrecoverable taxes paid, the storage, the transport costs, and other attributable or necessary costs for their acquisition, less discounts, reductions or similar items. Those inventories do not include selling costs.",

Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nA non-current asset or a disposal group of assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use. These assets or groups of assets are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position at the lower of their carrying value and their fair value less costs to sell and they are not depreciated nor amortized from the date of their classification.\n\nThe held for sale condition is met if the assets or group of assets are available, in their current condition, for immediate sale and the sale transaction is highly probable and is expected to be completed within the year following the date of classification.\n\nThe Bank performs the measurement of the assets held for  sale  at  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  date.  However,  these  assets  are evaluated quarterly if impairment indicators exist that imply review of the carrying value recorded in the accounts. If those indications are identified, impairment  losses  are  recognized  for  the  difference  between  the  carrying  and  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  as  'Impairment,  depreciation  and amortization'  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income.  Gains  and  losses  in  the  sale  of  premises  and  equipment  are  recognized  in  the  consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating income' or 'Other operating expenses'.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and represents a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated and individual plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nIncome and expenses coming from a discontinued operation must be disclosed separately from those coming from continued operations, in a single item after the income tax, in the consolidated statement of income of the current period and comparatively with previous period even though the Bank retains a non-controlling interest in the subsidiary after the sale.\n\nManagement has developed quantitative thresholds such as 'rules of thumb' to determine the materiality of major line of business. In the absence of particular standards, a line of business below the threshold of 5% of net assets in the consolidated statement of financial position is not considered material.\n\n## 13.  Impairment of non-financial assets and cash-generating units and goodwill\n\nThe Bank evaluates at the end of each period whether there is any indication that on a stand-alone basis non-financial assets and cash-generating units are impaired. If some indication of impairment does exist, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of the assets and the loss by impairment, the impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Regardless of whether impairment indicators exist, impairment of goodwill is assessed annually.\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  is  determined  by  Management  by  reference  to  market  value,  if  available,  by  pricing  models,  or  with  the  assistance  of  a valuation specialist. Determination of the recoverable amount requires Management to make assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flow for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment of the appropriate discount rate and growth rate, estimation of the recoverable amount of cash generation units and the valuation of the separable assets of each business whose goodwill is being reviewed.\n\nIf an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from the rest of the assets or group of assets, the recoverable amount is determined by the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.",

Other assets\n\nThe Bank presents as other assets, among other things, (a) the expenses paid in advance incurred in the development of its business, in order to receive future services, which are amortized during the period in which services are received or the costs or expenses are recorded and (b) foreclosed assets that do not comply with the requirements to be recognized as assets held for sale and where there are no plans to use them in the supply of services or for administrative purposes.\n\nForeclosed assets are initially recognized at the lower of net amount of the charged-off financial assets to which the foreclosed assets relate and net realizable value of the foreclosed asset (the net realizable value will be the estimated selling price of the asset or its awarding value, less the estimated costs necessary to carry out its sale), pending obtaining a plan for its commercialization. If net amount of the charged-off financial assets is greater than net realizable value of the foreclosed asset, an adjustment for impairment of credit risk of the financial asset is recorded in the results for the period.\n\nThere is evidence of impairment when these group of assets remain in the consolidated statement of financial position for a period of time exceeding one year from the reception date, without buyer having been found, despite the Bank's ongoing efforts to sell them (even adjusting the selling price).\n\nForeclosed assets are subsequently assessed to determine whether an impairment lost must be recognized. In the case of events that arise that are beyond the control of the Bank and that make remote the realization of these assets, they are identified as \"non-tradable', and a complete impairment is carried out.\n\n## 15.  Employee benefits\n\n## 15.1 Short term benefits\n\nThe  Bank  grants  to  its  employees  short-term  benefits  such  as  bonuses  based  on  added  value  to  clients  and  the  Bank's  results,  salaries,  accrued performance costs and social security that are expected to be wholly settled within 12 months. Expenses related to these benefits are recognized over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate. For further information, see Note 19. Employee benefit plans.\n\n## 15.2 Other long-term employee benefits\n\nThe Bank grants to its employees seniority bonuses as long-term employee benefits whose payment is not expected within the 12 months following the end of the annual period in which the employees have rendered their services. The cost of long-term employee benefits is allocated across the period from the time the employee was hired by the Bank and the expected date of obtaining the benefit. These benefits are projected up to the date of payment and are discounted through the projected unit credit method.\n\n## 15.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\n## -Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Bank makes monthly contributions to pension funds, due to legal requirements and it has no legal obligation to pay further contributions.\n\nThe  Bank  recognizes  contributions  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  once  the  contribution  is  accrued.  Any  contributions  unpaid  at  the consolidated statement of financial position date are included as a liability.",

The Bank makes an actuarial valuation based on the projected unit credit method and a risk-free rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money in each country (interest rate of treasury bonds ['TES'], representative of the nation's public debt), related to the characteristics and the benefit flows weighted average, to discount such obligation.\n\n## 16.  Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are  recorded  when  the  Bank  has  a  present  obligation  (legal  or  constructive)  as  a  result  of  past  events,  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nProvisions are determined by Management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, which estimate is discounted using a risk-free rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money in each country, which for Colombia is the interest rate on treasury bonds 'TES'.\n\nThe corresponding expense of any provision is recorded in the consolidated statement of income, as a provision, net of all expected reimbursement. The increase of the provision due to the time value of money is recognized as a financial expense.\n\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position, correspond mainly to:\n\n## I. Judicial proceedings\n\nJudicial  provisions  refer  to  pending  legal  proceedings  on  employment  matters,  ordinary  lawsuits,  class  actions  suit,  civil  actions  within  criminal prosecutions and executive proceedings against the Bank.\n\n## II. Onerous contracts\n\nFor the Bank, an onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceeds the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\n\n## III. Loan commitments\n\nIn order to meet the needs of its customers, the Bank issues loan commitments, letters of credit and bank guarantees. Loan commitments are those approved irrevocable loans, in which, despite having acquired a commitment to grant them, due to the contract or agreement or for any other reason they are still pending disbursement. See Note 2.D Significant accounting policies (7.5.2 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments).\n\n## IV. Financial guarantees\n\nThe Bank issues bank guarantees on behalf of its customers. A bank guarantee represents an irrevocable commitment pursuant to which the Bank will cover, up to the maximum amount guaranteed, a breach of the client's contractual obligations to third parties for a certain period of time. These are commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and are mainly issued to guarantee agreements established between  parties  from  the  energy  sector,  hydrocarbons  sector,  private  sector  and  public  procurement  contracts.  The  Bank  expects  most  of  those guarantees  provided  to  expire  before  they  are  used.  See  Note  2.D  Significant  accounting  policies  (7.5.2  Financial  guarantee  contracts  and  loan commitments).\n\nThe events or circumstances that would require the Bank to perform under a guarantee are determined by the type of guarantee, as outlined below:",

Revenue recognition\n\nThe Bank recognizes revenue from ordinary activities, which represent the transfer of goods or services committed with customers in exchange for an amount  that  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  entity  expects  to  be  entitled  in  exchange  for  such  assets  or  services.  The  recognition  and measurement of interest income and dividend income from debt and equity instruments are not within the scope of IFRS 15. Instead, they are within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nThe Bank evaluates the contracts and commitments established with customers, identifying compliance with the five steps established in IFRS 15 as follows:\n\n- 1. Identifying the contract: The parties' rights, payment conditions, evaluation of the commercial basis and characteristics of the consideration are identified, and the Bank evaluates if there are modifications or combinations that apply.\n- 2. Identifying performance obligations: The Bank evaluates the commitments included in the entity's contracts to identify when the customer makes use of the service and whether the obligations are identifiable separately.\n- 3. Determining the transaction price: The characteristics of the amounts for which the agreed services were exchanged are reviewed in the Bank's contracts, to estimate the effect of variable consideration in kind, or others payable to the customer.\n- 4. Allocating  the  transaction  price  to  performance  obligations:  In  the  evaluation  of  prices  under  the  Bank's  contracts,  these  are  allocated individually to the services provided by the Bank, even for products where there are packaged commitments.\n- 5. Satisfaction of performance obligations: The obligations established in contracts with customers are satisfied when the control of the service is transferred to the customer and the recognition is performed as established in IFRS 15, over time or at a point in time.\n\nThe Bank satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\n- a) The Bank's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use for the entity, and it has an enforceable right to receive payment for the performance completed to date.\n- b) The Bank's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced.\n- c) The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Bank's performance as the Bank performs.\n\nFor performance obligations where none of the indicated conditions is fulfilled, the Bank satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time, at which the customer obtains control of the promised services and the entity satisfies a performance obligation. When the Bank fulfills a performance obligation through the delivery of promised goods or services, it creates a contractual asset for the consideration amount obtained with the performance.\n\nA contract asset is the right of the Bank to receive a payment in exchange for goods or services that the Bank has transferred to a customer, when that right  is  dependent  on  something  other  than  the  passage  of  time  (for  example,  billing  or  delivery  of  other  elements  part  of  the  contract).  The  Bank recognizes the contractual assets as current assets, as they are expected to be realized within the normal operating cycle.\n\nThe costs of contracts eligible for capitalization as incremental costs when obtaining a contract are recognized as a contractual asset. Contractual costs are  capitalized  when incurred if the Bank expects to recover those costs. Contractual costs constitute non-current assets to the extent that the Bank expects to receive the economic benefits of those assets in a period greater than twelve months. The contractual costs are amortized systematically and consistently with the transfer",

The capitalized contractual costs are impaired if the customer withdraws or if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projection of the discounted cash flows that are related to the contract.\n\nWhen the amount of consideration received from a customer exceeds the amount of the recognized revenue, this creates a contractual liability. Contract liabilities constitute the Bank's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer, for which the Bank has received a payment from the end customer or if the amount is past due. They also include deferred income related to goods or services that shall be delivered or provided in the future, which will be billed to the customer in advance, but which are not yet past due.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer, and excludes amounts received on behalf of third parties when the Bank is an agent. The Bank recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer. Revenue is presented net of reimbursements and discounts and after eliminating inter-group sales. The Bank evaluates its revenue categories based on specific criteria to determine whether it acts as principal or agent. Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Bank and it is possible to reliably measure the related revenues and costs.\n\n## 18.1.  Interest income and expenses\n\nFor all  financial  instruments  measured  at  amortized  cost,  interest  income  and  interest  expenses  are  recognized  using  the  effective  interest  rate.  The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts future estimated cash flows payments through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying value of the financial liability or asset. The computation takes into account all the contractual conditions of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes incremental fees or expenses that are directly attributed to the instrument and are an integral part of the Effective Interest Rate (EIR), but not future credit losses.\n\nFor debt securities at fair value, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Interest and valuation on financial instruments'.\n\n## 18.2.  Fees and commission income\n\nThe Bank charges fees for the services it provides to its customers. Fee income can be divided into the following three categories:\n\n## Income from commissions that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument\n\nCommissions for loan commitments that have a high probability of being used are deferred (together with any incremental cost) via the effective interest rate, once the loan is granted (in accordance with section 18.1). If the commitment expires and no loan is made, the commission is recognized as income at the time of termination.\n\nThe opening commissions received for the issuance of a financial liability measured at amortized cost are included in the effective interest rate of the financial instrument and its recognition as income is generated during the estimated life of the asset.\n\n## Income from commissions obtained from the services that are provided during a certain period of time\n\nThese are commissions earned for the services rendered during a period. These payments include income from commissions and asset management, custody and other administration and advisory commissions.\n\nIn loan commitments, when it is not possible to demonstrate the probability that a loan will be used, the opening fees of the loan are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as revenue from ordinary activities, in accordance with IFRS 15, and are recognized based on the past due and the frequency of commission payment.",

Commissions or fee components that are linked to a specified performance are recognized after the corresponding criteria are met.\n\n## 18.3.  Dividend revenue\n\nFor the investments that are not associates or joint ventures, dividends are recognized when the right to payment of the Bank is established, which is generally when the shareholders declare the dividend. These are included in the consolidated statement of income as dividends received and share of profits of equity method investees.\n\n## 18.4.

This includes any ineffectiveness registered in the hedging transactions.\n\n## 19.  Income tax\n\nIncome tax includes current tax and deferred tax. The current tax is the income tax payable with respect to the profit for the fiscal year, which arises in profit or other comprehensive income. A provision is made for current tax considering the tax bases and tax rates enacted in each of the jurisdictions where the Bank is located, at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Bank recognizes, when appropriate, deferred tax assets and liabilities by estimating the future tax effects attributable to differences between book values of assets, liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rate that, in accordance with the valid tax laws in each country where the Bank has operations, must be applied in the year in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The future effects of changes in tax laws or tax rates are recognized in the deferred taxes as from the date of publication of the law providing for such changes.\n\nTax bases for deferred tax must be calculated by factoring in the definition of IAS 12 Income tax and the value of the assets and liabilities that will be realized or settled in the future according to the valid tax laws of each of the countries where the Bank has operations.\n\nDeferred  tax  liabilities  due  to  deductible  temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiary  and  associated  entities  or  shares  in  joint ventures, are recognized, except when the Bank is able to control the period in which the deductible temporary difference is reverted, and it is likely that the temporary difference will not be reverted in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets, identified with temporary differences, are only recognized if it is considered likely that the Bank will have sufficient taxable income in the future that allows it to be recovered based on the stand-alone entity expected cash flow forecast for the next three years.\n\nTax credit from fiscal losses and surplus amounts from the presumptive income on the net income are recognized as a deferred asset, provided that it is likely that the Bank will generate future net income to allow their offset.\n\nThe deferred tax is recorded as debit or credit according to the result of each of the companies that form the Bank, and for the purpose of disclosure on the consolidated statement of financial position it is disclosed as net.",

Use of estimates and judgments\n\nThe  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  requires  Bank's  Management  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgments or changes in assumptions are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if assumptions and conditions change.\n\nThe significant accounting estimates that the Bank uses in preparing its consolidated financial statements are detailed below:\n\n## 1. Credit risk impairment\n\nAs disclosed by Management and described in section D. Significant Accounting Policies, paragraph 7.4.5 Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 'FVTOCI', expected credit losses are calculated using individual and collective models and methodologies  based  on  assumptions  and  judgement  considering  historical  credit  data,  current  borrower  situation  and  reasonable  and  supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the prospective approach that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios. In addition, for loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, the fair value of guarantees granted, information on credit behavior and the future cash flows expected from the client.\n\nThe estimation  of  impairment  charges  is  a  critical  accounting  policy  because  of  the  significance  of  this  line  item,  the  sensitivity  of  the  charges  to changes in assumptions about future events (behavior of the expected macroeconomic variables), weighting of macroeconomic scenarios, uncertainty about the COVID-19 effects and other somewhat subjective judgments that are incorporated in the individual credit loss models.\n\nSome relevant assumptions must be made to operate the mathematical models behind the expected credit loss assessment. Assumptions are constructed from  historical  data  to  consider  whether  a  customer  has  a  significant  increase  in  risk  or  is  in  default;  these  are  reviewed  by  expert  panels.  Other assumptions such as future economic conditions, the simulation of reasonable future economic scenarios and the likelihood of those scenarios have a high  impact  on  lifetime  default  probability  models.  These  scenarios  are  determined  and  leveraged  by  the  Direction  of  Economic  Research,  which operates independently of the Bank's risk Management division.\n\nThe  main  factors  considered  in  collective  estimations  of  credit  losses  are  the  definition  of  significant  increase  in  credit  risk,  definition  of  default, collateral values, loan maturity and macroeconomic forecast of variables such as unemployment, GDP, interest rates, among others. It is also important to consider any other variable that could influence a client's willingness to pay.\n\nIn addition, individual credit loss models consider assumptions on how the financial performance and future cash flow of a client could be affected, the client's expected future operational and commercial activity, the capacity to generate sufficient cash to pay debt obligations and trends and regulatory changes in the economic sector in which the client operates, changes in the collateral value, weighting of the scenarios used, as well as other internal or external factors.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the assessment of three following factors, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from the expectations on which Management's estimates are based:",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n- \u25cf Exposure at default: The exposed balance of assets to the current capital balance, interest, and receivable accounts. In the case of products whose  nature  is  revolving  and  that  have  an  available  borrowing  that  is  susceptible  to  be  used  in  its  entirety  according  to  loan  contracts subscribed with clients, this parameter includes an estimation of the use of those products after the client's default.\n- \u25cf Probability of default (PD): This is the probability that the debtor fails to fulfill their obligations of capital and/or interest payment over a period of 12 months. This is linked to the rating/scoring of each debtor/operation.\n- \u25cf Loss given default (LGD): This is defined as the economic impairment that the entity would incur in the event of any instance of default. This depends mainly upon the characteristics of the debtor and upon the valuation of guarantees or collateral associated with the operation.\n\nImpairment loss models and methodologies, and the related assumptions, are assessed by the Bank's Chief Risk Officer (CRO) on a regular basis, using robust validation procedures in order to assure a reasonable coverage of effective losses. This process enables Management to periodically determine whether assumptions and models used to measure credit risk impairment should be adjusted to achieve more precise estimations. Internal controls, data governance standards and approval processes, have been implemented by the Bank to make estimations more accurate.\n\nDuring 2022, the Bank made the following improvements to the methodologies used for accounting for expected credit losses:\n\n- \u25cf Improvement in the LGD (Loss Given Default) model in order to incorporate as much client information as possible.\n- \u25cf Classification of clients that are cured from default in stage 2 for a 12-month period.\n- \u25cf Improvements in the identification of clients with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR).\n\nThese methodological improvements generated a reversal of provision for credit losses in the amount of COP 1,436 as of December 31, 2022.\n\nFurthermore, as of December 31, 2022, there is no longer an overlay value on the portfolios that had been receiving relief from COVID-19. For further information, see section D. Significant Accounting Policies, paragraph 7.4.5 Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI').\n\n## 2. Impairment testing of cash generating units ('CGU'), including goodwill\n\nThe Bank tests goodwill recognized upon business combinations for impairment at least annually. The impairment test for goodwill involves estimates and  significant  judgments,  including  the  identification  of  cash  generating  units  and  the  allocation  of  goodwill  based  on  the  expectations  of  which operating segments of the Bank will benefit from the acquisition. The fair value of the acquired companies is sensitive to changes in the valuation models' assumptions. Adverse changes in any of the factors underlying these assumptions could lead the Bank to record a goodwill impairment charge. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and supportable in the existing market environment and commensurate with the risk profile of the assets valued. See Note 9. Goodwill and intangible assets, net, for further information related to carrying amount, valuation methodologies, key assumptions, sensitivities and the allocation of goodwill.\n\n## 3. Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on deductible or levied temporary differences originating between tax and accounting bases, taking into account the tax rules applicable in each country where the Bank has operations. Due to the changing conditions of the political, social and economic environment,  the  constant  amendments  to  tax  legislation  and  the  permanent  changes  in  the  tax  principles  and  changes  in  interpretations  by  tax authorities determining the tax bases for the deferred tax items involves difficult judgments including estimates of future gains, offsets or tax deductions.\n\nAccordingly, the determination of the deferred tax is considered a critical accounting policy.",

Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Bank is subject to contingent liabilities, including those arising from judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings, tax and other claims arising from  the  conduct  of  the  Bank's  business  activities.  These  contingencies  are  evaluated  based  on  Management's  best  estimates  and  provisions  are established  for  legal  and  other  claims  by  assessing  the  likelihood  of  the  loss  actually  occurring  as  probable,  possible  or  remote.  Contingences  are provisioned and recorded when all the information available indicates that it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation before the consolidated statement of financial position date and the amounts may be reasonably estimated. The Bank engages internal and external experts in assessing probability and in estimating any amounts involved.\n\nThroughout the life of a contingency, the Bank may learn of additional information that can affect assessments regarding probability or the estimates of amounts involved; changes in these assessments can lead to changes in recorded provisions.\n\nThe Bank considers the estimates used to determine the provisions for contingent liabilities critical estimates because the probability of their occurrence and the amounts that the Bank may be required to pay are based on the Bank's judgment and those of its internal and external experts, which will not necessarily  coincide  with  the  future  outcome  of  the  proceedings.  For  further  information  regarding  legal  proceedings  and  contingencies  and  their carrying amounts, see Note 21. Provisions and contingent liabilities.\n\n## 5. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial  assets  and  liabilities  recorded  at  fair  value  on  the  Bank's  statement  of  financial  position  include  debt,  equity  securities  and  derivatives classified at fair value through profit or loss, debt classified at fair value through other comprehensive income and equity securities which the Bank has made an irrevocable election to present changes in its fair value in other comprehensive income.\n\nTo increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, IFRS 13 Fair value measurement specifies different levels of inputs that may be used to measure the fair value of financial instruments. In accordance with this standard, financial instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if there are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nInstruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions.\n\nLevel 2: Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2 if in the absence of a market price for a specific financial instrument, its fair value is estimated using models whose input data are observable for recent transactions of identical or similar instruments.\n\nLevel 3: Assets and liabilities are classified as level 3 if unobservable input data were used in the measurement of fair value that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of these assets or liabilities. The fair value of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.\n\nTransfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. All transfers between the aforementioned levels are assumed to occur at the end of the reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe measurement of the fair value of financial instruments generally involves a higher degree of complexity and requires the application of judgments especially when the models use unobservable inputs (level 3) based on the assumptions that would be used in the market to determine the price for assets  or  liabilities.  Determination  of  these  assumptions  includes  consideration  of  market  conditions  and  liquidity  levels.  Changes  in  the  market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.\n\nWhen developing fair value measurements, the Bank maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair  value.  Internal  models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with the Bank's policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, the Bank uses third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internally developed prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. For further details regarding carrying amount and sensitivity disclosures, please see Note 30. Fair value of assets and liabilities.\n\n## 6. Measurement of Employee benefits\n\nThe measurement of post-employment benefit obligations and long-term employee benefits takes into account a range of inputs and it is dependent upon a series of assumptions of future events. The projected unit credit method is used to determine the present value of the obligation for the defined benefits and its associated cost. Future measurements of obligations may differ to those presented in the consolidated financial statements, among others, due to changes  in  economic  and  demographic  assumptions  and  significant  events.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  an  improvement  in  the  actuarial  valuation methodology of the post-employment and long-term benefit plans was presented, in order to include typified discount rates by each benefit plan, with the objective of presenting more relevant information on the value of these plans in the consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 19. Employee benefit plans.\n\n## 7. Transaction price determination\n\nWith respect to contracts with the Bank's customers, for the determination of the transaction price, the Bank allocates to each one of the performance obligations under the contract the price which represents the value expected to be received in respect of each such performance obligation based on its relative  stand-alone  selling  price.  Such  price  is  determined  based  on  the  cost  of  each  service,  related  tax  and  associated  risks  to  the  operation  and inherent  to  the  transaction,  plus  the  margin  expected  to  be  received  for  the  services,  considering  in  each  case  the  market  price  for  the  service,  the conditions agreed with the customer and the customer's segment. The bank has fixed and variable prices considering the characteristics of each service, future  events,  discounts,  returns  and  other  variables  that  may  influence  the  selling  price.  No  significant  financing  components  are  factored  in  the determination of the selling  price.\n\n## 8. Leases\n\nThe measurement of the right-of-use asset and of the lease liabilities requires a series of judgments, among which are the determination of the term of the lease and the rate used in discounting the cash flows. The term of the lease is defined according to the historical information of the contracts and the period over which an asset is expected to be economically usable, which involves a high degree of uncertainty due to the use of relevant information about past events. In the Bank's case, the weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate was used to discount the cash flows associated with the leasing contracts. The Bank performs analysis taking into account the currency, lease term, economic environment and class of underlying assets, as to determine the weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## 9. Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments\n\nIn the process of determining the current and deferred tax for periods subject to review by the tax authority, the applicable rules have been applied and interpretations have been made to take positions, on which different interpretations could arise from those made by the entity. Due to the complexity of the  tax  system,  the  continuous  modifications  of  the  fiscal  rules,  the  accounting  changes  with  implications  in  the  tax  bases  and  in  general  the  legal instability of the country, at any time the tax authority could have different criteria from the Bank. Therefore, a dispute or inspection by the tax authority on a specific tax treatment may affect the deferred or current tax asset or liability bank's accounting, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12.",

Income tax.\n\n## 10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other relevant issues on the Bank's judgements and estimates\n\nDuring 2022, Colombia and the other countries where the Bank operates have been predominantly characterized by a return to a normal economic and social  environment,  which  has  positively  impacted  productive  activity  in  those  regions,  as  well  as  the  expectations  for  future  performance  of  the economy.  In  regard  to  the  evaluation  of  modifications  in  credit  conditions,  until  September  30,  2021,  the  Bank  maintained  a  program  to  support customers in accordance with each customer's individual situation to help them to resume payments by means of modification of loan terms when the debtors  have  been  financially  affected  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Some  of  these  relief  payments  continue  to  be  granted,  as  a  way  of accommodating customers who have difficulties in meeting their credit obligations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the impact of the relief granted to customers amounted to COP 53,745, as a higher value in the line 'Interest income on loans and financial leases' of the consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2022, there is no adjustment for this item because no new relief was granted due to COVID-19.\n\n- *  Impairment  of  non-financial  assets: Additionally,  the  Bank  has  considered  all  macroeconomic  impacts  when  developing  economic  budget assessments, forecasts and other underlying assumptions commonly used to determine the recoverable value of non-financial long-lived assets, such as goodwill, intangibles, investment property, plant and equipment, among others. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the total amount of long-lived assets was concluded to be recoverable based on the assessments carried out by Management. However, for foreclosed assets, an impairment adjustment was recognized in the amount of COP 39,173 as of December 31, 2021; whereas, as of December 31, 2022, the impairment analysis of these assets was not impacted by the pandemic.\n\n## F. Recently issued accounting pronouncements\n\n## a) Accounting Pronouncements Applicable in 2022\n\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: In  May  2020,  the  IASB  issued  amendments  to  IFRS  3  to  update  a  reference  to  the  Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, without changing the accounting requirements for business combinations. This amendment clarifies the compliance requirements of assets and liabilities restrictions for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by applying the acquisition method in a business combination. More specifically:\n\n- -The IASB may add an additional exception to the recognition principle in IFRS 3. This exception indicates that on the acquisition date the acquirer will account for contingent liabilities and liabilities within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 Levies if incurred separately, rather than assumed in a business combination.\n- -Explicitly incorporate the prohibition of the recognition of contingent assets acquired in a business combination, clarifying that the reference to the 2018 Conceptual Framework does not change the requirement for these assets.\n\nThe amendment to IFRS 3 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. This amendment was applied by the Bank as of January 1, 2022, with no impact on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\nAmendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: In  May 2020, the amendment to IAS 37 Onerous contracts Costs of performing a contract was issued, with the purpose of evaluating whether a contract is onerous. IAS 37 provides the definition of an onerous contract as one in which the costs of fulfilling the contract exceed the economic benefits received. The amendment clarifies that the costs of fulfilling a contract are those directly related to the contract, that is, the following: a) the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract; and (b) an allocation of other costs directly related to the fulfilling the contract.\n\nIn addition, this amendment clarifies that before recognizing the provision for loss on the onerous contract, impairment losses on the assets held to comply with the contract must be recognized, in accordance with IAS 36.",

This amendment was applied by the Bank as of January 1, 2022, with no impact on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\n## Annual improvements to IFRS Cycle 2018-2020\n\n- \u25cf IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards: The Board proposes to require a subsidiary that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1 to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by the parent, based on the parent's date of transition to IFRS.\n- This proposed amendment would also apply to an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16 (a) of IFRS 1. These improvements apply from January 1, 2022. This amendment was applied by the Bank as of January 1, 2022, with no impact on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n- \u25cf Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments-Fees in the '10 percent' test for derecognition of financial liabilities: In determining whether to derecognize a financial liability that has been modified or exchanged, an entity is required to assess whether the terms are substantially different. The Board clarified the fees that should be included by an entity when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. Based on this amendment, the entity shall include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf. This amendment is mandatory for the annual periods beginning on, or after January 1, 2022. Earlier application is permitted. The Bank early applied this amendment to financial liabilities that were modified, or exchanged, in the periods beginning on, or after January 1, 2020.\n- \u25cf Illustrative Examples accompanying IFRS 16 Leases: The Board proposes to amend Illustrative Example 13 accompanying IFRS 16 to remove the illustration of payments from the lessor relating to leasehold improvements. The proposed amendment would remove potential for confusion regarding the treatment of lease incentives applying IFRS 16. These improvements apply from January 1, 2022. This amendment was applied by the Bank as of January 1, 2022, with no impact on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\n## b) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Applicable in Future Periods\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 to clarify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. More specifically:\n\n- -The amendments specify that the conditions which exist at the end of the reporting period of an obligation are those which will be used to determine if a right to defer settlement of a liability exists.\n- -Management expectations about events after the balance sheet date, for example on whether a covenant will be breached, or whether early settlement will take place, are not relevant.\n- -The amendments clarify the situations that are considered settlement of a liability.\n\nAdditionally,  on  October  30,  2022,  the  IASB  issued  an  amendment  to  IAS  1  to  improve  the  disclosures  an  entity  provides  when  its  right  to  defer settlement of a liability for at least twelve months is subject to compliance with covenants, and how this impacts the classification of that liability as current or non-current.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 1 are required to be applied for annual periods  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2024.  The  amendments  must  be  applied retrospectively, in accordance with IAS 8. Early application is permitted.\n\nManagement concluded that this amendment has no impact on the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, because the Bank presents the consolidated statement of financial position ordered by liquidity, according to the business nature.\n\nAmendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.

The amendment to IAS 8 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and early application is permitted.\n\nThe Bank early applied this amendment as of January 1, 2022, with no impact on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures, due to the new definition of accounting estimates being in accordance with that which the Bank currently applies and discloses.\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements. Disclosure of Accounting Policies: In February 2021 the Board amended IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, to replace the term \"significant\" with \"material\", to require an entity to disclose its material accounting policy information rather than its significant accounting policies. Therefore, accounting policy information may be considered material when that information is considered together with other information in a complete set of financial statements. In the Board's view, accounting policy information is expected to be material if its disclosure was needed for primary users to understand information provided about material transactions, other events or conditions in the financial statements. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and early application is permitted.\n\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact that this amendment would have on the Bank's consolidated financial statement and disclosures.\n\nAmendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction: In May 2021, the Board issued  Deferred  Tax  related  to  Assets  and  Liabilities  arising  from  a  Single  Transaction.  The  amendments  narrowed  the  scope  of  the  recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of IAS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and early application is permitted.\n\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact that this amendment would have on the Bank's consolidated financial statement and disclosures.\n\nAmendments to IFRS 16 Leases-  Lease  liability  in  a  sale  and  leaseback :  In  September  2022,  the  Board  amended  IFRS  16  to  add  subsequent measurement requirements for sale and leaseback transactions that meet the requirements of IFRS 15 to be accounted as a sale. The amendments require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a subsequent lease such that it does not recognize any amount of gain or loss that relates to the right-of-use that it retains.\n\nThis amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and early application is permitted.\n\nManagement evaluated the impact of the changes that the amendment to IFRS 16 would have on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures, and no impact is expected.\n\n## NOTE 3.

The analysis regresses the historical monthly changes in the fair value of the hedged item, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate and changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\nAdditionally, changes in the value of the hedged item are measured in relation to the corresponding changes in the value of the hedging instrument. All values used in the measurement of hedge effectiveness shall be clean. The regression analysis will always use three or more years of market data. A regression analysis is used in forward testing to assess the effectiveness of the hedge in order to archive compensating changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe subsidiary is exposed to future changes in the fair value of fixed assets/liabilities (USD and non USD) caused by movements in market interest rates that could affect earnings. Management's strategy is to reduce this exposure to interest rate movements through intest rate swap transactions. A hedging instrument (specific swap or group of swaps) has been assigned to each hedged item. The maturity and principal of the hedging instrument will match the maturity or principal of the hedged item to avoid partial-term fair value hedges. The effectiveness of each hedge has to be tested.",

Where legally enforceable, and depending on the Bank's intention, these master netting agreements give the Bank, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities and cash equivalents held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty.\n\nThe table below presents derivative instruments subject to enforceable master netting agreements and other similar agreements but not offset in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 by derivative and by risk:\n\n## As of December 31, 2022\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                                                                             | Derivatives Assets Derivatives Liabilities   |             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Over-the-counter                                                                                            |                                              |             |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                                                                                  |                                              |             |\n| Swaps                                                                                                       | 2,394,832                                    | (1,917,397) |\n| Forwards                                                                                                    | 1,573,952                                    | (1,711,644) |\n| Options                                                                                                     | 121,307                                      | (92,908)    |\n| Interest rate contracts                                                                                     |                                              |             |\n| Swaps                                                                                                       | 865,627                                      | (1,008,302) |\n| Equity contracts                                                                                            |                                              |             |\n| Forwards                                                                                                    | 5,519                                        | (7,203)     |\n| Gross derivative assets/liabilities                                                                         | 4,961,237                                    | (4,737,454) |\n| Offseting of derivates                                                                                      | -                                            | -           |\n| Derivative financial instruments in statement of financial position                                         | 4,961,237                                    | (4,737,454) |\n| Master netting agreements                                                                                   | (4,369,178)                                  | 4,578,461   |\n| Collateral received/paid                                                                                    | (592,059)                                    | 158,993     |\n| Total derivative financial instruments assetss/ liabilities before collateral and Master netting agreements | -                                            | -           |\n\n## As of December 31, 2021\n\n|                    | Derivatives Assets   | Derivatives Liabilities   |\n|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| In millions of COP | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP        |\n| Over-the-counter   |                      |                           |",

Given this benchmark rate is subject to uncertainty as a result of the replacement of LIBOR, the Bank has adopted the amendments to IFRS 9 which provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements (as explained in note 2 Significant Accounting Policies).\n\nThe amendments to IFRS 9 provided temporary exceptions to apply specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships, that are directly affected by the reform to LIBOR. The bank assumed that the hedge accounting will remain highly probable and that the hedge relationship will remain highly effective.\n\nThe Bank maintains swaps as hedging instruments where it changes flows as follows: it pays a fixed interest rate and receives floating interest to hedge the market risk of fixed rate debt instruments.\n\nThe table below shows the notional value of hedging instruments by benchmark interest rate impacted by the reform:\n\n|                   | In thousands of USD Notional value of Notional value of hedging instruments hedging instruments   | In thousands of USD Notional value of Notional value of hedging instruments hedging instruments   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                   | 2022                                                                                              | 2021                                                                                              |\n| Fair value hedges |                                                                                                   |                                                                                                   |\n| USD LIBOR         |                                                                                                   | 79,550                                                                                            |\n\nThe main sources of ineffectiveness for interest rate risk hedge accounting relationships are:\n\n- \u25cf Differences in the interest rate market curves applied to discount the hedging instrument and the hedged instrument.\n- \u25cf The effects of the reforms identified for the LIBOR rate transition, where it could be affected if the agreed times for the changes do not coincide with those made by the international market and have different impacts on the hedged instrument and the hedging instruments.",

The growth of the portfolio at this stage is mainly due to the newly granted loans and customers with good payment behavior returning to stage 1 after the pandemic. The increase in the loss allowance is consistent with the coverage ratio of the portfolio growth.\n\n## Stage 2 (Lifetime expected credit losses)\n\nThe exposure in stage 2 decreased by COP 643,314 and the loss allowance decreased by COP 178,706. The decrease in exposure is mainly due to the improvement of specific customers migrating from stage 2 to stage 1 in the agribusiness sector for a value of COP 658,486, customers who are no longer being monitored for medium risk due to better performance, and customers who have completed their COVID-19 reliefs and have good payment behavior (transfer to stage 1). The decrease in the loss allowance in this stage is mainly due to the migration of customers between stages and the net between the release and constitution of provision made on debtors who have completed their financial reliefs.\n\n## Stage 3 (Lifetime expected credit losses)\n\nThe exposure in stage 3 decreased by COP 1,426,253, and the loss allowance decreased by COP 627,111. The variation in exposure is mainly due to a higher  level  of  charge-offs  (customers  leaving  the  balance)  and  customers  who  are  no  longer  being  monitored  for  high  risk  due  to  better  sectoral performance this year. The decrease in loss allowance is consistent with the movements of the portfolio in this stage.\n\n## NOTE 7. LEASES\n\n## 7.1. Lessor\n\n## Finance leases\n\nThe Bank has entered into lease agreements as the lessor. These lease arrangements involve machinery and equipment, computer equipment, vehicles and furniture and fixtures, and their terms range between one and ten years, as follows:",

Additionally,  the  Bank recognized other services related to the lease for COP 541,436 and COP 375,275, respectively.\n\n## Risk management associated with leases\n\nGrupo Bancolombia, in those companies that offer leasing services, performing as a lessor, has a comprehensive risk assessment model for those assets classified as property and equipment. For the risk arising from non-payment of the lease fee by the lessee, the model includes policies and guidelines in the  lease  contracts  origination,  in  which  the  payment  capacity  of  the  lessee  is  assessed  through  financial  analysis,  evaluation  of  historical  payment behavior and risk level.\n\nFor active  risk,  the  model  includes  the  impairment  test  that  is  carried  out  annually  for  this  type  of  asset,  where  external  (economic  and  legal)  and internal (insurance, maintenance, sales) indicators that impact the assets and their environment are evaluated. The lessor carries out a detailed review process at the time of the return of the asset by the lessees to guarantee its operating conditions and determine the required adjustments.\n\nAdditionally, the bank relies on the participation of experts, separate from the salesforce, who permanently monitor the conditions of the asset preowned market, back testing the consistency of the variables involved in estimating the residual value (commercial value minus selling costs) and the periodic review  of  the  model  results  with  key  executives.  All  of  the  above,  complemented  by  agreements  with  suppliers  for  the  exchange  of  information, knowledge and in some cases, structuring the residual risk mitigation mechanisms.",

These costs were the result of the analysis design and implementation of the transformation projects, the most representative of which were: Core Nequi Renewal (Colombia), evolution of digital channels (online banking for individuals and companies) and core transformation in Banistmo S.A. collections. The expenses were recorded mainly as fees in the line 'Other administrative and general expenses' of the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Intangibles which did not meet the criteria to be recognized as assets\n\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Bank recognized in the statement of income the amount of COP 49,079, COP 10,046 and COP 86,168, respectively, related to expenditures which were not recognized as intangible assets. These expenses were not recorded as assets due to the lack of characterists to be reliably identifiable, and those assets do not support critical processes to be recognized as intangible assets.",

Recoverable amount is determined by management by reference to market value, if available, by pricing models, or with the assistance of a valuation specialist. Determination of recoverable amount requires management  to  make  assumptions  and  use  estimates  to  forecast  cash  flow  for  periods  that  are  beyond  the  normal  requirements  of  management reporting;  the  assessment  of  the  appropriate  discount  rate;  estimation  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  cash-generation  units;  and  the  valuation  of  the separable assets of each business whose goodwill is being reviewed.\n\nThe key assumptions used by management in determining the recoverable amount are:\n\n| Operating segment   | Goodwill 2022      | Valuation Methodology   | Key Assumptions                     | Discount Rate (1) (real)   | Growth rate (2) (real)   |\n|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| In millions of COP  | In millions of COP | In millions of COP      | In millions of COP                  | In millions of COP         | In millions of COP       |\n| Banking Panama      | 7,346,484          | Discounted Cash flow    | 5 years plan                        | 10.90 %                    | 5.30 %                   |\n| Banking             |                    |                         |                                     | 20.10 %                    | 3.90 %                   |\n| El Salvador         | 1,356,837          | Discounted Cash flow    | 5 years plan                        | and 16.10 % (3)            |                          |\n| Banking Guatemala   | 1,122,680          | Discounted Cash flow    | 5 years plan                        | 13.00 %                    | 4.90 %                   |\n| Others Segments     | 10,660             | Comparable multiples    | Multiples EV/ Revenue and EV/EBITDA | 38.08 %                    | Does not apply           |\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, the Bank tested the aforementioned goodwill for impairment purposes at the following operating segment levels: Banking Panama, Banking El Salvador and Banking Guatemala. Each operating segment represents a group of cash generating units. Evaluating the goodwill impairment at an operating segment level ensures the alignment with the approach used by the CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments  and  assess  its  performance.  After  the  valuation,  it  was  determined  that  there  is  no  impairment  loss  for  any  of  the  cash-generating  units mentioned above during 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis:\n\nIn order to assess the impact of changes in certain significant inputs such as the discount rate and the growth rate in the operating segments' recoverable amount, the Bank undertook a sensitivity analysis of these inputs through alternative scenarios.",

FAI CALLE 77\n\nOn June 4, 2021, Bancolombia S.A. entered into an agreement with CCLA Colombia S.A.S. for the conditional assignment of the fiduciary rights of the Trust  named  P.A.  FAI  Calle  77,  which  owns  the  Nomad  77  Building  located  in  the  city  of  Bogot\u00e1  (Colombia),  which  is  the  first  project  built  for Multifamily rental housing in Colombia.  Bancolombia S.A. concluded that it has control over the P.A. FAI Calle 77 given that it has exposures, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement in the investee and also has the ability to use its power to affect returns from the rental housing activity, through its  participation  in  executive  committees,  and  has  the  capacity  to  direct  the  activity  that  most  significantly  affects  returns  of  all  business  namely, approval rights over the disposal of the real estate projects.\n\nThe transaction was completed on March 1, 2022, upon Bancolombia S.A. obtaining the registration that qualifies it as a lessor of real estate for urban housing from the 'Secretar\u00eda de Habitat' of Bogota. This registration was the condition to which the transfer of the fiduciary rights were subject. The Bank also obtained control of the P.A. FAI Calle 77 Trust on March 1, 2022, and has an equity interest of 98.00%. This acquisition reflects the Bank's objective to evolve its value proposition based on the current needs of the market, seeking to provide a differential service in rental housing.\n\nThe consideration paid by Bancolombia S.A. was COP 56,968, which consisted of a cash advance of COP 29,025 on June 9, 2021 and settlement of an active financial leasing operation with the sellers for COP 27,943.\n\nThe acquisition of the P.A. FAI Calle 77 Trust was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of IFRS 3. The purchase price was assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired, based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.\n\nThe Bank opted to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree of 2.00% at fair value, which amounted to COP 1,166 at the date of acquisition.\n\nThe estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on information available as of March 1, 2022. The Bank believes that this information provides a reasonable basis for determining fair values:",

FAI  Calle  77  Trust  resulted  in  the  recognition  of  a  gain  from  a  bargain  purchase  of  COP  2,433,  which  was  recognized  in 'Dividends and net income on equity investments' line item of the Consolidated Statement of Income. The amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of the non-controlling interest therein, due to the fact that the price was agreed 9 months before the efective transfer of control of the business, reflecting a valuation of the assets.\n\n## Acquisition-related cost\n\nIn  connection with the acquisition, the Bank incurred costs which are recorded in the \"Other administrative and general expenses\" line item of the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## WOMPI S.A.S. (before 'Vlipco S.A.S.')\n\nOn  November  10,  2021,  Bancolombia  S.A.  entered  into  a  stock  purchase  agreement,  pursuant  to  which  Bancolombia  S.A.  agreed  to  purchase  an additional  47.37%  stake  in  the  capital  stock  of  the  Colombian  company,  Wompi  S.A.S.  Wompi  S.A.S.  provides  technology  services  to  financial companies and qualifies as a business as defined in IFRS 3.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the Bank owned 91,838 shares of Wompi S.A.S. that represented 47.40% of the total capital stock of the company, classified as an investment in joint venture.\n\nThe  transaction  was  completed  on  November  30,  2021,  upon  receipt  of  required  regulatory  approvals  from  the  Superintendencia  of  Industry  and Commerce, and as a result Bancolombia S.A. obtained control of Wompi S.A.S. The consideration paid by Bancolombia S.A. was COP 9,474, in cash.\n\nThe acquisition of Wompi S.A.S. in stages was accounted for under the acquisition method, in accordance with IFRS 3. Accordingly, the Bank has remeasured its previously held equity interest in Wompi S.A.S. at its acquisition-date fair value and recognized the resulting gain or loss and equity method adjustment.",

The goodwill of COP 10,660 is calculated as the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired, and reflects the value expected from the synergies from combining Wompi's technology services with the Bank's financial services, as well as the opportunity to increase its national and international operations in the payments gateway market, that do not qualify for a separate recognition as intangible assets. The goodwill has been allocated to the segment Other Segments.  None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nThe Bank has elected to measure the non-controlling interests of 5.23% in the acquiree at fair value, the amount at the acquisition date was COP 1,047.\n\nFor this acquisition, the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on the information available at November 30, 2021.

The  most  significant measures this norm are outlined below:\n\nThe Corporate Income Tax rate (CIT) continues at 35%; however, the surcharge applicable to financial entities from 2023 to 2027 increased by 5%. This surcharge is applicable when the financial entities have a taxable income equal to, or higher than 120.000 tax units (UVT).\n\nCertain non-taxable incomes, special deductions, exempt incomes, and tax credits will be limited to 3% of the taxpayer's net income before deductions.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2023 onwards, Industry and Trade Tax (ITT) will not be creditable against the Corporate Income Tax. Therefore, ITT only will be eligible as a deduction.\n\nA minimum effective tax rate of 15% was introduced for Colombian corporations. This rate must be calculated by dividing the due tax (with certain adjustments) over the book profits (with certain adjustments).\n\nProfits derived from the sale of shares listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange will be treated as non-taxable income if: i) a single shareholder owns them, and ii) they are not more than 3% of the total outstanding shares listed by the entity in the taxable year.\n\nThe distribution of profits in shares will be taxable for CIT matters.\n\nPayments  falling  into  the  following  categories  i)  social  club  memberships,  ii)  personal  payments  to  shareholders  and  their  relatives,  and  iii)  labor expenses of home support personnel, among others, will not be deductible for CIT purposes.\n\nDonations to research, technological developments, and innovation will not be deductible.\n\n## Dividend tax rate increases as follows:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| Dividend tax           | Rate             |\n|------------------------|------------------|\n| Foreign entities       | From 10% to 20%  |\n| Colombian corporations | From 7,5% to 10% |\n\nCapital gains tax increases from 10% to 15%.\n\nA temporary reduction in penalties and interest of 60% will be applied upon the fulfillment of certain requirements\n\nThe tax determination will be made through electronic invoicing when the taxpayer has not filed their income tax returns.\n\nPenalty for not sending information to the Tax Office is reduced to 7500 tax units (UVT).\n\nIn-kind payments made by an entity to third parties for the acquisition of goods or provision of services will be deemed as taxable income for the entity's employees, their spouses, their relatives, and any other person with the title of the beneficiary of the payment.",

In the case of Colombian companies, dividends will be subject to the application of Articles 48 and 49 of the Tax  Statute  and  consequently  will  be  subject  to  withholding  at  source  at  the  established  rates,  in  accordance  with  the  tax  characteristics  of  each shareholder.\n\n## 12.8.2   Dividends received from Subsidiary Companies\n\nConsidering the historical tax status of the dividends received by the Bank from its affiliates and national subsidiaries, it is expected that in the future dividends will be received on the basis of non-income tax.  They will not be subject to withholding tax, taking into account that the Bank, its affiliates and national subsidiaries belong to the same business group.\n\n## 12.9      Tax contingent liabilities and assets\n\nIn the determination of the effective current and deferred taxes subject to review by the tax authority, the relevant regulations have been applied in accordance with the interpretations made by the Group Bancolombia.\n\nIn Colombia due to the complexity of the tax system, ongoing amendments to the tax regulations, accounting changes with implications on tax bases and  in  general  the  legal  instability  of  the  country,  the  tax  authority  may  at  any  time  have  different  criteria  than  that  of  the  Bancolombia  Group. Consequently, a dispute or inspection by the tax authority on a tax treatment may affect the Group Bancolombia accounting of assets or liabilities for deferred or current taxes, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12. However, based on the criteria established in the interpretation of IFRIC 23, the Bancolombia Group did not recognize uncertain tax positions in its financial statements.\n\n## NOTE 13.

The recognition of liabilities related to post-employment and longterm employee benefit plans is based on actuarial computations which involve judgments and assumptions made by management (with the assistance of external actuaries) related to the future macroeconomic and employee demographic factors, among others, which will not necessarily coincide with the future outcome of such factors.\n\n## Post-employment benefits\n\n## 19.1 Defined benefit pension plan\n\n## Colombia\n\nUnder  Colombian  law,  employee  pension  obligations  are  managed  as  a  defined  contribution  plan  since  1990.  The  Bank's  legal  retirement  benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 relates to retired employees who rendered services to the Bank before the current regulations took effect. Under this unfunded plan, benefits are based on length of service and level of compensation. As of December 31, 2022, 522 participants were covered by this plan, and as of December 31,  2021, 555 participants.\n\nFor purposes of the projected assessment of the pension plan obligation, in the absence of an extensive market for high-quality corporate debt, the sovereign bond curve of the Colombian government is used, with maturity similar to the residual life of the obligation of the projected benefit. The net cost of pensions is accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Income as 'salaries and employee benefits', and includes the interest costs and cost of current service.\n\n| Defined benefit pension plan                       | 2022     | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| In millions of COP                                 |          |          |\n| Present value of the obligation as of January 1    | 110,018  | 127,132  |\n| Interest cost                                      | 9,459    | 7,011    |\n| Benefits paid                                      | (11,439) | (11,545) |\n| Net actuarial (gain) due to changes in assumptions | (11,321) | (7,459)  |\n| Net actuarial (gain) due to plan experience        | (1,636)  | (5,121)  |\n| Defined obligation, unfunded as of December 31     | 95,081   | 110,018  |\n\n## Panama\n\nThe Chase Manhattan Bank Corporation, N.A.

This benefit accumulates and is paid to the employees upon their termination or retirement from the Bank, calculated based on the employees' last salary base; however, employees may request advances against this benefit at any time. In 1990, the Colombian government revised its labor regulations for new employees to permit companies, subject to the approval of the employees, to transfer this severance obligation annually to private pension funds (this scheme of employee benefits is known as the current severance obligation).\n\nAs of December 2022 and 2021, 152 and 204 participants, respectively, were covered by this plan.\n\nThe balances recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are listed below:\n\n| Severance obligation                                      | 2022               | 2021               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| In millions of COP                                        | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| Present value of the obligation as of January 1           | 18,429             | 22,228             |\n| Current cost of service                                   | 409                | 531                |\n| Interest cost                                             | 1,250              | 1,149              |\n| Benefits paid                                             | (5,113)            | (6,678)            |\n| Net actuarial loss / (gain) due to changes in assumptions | 1,806              | (83)               |\n| Net actuarial (gain) / loss due to plan experience        | (1,335)            | 1,282              |\n| Defined obligation, unfunded as of December 31            | 15,446             | 18,429             |\n| Current severance regimen (1)                             | 73,475             | 95,331             |\n| Total                                                     | 88,921             | 113,760            |\n\n## 19.3 Retirement Pension Premium Plan and Executive Pension Plan Premium\n\n## Colombia\n\nUnder Colombian labor regulations, employers and employees are entitled to negotiate private agreements.

The resources of the asset plan that backed this benefit were transferred to the accounts of the beneficiaries in the private pension fund, subject to the permanence of the employment relationship.\n\nThe plan assets' fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follow:\n\n| Bancolombia's Plan assets                               | 2022               | 2021               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| In millions of COP                                      | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| Fair value of assets as of January 1                    | 30,121             | 25,211             |\n| Employee contributions                                  | 6,614              | 2,500              |\n| Interest income on plan assets                          | 2,329              | 1,538              |\n| Return on plan assets greater/(less) than discount rate | (4,245)            | 872                |\n| Benefits paid                                           | (34,819)           | -                  |\n| Fair value assets at the end of the year                | -                  | 30,121             |",

The rate used to discount the obligation of the defined benefit plan to reflect the duration of the labor liabilities as of December 2022 corresponds to the yield of sovereign bonds of each country where the plan is established, either Colombia, Panama, Guatemala and El Salvador, as applicable, since the market transactions of these countries involving corporate bonds of high quality have no high levels of activity. The assumption of the rate of inflation is based on the long term projection of the Central Bank of Colombia, Panama, Guatemala and El Salvador.\n\nThe nature of the risks related to the obligations aforementioned are summarized below:\n\n| Investment risk     | The  present  value  of  the  obligation  for  the  defined  benefits  plan  is calculated using a discount rate determined with reference to high quality sovereign yields of each country.

An increase in the life expectancy of the participants will increase the plan obligation               |\n| Salary risk         | The present value of the obligation of the benefit plan is calculated with reference to the future salaries of the participants. As such, an increase in the participants' wages will increase the obligation of the plan                                                                               |\n\n## Estimated payment of future benefits\n\nThe payments of benefits, which reflect future service rendered, are considered to be paid as follows:\n\n| Years              | Pension Benefits   | Other benefits     |\n|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| 2023               | 15,322             | 81,503             |\n| 2024               | 15,665             | 80,119             |\n| 2025               | 15,944             | 80,725             |\n| 2026               | 16,270             | 93,290             |\n| 2027               | 16,328             | 82,631             |\n| 2028 a 2032        | 80,849             | 440,004            |",

On December 7, 2022, Bancolombia issued an answer to the lawsuit. Bancolombia has not recorded a provision for this matter.\n\n## Constitutional Public Interest Action - Carlos Julio Aguilar and other\n\nIn this proceeding, a constitutional public interest action was filed, in which the plaintiffs allege that due to the restructuring of Departamento del Valle's financial obligations and its Performance Plan, the collective rights of the public administration and the public funds of the Departamento del Valle were breached. According to the Bank's defense arguments, the agreement was made in accordance with the law.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  procedure  is  at  the  evidentiary  stage.  The  contingency  is  deemed  to  be  possible.  Bancolombia  has  not  recorded  a provision for this matter.\n\n## Fiscal Responsibility Proceeding - Contralor\u00eda Departamental de Cundinamarca v. GEHS, Bancolombia and other natural persons\n\nThe development of the Water Treatment Plant PTAR Ch\u00eda I Delicias Sur from Municipio de Ch\u00eda, Colombia, was outlined in a lease agreement signed on September 28, 2015. The price agreed was COP 19,000. The object of the agreement was the financing of the Project, as well as the optimization, design, and construction of the Water Treatment Plant PTAR Ch\u00eda I Delicias Sur.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, Bancolombia had anticipated certain payments to the Supplier of the Project. The Municipio de Ch\u00eda's Mayor Office, has claimed that irregularities have been found during the execution of the Project. Because of these allegations, the Contralor\u00eda de Cundinamarca began a proceeding of Fiscal Responsibility against GEHS Global Environment and Health Solutions de Colombia (Supplier), Guillermo Varela Romero, Rafael Antonio Ballesteros G\u00f3mez, Lu\u00eds Alejandro Prieto Gonz\u00e1lez (Municipio de Ch\u00eda's former Mayor and employees of the municipal administration), and Bancolombia S.A., on the basis of the alleged loss.\n\nBancolombia  has  alleged  in  its  defense,  among  others  arguments,  that  the  Bank  fully  complied  with  its  contractual  obligations  and  that  it  is  not responsible for the loss of the Municipality's resources. There is precedent form the Consejo de Estado and Corte Suprema de Justicia de Colombia supporting Bancolombia's position.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the judgment is in the final pleadings stage. Likelihood of the plaintiff succeeding is now considered remote. Bancolombia has not recorded a provision for this matter.\n\n## Remediation Plan for Santa Elena's property\n\nIn 1987, Bancolombia (formerly Bank of Colombia) received a property located in Municipio de Cartagena, Colombia from the National Federation of Algodoneros. After the settlement was signed, soil contamination from pesticides and herbicides was found on the property. Bancolombia initiated a civil responsibility judicial procedure against the Federation alleging environmental contamination. On November 13, 2015, the final judgement was issued, and it was decided that the National Federation of Algodoneros was liable for environmental damages and that Bancolombia was not liable.\n\nDespite not being liable for environmental damages, Bancolombia is subject to decontamination requirements with respect to the property. Bancolombia has carried out over the years various activities aimed at containing the environmental impact, as well as the social management of the communities neighboring the lot. These activities include, among others, the confinement of contaminating material, installation of monitoring wells, and execution of plans to reduce contamination levels.\n\nOn December 2022, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales de Colombia (ANLA) approved the extension of the Stage 1 diagnostical studies and the execution of Stage 2 Remediation, Contingencies and Social Support Plans. Although Bancolombia appealed the administrative act issued by the ANLA on the basis of technical issues, the execution stage of the Plan will begin in the first trimester of 2023.",

The action seeks compensation for damages derived from alleged fraud involving six  international transfers for a total USD 1,900, that Inversiones DD&C, who was a client of Banistmo at the time, ordered to be made to a bank account at the BCRG.\n\nThe parties who initiated the action are seeking USD 28,100, in 'dommages mat\u00e9riels' (which are damages for alleged economic loss), as well as additional amounts in 'dommages moraux' (which are damages for alleged non-economic loss, including alleged psychological suffering and moral anguish).\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Banistmo has not yet appeared in the case.  It expects to appear for the first time at a hearing in February 2023, at which it expects to raise a number of arguments challenging the legality of the action and intends to assert that its conduct complied with the transfer instructions ordered by its then client and with all relevant contractual requirements.\n\nBased on its current assessment of the claims, Banistmo has not recorded a provision for this matter.\n\n## BANCO AGR\u00cdCOLA\n\n## Direcci\u00f3n General de Impuestos Internos of El Salvador\n\nThe authority on taxes of El Salvador, in accordance with the resolution of October 2018, determined that Banco Agr\u00edcola failed to pay and declare income taxes related to fiscal year 2014 for a total of USD 11,116 and related penalties.\n\nIn 2021, the appeal presented by Banco Agr\u00edcola was decided. The Tribunal de Apelaciones de los Impuestos Internos y Aduanas (TAII) modified the Resolution issued by DGII, adjusted the rental tax to USD 6,341  and  revoked  the  sanction.  Banco  Agr\u00edcola  filed  a  lawsuit  before  the  Contentious Administrative Tribunal seeking to overrule DGII's and TAII's previous decisions in relation to the tax's payment. As of December 31, 2022, the initial hearing date is pending.\n\nThe contingency is deemed to be remote.  Banco Agr\u00edcola has not recorded a provision for this matter.",

According to the lawsuit, Cordal was the owner of a current  account  in  Arrendadora  Financiera  (formerly  Banco  Capital  S.A.)  and  it  alleged  that  it's  funds  were  irregularly  transferred  to  third  parties. Arrendadora Financiera alleges Cordal's account was liquidated before the acquisition of Banco Capital S.A. and, therefore, no funds were transferred.\n\nThe proceeding is at the evidentiary stage. The contingency is deemed to be remote. Arrendadora Financiera has not recorded a provision for this matter. A former employee of the plaintiff was convicted of aggravated theft in connection with the facts of this lawsuit.\n\n## BANCO AGROMERCANTIL\n\n## Delicarnes\n\nDelicarnes  S.A.  acquired  a  mortgage  credit  with  Banco  Agromercantil  and  breached  its  obligation  to  pay,  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  terms. Therefore, Banco Agromercantil began a payment procedure against the company. Delicarnes counterclaimed and filed a lawsuit seeking damage and compensation for USD 69,956, alleging that there was no breach of any obligation and that Banco Agromercantil should not have filed the lawsuit against them.\n\nThe proceeding concluded, with a ruling in favor of Banco Agromercantil. The judgment is final.\n\n## Bapa Holdings Corp.\n\nOn September 20, 2022, a lawsuit against Banco Agromercantil was filed by Bapa Holdings Corp. The plaintiff alleges it invested USD 7,000, through a participation agreement with North Shore Development Company (NDSC) for the development of a housing project that was going to be built in a property,  which  was  security  for  a  loan  given  by  Banco  Agromercantil  to  NDSC,  located  in  Roatan  Island,  Honduras.  Bapa  claims  BAM  caused damages due to its failure to provide information about NDSC's financial situation and going through with the sale of the credit.\n\nOn October 24, 2022, BAM responded to the claim and filed exceptions alleging that it has no commercial relationship with Bapa, and the statute of limitations deadline expired\n\nThe contingency is deemed to be remote. Banco Agromercantil has not recorded a provision for this matter.\n\n## Superintendencia de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria (SAT)\n\nThe Superintendencia de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria (SAT) de Guatemala ordered a tax adjustment in the fiscal year 2014 of Banco Agromercantil's rental tax declaration, duly paid by BAM, for a value of USD 13,583, (including tax and sanction).  Banco Agromercantil initiated legal proceedings against the decision adopted by de SAT, pleading that the tax discounts applied by the Bank were appropriate.\n\nThe judgment is pending. The contingency is deemed to be remote. Banco Agromercantil has not recorded a provision for this matter.",

Under the Colombian Commercial Code, after payment of income taxes  and  appropriation  of  legal  and  other  reserves,  and  after  setting  off  losses  from  prior  fiscal  years,  Bancolombia  must  distribute  to  its stockholders at least 50% of its annual net income or 70% of its annual net income if the total amount of reserves exceeds its outstanding capital, unless such minimum percentages are waived by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least 78% of the shares present at the stockholders' meeting. Such dividend distribution must be made to all stockholders, in cash or in issued stock of Bancolombia, as may be determined by the stockholders, and within a year from the date of the annual general ordinary stockholders' meeting in which the dividend was declared.\n\nThe payment of dividends must be made in cash during the year following the applicable date for the annual general ordinary stockholders' meeting. If the payment is made in the Bank's own equity securities instead of cash, that must be approved by 80% of the outstanding common shareholders and 80% of the outstanding preferred shares.\n\nThe annual net profits of Bancolombia must be applied as follows: (i) first, an amount equal to 10% of Bancolombia's net profits to a legal reserve until such reserve is equal to at least 50% of the Bank's paid-in capital; (ii) second, to the payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares; and (iii) third, as may be determined in the ordinary annual general ordinary stockholders' meeting by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Bancolombia S.A., considering the current capital levels and the results of operations and business of the Bancolombia Group in 2022, and recommended to management to review the dividend policy to increase the percentage of profit distribution to be proposed to shareholders at the next ordinary general shareholders' meeting.\n\n|   Dividends declared with respect to net income earned in: | Cash dividends per share (Stated in COP)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                                       2022 | 3,536                                      |\n|                                                       2021 | 3,120                                      |\n|                                                       2020 | 260                                        |\n|                                                       2019 | 1,638                                      |\n|                                                       2018 | 1,092                                      |\n\n## Common shares\n\nThe holders of common shares are entitled to vote on any matter subject to approval at an annual general ordinary stockholders' meeting.

The Bank does not have a significant exposure to sub-prime securities. The asset-backed securities are denominated in local market TIPS and  accounted  for  as  investment  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  and  residual  rights  accounted  for  as  investment  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income. These asset-backed securities have different maturities and are generally classified by credit ratings. The Bank does not expect significant changes in those ratings. Also, the Bank retains beneficial interests in the form of servicing fees on the securitized mortgages.\n\n## The Bank's managed funds\n\nThe Bank's managed funds are derived from the following type of business lines: related trusts, mutual funds sold to individuals, corporate trusts, escrow accounts, private equity funds, and delegated tailor-made mandates from third parties. Generally, the revenues correspond to the fees received from the management of resources that are invested in several instruments and management of properties and premises related to real estate projects in progress.\n\nLikewise, the Bank receives fees for management assets pledged as collateral for clients' commitments and obligations, and fees from management of resources of government agencies and entities.\n\nOn the other hand, there is not an additional exposure to loss, such as funding commitments with regards to the Bank's involvement with those entities.",

In the financial advisory contract, a best efforts clause is included.\n\nThe  promises  given  to  the  customers  are  established  in  the  contracts  independently  and  explicitly.  The  services provided  by  the  Invesment  Bank  are  not  interrelated  between  the  contracts,  correspond  to  the  independent  advice agreed  and  do  not  include  additional  services  in  the  commission  agreed  with  the  customer.  The  advisory  services offered  in  each  one  of  the  contracts  are  identifiable  separately  from  the  other  performance  commitments  that  the Investment  Bank  may  have  with  the  customers.  The  Investment  Bank  does  not  have  a  standard  contract  for  the provision of advisory services, given than each contract is tailored to the customer's needs.\n\nThe transaction price is defined at the start of the contract and is assigned to each service provided independently. The price contains a fixed and a variable portion which is provided in the contracts. The variation depends on the placement amount for the case of a financial structuring contract and coordination of the issuance and conditions of the same. In these operations Banca de Inversion Bancolombia provides advice to the customers and the price shall depend at times on  the  success  and  amount  of  the  operation.  In  the  contracts  subject  to  evaluation  there  are  no  incremental  costs associated with the satisfaction of the commitments of the Bank with the customers provided for.\n\nIn  the  contracts  signed  with  the  customers,  a  penalty  clause  is  established  in  case  of  a  customer  withdrawing  from continuing with the provision of the services established in the commercial offer. The penalty shall be recognized in the financial  statements  once  the  Investment  Bank  is  notified  on  the  withdrawal  under  the  concept  of  charges  for  early termination of the contract.\n\nThe  Bank  presents  the  information  on  revenue  from  contracts  with  customers  in  accordance  with  its  operating  segments  defined  earlier  in  Note  3 Operating Segments for each of the principal services offered.\n\nThe following table shows the balances categorized by nature and by segment of revenue from ordinary activities from contracts with customers, for further information about composition of Bank' segments see Note 3 Operating segments:\n\n## As of December 31, 2022\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                          | Banking Colombia   | Banking Panama     | Banking El Salvador   | Banking Guatemala   | Trust              | Investment Banking   | Brokerage          | International Banking   | All Other Segments   | Total              |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Revenue from contracts with customers                    | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP    | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP | In millions of COP      | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP |\n| Fees and Commissions                                     |                    |                    |                       |                     |                    |                      |                    |                         |                      |                    |\n| Credit and debit card fees and commercial estabilshments | 2,248,727          | 232,637            | 216,977               | 79,551              | -

The  price  that  the  Bank determines for each performance obligation is done by defining the cost of each service, related tax and associated risks to the operation and inherent to the transaction plus the margin expected to be received in each one of the services, taking as references the market prices and conditions, as well as the segmentation of the customer.\n\nIn the transactions evaluated in the contracts, changes in the price of the transaction are not identified.\n\n## Contract assets with customers\n\nThe Bank receives payments from customers based on the provision of the service, in accordance to that established in the contracts. When the Bank incurs costs for providing the service prior to the invoicing, and if these are directly related with a contract, they improve the resources of the entity and are expected to recuperate, these costs correspond to a contract asset. Currently, the Group does not have assets related to contracts with customers.\n\nAs a practical expedient, the Bank recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when the amortization period of the asset is one year or less.\n\n## Contract liabilities with customers\n\nThe contract liabilities constitute the obligation of the Bank to transfer the services to a customer, for which the Group has received a payment on the part of the final customer or if the amount is due before the execution of the contract. They also include deferred income related to services that shall be delivered or provided in the future, which will be invoiced to the customer in advance, but which are still not due.\n\nThe contract liabilities increased COP 1,831 in 2022. The changes in contract liabilities are due to performance circumscribed in the contract.",

EARNING PER SHARE ('EPS')\n\nBasic EPS is calculated by reducing the income from continuing operations by the amount of dividends declared in the current period for each class of stock and by the contractual amount of dividends that must be paid for the current period, considering the allocation of remaining earnings to common stock and participating securities to the extent that each security may share in earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. EPS is determined by dividing the total earnings allocated to each security by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\n\nDiluted EPS assumes the issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The Bank had no dilutive potential common shares as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.",

In  accordance  with  IFRS  the  financial  instruments  are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market is a market in which  transactions  for  the  asset  or  liability  being  measured  take  place  with  sufficient  frequency  and  volume  to  provide  pricing  information  on  an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. Level 2 generally includes: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 : Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets  and  liabilities  include  financial  instruments  whose  value  is  determined  using  pricing  models,  discounted  cash  flow  methodologies,  or  similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally  includes  certain  retained  residual  interests  in  securitizations,  asset-backed  securities  (ABS)  and  highly  structured  or  long-term  derivative contracts where independent pricing information was not able to be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.",

All methodologies and procedures developed by the pricing services provider are supervised by the SFC, which has not objected to them.\n\nOn a daily basis, the back-office Service Valuation Officer (SVO) verifies the valuation of investments, and the Credit and Financial Risk Manager area reports the results of the portfolio's valuation.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\n## Assets and liabilities\n\n## a. Debt instruments\n\nThe  Bank  assigns  prices  to  those  debt  investments,  using  the  prices  provided  by  the  official  pricing  services  provider  (Precia)  and  assigns  the appropriate  level  according  to  the  procedure  described  above.  For  securities  not  traded  or  over-the-counter  such  as  certain  bonds  issued  by  other financial  institutions,  the  Bank  generally  determines  fair  value  utilizing  internal  valuation  and  standard  techniques.  These  techniques  include determination  of  expected  future  cash  flows  which  are  discounted  using  curves  of  the  applicable  currencies  and  the  Colombian  consumer  price index (interest rate in this case), modified by the credit risk and liquidity risk. The interest rate is generally computed using observable market data and reference  yield  curves  derived  from  quoted  interest  in  appropriate  time  bandings,  which  match  the  timings  of  the  cash  flows  and  maturities  of  the instruments.\n\n## b. Equity securities\n\nThe Bank performs the market price valuation of its investments in variable income using the prices provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia)  and  classifies  those  investments  according  to  the  procedure  described  above  (Hierarchy  of  fair  value  section).  Likewise,  the  fair  value  of unlisted equity securities is based on an assessment of each individual investment using methodologies that include publicly-traded comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, and if necessary considered, are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Interests in investment funds, trusts and collective portfolios are valued using the investment unit value determined by the fund management company. For investment funds where the underlying assets are investment properties, the investment unit value depends on the investment properties value, determined as described below in 'i. Investment property'.\n\n## c. Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Bank holds positions in standardized derivatives, such as futures over local stocks, and over the representative exchange rate. These instruments are evaluated according to the information provided by Precia, which perfectly matches the information provided by the Central Counterparty Clearing House - CCP.\n\nAdditionally,  the  Bank  holds  positions  in  Over  The  Counter  (OTC)  derivatives,  which  in  the  absence  of  prices,  are  valued  using  the  inputs  and methodologies provided by the pricing services provider.\n\nThe key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, the spot price of the underlying volatility, credit curves and correlation of such inputs.\n\n## d. Credit valuation adjustment\n\nThe Bank measures the effects of the credit risk of its counterparties and its own creditworthiness in determining fair value of the swap, option and forward derivatives.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nCounterparty credit-risk adjustments are applied to derivatives when the Bank's position is a derivative asset and the Bank's credit risk is incorporated when the position is a derivative liability. The Bank attempts to mitigate credit risk to third parties which are international banks by entering into master netting  agreements. The agreements allow to offset or bring net amounts that are liabilities, derivates from transactions carried out by the different agreements. Master netting agreements take different forms and may allow payments to be made under a variety of other master agreements or other negotiation agreements between the same parties; some may have a monthly basis and others only apply at the time the agreements are terminated.\n\nWhen assessing the impact of credit exposure, only the net counterparty exposure is considered at risk, due to the offsetting of certain same-counterparty positions and the application of cash and other collateral.\n\nThe  Bank  generally  calculates  the  asset's  credit  risk  adjustment  for  derivatives  transacted  with  international  financial  institutions  by  incorporating indicative credit related pricing that is generally observable in the market (Credit Default Swaps, 'CDS'). The credit-risk adjustment for derivatives transacted  with  non-public  counterparties  is  calculated  by  incorporating  unobservable  credit  data  derived  from  internal  credit  qualifications  to  the financial institutions and corporate companies located in Colombia. The Bank also considers its own creditworthiness when determining the fair value of  an  instrument,  including  OTC  derivative  instruments  if  the  Bank  believes  market  participants  would  take  that  into  account  when  transacting  the respective  instrument.  The  approach  to  measuring  the  impact  of  the  Bank's  credit  risk  on  an  instrument  transacted  with  international  financial institutions is done using the asset swap curve calculated for subordinated bonds issued by the Bank in foreign currency. For derivatives transacted with local financial institutions, the Bank calculates the credit risk adjustment by incorporating credit risk data provided by rating agencies and released in the Colombian financial market.\n\n## e. Impaired loans measured at fair value\n\nThe Bank measured certain impaired loans based on the fair value of the associated collateral less costs to sell. The fair values were determined as follows using external and internal valuation techniques or third party experts, depending on the type of underlying asset.\n\nFor vehicles under leasing arrangements, the Bank uses an internal valuation model based on price curves for each type of vehicle. Such curves show the expected price of the vehicle at different points in time based on the initial price and projection of economic variables such as inflation, devaluation and customs. The prices modelled in the curves are compared every six months with market information for the same or similar vehicles and in the case of significant deviation; the curve is adjusted to reflect the market conditions.\n\nOther vehicles are measured using matrix pricing from a third party. This matrix is used by most of the market participants and is updated monthly. The matrix is developed from values provided by several price providers for identical or similar vehicles and considers brand, characteristics of the vehicles, and manufacturing date among other variables to determine the prices.\n\nFor real estate assets, a third-party qualified appraiser is used. The methodologies vary depending on the date of the last appraisal available for the property (the appraisal is estimated based on either of three approaches: cost, sales comparison and income approach, and is required every three years). When the property has been valued in the last 12 months and the market conditions have not shown significant changes, the most recent valuation is considered the fair value of the property.\n\nFor all other cases (for example, appraisals older than 12 months) the value of the property is updated by adjusting the value in the last appraisal for weighted factors such as location, type and characteristics of the property, size, structural conditions and the expected sales prices, among others. The factors are determined based on current market information gathered from several external real estate specialists.",

Assets held for sale measured at fair value less cost of sale\n\nThe Bank measures certain impaired foreclosed assets and premises and equipment held for sale based on fair value less costs to sell. The fair values were determined using external and internal valuation techniques, depending on the type of underlying asset. Those assets are comprised mainly of real estate properties for which the appraisal is conducted by experts considering factors such as the location, type and characteristics of the property, size, physical conditions and expected selling costs, among others. Likewise, in some cases the fair value is estimated considering comparable prices or promises of sale and offering prices from auctions process.\n\n## g. Mortgage-backed securities ('TIPS') and Asset-Backed securities\n\nThe Bank invests in asset-backed securities for which underlying assets are mortgages and earnings under contracts issued by financial institutions and corporations, respectively. The Bank does not have a significant exposure to sub-prime securities. The asset-backed securities are denominated in local market TIPS and are classified as fair value through profit or loss. These asset-backed securities have different maturities and are generally classified by credit ratings.\n\nTIPS are part of the Bank portfolio and its fair value is measured with published price by the official pricing services provider. These securities are leveled by margin and are assigned level 2 or 3 based on the Precia information.\n\nResidual  TIPS  have  their  fair  value  measured  using  the  discounted  flow  method,  taking  into  account  the  amortization  tables  of  the  Titularizadora Colombiana, the betas in COP and UVR of Precia (used to construct the curves) and the margins; when they are residual TIPS of subordinated issues, a liquidity premium is applied. These securities are assigned level 3.\n\n## h. Investments in associates measured at fair value\n\nThe Bank recognizes its investments in P.A Viva Malls and P.A Distrito Vera as an associate at fair value. The estimated amount is provided by the fund manager as the variation of the units according to the units owned by the FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia. The associate's assets are comprised of investment properties which are measured using the following techniques: comparable prices, discounted cash flows, replacement cost and direct capitalization. For further information about techniques methodologies and inputs used by the external party see 'Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements'.\n\n## i. Investment property\n\nThe  Bank's  investment  property  is  valued  by  external  experts,  who  use  valuation  techniques  based  on  comparable  prices,  direct  capitalization, discounted cash flows and replacement costs.",

The financial instruments below are not measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis:\n\n## Short-term financial instruments\n\nShort-term financial instruments are valued at their carrying amounts included in the consolidated statement of financial position, which are reasonable estimates of fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity of the instruments. This approach was used for cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable, customers' acceptances, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest payable and bank acceptances outstanding.\n\n## Deposits from customers\n\nThe fair value of time deposits was estimated based on the discounted value of cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Fair value of deposits with no contractual maturities represents the amount payable on demand as of the statement of financial position date.\n\n## Interbank deposits and repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowings\n\nShort-term interbank borrowings and repurchase agreements have been valued at their carrying amounts because of their relatively short-term nature. Long-term and domestic development bank borrowings have also been valued at their carrying amount because they bear interest at variable rates.\n\n## Borrowings from other financial institutions\n\nThe fair value of borrowings from other financial institutions were determined using discounted cash flow models. The cash flows projection of capital and interest  was  made  according  to  the  contractual  terms,  considering  capital  amortization  and  interest  bearing.  Subsequently,  the  cash  flows  were discounted using reference curves formed by the weighted average of the Bank's deposit rates.\n\n## Debt instruments in issue\n\nThe fair value of debt instruments in issue, comprised of bonds issued by Bancolombia S.A. and its subsidiaries, was estimated substantially based on quoted market prices. The fair value of certain bonds which do not have a public trading market, were determined based on the discounted value of cash flows using the rates currently offered for bonds of similar remaining maturities and the Bank's creditworthiness.\n\n## Preferred shares\n\nIn  the  valuation  of  the  liability  component  of  preferred  shares  related  to  the  minimum  dividend  of  1%  of  the  subscription  price,  the  Bank  uses  the Gordon Model to price the obligation, taking into account its own credit risk, which is measured using the market spread based on observable inputs such as quoted prices of sovereign debt. The Gordon Model is commonly used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock based on a future series of dividends that are estimated by the Bank and growth at a constant rate considering the Bank's own perspectives of the payout ratio.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nEstimating the fair value of loans and advances to customers is considered an area of considerable uncertainty as there is no observable market. The loan portfolio is stratified into tranches and loans segments suchs as commercial, consumer, small business loans, mortgage and leasing. The fair value of loans and advances to customers and financial institutions is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, considering each credit's principal and interest projected cash flows to the prepayment date. The projected cash flows are discounted using reference curves according to the type of loan and its maturity date.",

Changing one or more of the inputs to the valuation models to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would change the fair values and therefore a valuation adjustment would be recognized in profit or loss. Favorable and unfavorable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable input as described in the table below.\n\nThe following table sets forth information about significant unobservable inputs related to the Bank's material categories of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and the sensitivity of these fair values to reasonably possible alternative assumptions.",

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\n## Approval of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on April 3, 2023.\n\nAcquisition PA Nomad Central.\n\nOn february 1, 2023 Bancolombia acquired 98% stake and obtained the control of Patrimonio Aut\u00f3nomo Nomad Central through the assignment of trust rights for which the entity was classified as a subsidiary as of that date. The value of the acquisition was stipulated at COP 47,000.\n\n## DD&C, Carlos P\u00e9rez Leal and Others\n\nIn respect of the matter described under the subheading 'DD&C, Carlos P\u00e9rez Leal and Others' in Note 21 'Provisions and Contingent Liabilities' to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Banistmo appeared for the first time at a hearing in February 2023, at which it raised a number of arguments challenging the legality of the plaintiffs' claims.  The Tribunal scheduled a subsequent hearing on the merits to be held in April 2023, at which Banistmo intends to assert that the allegations are meritless and that its conduct complied with the transfer instructions ordered by its then client and with all relevant  contractual  and  regulatory  requirements.  Following  these  recent  developments  and  further  analysis,  the  Company  considers  a  contingency related to these claims as possible. However, the Company does not consider it reasonably likely that any contingency will exceed the amount of any actual economic losses of the plaintiffs regarding the circumstances alleged in the complaint, which amount is not likely to have a material effect on the Company.",

The SFC issued the External Circular Letter 018 as of September 2021,  with  guidelines  for  the  definition  of  the  risk  appetite  framework  and  establishes  a  system  that  integrates  the  management  of  credit,  market, liquidity, operational, counterparty, guarantee, insurance and country risks through the creation of Chapter XXXI \"Integral Risk Management System (SIAR)\" in the Basic Accounting and Financial Circular. This system provides for a comprehensive view of the risks to which an entity is exposed and is  in  alingment  with  international  practices  and  recommendations  made  by  multilateral  organizations  about  the  matter.  In  accordance  with  the requirements  of  the  Circular,  in  December  2021  the  \"Internal  Implementation  Plan\"  was  sent  to  the  SFC,  denoting  the  activities  proposed  for  the compliance and development of the instructions contained therein. The instructions indicated in the Circular will become effective as of June 1, 2023, with the exception of numeral 10 of Part II of Chapter XXXI related to the aggregation of data on risks and reporting, which will become effective no later than December 31, 2023.\n\nTo strengthen comprehensive risk management, the Bank has a three lines of defense model, with a cohesive and coordinated approach, in which its independence is guaranteed. Within the Corporate Governance Framework, the roles of the responsible areas in each line are defined, according to the level  of  responsibility  in  Bancolombia,  in  order  to  guarantee  effective  and  efficient  coordination  among  them  for  risk  management  (in  its  different stages) and internal control.\n\nFirst  line:  The  owner  of  risks  and  its  management,  focused  on  self-control.  Performs  the  commercial  and  operational  management  and  the administration of controls; including the implementation of actions that ensure processes compliance for risk management.\n\nSecond  line:  Supports  the  construction  and  monitoring  of  the  controls  from  the  first  line  of  defense;  performs  a  transversal  management  of  risks, assisting  the  areas  of  Bancolombia  in  the  definition  of  mitigation  actions  and  in  the  monitoring  of  the  exposure;  in  addition,  is  responsible  for consolidating the risk information in order to perform the accountability to the governance structures and senior management as appropriate.\n\nSpecifically,  the  Board  of  Directors  reviews  and  approves  the  resources,  structure  and  processes  of  the  Bank  associated  with  risk  management;  in addition, it evaluates, through periodic reports from Management, the levels of exposure to the different risks, their impact and the mitigation strategies, in  accordance  with  the  functions  established  in  the  current  regulation  and  the  Corporate  Governance  Code  regarding  the  risk  management.  For  the development of its supervisory functions, the Board has the support of the Risk Committee which is in charge of the approval, monitoring and control of policies, methodologies, tools, guidelines and strategies for the identification, measurement, control and mitigation of risks. According to the corporate guidelines, the Risk Committee consists of members from the Board of Directors.\n\nThe main function of the Corporate Risk Vicepresidency is to design and propose risk management strategies to the Board of Directors and Senior Management, lead its execution and define the Group's risk appetite, in such a way as to ensure",

Credit Risk Management - Loans and Advances\n\nThe first quarter of 2022 experienced  fewer economic and social restrictions in the different markets in which the Bank operates, when compared to previous quarters. This is the result of lower  infection rates and an increase in  COVID-19 vaccination schemes, as well as  the general performance of various local economic sectors. The Bank has developed solutions for customers affected by the pandemic, who were largely subject to financial relief during 2021.\n\nIn 2022,  there was some uncertainty  in Colombia, related to the presidential elections and  possible changes in laws and government  policies. In El Salvador, this uncertainty was related to  concerns about the stability of public finances and the impact of the macroeconomic and political environment. Additionally,  international  developments  associated  with  a  possible  global  recession,  international  conflicts  and  supply  chain  disruptions  were exerienced.  Furthermore, the significant  increase of inflation made it  important to constantly monitor our customers and the economies in which we operate, with the  goal of maintaining proactive credit risk management. This goal is achieved by monitoring and supporting  clients and portfolios, evaluating conditions and  specific requests related to  them, as well as developing  methodologies, tools and models that optimize collection.\n\nThe monitoring of the credit portfolio continues to be a key factor in the identification and application of strategies in different credit cycle stages, beyond what happened due to the pandemic.\n\nRisk management during the credit life cycle is developed through the fulfillment of the policies, procedures and methodologies stipulated in the Credit Risk Administration System, in accordance with the strategy approved by the Board of Directors for monitoring and controlling credit risk.\n\nThe Credit Risk Administration System also contains general criteria to evaluate, classify, measure and mitigate credit risk. In addition, the credit risk department has developed methodologies and manuals that specify the policies and procedures for different products and segments managed by the Bank.\n\nTo maintain credit quality and manage the risk arising from its lending activities, the Bank has established general loan policies, including the following:\n\n- \u25cf Credit exposure limits: Contains guidelines with regards to the establishment of credit exposure limits. This is set as a result of legal requirements and according to the Bank's internal guidelines.\n- \u25cf Origination policies: These policies aim to acquire ample and sufficient knowledge of the characteristics of potential borrowers and to select them properly.  The  risk  level  of  the  individual  and  legal  entities  is  determined  using  rating  and  scoring  models  which  define  cut-off  points  that  are applied in the process of issuing credit. These models use information such as the credit history of the borrower, sociodemographic particularities, the type of business the borrower engages in, the borrower's ability to repay the loan, and information received from the credit risk bureaus. In addition, sectorial and macroeconomic behavior is taken into account. Loan applications, depending on their amount and risk level, are presented for approval at the level of management authority required.",

In addition, this policy is meant to provide the guidelines to analyze the client's status and take the necessary actions in order to mitigate credit risk to which the Bank is exposed. For further information, please see Note 2.\n- \u25cf Monitoring policies: Contains  various  monitoring  procedures,  portfolio  reports  and  policies  for  the  purpose  of  overseeing,  in  an  adequate  and timely manner, the evolution of credit risk. These procedures include a continuous process of classification and reassessment of credit operations and they maintain consistency with the policies implemented for granting loans.\n- \u25cf Portfolio recovery policies: Through these policies, the Bank aims to establish those mechanisms that allow it to anticipate the action to be taken in the event of possible delays and minimize the impact resulting from non-fulfillment of payment or delays by the borrower. Additionally, the aspects established in this policy delimit what the Bank has defined as collection management and that make it possible to obtain information to improve the origination policies and the allowances for loans and advances and lease losses models. The established actions are combined with strategies to adjust to the economy, market and costumer conditions, allowing the Bank to offer alternatives tailored to each case, such as payment deals, foreclosed assets, cession agreements, modifications, restructuring, and so on.\n\nManagement of credit risk is carried out through all the credit life cycle. These processes are defined in the following way:\n\n- \u25cf Origination: Knowing the borrower, payment capacity analysis, payment behavior and credit approval and structure.\n- \u25cf Monitoring: Knowing the borrower's situation during the life of the credit.\n- \u25cf Recovery: Collection management during the different stages of the same credit.\n\nIn order to support the credit origination processes, the Bank develops models, methodologies and analytic techniques based on statistical information or criteria from experts, which differentiate the risk levels of potential borrowers in order to support the decision-making process.\n\nThe Risk Corporate Vice Presidency is in charge of defining and documenting the specific characteristics of the models, methodologies and analytics techniques, as well as the parameters, variables and the cut-off points that are applied in the process of issuing credit, according to market and product conditions, as well as the appetite framework approved by the board of directors. Those models, methodologies and analytic techniques can incorporate different kinds of variables such as social demographic, qualitative issues, internal and external behavior, product parameters, etc. In addition, as defined for regulatory basis, Risk Corporate Vice Presidency performs back testing to these models and methodologies in order to evaluate their effectiveness, reporting their results to the board of directors.\n\nThe Risk Corporate Vice Presidency establishes through internal guidelines the scoring or cut-off points required in the different process of issuing credit.  In  the  same  way,  this  Vice  Presidency  can  adjust  parameters  to  give  a  different  score  considering  relevant  qualitative  and  quantitative information, such as customer's sector, financial indicators, historical payment behavior, etc.\n\nMoreover, on a monthly basis, the entire credit portfolio is rated considering the established internal models for the purpose of evaluating the credit risk of each borrower and constitutes the required allowance for loans and advances and lease losses.\n\nIn addition to the evaluation and qualification of the portfolio, the monthly allowance for loans and advances and lease losses serves to measure the present condition of the portfolio and the methodologies used for its calculation serve as a tool to evaluate risk, be it in a collective or individual manner. Collective evaluation of the portfolio applies the following",

The analysis is based on the projection of the individual client cash flow, parameters such as recovery rates estimated by models  that  include  financial,  behavioral  information,  collaterals  and  qualitative  variables,  which  serve  as  elements  to  measure  risk  and  define allowances for loans, advances and lease losses for each borrower.\n\nAnnual backtesting must be performed on the allowances for loans and advances and lease losses models for the purpose of maintaining suitable hedge levels in accordance with the Bank's risk appetite.\n\nThe Bank is continuously monitoring the concentration of risk groups, as well as carrying out a daily control of the exposure to different economic groups, evaluating the legal limits of indebtedness in order to fulfill the norms established about the concentration limits.\n\nThe Bank performs international references determined by the rankings of external risks that allow the analysis of concentration levels in different geographic areas. On the other hand, at the legal level, the Bank is governed by the concepts and methodologies established by the external norms regarding the construction, administration and control of the concentration of economic groups.\n\nThe following classifications are established for the analysis of concentration:\n\n- \u25cf By country: Based on the country where the loans were originated.\n- \u25cf By sector: According to the sectorial sub-segmentation defined by the Bank based mainly on the code CIIU 1 .\n- \u25cf By categories: According to the portfolio category of each agreement (commercial, financial leases, consumer loans, small business loans and mortgages).\n- \u25cf By economic group: According to the characteristics of economic groups as established by regulations.\n- \u25cf By maturity: According to the remaining term to loan maturity.\n- \u25cf By past due days: This concentration evaluates loans that are more than one month overdue.\n\n1 CIIU: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities.\n\nb.     Credit Quality Analysis - Loans and Financial Leases\n\n## Rating System for Credit Risk Management\n\nThe principal aim of this rating system is to determine the risk profile of the borrower, which is obtained through a rating.\n\nThe rating for corporate loans is assigned principally based on the analysis of the interrelation of both qualitative and quantitative elements that can affect the fulfillment of the financial commitments acquired by a borrower. Information from financial statements, profit and loss statements, historical payment behavior both with the Bank and with other entities, and qualitative information on variables that are not explicit in the financial statements are taken into account, as well as client transactional information such as alternative variables. The rating model is applied at the origination of the loan and is  updated  by  a  central  qualification  office  to  undertake  a  periodical  evaluation  of  the  loan  portfolio.  In  the  case  of  a  retail  customer,  granting  and behavior scoring models are used in order to identify the level of risk associated with the borrower. These models include information such as personal details, financial information, historical behavior, the total number of credit products and external information from credit bureaus.",

These loans include loans denominated in local units or local currency that are guaranteed by a senior mortgage on the property and that are financed with a total repayment term of 5 to 30 years.\n\nThe counterparties in the mortgage portfolio are mainly made up of individuals segmented in homogenous groups, which are formed according to their size, which is calculated by their monthly income.\n\n## \uf0b7 Small Business Loans:\n\nThese are issued for the purpose of encouraging the activities of small business and are subject to the following requirements: (i) their indebtedness with all entities cannot exceed 120 minimum wages (excluding mortgage obligations for housing financing); (ii) the client's total assets, excluding mortgage assets, are less than 500 minimum wages.\n\nThe borrowers in this portfolio are mainly individuals, segmented in homogenous groups, which are formed according to their commercial size, which is calculated by their monthly income.\n\n## Analysis of the behavior and impairment of the loan portfolio and financial lease operations\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Bank's total loan portfolio, valued in Colombian pesos, registered an increase of 22.5% compared to December 2021, driven by  growth mainly of commercial, consumer and mortgage loans in Bancolombia, Banco Agricola's corporate businesses and BAM's consumer loans. Additionally, there was an increase in the USD portfolio due to the Colombian peso devaluation against the U.S. dollar during the analysis period. The 30-day past due loan ratio (consolidated) stood at 3.55% in December 2022 compared to 4.55% in December 2021. This decrease has been driven by the application of strategies throughout the credit cycle, which allowed the implementation of anticipated actions consistent with customer realities, achieving important improvements in the client experience and efficiency in the processes. However, the consumer loan portfolio exerienced a  slight increase in the past-due portfolio resulting from to macroeconomic effects, such as the increase in the IPC (consumer price index) and interest rates.\n\n- \u25cf Commercial loans and financial leases amounted to COP 171,635 billion, which represented an increase of 22.6% compared to 2021. The 30-day past due loan ratio was 2.39% compared to 3.77% as of December 2021.\n- \u25cf Consumer loans amounted to COP 59,588 billion, which represented an increase of 23.2% compared to 2021. The 30-day past due loan ratio was 5.82% compared to 5.63% as of December 2021.\n- \u25cf Mortgage loans  totaled to COP 37,371 billion, which represented an increase of 21.9% compared to 2021. The 30-day past due loan ratio was 4.95% compared to 6.04% as of December 2021.\n- \u25cf Small Business loans ended at COP 1,328 billion, which represented an increase of 3.6% with respect to 2020. The 30-day past due loan ratio was 11.48% compared to 12.85% as of December 2021.\n\nIn order to monitor credit risk associated with clients, the Bank has established regular meetings conducted by the AEC Committee to identify events that  can  lead  to  a  reduction  in  borrowers'  ability  to  pay.  Generally,  clients  with  good  credit  behavior  could  be  included  in  the  watch  list  in  case  of detecting any event that can lead to future financial difficulties to repay their loans; for instance, internal factors such as the economic activity and sector,  financial  weakness,  impacts  of  macroeconomic  conditions,  changes  in  corporate  governance  and  other  situations  that  could  affect  clients' business. The amount and allowance of clients included in the described watch list, as of December 31, 2022 and December 2021 is shown below.",

Collateral is considered in the determination of the allowance for loans and advances and lease losses when it complies with the following conditions:\n\n- \u25cf Its fair value was established according to technical and objective criteria.\n- \u25cf The Bank is granted a preference to obtain the payment of the obligation, becoming an effective legal mechanism over it.\n- \u25cf Its performance is reasonably possible.\n\nThe Bank has defined the criteria for collateral enforceability, which are established according to the classification of the loan portfolio. In addition, the Bank has set guidelines to value collateral and the frequency of such valuations, as well as those guidelines related to the legalization, registry and maintenance of the collateral. Likewise, the Bank has defined the criteria for insurability, custody and the necessary procedures for their cancellation.\n\nThe update of the fair value of mortgages and vehicles collaterals for the loan portfolio is made at least once a year. The methodology used to estimate the fair value of the properties is applied by external and independent entities. Updating the fair value of the vehicles is done through guides and valid values commonly used as reference to set the value of a vehicle. The fair value of real state and vehicles are classified in levels 2 and 3 depending on the observability and significance of the inputs used in the valuation techniques according to the hierarchy established by IFRS 13.\n\nTo  determine  the  suitability  of  appraiser's  selection,  there  are  internal  guidelines  to  be  fulfilled  related  to  independence,  professional  certification, reputation and experience. In a similar way, to validate the appraisal's suitability, the bank has defined guidelines based on current regulations which are related to methodologies, report quality and commercial value.",

The carrying amount of such financial assets is COP 206,871 as at December 31, 2022 and COP 204,268 as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Foreclosed assets and other credit mitigants\n\nAssets received in lieu of payment (foreclosed assets) are recognized on the statement of financial position when current possession of the asset takes place.\n\nForeclosed assets such as immovable and movable property, equity securities and other financial assets, are received based on a commercial valuation, and their net realizable value is given by a specialized team.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, Bancolombia Group recorded non-monetary transactions related to restructured loans and returned assets which were transferred to the balance sheet as assets held for sale that amounted to COP 889,752 and COP 672,586, respectively. Additionally, in 2021, in the liquidation of residual securitization rights for COP 75,664, the Bank received as payment the customer credit portfolio and assets held for sale. These operations were not reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nThe Bank classifies foreclosed assets after acknowledgment of the exchange operation according to the intention of use, as follows:\n\n- \u25cf Non-current assets held for sale.\n- \u25cf Other marketable assets.\n- \u25cf Other non-marketable assets.\n- \u25cf Inventories.\n\nCollateral classified as non-current assets held for sale are those expected to be sold in the following 12 months. When there are market restrictions that do not allow their realization in less than 12 months and this period is extended, retroactive depreciation must be charged to results and the asset value will be reduced by the depreciation value.\n\nForeclosed assets classified as non-current assets held for sale are those expected to be sold in the following 12 months. The non-current assets held for sale that cease to comply with the guidelines of immediately sell, must be classified as 'Other marketable assets' and if it's necessary, their book value would be adjusted.",

Credit Quality Analysis - Other Financial Instruments:\n\nIn order to evaluate the credit quality of a counterparty or issuer (to determine a risk level or profile), the Bank relies on two rating systems: an external one and an internal one, both of which allow to identify a degree of risk differentiated by segment and country and to apply the policies that have been established for issuers or counterparties with different levels of risk, in order to limit the impact on liquidity and/or the income statement of the Bank.\n\nExternal credit rating system is divided by the type of rating applied to each instrument or counterparty; in this way the geographic location, the term and the type of instrument allow the assignment of a rating according to the methodology that each examining agency uses.\n\nInternal credit rating system: The 'ratings or risk profiles' scale is created with a range of levels that go from low exposure to high exposure (this can be  reported  in  numerical  or  alphanumerical  scales),  where  the  rating  model  is  sustained  by  the  implementation  and  analysis  of  qualitative  and quantitative variables at sector level, which according to the relative analysis of each variable, determine credit quality; in this way the internal credit rating system aims to establish adequate margin in decision-making regarding the management of financial instruments.\n\n## Credit Quality Analysis of the Group\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                 | Debt instruments   | Debt instruments   | Equity   | Equity   | Derivatives (1)   | Derivatives (1)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                 | 2022               | 2021               | 2022     | 2021     | 2022              | 2021              |\n| Maximum Exposure to Credit Risk |                    |                    |          |          |                   |                   |\n| Low Risk                        | 21,851,178         | 24,183,394         | 235,664  | 256,916  | 9,119,402         | 1,047,939         |\n| Medium Risk                     | 2,090,039          | 2,730,400          | 19,074   | 33,627   | 14,464            | 38,521            |\n| High Risk                       | 3,476,980          | 1,920,034          | 13,728   | 12,526   | 55,622            | 3,661             |\n| Without Rating                  | 12,984             | -                  | 305,389  | 177,084  | -                 | -                 |\n| Total                           | 27,431,181         | 28,833,828         | 573,855  | 480,153  | 9,189,488         | 1,090,121         |\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  criteria  and  considerations  specified  in  the  internal  rating  allocation  and  external  credit  rating  systems  methodologies,  the following schemes of relation can be established, according to credit quality given to each one of the qualification scales:\n\nLow Risk: All  investment  grade  positions  (from  AAA  to  BBB-),  as  well  as  those  issuers  that  according  to  the  information  available  (financial statements, relevant information, external ratings, CDS, among others) reflect adequate credit quality.\n\nMedium Risk: All  speculative  grade  positions  (from  BB+  to  BB-),  as  well  as  those  issuers  that  according  to  the  available  information  (Financial statements, relevant information, external qualifications, CDS, among others) reflect weaknesses that could affect their financial situation in the medium term.\n\nHigh Risk: All positions of speculative grade (from B+ to D), as well as those issuers that according to the information available (Financial statements, relevant information, external qualifications, CDS, among others) reflect a high probability of default of financial obligations or that already have failed to fulfill them.",

This company acts on behalf of Bancolombia for making international margin calls and providing a better management of the collateral.\n\n3 A  Credit  Support  Annex  (CSA)  provides  credit  protection  by  setting  forth  the  rules  governing  the  mutual  posting  of  collateral.  CSAs  are  used  in documenting  collateral  arrangements  between  two  parties  that  trade  privately  negotiated  (over-the-counter)  derivative  securities.  The  trade  is documented under a standard contract called a master agreement, developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).\n\nCollateral adjustments for margin agreements: The adjustments will be determined by the criteria applied by both the external and internal regulations in effect, and at the same time, mitigation standards are maintained so that the operation fulfills the liquidity and solidity criteria for settlement. Among the main characteristics by product or market, we have:\n\n- \uf02d With respect to the derivative operations, these are carried out daily, with threshold levels of zero for the majority of counterparties, which reduces the exposure to a term that does not exceed 10 days, according to Basel.\n- \uf02d For buy-sell backs, repos and other securities financing transactions, daily monitoring is done in order to establish the need to adjust the collateral in such a way that these are applied in as little time as possible, according to the contracts or market conditions.\n- \uf02d For all international counterparties, margin agreements that limit exposure to the maximum and with a daily adjustment period are celebrated. These  margin  agreements  are  celebrated  under  ISDA  and  GMRA  (Global  Master  Repurchase  Agreement) 4 both  for  OTC  derivatives  and securities financing transactions.\n- \uf02d For every local counterparty, the local framework agreement is signed (agreement developed by the industry) and the mitigating actions to apply in each operation are agreed upon, whether for margin agreements, re-couponing, early termination, among others.\n- \uf02d For  repos,  buy-sell  backs  and  other  securities  financing  transactions,  these  are  agreed  upon  by  organized  markets  that  in  general  implicate complying with haircut or additional collateral rules.\n- \uf02d The central counterparty carries out daily control and monitoring processes in order to comply with the rules imposed by these organizations in such a way that we are always making daily adjustments at the demanded collateral level.\n\n## \u25cf Level of collateral held:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                 | Collateral*   | Collateral*   | Main type of collateral   | Main type of collateral   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                 | 2022          | 2021          | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Maximum Exposure to Credit Risk |               |               |                           |                           |\n| Debt Securities                 | (741,197)     | (1,214,692)   | Government bonds (TES)    | Government bonds (TES)    |\n| Derivatives                     | (138,416)     | (87)          | Government bonds (TES)    | Government bonds (TES)    |\n| Equity                          | -             | -             | Government bonds (TES)    | Government bonds (TES)    |\n| Total                           | (879,613)     | (1,214,779)   | Government bonds (TES)    | Government bonds (TES)    |",

This added to the fear of a possible recession.\n\nThe Colombian stock market closed the year with an annual devaluation of approximately 9%. This is attributed to various risk factors (for example, political tensions due to the implementation of the pension, health, energy reforms and inflation, which increased the price of products and impacted supply behavior) to which the companies in this market were subject.\n\nIn international stock markets, the S&P 500 closed with a fall of 20%, and Euro Stoxx with an approximate decrease of 12%. These markets were impacted by global inflation, which has forced  the central banks to increase interest rates as a measure to contain this phenomenon. As a cosenquence, this increases the fear of a possible recession and affects the financial indicators of the companies in these stock markets.\n\nIn December 2022, the negotiation of the different derivative products increase as a consequence of the use of the hedges of interest rate and exchange rate to prevent risks, due to the uncertainty generated by a possible global recession. The futures about currencies increase the negotiation levels in 20.6% for the close of the fourth quarter of 2022. On the other hand, the exchange rate closed in December at $4,810.20 with an annual devaluation of 20.8%, showing the general uncertainties both internationally and locally.\n\nGiven the fears of a possible economic recession linked to the current inflationary outlook in emerging markets and developed economies, and the rise in interest rates, it is possible that new records will be reached in these macroeconomic variables that will influence a greater devaluation of securities in the short and medium term.However, the central banks' measures are expected to contain these macroeconomic effects that continue to impact the fixed income, equity and derivatives markets.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk refers to the risk of losses in the Bank's treasury book due to changes in equity prices, interest rates, foreign-exchange rates and other indicators whose values are set in a public market. It also refers to the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income and equity economic value of equity as a result of a change in market interest rates.\n\nMarket risk stems from the following activities at the Bank:\n\n- a)        Trading: includes  purchase  -  sale  and  positioning  mainly  in  fixed  income  securities,  equities,  currencies  and  derivatives,  as  well  as  the financial services provided to customers, such as brokerage. Trading instruments are recorded in the treasury book and are managed by the Treasury Division which is also responsible for the aggregated management of exchange rate exposures arising from the banking book and treasury book.\n- b)    Balance sheet management: refers  to  the  assets  and  liabilities  management,  due  to  mismatches  in  maturities  and  repricing  of  them.  The Assets Liability Management Division is responsible for the balance sheet management, preserving the stability of the financial margin and the equity economic value of equity, maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and solvency. Non-trading instruments are recorded in the Bank's banking book (the 'Banking Book'), which includes primarily loans, time deposits, checking accounts and savings accounts.\n\nIn the Bank, the market risks are identified, measured, monitored, controlled and reported in order to support the decision-making process for their mitigation, and to create greater shareholder value added.",

Each country has a local Market and Liquidity Risk Management Office that applies at an individual level the principles of the Bank's Market Risks Management Strategy. The Board of Directors and senior management have formalized the policies, procedures, strategies and rules of action for market risk administration in its 'Market Risk Manual'. This manual defines the roles and responsibilities within each subdivision of the Bank and their interaction to ensure adequate market risk administration.\n\nThe  Bank's  Market  and  Liquidity  Risks  Management  Office,  responsible  for  monitoring  and  permanently  controlling  compliance  with  the  limits established, is set up with clear independence from the trading and businesses units, ensuring enforcement authority. This independent control function is complemented by regular reviews conducted by the Internal Audit.\n\nThe Bank's Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office is responsible for: (a) identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling the market risk inherent in the Bank's businesses: (b) the Bank's exposure under stress scenarios and confirming compliance with the Bank's risk management policies: (c) designing the methodologies for valuation of the market value of certain securities and financial instruments: (d) reporting to senior management and the  Board of Directors any violation of the Bank's risk management policies: (e) reporting to the senior management on a daily basis the levels of market risk associated with the trading instruments recorded in its treasury book, and (f) proposing policies to the Board of Directors and to senior management that ensure the maintenance of predetermined risk levels. The Bank has also implemented an approval process for new products across each of its subdivisions. This process is designed to ensure that each subdivision is prepared to incorporate the new product into its procedures, that every risk is considered before the product is incorporated and that approval is obtained from the Board of Directors before the new product can be sold.\n\nMarket  risks  arising  from  trading  instruments  are  measured  at  the  Bank  using  two  different  Value  at  Risk  (VaR)  methodologies:  the  standard methodology required by the SFC, and the internal methodology of historical simulation. The standard methodology is established by 'Chapter XXI of the  Basic  Accounting Circular', based on the model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee. The internal methodology of weighted historical simulation uses a confidence level of 99%, a holding period of 10 days, and a time frame of one year or at least 250 days from the reference date of the VaR calculation is used, obtained from the reference date of calculating the VaR. The standard methodology is used to report the market risk exposure to the Financial Superintendency and is also used to measure the capital requirements for the Bank, therefore the analysis below is based on information obtained from this model.\n\nThe Bank's VaR limits structure for trading activities, is sufficiently granular to conduct an effective control of the various types of market risk factors on which an exposure is held. It ensures that the market risk is not concentrated in certain asset classes and maximizes the portfolio diversification effect. These limits are defined by companies, products or by risk takers. The majority of the limits are based on the maximum VaR values to which a certain portfolio can be exposed, nevertheless, loss triggers, stop loss and sensitivity warning levels are also set, especially in the derivatives portfolios. The limits are approved by the Board of Directors, and set based on factors such as tolerance for losses, capital resources and market's complexity and volatility. They are monitored daily, and their excesses or violations are reported to the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee.\n\nIn order to capture the tail risks, the Expected Shortfall is estimated, with a confidence interval of 97.5%, which corresponds to the expected value of the losses that are greater than or equal to the VaR.Additional measurements such as stress tests are performed like stress tests are done, to identify extreme unusual  situations  that  could  cause  severe  losses.  Stress  simulations  include  historical  events  and  hypothetical  scenarios.  Back  testing  or  model validation techniques through comparison of predicted and actual loss level are applied on a regular basis to analyze and contrast the accuracy of the VaR calculation methodology in order to confirm its reliability, and make adjustments to the models if necessary.\n\nWithin the control and monitoring processes of market risks, reports are elaborated on a daily and monthly basis. They include an analysis of the most relevant risk measures and allow for monitoring the exposure levels to market risks and to the legal and internal limits established for each one of the levels of the Bank. These reports are taken as an input for the decision-making process in the different Committees and management of the Bank.",

Additionally, triggers are defined for monitoring and controling exposure to the interest rate risk of the banking book positions, which are periodically reported to Senior Management.\n\nThe market risk management of the positions in the banking book is carried out in a decentralized and independent manner in each of the banking entities of the Bank, by the Asset and Liability Management areas, in the Finance Department.\n\n## Market Risk Management\n\nThe following section describes the market risks to which the Bank is exposed and the tools and methodologies used to measure these risks as of December 31, 2022. The Bank faces market risk as a consequence of its lending, trading and investments businesses.\n\nThe Bank uses VaR calculation to limit its exposure to the market risk of its Treasury Book. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR based on its assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  risk  for  Bancolombia.  The  Risks  Committee  is  responsible  for  establishing  the maximum VaR for each company and the Propietary Trading Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR by type of investment. These limits are supervised on a daily basis by the Market Risk Management Office.\n\nFor managing the interest rate risk from banking activities, the Bank analyzes the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities and estimates the impact on the net interest income and the equity economic value of equity. In addition, the foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the banking book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## a.     Measurement of market risk of trading instruments\n\nThe Bank currently measures the treasury book exposure to market risk (including OTC derivatives positions) as well as the foreign exchange rate risk exposure of the banking book, which is provided to the Treasury Division, using a VaR methodology established in accordance with 'Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular', issued by the SFC.\n\nThe VaR methodology established by 'Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular' is based on the model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee, which focuses on the treasury book and excludes investments classified as amortized cost which are not being given as collateral and any other investment that comprises the banking book, such as non-trading positions excluding the currency  the  risk  position  stemming  from  investment  in  affiliated  but  not  consolidated  entities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies.  In  addition,  the methodology  aggregates  all  risks  by  the  use  of  correlations,  through  an  allocation  system  based  on  defined  zones  and  bands,  affected  by  given sensitivity factors.\n\nThe total  market  risk  for  the  Bank  is  calculated  by  the  arithmetical  aggregation  of  the  VaR  calculated  for  each  subsidiary.  The  aggregated  VaR  is reflected in the Bank's Capital Adequacy (Solvency) ratio, in accordance with Decree 2555 de 2010.\n\nFor purposes of VaR calculations, a risk exposure category is any market variable that is able to influence potential changes in the portfolio value. Taking into account a given risk exposure, the VaR model assesses the maximum loss not exceeded, over a given period of time. The fluctuations in the portfolio's VaR depend on volatility, modified duration and positions changes relating to the different instruments that are subject to market risk.\n\nThe  relevant  risk  exposure  categories  for  which  VaR  is  computed  by  the  Bank  according  to  'Chapter  XXI,  Appendix  1  of  the  Basic  Accounting Circular' are: (i) interest rate risks relating to local currency, foreign currency and UVR; (ii) foreign exchange rate risk; (iii) stock price risk; (iv) fund risk. and (v) credit default swaps risk.",

The Bank calculates the interest rate risk for positions in local currency, foreign currency and UVR separately; in accordance with Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular issued by the SFC.\n\nIn the first instance, the interest rate risk exposure is determined by the sensitivity calculation for the net position of each instrument. This sensitivity is calculated as the net present value (NPV) of each instrument, its corresponding modified duration and the estimated variation of interest rates. The possible variations in the interest rates are established by the SFC according to the historical behavior of these variables in the markets, and they are a function of the duration and currency, as seen in the following table.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|        |      | Modified Duration   | Modified Duration   | Changes in Interest Rates (bps)   | Changes in Interest Rates (bps)   | Changes in Interest Rates (bps)   |\n|--------|------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Zone   | Band | Lower Limit         | Upper Limit         | Legal Currency                    | UVR                               | Foreign Currency                  |\n| Zone 1 | 1    | 0                   | 0.08                | 274                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 1 | 2    | 0.08                | 0.25                | 268                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 1 | 3    | 0.25                | 0.5                 | 259                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 1 | 4    | 0.5                 | 1                   | 233                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 2 | 5    | 1                   | 1.9                 | 222                               | 250                               | 90                                |\n| Zone 2 | 6    | 1.9                 | 2.8                 | 222                               | 250                               | 80                                |\n| Zone 2 | 7    | 2.8                 | 3.6                 | 211                               | 220                               | 75                                |\n|        | 8    | 3.6                 | 4.3                 | 211                               | 220                               | 75                                |\n|        | 9    | 4.3                 | 5.7                 | 172                               | 200                               | 70                                |\n|        | 10   | 5.7                 | 7.3                 | 162                               | 170                               | 65                                |\n| Zone 3 | 11   | 7.3                 | 9.3                 | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n|        | 12   | 9.3                 | 10.6                | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n|        | 13   | 10.6                | 12                  | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n|        | 14   | 12                  | 20                  | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n|        | 15   | 20                  |                     | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n\nOnce the sensitivity factor is calculated for each position, the modified duration is then used to classify each position within its corresponding band. A net sensitivity is then calculated for each band, by determining the difference between the sum of all long-positions and the sum of all short-positions. Then a net position is calculated for each zone (which consists of a series of bands) determined by the SFC. The final step is to make adjustments within each  band,  across  bands  and  within  each  zone,  which  results  in  a  final  number  that  is  the  interest  rate  risk  VaR  by  currency.  Each  adjustment  is performed following the guidelines established by the SFC.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to interest risk primarily arises from investments in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES).\n\n## \uf0b7 Currency (Treasury and Banking Book), Equity (Treasury Book) and Fund (Treasury Book) Risk\n\nThe VaR model uses a sensitivity factor to calculate the probability of loss due to fluctuations in the price of stocks, funds and currencies in which the Bank maintains a position. As previously indicated, the methodology used in these financial statements to measure such risk consists of computing VaR, which is derived by multiplying the position by the maximum probable variation in the price of such positions ('\u2206p'). The ('\u2206p') is determined by the SFC, as shown in the following table:\n\n| Currency             | Sensitivity Factor   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|\n| United States Dollar | 12.49 %              |\n| Euro                 | 11.00 %              |\n| Other currencies     | 13.02 %              |\n| Equity and Fund Risk | 14.70 %              |",

Currently, the Bank not present exposure to credit default swaps risk.\n\nThe total market risk VaR had a 9.1% increase, from COP 817,301 in December 31, 2021 to COP 891,569 as of December 31, 2022, due mainly to the increase of the position in Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia. Although, the interest rate risk VaR  decrease due to the reduction in Colombian Government Treasury Bonds and in notional derivatives positions. The equity risk VaR and the foreign exchange rate risk VaR  decrease due to a reduction in of equities market value and to the lower exposure to the US Dollar.\n\nThe following table presents the total change in market risk and other risk factors.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| December 2022 In millions of COP   | December 2022 In millions of COP   | December 2022 In millions of COP   | December 2022 In millions of COP   | December 2022 In millions of COP   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Factor                             | December 31                        | Average                            | Maximum                            | Minimum                            |\n| Interest Rate Risk VaR             | 340,107                            | 381,094                            | 410,605                            | 340,107                            |\n| Foreign Exchange Rate Risk VaR     | 78,165                             | 118,620                            | 201,927                            | 78,165                             |\n| Equity Risk VaR                    | 85,345                             | 98,401                             | 105,263                            | 85,345                             |\n| Fund Risk VaR                      | 387,952                            | 294,468                            | 387,952                            | 225,401                            |\n| Total Value at Risk                | 891,569                            | 892,583                            | 1,059,312                          | 783,367                            |\n\n| December 2021 In millions of COP   | December 2021 In millions of COP   | December 2021 In millions of COP   | December 2021 In millions of COP   | December 2021 In millions of COP   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Factor                             | December 31                        | Average                            | Maximum                            | Minimum                            |\n| Interest Rate Risk VaR             | 403,556                            | 407,530                            | 450,774                            | 347,163                            |\n| Foreign Exchange Rate Risk VaR     | 88,477                             | 82,247                             | 98,848                             | 63,375                             |\n| Equity Risk VaR                    | 99,895                             | 96,543                             | 103,187                            | 91,944                             |\n| Fund Risk VaR                      | 225,373                            | 221,810                            | 225,892                            | 216,153                            |\n| Total Value at Risk                | 817,301                            | 808,130                            | 862,101                            | 743,910                            |\n\n## \uf0b7 Assumptions and Limitations of VaR Models\n\nAlthough VaR models represent a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as predictive of future results. The Bank may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by the Bank's VaR models. A VaR model does not calculate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the reasonable judgment of the Bank's risk management personnel.\n\n## \uf0b7 The Bank's results could adversely affected with high inflation rate\n\nHigh level of inflation increases interest rates and reduces the market value of the Bank's debt instruments and increases the market risk in general. Inflation also impacts the real interest rate. When the inflation rate is higher than the nominal interest rate, negative real interest rates discourage saving and the greater variability increases uncertainty and risk, not only in the loan market but also in the stock market.",

Non-trading instruments market risk measurement\n\nThe banking book's relevant risk exposure is interest rate risk, which is the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income or in the equity economic  value  of  equity  as  a  result  of  a  change  in  market  interest  rates.  Changes  in  interest  rates  affect  the  Bank's  earnings  because  of  timing differences  on  the  repricing  of  the  assets  and  liabilities.  The  Bank  manages  the  interest  rate  risk  arising  from  banking  activities  in  non-trading instruments by analyzing the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities, and estimates the impact on the  net  interest  income  and  the  equity  economic  value  of  equity.  The  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  exposures  arising  from  the  banking  book  are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## \uf0b7 Interest Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nThe Bank has performed a sensitivity analysis of market risk sensitive instruments estimating the impact on the net interest income of each position in the Banking Book, using a repricing model and assuming positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points (bps).\n\nThe table 1 provides information about Bancolombia's interest rate sensitivity for the statement of financial position items comprising the Banking Book.\n\nThe chart below provides information about Bancolombia's interest rate risk sensitivity in local currency (COP) at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:\n\nTable 1. Sensitivity to Interest Rate Risk of the Banking Book\n\n|                                         | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| In millions of COP                      | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP  |\n| Assets sensitivity 100 bps              | 1,060,949           | 859,122             |\n| Liabilities sensitivity 100 bps         | 545,911             | 419,027             |\n| Net interest income sensitivity 100 bps | 515,038             | 440,095             |\n\nThe chart below provides information about Bancolombia's interest rate risk sensitivity in foreign currency (US dollars) at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\n\n|                                         | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| In millions of USD                      | In millions of USD  | In millions of USD  |\n| Assets sensitivity 100 bps              | 84,883              | 77,106              |\n| Liabilities sensitivity 100 bps         | 71,737              | 55786               |\n| Net interest income sensitivity 100 bps | 13,146              | 21,320              |\n\nA positive net sensitivity denotes a higher sensitivity of assets than of liabilities and implies that a rise in interest rates will positively affect the Bank's net interest income. A negative sensitivity denotes a higher sensitivity of liabilities than of assets and implies that a rise in interest rates will negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. In the event of a decrease in interest rates, the impacts on net interest income would be opposite to those described above.\n\n## Total Exposure:\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the net interest income sensitivity in local currency for the banking book instruments, entered for other than trading purposes with positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points was COP 515,038. The change in the net interest income sensitivity between 2022 and 2021 is due to the increase in the sensitivity of float loans.\n\nOn the other hand, the net interest income sensitivity in foreign currency, assuming the same parallel shift of 100 basis points, was USD 13,146  at December 31, 2022, compared with USD 21,320 at December 31, 2021. The decrease in net interest income sensitivity due to interest rate risk between 2022 and 2021 occurred due to the increase of the liabilities sensitivity due to the rise of loans with other banks.",

        "page_content": "## Assumptions and limitations:\n\nNet interest income sensitivity analysis is based on the repricing model and considers the following key assumptions: (a) does not consider prepayments, new operations, defaults, etc., (b); the fixed rate instruments sensitivity, includes the amounts with maturity lower than one year and assumes these will be disbursed at market interest rates and (c) changes in interest rate occur immediately and parallel in the yield curves from assets and liabilities for different maturities.\n\n## \uf0b7 Structural equity risk exposure (Banking Book)\n\nBancolombia's investment banking affiliate, in its role of financial corporation, holds, directly and through its affiliated companies, structural equity investments. These positions are maintained mostly in the industrial and financial sectors.\n\nThe market value of those investments incresed by 13% during the year, from COP 49,925 million as of December 31, 2021 to COP 56,607 million as of December 31, 2022, as a result mainly driven by the increase in the market value of the investments in Enka Shares.\n\nThe structural equity positions are exposed to market risk. Sensitivity calculations are made for those positions:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|             | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Fair Value  | 56,607              | 49,925              |\n| Delta       | 14.70 %             | 14.70 %             |\n| Sensitivity | 8,321               | 7,339               |\n\nA negative impact of 14.7%, applied to the market value, produces a decrease of COP 8 billion in the structural equity investments market value, from COP 57 billion to COP 48 billion.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  defined  as  the  inability  of  a  financial  firm  to  meet  its  debt  obligations  without  incurring  unacceptably  large  losses.  Thus,  funding liquidity risk is the risk that a firm will not be able to meet its current and future cash flow and collateral needs, both expected and unexpected, without materially affecting its daily operations or overall financial condition. The Bank is sensitive to funding liquidity risk since debt maturity transformation is one of its key business areas.\n\nAt  the  Bank,  liquidity  prevails  over  any  objective  of  growth  or  revenue.  Managing  liquidity  has  always  been  a  fundamental  pillar  of  its  business strategy, together with capital, in supporting its statement of financial position.\n\nThe  Bank's  liquidity  management  model  promotes  the  autonomy  of  subsidiaries,  which  must  be  self-sufficient  in  their  structural  funding.  Each subsidiary is responsible for meeting the liquidity needs of its current and future activity, within a framework of management coordination at the Bank level. The metrics used to control liquidity risk are developed based on common and homogeneous concepts, but analysis and adaptation are made by each subsidiary.\n\nIn line with best governance practices, the Bank has established a clear division of function between executing liquidity management, responsibility of the Asset and Liability Division, and their monitoring and control, responsibility of the Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office.\n\nThe  different  authorities  of  senior  management  define  the  policies  and  guidelines  for  managing  liquidity  risk.  These  authorities  are  the  Board  of Directors, the Risk Committee, and senior management of the Parent Company, which set the risk appetite and define the financial strategy. The ALCO committees (Asset and liability committee) define the objective positioning of liquidity and the strategies that ensure the funding needs derived from businesses.  The  ALM  division  (Asset  and  liability  management)  and  the  Market  and  Liquidity  Risks  Management  Office  support  the  mentioned committees, which elaborate analysis and management proposals, and control compliance with the limits established.",

        "page_content": "Liquidity Risks Management Office is responsible for proposing the minimum amount of the liquidity reserve, the policies of the liquidity portfolio, defining premises and metrics in order to model the behaviour of the cash flows, proposing and monitoring liquidity limits in line with the Bank's risk appetite, simulating stress scenarios, evaluating and reporting the risks inherent to new products and operations; and submitting the reports required by the internal authorities for decision-making, as well as by regulators. All of the above activities are verified and evaluated by the Internal Audit.\n\nThe measures to control liquidity risk include maintaining a portfolio of highly liquid assets, and the definition of triggers and liquidity limits, which enable evaluating the level of exposure of each one of the entities in a proactive way.\n\nThe methodologies used to control liquidity risk include the liquidity gaps and stress scenarios. The liquidity gaps measure the mismatches of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet position's cash flows, separately for local currency and foreign currency. Regulatory metrics are also applied, in which the contractual maturities are used; and internal models in which the cash flows are adjusted by different ratios, to reflect a more accurate behaviour.\n\nPeriodically, a validation of the policies, limits, processes, methodologies and tools to evaluate liquidity risk exposure is performed, in order to establish its pertinence and functionality, and to carry out the necessary adjustments. The Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office elaborate reports daily, weekly and monthly basis in order to monitor the exposure levels and the limits and triggers set up, and to support the decision-making process.\n\nEach subsidiary has its own liquidity contingency plan, which is tested annually. These contingency plans procure the optimization of different funding sources, including obtaining additional funding from the Parent Company.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Bank's Board of Directors sets the strategy for managing liquidity risk and delegates responsibility for oversight of the implementation of this policy to ALCO committee that approves the Bank's liquidity policies and procedures. The Treasury Division manages the Bank's liquidity position on a day-to-day basis and reviews daily reports covering the liquidity position. A summary report, including any exceptions and remedial action taken, is submitted regularly to Risk Committee and ALCO committees.\n\n## a.     Liquidity risk exposure:\n\nIn order to estimate liquidity risk, the Bank measures a liquidity coverage ratio to ensure holding liquid assets sufficient to cover potential net cash outflows  over  30  days.  This  indicator  allows  the  Bank  to  meet  liquidity  coverage  for  the  next  month.  The  liquidity  coverage  ratio  is  presented  as follows:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| Liquidity Coverage Ratio       | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Net cash outflows into 30 days | 18,227,019          | 15,897,163          |\n| Liquid Assets                  | 48,059,179          | 44,198,889          |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio **    | 263.67 %            | 278.03 %            |\n\n## b.     Liquid Assets\n\nOne of the main guidelines of the Bank is to maintain a solid liquidity position, therefore, the ALCO Committee, has established a minimum level of liquid assets, based on the funding needs of each subsidiary, to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Bank's reputation.",

The project is in an implementation stage, it currently has an assigned budget and an interdisciplinary work team made up of the areas of: products, legal, processes, technology, projects, who address the discontinuation of LIBOR from different work fronts focused on structuring and executing work plans.\n\nThe Project has identified impacts in the following products:\n\n- \u25cf Loans in USD\n- \u25cf Term deposits in USD\n- \u25cf International Factoring\n- \u25cf Derivatives: Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) in USD and Cross Currency Swaps (CCS) in USD\n- \u25cf Bonds in USD\n- \u25cf International Leasing\n- \u25cf USD Loans with international banks\n\nThe project has achieved the following milestones:\n\n- \u25cf Initial technological and processes adjustments for the development of products referencing the new rate (SOFR)\n- \u25cf Implementation of fallback language in loan contracts and derivatives confirmations and ISDA protocol adherence\n- \u25cf SOFR rate approval by GAP Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors\n- \u25cf An internal communication scheme has been implemented, which consists of sending quarterly newsletters with project progress and action plans to stakeholders  involved  informed,  as  well  as  communications  to  the  Bank's  internal  team  in  order  to  provide  them  with  a  training  on  the discontinuation  of  LIBOR.  Additionally,  a  communication  plan  has  been  established  with  clients,  which  includes  the  publication  of  articles  in specialized media and emails with information, sent directly to clients. It also includes one-to-one meetings with clients.\n- \u25cf A work plan has been set up. It includes exposure measurement, impact assessment, systems adjustments. It also includes development of products in the new reference rate, analyzing and implementing appropriate \"fallback language\" and designing a strategy to approach clients.  Monitoring and adjustments to the implementation plan are carried out periodically.\n\nAnswer has  been  given  to  regulatory  entities  regarding  this  transition  process  to  risk-free  rates.  Bancolombia  will  continue  adapting  its  processes, methodologies, and systems in order to reach all the requirements in the transition process towards new risk-free rates.Bancolombia expects to conclude this process before the cessation date of discontinuation of LIBOR in June 2023.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| December 31, 2021 In millions of COP 1   | December 31, 2021 In millions of COP 1   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | USD LIBOR                                |\n| Assets                                   |                                          |\n| Loans                                    | 24,077,401                               |\n| Bonds                                    | 954,238                                  |\n| Derivatives                              | 170,402                                  |\n| Total Assets                             | 25,202,041                               |\n| Liabilities                              |                                          |\n| Loans                                    | 4,123,825                                |\n| Term deposits                            | 11,700                                   |\n| Total Liabilities                        | 4,135,525                                |",

In addition, the transition process to an alternative reference rate could impact the Bank's business, financial condition or result of operations, as a result of:\n\n- \u25cf An adverse impact in pricing, liquidity, value, return and trading for a broad array of financial products, loans and derivatives that are included in the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\n- \u25cf Extensive changes to internal processes and documentation that contain references to LIBOR or use formulas that depend on LIBOR.\n- \u25cf Disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in LIBOR -based products such as fallback language or other related provisions.\n- \u25cf The transition and development of appropriate systems and models to effectively transition the Bank's risk management processes from LIBOR based products to those based on one or more alternative reference rates in a timely manner; and\n- \u25cf An increase in prepayments of LIBOR -linked loans by the Bank's clients.\n\nFrom January 2022, products indexed to the SOFR rate began to be offered, additionally it was defined not to carry new operations indexed to the LIBOR rate.\n\nIn turn, as an organization, we will continue to focus during 2023 on the implementation of the activities related to the transition process of operations that are indexed to LIBOR.\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe Capital Management function oversees Shareholders' equity and Bancolombia's capital structure, aiming for value generation through businesses related to financial activities and investments.\n\nThe goal is to have the enough capital to cover unexpected losses, and develope the business plan. To do so, the Capital and Corporate Investments area oversees Bancolombia's capital ratios and uses several mechanisms to optimize such ratios according to forecasted business conditions.",

The results are presented to the Board of Directors and some support committees to make sure that all risks are properly managed and within risks appetite, guidelines, and regulation.\n\nBancolombia's management has the goal of maintaining the balance between an adequate capital allocation and value generation for shareholders. This way, business opportunities can be financed with internal funding or capital markets resources.\n\nBancolombia's lending and deposit-taking activities are supervisor by the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia, and that implies complying with Decree 1477 of 2018.\n\nThis decree standardized the definitions of regulatory capital according to Basel III standards. It also updated the risk adjusted capital consumption of assets and added capital buffers. New capital measures will be implemented from the current 4.5% basic solvency level and the 9% total solvency level.\n\nAdditionally, Bancolombia conducts stress test to estimate how the bank's balance sheet, results and ratios during adverse scenarios. None of the stress test runs implies reaching solvency ratios below regulatory levels and therefore, we consider that capital levels are optimal at the end of 2021.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2024, after the complete implementation of the new capital standards, a minimum basic capital of 6% and a total capital ratio of 11.5% will be required, according to the following formulas:",

Pursuant to Article 8 of the bylaws, all shares issued shall have the same nominal value. As  of  December  31,  2022,  a  total  of  509,704,584  common  shares  and  452,122,416  preferred  shares  were  registered  in  the  Bank's stockholder registry in the name of 37,193 stockholders. A total of 126,623,872 representing 28.01% of preferred shares were directly held by  the  depositary  in  the  United  States  and  were  held  by  28  record  holders  registered  in  The  Bank  of  New  York  Mellon's  registered stockholder list. Given that some of the preferred shares and American Depository Shares ('ADSs') are held by nominees, the number of record holders may not be representative of the number of beneficial owners.\n\n## PREFERRED SHARES\n\nThe following description of the Bank's preferred shares is a summary of the material terms of the by-laws and Colombian corporate law regarding the preferred shares and the holders thereof.

As of December 31, 2022, the market capitalization for the Bank's preferred shares based on the closing price in the Colombian Securities Exchange was COP 15,169 billion (the Bank's total market capitalization, which includes the common and preferred shares, was COP 36,831 billion or USD 7.66 billion as of the same date).\n\nThere are no official  market  makers  or  independent  specialists  on  the  Colombian  Securities  Exchange  to  ensure  market  liquidity  and, therefore,  orders  to  buy  or  sell  in  excess  of  corresponding  orders  to  sell  or  buy  will  not  be  executed.  The  aggregate  equity  market capitalization of the Colombian Securities Exchange, as of December 31, 2022, was COP 331,595 billion (USD 68,936 billion), with 78 companies listed as of that date.\n\nNeither the registration of our preferred shares in the Registro Nacional de Valores y Emisores (the National Registry of Securities and Issuers)  nor  the  approval  of  any  public  offer  by  the  Colombian  Finance  Superintendence  ('SFC') should be understood as a rating or assumption of liability by the SFC with respect to us, the price, quality or the tradability of the securities or of our solvency.\n\n## Registration and Transfer\n\nThe  preferred  shares  are  evidenced  by  a  dematerialized  global  certificate  held  for  custody  by  Deposito  Centralizado  de  Valores  de Colombia - Deceval S.A. ('Deceval'), in registered form without dividend coupons attached. The Bank maintains a stock registry through Deceval  and  only  those  holders  listed  in  that  stock  registry  as  holders  of  preferred  shares  are  recognized  by  the  Bank  as  holders  of preferred shares. Each registration or transfer of preferred shares will be effected only by the book entry record on such stock registry. Any such registration will be effected without charge to the person requesting such registration, but subject to payment by such person of any taxes,  stamp  duties  or  other  governmental  charges  payable  in  connection  therewith.  The  Bank  of  New  York  Mellon,  which  acts  as depositary (the 'depositary') for our American Depositary Receipts ('ADRs') facility, or the depositary's nominee shall be the registered holder on behalf of beneficial owners of ADSs representing the preferred shares, which shall be deposited with Fiduciaria Bancolombia S.A. (formerly Fiducolombia S.A.), as agent of the depositary (the 'custodian').\n\nIn general, transfers of shares of listed companies in Colombia are required to be effected through the Colombian Securities Exchange. The  following  transfers,  however,  are  not  required  to  be  effected  through  the  Colombian  Securities  Exchange:  (i)  transfers  between shareholders that have the same beneficial owner provided that such condition is evidenced to the SFC; (ii) transfers by operation of law (such as inheritance, liquidation of companies or judicial decisions, among others); (iii) transfers as payment in kind provided that a one year pre-existence of the payment obligation is evidenced to the SFC; and (iv) transfers whose amount do not exceed the value of 66,000 Unidades de Valor Real (or 'UVRs', a Colombian inflation-adjusted monetary index calculated by the board of directors of the Central Bank  of  Colombia  (the  'Central  Bank')  and  generally  used  for  pricing  home-mortgage  loans;  as  of  March  29,  2023  approximately U.S.$4,784.35.Neither the Bank nor the depositary will be liable for any failure to comply with the ownership limitation or failure to respond to any request for information to determine compliance with the ownership limitation.\n\nColombian  securities  regulations  forbid  a  shareholder  to  pre-arrange  transactions  on  shares  of  listed  companies  unless  the  prearrangement is disclosed publicly and to the SFC at least one month in advance.\n\nPursuant to Colombian Banking laws, no individual or corporation may hold 10% or more of a Colombian financial institution's capital stock or increase any such ownership without the prior authorization of the SFC.\n\n## Voting Rights\n\nThe holders of preferred shares are not entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at any general shareholders' meeting of holders of common shares except as described below.",

Notice of ordinary meetings and extraordinary meetings convened to approve fiscal year-end financial statements, the increase of authorized capital, the reduction of the outstanding capital, the merger, spin-off or sale of more than 25% of the assets, liabilities and contracts, must be published in one newspaper of wide circulation at Bancolombia's principal place of business at least 30 calendar days prior to such meeting. Notice of other extraordinary meetings, must be published in one newspaper of wide circulation at Bancolombia's principal place of business at least 15 calendar days prior to such meeting listing the matters to be addressed at such meeting.\n\nExcept when Colombian law or our by-laws require a special majority, action may be taken at a general shareholders' meeting by the vote of two or more shareholders representing a majority of common shares present. Pursuant to Colombian law and/or our by- laws, special majorities are required to adopt the following corporate actions:\n\n- \u00b7 a favorable vote of at least 70% of the common shares represented at a general shareholders' meeting is required to approve the issuance of shares without preemptive rights available to the shareholders;\n- \u00b7 a favorable vote of at least 78% of common shares represented at a general shareholders' meeting is required to decide not to distribute as dividend at least 50% of the annual net profits of any given fiscal year;\n- \u00b7 a favorable vote of at least 80% of the holders of common shares represented at a general shareholders' meeting, and 80% of the holders of outstanding preferred shares is required to approve the payment dividend in shares; and\n- \u00b7 a  favorable  vote  of  at  least  70%  of  the  holders  of  common  shares  and  of  outstanding  preferred  shares  is  required  to  effect  a decision to impair the conditions or rights established for such preferred shares, or a decision to convert preferred shares into common shares.\n\nIf the SFC determines that any amendment to the by-laws fails to comply with Colombian law, it may demand that the relevant provisions be modified accordingly. Under these circumstances, we will be obligated to comply in a timely manner.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe  holders  of  common  shares,  once  they  have  approved  the  year-end  financial  statements,  determine  the  allocation  of  distributable profits, if any, for the preceding year.\n\nUnder the Colombian Commerce Code, a company must distribute at least 50% of its annual net profits to all shareholders, payable in cash,  or  as  determined  by  the  shareholders,  within  a  period  of  one  year  following  the  date  on  which  the  shareholders  determine  the dividends.  If  the  total  amount  of  all  reserves  of  a  company  exceeds  its  outstanding  capital,  this  percentage  is  increased  to  70%.  The minimum dividend requirement of 50% or 70%, as the case may be, may be waived by a favorable vote of the holders of 78% of a company's common shares present at the meeting.\n\nUnder Colombian law and our by-laws, annual net profits are to be applied as follows:",

In  accordance  with  Colombian  law  and  our  by-laws,  the  dividends  payable  to  the  holders  of  common  shares cannot exceed the dividends payable to holders of the preferred shares.\n\nHolders  of  preferred  shares  are  entitled  to  receive  dividends  based  on  the  profits  of  the  preceding  fiscal  year,  after  canceling  losses affecting the capital and once the amount that shall be legally set apart for the legal reserve has been deducted, but before creating or accruing  for  any  other  reserve,  of  a  minimum  preferred  dividend  equal  to  1%  yearly  of  the  subscription  price  of  the  preferred  share, provided this dividend is higher than the dividend assigned to common shares. If this is not the case, the dividend shall be increased to an amount that is equal to the per share dividend on the common shares.\n\nPayment of the preferred dividend shall be made at the time and in the manner established by the general shareholders' meeting and in the priority indicated by Colombian law.\n\nThe general shareholders' meeting may allocate a portion of the profits to welfare, education or civic services, or to support economic organizations of our employees.\n\nThe dividend payments may be made in installments which must be approved at the annual general shareholders' meeting. In the general shareholders' meeting, shareholders will determine the effective date, the system and the place for payment of dividends.\n\nDividends declared on the preferred shares will be payable to the record holders of those shares, as they appear on our stock registry, on the  appropriate  record  dates  as  determined  by  the  general  shareholders'  meeting.  Generally,  any  stock  dividend  payable  by  us  to  the holders of preferred shares will be paid in preferred shares. However, the general shareholders' meeting may authorize the payment in common shares to all shareholders. Any in-kind dividend payable in shares requires the approval of 80% or more of the voting interest of the common shares present at a shareholders' meeting and the approval of 80% or more of the voting interest of the outstanding preferred shares. In the event that such voting majority is not obtained, shareholders may individually elect to receive a stock dividend or a cash dividend.\n\n## Liquidation Rights\n\nThe Bank will be dissolved if certain events take place, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 our term of existence, as stated in the by-laws, expires without being extended by the shareholders prior to its expiration date;\n- \u00b7 losses  cause  the  decrease  of  our  shareholders'  equity  below  50%  of  our  outstanding  capital  stock,  unless  one  or  more  of  the corrective measures described in the Colombian Commerce Code are adopted by a general shareholder's meeting within six months;\n- \u00b7 by decision of the general shareholders' meeting; and\n- \u00b7 in certain other events expressly provided for by Colombian law and our by-laws.",

In addition, the SFC has the power to  take  over  the  operations  and  assets  of  a  bank  and  proceed  to  its  liquidation  under  certain  circumstances  and  in  the  manner prescribed in the Colombian Financial Statute (Estatuto Org\u00e1nico del Sistema Financiero - Decree 663 of 1993 - the 'Financial Statute')\n\nUpon  liquidation,  holders  of  fully  paid  preferred  shares  will  be  entitled  to  receive  in  pesos,  out  of  the  surplus  assets  available  for distribution to shareholders, pari passu with any of the other shares ranking at that time pari passu with the preferred shares, an amount equal to the nominal value of those preferred shares before any distribution or payment may be made to holders of common shares or any other shares at that time ranking junior to the preferred shares with regard to participation in our surplus assets. If, upon any liquidation, assets that are available for distribution among the holders of preferred shares and liquidation parity shares are insufficient to pay in full their  respective  liquidation  preferences,  then  those  assets  will  be  distributed  among  those  holders  pro-rata  in  accordance  with  the respective liquidation preference amounts payable to them.\n\nSubject to the preferential liquidation rights of holders of preferred shares, all fully paid common shares will be entitled to participate equally in any distribution upon liquidation. Partially paid common shares must participate in a distribution upon liquidation in the same proportion that those shares have been paid at the time of the distribution.\n\nTo the extent there are surplus assets available for distribution after full payment to the holders of common shares of the nominal value of the common shares, the surplus assets will be distributed among all holders of shares of capital stock pro-rata in accordance with their respective holdings of shares.\n\n## Preemptive Rights and Other Anti-Dilution Provisions\n\nPursuant to the Colombian Commerce Code, the Bank is allowed to have an amount of outstanding capital stock equal to or smaller than the authorized capital stock set out in the by-laws. Under the by-laws, the holders of common shares determine the amount of authorized capital stock, and the board of directors has the power to (a) order the issuance and regulate the terms of subscription of common shares up to the total amount of authorized capital stock and (b) regulate the issuance of preferred shares, when expressly delegated by the general shareholders' meeting. The issuance of preferred shares must always be first approved by the general shareholders' meeting, which shall determine the nature and extent of any privileges, according to the by-laws and Colombian law.\n\nAt the time a Colombian company is formed, its outstanding capital stock must represent at least 50% of the authorized capital. Any increases in the authorized capital stock or decreases in the outstanding capital stock must be approved by the majority of shareholders required to approve a general amendment to the by-laws. Pursuant to the Financial Statute, the SFC may order a commercial bank to increase its outstanding capital stock under certain special circumstances.\n\nThe Bank's by-laws and Colombian law require that, whenever the Bank issues new shares of any outstanding class, the Bank must offer the holders of each class of shares the right to purchase a number of shares of such class sufficient to maintain their existing percentage ownership of the aggregate capital stock. These rights are called preemptive rights.\n\nThe general shareholders' meeting may suspend preemptive rights with respect to a particular capital increase by a favorable vote of at least 70% of the common shares represented at a general shareholders' meeting. Preemptive rights must be exercised within the period stated in the share placement terms of the increase, which cannot be shorter than 15 business days following the publication of the notice of the public offer of that capital increase. From the date of the notice of the share placement terms, preemptive rights may be transferred separately from the corresponding shares.",

A total of 126,623,872 representing 28.01% of preferred  shares  were  part  of  the  ADR  program  and  were  held  by  28  record  holders  registered  in  The  Bank  of  New  York  Mellon's registered stockholder list. Given that some of the preferred shares and ADSs are held by nominees, the number of record holders may not be representative of the number of beneficial owners. A beneficial owner includes anyone who has the power to receive the economic benefit of ownership of the securities. ADRs evidencing ADSs are deliverable by The Bank of New York Mellon, as depositary pursuant to the deposit agreement. Each ADS represents four preferred shares or evidences the right to receive four preferred shares.\n\nCopies of the deposit agreement are available for inspection at the Corporate Trust Office of the depositary (the 'Corporate Trust Office'), currently located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, and at the office of the custodian, currently located at Carrera 48 # 26-85, Medellin, Colombia or Calle 28 # 13a-75, Edificio Atrio, Bogota, Colombia. The depositary's principal executive office is located at One Wall Street, New York, New York 10286. The deposit agreement is also an exhibit to our registration statement on Form F-3 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28, 2022.",

Among other requirements, the regime mandates registration of certain foreign exchange transactions with the Central Bank and specifies  procedures  to  authorize  and  administer  certain  types  of  foreign  investments.  International  investments  are  regulated  by  the Central  Bank  by  means  of  External  Resolution  1  of  2018  and  External  Circular  DCIN  83,  both  as  amended,  setting  forth  in  detail regulation and procedures regarding foreign investment in Colombia.\n\nInvestors who wish to participate in our ADR facility and hold our ADRs will be required to submit to the custodian of the ADR facility certain information and comply with certain registration procedures required under the foreign investment regulations in connection with foreign exchange controls regarding currency conversion (generally COP/USD, related to the foreign investment). Holders of ADRs who wish  to  withdraw  the  underlying  preferred  shares  will  also  have  to  comply  with  certain  registration  and  reporting  procedures.  See 'Deposit,  Transfer  and  Withdrawal'  below.  Under  Colombian  foreign  investment  regulations,  the  failure  of  a  non-Colombian  resident investor to report or register foreign exchange transactions relating to investments in Colombia with the Central Bank, on a timely basis, may prevent the investor from obtaining remittance rights, constitute an exchange control infraction and result in a fine.\n\nApproval was obtained from the SFC for the depositary facility  established  for  the  ADSs  pursuant  to  the  deposit  agreement  (and  the agreement between the depositary and the custodian referenced therein) as an institutional fund pursuant to the International Investment Statute. In addition, the SFC authorized the initial and subsequent deposits of preferred shares with the custodian for the purpose of issuing ADSs, as described below. Under such law, the custodian acts as the local administrator of such fund and has certain reporting obligations to the Central Bank and to the SFC.\n\n## Deposit, Transfer and Withdrawal\n\nThe depositary has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement, that upon delivery to the custodian of preferred shares (or evidence of rights to receive preferred shares) and pursuant to appropriate instruments of transfer in a form satisfactory to the custodian, the depositary will, upon payment of the fees, charges and taxes provided in the deposit agreement, execute and deliver an ADR or ADRs, registered in the name or names of the person or persons named in the notice of the custodian delivered to the depositary or requested by the person depositing such preferred shares with the depositary. Such ADR or ADRs shall evidence any authorized number of ADSs requested by such person or persons and shall be executed and delivered at the depositary's Corporate Trust Office. Each deposit must be accompanied by a written notice describing the price paid for the preferred shares being deposited (including any commissions paid to a securities broker in Colombia) in order to enable the custodian to comply with the foreign exchange regulations of the Central Bank with respect to the fund or such other matters as may be required from time to time under applicable Colombian law.\n\nPursuant to the Financial Statute, no individual or corporation may hold 10% or more of a Colombian financial institution's capital stock without the prior authorization of the SFC.\n\nUpon surrender  at  the  Corporate  Trust  Office  of  the  depositary  of  an  ADR  for  the  purpose  of  withdrawal  of  the  deposited  securities represented  by  the  ADSs  evidenced  by  such  ADR,  and  upon  payment  of  the  fees  of  the  depositary  for  the  surrender  of  ADRs, governmental charges and taxes provided in the deposit agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement, our by-laws and the terms of the deposited",

In addition, the deposit agreement provides that the owner or beneficial owner will be responsible for the report of  any  false  information  relating  to  foreign  exchange  transactions  to  the  custodian  or  the  Central  Bank  in  connection  with  deposits  or withdrawals of preferred shares or other deposited securities.\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement and any limitations established by the depositary, unless requested by us to cease doing so, the depositary may deliver ADRs prior to the receipt of preferred shares (a 'pre-release') and deliver shares upon the receipt and cancellation of ADRs which have been pre-",

Every owner of an ADR, at the time any amendment becomes effective, will be deemed, by continuing to hold such ADR, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by the deposit agreement as amended thereby. In no event will such amendment impair the right of the owner or any ADR to surrender such ADR and receive therefor the preferred shares or other deposited securities represented thereby, except to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law.\n\nThe depositary will at any time at our direction terminate the deposit agreement by mailing notice of such termination to the owners of the ADRs then outstanding at least 90 days prior to the date fixed in such notice for such termination.

If any ADRs remain outstanding after the date of termination of the deposit agreement, the depositary thereafter shall discontinue the registration of transfers of ADRs, will suspend the distribution of dividends to the owners thereof and will not give any further notices or perform any further acts under the deposit agreement, except the collection of dividends and other distributions pertaining to the deposited securities, the sale of rights and other  property  and  the  delivery  of  underlying  preferred  shares  or  other  deposited  securities,  together  with  any  dividends  or  other distributions received with respect thereto and the net proceeds of the sale of any rights or other property, in exchange for surrendered ADRs (after deducting, in each case, the fees of the depositary for the surrender of an ADR and other expenses set forth in the deposit agreement and any applicable taxes or governmental charges). At any time after the expiration of one year from the date of termination, the depositary may sell the deposited securities then held thereunder and hold uninvested the net proceeds of such sale, together with any other cash, unsegregated and without liability for interest, for the pro-rata benefit of the owners that have not theretofore surrendered their ADRs, such owners thereupon becoming general creditors of the depositary with respect to such proceeds. After making such sale, the depositary will be discharged from all obligations under the deposit agreement, except to account for net proceeds and other cash (after deducting, in each case, the fee of the depositary and other expenses set forth in the deposit agreement for the surrender of an ADR and any applicable taxes or other governmental charges).\n\nCharges of Depositary",

The Senior Notes Trustee has the following two main roles, subject to the terms of the Senior Debt Indenture:\n\n- \u00b7 First, the Senior Notes Trustee can enforce the rights of registered holders of the Senior Notes ('Senior Notes Holder', or 'Senior Notes Holders') against us if we default in respect of the Senior Notes. There are some limitations on the extent to which the Senior Notes Trustee acts on behalf of Holders, which are described under 'Events of Default'; and\n- \u00b7 Second, the Senior Notes Trustee performs administrative duties for us, such as making interest payments and sending notices to Senior Notes Holders.\n\n## Principal, Maturity and Interest\n\nInterest on the Senior Notes will be payable to Senior Notes Holders of record at the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to each such Interest Payment Date, as the case may be, immediately preceding the relevant interest payment date. Interest on the Senior Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. If any interest payment date or final maturity date is a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of the principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if it were made on the date the payment was due.\n\nIn the event that the Bank defaults on the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or such other amounts as may be payable in respect of the Senior Notes, the Bank will pay interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, at the rate borne by the Senior Notes plus 1% per year and it will pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful.\n\nThe Bank will pay the principal of and interest on the Senior Notes and any Additional Amounts (as defined below) in U.S. Dollars.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\nAfter the date on which the Notes are originally issued ('Issue Date'), the Bank may issue additional Senior Notes under the Indenture having identical terms and conditions to the Senior Notes to be issued on the early settlement date (the 'Additional Fungible Notes'), except with respect to (1) issue date, (2) issue price, (3) first interest payment date and (4) any adjustments necessary in order to conform to and ensure compliance with the Securities Act (or other applicable securities laws), which are not adverse in any material respect to any Holder of any outstanding Senior Notes (other than such Additional Fungible Notes). Any Additional Fungible Notes are expected to be part of the same issue as the Senior Notes to be issued on the early settlement date and will be treated as a single series with the Senior Notes to be issued on the early settlement date, including for purposes of voting, redemptions and offers to purchase. Pursuant to the Senior Debt Indenture, Additional Fungible Notes will be fungible with the Senior Notes to be issued on the early settlement date for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n## Additional Amounts\n\nAll payments made by the Bank under or with respect to the Senior Notes will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of any Taxing Authority in any jurisdiction in which the Bank is organized or is otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made (each a 'Relevant  Taxing  Jurisdiction'),  unless  the  Bank  or  the  paying  agent  is  required  to  withhold  or  deduct  Taxes  by  law  or  by  the interpretation or administration thereof.

The Senior Debt Indenture provides that, in case an Event of Default occurs and is not cured, the Senior Notes Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in similar circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Senior Notes Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Senior Debt Indenture at the request of any Senior Note Holder, unless such Senior Note Holder shall have offered to the Senior Notes Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to the Senior Notes Trustee.\n\n## Unclaimed Amounts\n\nAny money deposited with the Senior Notes Trustee or paying agent or held by the Bank, in trust, for the payment of principal, premium, interest or any Additional Amounts, that remains unclaimed for two (2) years after such amount becomes due and payable shall be paid to the Bank upon its request or, if held by the Bank, shall be discharged from such trust.

There  are  some limitations on the extent to which the Subordinated Notes Trustee acts on behalf of Subordinated Note Holders, which are described under 'Events of Default'; and\n- \u00b7 Second, the Subordinated Notes Trustee performs administrative duties for us, such as making interest payments and sending notices to holders of Subordinated Notes.\n\n## Principal, Maturity and Interest\n\nInterest on the Subordinated Notes will be payable to Subordinated Notes Holders of record at the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to each such Interest Payment Date, as the case may be, immediately preceding the relevant interest payment date. Interest on the Subordinated Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. If any interest payment date or  final  maturity  date  is  a  day  that  is  not  a  Business  Day,  the  related  payment  of  the  principal  and  interest  will  be  made  on  the  next succeeding Business Day as if it were made on the date the payment was due.\n\nIn the event that the Bank defaults on the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or such other amounts as may be payable in respect  of  the  Subordinated  Notes,  the  Bank  will  pay  interest  on  overdue  principal  and  premium,  if  any,  at  the  rate  borne  by  the Subordinated Notes plus 1% per year and it will pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful.\n\nThe Subordinated Notes were issued in registered form, without coupons. Beneficial interests in the Subordinated Notes are shown on, and transfers are effected only through, records maintained by the DTC and its participants.\n\nThe Bank will pay the principal of and interest on the Subordinated Notes and any Additional Amounts (as defined below) in U.S. Dollars.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\nAfter the Issue Date of the Subordinated Notes, the Bank may issue additional Notes under either of the Subordinated Debt Indentures, having identical terms and conditions to the 2027 or 2029 Notes to be issued on the early settlement date (the ' Additional Subordinated Fungible Notes '), except with respect to (1) issue date, (2) issue price, (3) first interest payment date and (4) any adjustments necessary in order to conform to and ensure compliance with the Securities Act (or other applicable securities laws), which are not adverse in any material  respect  to  any  Subordinated  Note  Holder  of  any  outstanding  Subordinated  Notes  (other  than  such  Additional  Subordinated Fungible Notes). Any Additional Subordinated Fungible Notes are expected to be part of the same issue as the Subordinated Notes to be issued on the early settlement date and will be treated as a single series with the Subordinated Notes to be issued on the early settlement date, including for purposes of voting, redemptions and offers to purchase. Pursuant to the Subordinated Debt Indentures, no Additional Fungible Notes may be issued unless such Additional Subordinated Fungible Notes will be fungible with the Subordinated Notes to be issued on the early settlement date for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nAdditional Amounts",

Also,  as  a  result  of  the  operation  of  the  provisions  of  the  Subordinated  Notes  described  under  'Loss  Absorption'  below, Subordinated Notes Holders may recover less ratably than holders of pari passu subordinated debt of the Bank that does not include a similar loss absorption feature.\n\nIn addition, the Subordinated Notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Bank's subsidiaries.\n\nThe payment of all Obligations on or relating  to  the  Subordinated  Notes  will,  in  the  event  of  liquidation,  be  subordinated  in  right  of payment to the prior payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of all obligations due in respect of Senior External Liabilities of the Bank, whether outstanding on the Issue Date or incurred after that date, and will be senior only to subordinated instruments constituting Tier One Capital and the Bank's capital stock.

The registrar may require a Subordinated Note Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Subordinated Debt Indentures. Without the prior consent of the Bank, the registrar is not required to register the transfer or exchange of a Subordinated Note between a record date and the next succeeding interest payment date.",

Each Subordinated Note Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Subordinated Notes.

The Subordinated Debt Indentures contains certain limitations on the rights of the Subordinated Notes Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Bank, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain assets received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Subordinated Notes Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest (as defined in the Subordinated Debt Indentures), it must eliminate such conflict or resign.\n\nThe Subordinated Notes Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Subordinated Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Subordinated Notes Trustee, subject to  certain  exceptions.  The  Subordinated  Debt  Indentures  provides  that,  in  case  an  Event  of  Default  occurs  and  is  not  cured,  the Subordinated  Notes  Trustee  will  be  required,  in  the  exercise  of  its  power,  to  use  the  degree  of  care  of  a  prudent  person  in  similar circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Subordinated Notes Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Subordinated Debt Indentures at the request of any Subordinated Note Holder, unless such Subordinated Note Holder shall have offered to the Subordinated Notes Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to the Subordinated Notes Trustee.\n\n## Unclaimed Amounts\n\nAny money deposited with the Subordinated Notes Trustee or paying agent or held by the Bank, in trust, for the payment of principal, premium, interest or any Additional Amounts, that remains unclaimed for two (2) years after such amount becomes due and payable shall be paid to the Bank upon its request or, if held by the Bank, shall be discharged from such trust. The Subordinated Note Holder will look only to the Bank for payment thereof, and all liability of the Subordinated Notes Trustee or paying agent shall thereupon cease. However, the Subordinated Notes Trustee or paying agent may at the expense of the Bank cause to be mailed to Subordinated Notes Holders at the last address of record, notice that the money remains unclaimed and any unclaimed balance of such money remaining, after a specified date, will be repaid to the Bank.\n\n## No Sinking Fund\n\nThe Subordinated Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund.\n\nListing\n\nThe  Subordinated Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n## Governing Law\n\nThe Subordinated Debt Indentures and the Subordinated Notes are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the authorization and execution of such documentation by the Bank and any subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes will be governed by the laws of Colombia. The qualification of the Subordinated Notes as Tier Two Capital will be determined pursuant to applicable Colombian banking law and regulations.\n\n## Currency Rate Indemnity\n\nThe Bank has agreed that, if a judgment or order made by any court for the payment of any amount in respect of any Subordinated Notes is expressed in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the Bank will indemnify the relevant Subordinated Note Holder against any deficiency arising from any variation in rates of exchange between the date as of which the denomination currency is notionally converted into the judgment currency for the purposes of the judgment or order and the date of actual payment. This indemnity will constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Bank's other obligations under the Subordinated Debt Indentures, will",
