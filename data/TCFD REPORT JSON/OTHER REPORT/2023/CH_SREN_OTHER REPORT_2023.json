        "page_content": "## Letter to shareholders\n\n'Swiss Re's strong result in such demanding times demonstrates that our business model is intact.'\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nSwiss Re can look back on a successful year as it achieved all of its 2023 financial targets, including generating USD 3.2 billion net income. Net premiums earned and fee income rose to USD 45 billion, a record, while return on equity (ROE) was 22.3%. Our improved profitability supports the Board of Directors' proposal to increase the ordinary dividend per share by 6%.\n\nNumerous factors drove our 2023 performance. Improved price adequacy within the property and casualty market after strong renewals, coupled with underwriting discipline, helped us manage elevated industry losses from natural catastrophes. Higher interest rates lifted our investment income. While mortality in the US remains elevated, it has declined from its 2021 peak.\n\nTo be sure, last year was characteristic of the volatile era we live in: a new war in the Middle East began while the war in Ukraine continued; for a fourth consecutive year, global insured losses from natural catastrophes exceeded USD 100 billion; and economic inflation also remained at higher levels than in recent decades.\n\nSwiss Re's strong result in such demanding times demonstrates that our business model is intact, enabling us to continue providing the sophisticated risk knowledge and peak risk capacity that our clients require to navigate existing and future perils.\n\n2023 also marked the 160th anniversary of Swiss Re's founding. More than a century and a half after we got our start in Zurich in\n\n1863, the company remains well placed to continue delivering on its purpose: making the world more resilient.\n\nFrom the outset, Swiss Re has adapted to changing demands, a process that continues. In the second quarter of 2023, we re-cast our businesses into marketfacing units by establishing separate Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) and Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re) Business Units, as well as a new Global Clients & Solutions Business Unit that embodies our strategic push to go beyond risk transfer by offering risk insights and cultivating risk partnerships. Corporate Solutions, Swiss Re's commercial insurance arm, was not impacted by these changes.\n\nAs part of this transformation of our Reinsurance businesses, we removed an entire organisational layer, making our underwriting and decision-making more efficient and bringing us closer to clients. Swiss Re is wholly committed to building an organisation that is leaner, nimbler and more responsive to the evolving risk-protection needs of our clients.\n\nSwiss Re is well positioned to benefit from the current reinsurance market environment, while our investment portfolio is expected to be supported by higher interest rates. After the strong performance in 2023, we are focused on further improving business performance, while managing challenges with rigour and vigilance.\n\n## Group and business performance\n\nSwiss Re reported net income of USD 3.2 billion, up from USD 472 million in 2022, when results were significantly impacted by Hurricane Ian.

At constant foreign exchange rates, 2023 premiums earned increased by 4.9%.\n\nOur full-year return on investments (ROI) increased materially to 3.4% from 2.0% in 2022. The recurring income yield rose to 3.6% for 2023 from 2.6%, as higher interest rates contributed positively to our reinvestment strategy. This trend was even more pronounced in the fourth quarter, when the recurring income yield rose to 3.9% and the reinvestment yield was 5.0%.\n\nSwiss Re's capital position remained strong, with the Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio materially above the 200-250% target range as of 1 January 2024.\n\nAll of these factors support the Board of Directors' decision to propose an increased ordinary dividend of USD 6.80 per share.\n\nP&C Re posted net income of USD 1.9 billion for 2023, compared with USD 312 million in 2022. The solid result was driven by a resilient underwriting performance and disciplined renewals. Strong margins and positive reserve developments in property and speciality lines helped offset significant reserve strengthening in the casualty business. In addition, the result was supported by a solid investment performance. The reported combined ratio was 94.8%1, meeting the target of less than 95%.\n\nLarge natural catastrophe claims were USD 1.3 billion2, below the full-year budget of USD 1.7 billion, based on higher attachment points and adjusted risk sharing. Swiss Re's largest claims\n\npayments were linked to the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, where we paid over USD 500 million to assist the region's recovery. Swiss Re also shouldered claims from Cyclone Gabrielle and flooding in New Zealand, as well as from Hurricane Otis and storms in Europe.\n\nL&H Re reported net income of USD 976 million for 2023, above the USD 900 million full-year target and more than double the USD 416 million from the year earlier. L&H Re benefitted from active in-force portfolio management and a strong investment result, which offset elevated mortality claims in the US.\n\nCorporate Solutions delivered another strong performance, as net income resumed growth in 2023 to USD 678 million, compared with USD 486 million in 2022. Portfolio steering and underwriting discipline underpinned our book of business's resilience, while higher recurring investment income also lifted performance. Corporate Solutions achieved a full-year combined ratio of 91.7%1, outperforming the full-year target of less than 94%.\n\n## Sustainability remains in focus\n\nSwiss Re's commitment to sustainability is unwavering. The company is implementing its Group Sustainability Strategy 2023-2025, which rests on two pillars: advancing the net-zero transition and building societal resilience.\n\nSwiss Re aims to play a role in facilitating the transition to low-carbon economies. This includes efforts to de-risk transition projects, providing reinsurance capacity to renewable energy infrastructure, continuing our own efforts to\n\n'All of these factors support the Board of Directors' decision to propose an increased ordinary dividend of USD 6.80 per share.'",

Our P&C Re Business Unit has also launched the Centre of Competence for Renewable Energy, to help clients understand and manage the complexities associated with renewable energy technologies.\n\nIn asset management, we achieved a 45% reduction of the weighted average carbon intensity of Swiss Re's corporate bond and listed equity portfolio as of 2023, relative to the 2018 baseline.\n\nIn addition to climate mitigation efforts, Swiss Re aims to help build societal resilience by enhancing disaster resilience and helping extend the reach of financial protection to more people. For instance, Swiss Re aims to make insurance more available, accessible and affordable.\n\nMoreover, products such as our parametric flood risk solution are contributing to extending protection to low- and middleincome communities in New York City neighbourhoods vulnerable to inundation during hurricanes or other extreme weather.\n\nIt is our ambition to promote leadership diversity across the company. Swiss Re is committed to an environment that encourages personal and professional growth for all employees.\n\nPlease see our 2023 Sustainability Report which will be submitted for the first time for a vote to the 2024 Annual General Meeting - for more about these and other initiatives at Swiss Re.\n\n## Outlook and new profitability targets\n\nIn 2024, we continue to emphasise underwriting discipline, which was visible in the successful January renewals. P&C Re renewed treaty contracts resulting in USD 13.1 billion in premium volume. This represents a 9% volume increase compared with the business that was up for renewal. Our focus on costs and strengthening proximity to our clients also remains paramount.\n\nOf course, many risks persist. Two wars continue, and with them geopolitical turbulence. The 1 January 2024 earthquake in Japan reminded us that the biggest threats materialise without warning. Mortality remains elevated in key markets. We also continue to closely monitor social inflation in the US.\n\nStill, we anticipate an attractive reinsurance market environment to continue in 2024. An improved risk-sharing equilibrium enables Swiss Re to build on its strengths: partnering with our insurance clients to provide sufficient risk-transfer capacity to manage peak perils and recover from them when they become reality.\n\nWith our transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) on 1 January 2024, we re-affirm the targets announced in December 2023, including IFRS net income exceeding USD 3.6 billion this year.",

Great city fires had laid waste to cities across both Europe and the US. In 1861, Switzerland witnessed its own city fire in Glarus, an event which made it clear that insurance alone was inadequate to cover such an unusually large catastrophe. In December 1863, Schweizerische R\u00fcckversicherungs-Gesellschaft, today's Swiss Re, was founded.\n\nAs Swiss Re has grown, so too has the complexity of the interconnected risks that its clients and partners are exposed to. Today, people face new issues such as the challenges of rapid digitalisation and the transformation of energy supplies as societies work to counteract the powerful forces contributing to a\n\nwarming planet. Thanks to its longstanding expertise in risk management, Swiss Re is adept at tackling an everchanging risk landscape to meet the challenges ahead.\n\n## Modest beginnings to great endeavours\n\nWhen Swiss Re moved into its original two-room office in Zurich's historic old town, the fledgling company initially focused on fire and marine cover, and soon after began supporting clients with life reinsurance.\n\nToday, more than 14 000 Swiss Re employees operate out of around 80 offices globally. Swiss Re's world view has always been international. Right from the beginning, its founders recognised not only the necessity of swiftly expanding\n\nrisk pools into broad geographies, but also the opportunities that accompanied a global approach.\n\nTo ensure that the legacy of its great founders lives on, Swiss Re continues to build strong client relationships, to maintain an excellent capital position and to strive to be the best possible workplace for talented, motivated people who are committed to strengthening the company's performance and achieving its business goals.\n\nThe world and its risks have greatly evolved since Swiss Re was founded more than a century and a half ago, but the company's purpose endures - to help make the world more resilient.",

Types of risk transfer include: traditional property and casualty, and life and health re/insurance; large and complex transactions; and public sector risk transfer, where we work with governments.\n\n## Risk insights - helping our clients better understand and take risks\n\nOur research, solutions and tools enable an improved understanding of risks and opportunities. We leverage new technology, specifically data and analytics capabilities, to further our ability to offer services and risk insights that help our clients and partners make more data-driven decisions and take risks.\n\n## Risk partnerships - working with others to find new and innovative ways to process, transfer and diversify risk\n\nThrough strong partnerships, we create platforms to process, transfer and diversify risks. This includes access to capital markets, business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) products, public-private partnerships and new ecosystems.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, where it was founded in 1863, the Swiss Re Group has approximately 14 700 employees and operates through a network of offices in 29 countries. Swiss Re Ltd, the Group's holding company, is a joint stock company listed in accordance with the International Reporting Standards on SIX Swiss Exchange.\n\nSince 3 April 2023, Swiss Re has four Business Units. Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re), Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) and Corporate Solutions provide products and services to distinct client segments. Global Clients & Solutions (GCS) provides risk insights and develops risk partnerships.\n\nSwiss Re conducts business in the areas of reinsurance, insurance and asset management, in accordance with its Articles of Association. In re/insurance, Swiss Re assumes risks and in turn receives premiums.\n\nThe company generates earnings by underwriting risks and investing premiums, as well as through fee revenues for providing risk insights and services to clients. Swiss Re's client base mainly consists of insurance companies that provide services to individuals and small and larger businesses, and of large corporates and government entities.\n\nUnderwriting risks is at the core of Swiss Re's business model, and entails assessing, pricing and assuming insurance risks. Swiss Re receives a premium payment from clients for transferring risks to its balance sheet and compensating for the client's losses, in line with Swiss Re's contractual obligations, should an insured event occur.\n\nSwiss Re assumes life and health risks as well as property and casualty risks from its globally diversified client base, including risks related to natural perils, such as earthquakes or tropical cyclones.\n\nThere are two basic forms of reinsurance: in facultative reinsurance each risk or policy is negotiated and agreed on individually, while in obligatory or treaty reinsurance, the insurer and reinsurer are bound by an obligation to transfer and assume a contractually agreed share of a whole portfolio of risks.\n\nDepending on the duration of the risk transfer contract and the type of business, it can take anywhere from a few days to many years between the premium payment, the notification of a potentially insured event and the payment of claims or benefits. During this time, reserves for expected losses are prudently managed.\n\nTo meet future claims and benefits, Swiss Re invests the premiums generated through underwriting in assets whose cash flows largely match the durations and currencies of its re/insurance liabilities.\n\nTo efficiently manage its capital, Swiss Re has a well-diversified underwriting portfolio across business lines and regions, and transfers peak risks to external third parties through retrocession or capital market instruments such as insurancelinked securities.\n\nSwiss Re plays its part in providing stability to the broader insurance industry and society at large by absorbing shocks, particularly from disastrous events. Through its ability to assess, price, transfer and diversify risks, Swiss Re reduces financial volatility within wider society, thereby making the world more resilient to adverse events.\n\nSwiss Re's profound understanding of risk is a core element of its business. The company uses its proprietary risk knowledge in its business decisions, and provides clients with data-driven risk insights, analytical tools and advisory services in return for a fee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read the full report here\n\nFinancial Report 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

This shows how we have made Swiss Re a great place to work.\n\n## How has the recent shift in working culture affected HR's role within Swiss Re?\n\nAs flexible and hybrid work is now the norm, HR's role is to unite a diverse and global workforce around a shared purpose to foster innovation, collaboration and productivity.\n\nWith this new way of working, we need to make sure our people remain empowered and feel able to take the best decisions possible for our business. I'm pleased to say that three quarters of respondents in our 2023 employee survey felt their office environment and workplace services supported their productivity.\n\n## How is HR helping employees and managers adapt to this new work environment?\n\nTrust is key in a successful organisation, and it flows both ways between line managers and their teams. HR advocates and fosters the mindset shift required for this new and flexible working environment. For example, managers now need to coach and enable their teams just as much as they need to manage them. We're here to help managers adapt to leading more empowered, accountable employees by focusing on leadership development through training programmes.\n\nHR also encourages all Swiss Re employees to step up and 'be CEO' of their own jobs. This starts with recruiting the right people for the right roles and then supporting them throughout their career at Swiss Re, from onboarding to professional development and employee wellbeing support.\n\n## What were your biggest achievements in 2023?\n\nIn early 2023, Swiss Re announced the formation of its new Business Units. Firstly, the work my team and I did on the organisational design helped simplify the structure to get us closer to clients and partners, and sharpen our focus on performance.\n\nSecondly, HR supported the transformation by evolving our company culture and providing line managers with a framework to further empower employees. These efforts are paying off; in a recent employee survey, 80% of respondents said that they feel there is a strong sense of accountability among colleagues and that they have the authority to make decisions in their role.\n\n## What are your priorities in 2024?\n\nThis year is about focusing on execution and delivery so that we can win in the market. We need to look ahead and make sure Swiss Re has the high-performing people required to deliver results. As part of this, I will be prioritising talent management and leadership development, as well as recruiting new talent.\n\nAnother priority is to continue to drive our culture of simplicity, accountability and speed, while keeping our caring and inclusive spirit.

With a focus on five diversity themes, the following initiatives help embed inclusion throughout Swiss Re to drive diversity and resilience.\n\n## Gender\n\nAdvancing gender parity and increasing female representation is central to Swiss Re's DEI goals. Swiss Re is committed to increasing the proportion of women in senior management positions. Swiss Re's ambition is to reach 35% female representation in executive and senior management by the end of 2027. Swiss Re aims to increase the number of women who join the company at all levels by ensuring diverse candidate slates and selection panels as well as equitable recruitment and hiring practices.\n\n## Generations\n\nSwiss Re wants to attract and retain employees across all generations, to learn from experienced colleagues and integrate those entering the workforce. This intergenerational mix drives Swiss Re's innovation and growth. Employees have flexible working options thanks to Swiss Re's Own The Way You Work\u2122 policy and benefits that are tailored to various stages of life. In 2022, Swiss Re's Kids House was introduced to support families. It provides flexible childcare for working parents in Zurich and since 2023 also offers regular care for up to five days per week.\n\n## Equalising minimum parental leave\n\nIn 2023, Swiss Re introduced a new parental leave policy, equalising minimum parental leave globally to give employees better opportunities to raise their families and manage their work-life balance. Employees who become parents through birth, adoption, surrogacy or foster placement are eligible for the newly defined minimum parental leave. Primary caregivers receive a minimum of\n\n- 16 weeks and secondary caregivers get a minimum of four weeks of paid leave.\n\n## 500under30\n\nThe purpose of 500under30 is to connect young professionals at Swiss Re through tailored activities. The network opens up opportunities for people across different generations and job functions to work together. It provides networking opportunities, presentations by business leaders and access to learning materials. Launched in Switzerland, the 500under30 network continues to grow and is now operating in Swiss Re's South Africa and Slovakia offices.\n\n## AccelHERate\n\nAmong Swiss Re's many women's initiatives is AccelHERate, a flagship female leadership development programme at Swiss Re Global Business Solutions India. The programme is designed to develop female leaders by giving them the edge needed to grow in their careers, creating a pool of future leaders at Swiss Re. AccelHERate is successfully running its second cohort. According to Swiss Re's 2023 DEI Report, more than 40% of participants from the first cohort have advanced their careers due to the programme; approximately 20% have been promoted, 15% have become new line managers and 5% have changed to a more fulfilling role.\n\n## Flex+\n\nFlex+ is Swiss Re's flexible working model that facilitates a gradual approach towards retirement in Switzerland. Based on the Swiss Re Pension Fund Regulations, it allows employees between 58 and 65 to voluntarily reduce their responsibilities and/or working hours. While there is a corresponding salary adjustment, Swiss Re continues its contribution to their pension fund based on the previous level of employment. This flexible transition to retirement enables the company to preserve valuable institutional knowledge while also meeting the changing needs and expectations of employees nearing retirement.",

The company is working towards being more representative of the local markets it operates in. For example, teams in South Africa, the UK and the US are providing development opportunities to people of colour in the organisation, such as mentorship programmes and reverse-mentorships, where a junior employee fills in gaps in a more experienced person's knowledge. In growing a diverse talent pipeline, Swiss Re also supports a number of apprenticeship opportunities and engages in external partnerships to enhance racial and ethnic diversity.\n\n## LGBTI+\n\nSwiss Re is committed to providing a safe, equal-opportunity work environment for LGBTI+ employees. The company has signed the United Nation's Free & Equal Standards of Conduct to tackle discrimination against LGBTI+ people. In 2019, Swiss Re attained 'Embassy Status', which means that all leave (parental and bereavement), gift and insurance (medical, death and critical illness) benefits now extend to LGBTI+ partners as well as unmarried heterosexual partners across all locations. In the few locations where a significant cultural or legal barrier still exists, Swiss Re continues to work on solutions.\n\n## Mental health\n\nSwiss Re is working hard to break down the stigma surrounding mental health issues by making employees feel comfortable about communicating both mental and physical health issues without fear of judgment. The company has joined the Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental Health by signing a public pledge to advance progress in workplace mental health. Swiss Re also supports its employees by promoting a healthy working culture, notably through its flexible working initiative Own The Way You Work\u2122 and its Employee Assistance Programmes.\n\n## Sponsorship programme for people of colour\n\nSponsorship programmes can help support the career advancement of underrepresented talent. Swiss Re launched an 18-month programme for people of colour in the US and Switzerland. It pairs Managing Directorlevel leaders with high-potential people of colour to support their development. The sponsorship includes learning opportunities and coaching, advocacy and endorsement from participants' sponsors, which aims to elevate the employees' profile and visibility in the organisation and potentially lead to new career opportunities.\n\n## myGwork\n\nSwiss Re is a proud partner of myGwork, the global business community for LGBTI+ professionals, students, inclusive employers and anyone who believes in workplace equality. The community seeks to empower the LGBTI+ community by offering members a safe space where they can connect with inclusive employers and find jobs, mentors, professional events and news. Swiss Re is also partnering with myGwork to recruit talent from the LGBTI+ community.\n\n## Pathways\n\nPathways, Swiss Re's Mental Health Network, is dedicated to raising awareness of mental health challenges, overcoming mental health misconceptions and taboos, and fostering an environment of open conversations to strengthen resilience. The global network comprises mental health champions - employees who take the time to listen, advocate for mental health in their circles and refer people to professional help if necessary.\n\n## Mosaic and Kaleidoscope Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)\n\nThe ERG Mosaic promotes an inclusive environment for people of colour to enhance their professional and personal development across the company and within society. Mosaic drives mentoring initiatives, builds community through networking opportunities, supports recruiting processes and partners with the DEI Council and Human Resources. The Kaleidoscope ERG's purpose is to ensure that people of different identities, ethnicities, nationalities and cultures at Swiss Re are empowered, ensuring equal opportunities and fostering an inclusive workplace that encourages people to be their authentic selves.\n\n## Together with Pride (TwP)\n\nTwP's mission is to create an inclusive workplace that empowers Swiss Re's diverse workforce - including LGBTI+ employees - to be their whole selves at work. The Employee Resource Group fosters an environment of belonging, where LGBTI+ colleagues can fully contribute to Swiss Re's sustainable business performance. The ally network actively increases awareness and equity among all Swiss Re employees so that the unique challenges faced by the LGBTI+ workforce are recognised and overcome.

In 2008 he joined the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) as Chief Executive Officer. He returned to Swiss Re as Group Chief Risk Officer and member of the Group Executive Committee in 2014. He is Chairman of the Group Sustainability Council.\n\n## Why is sustainability a key strategic area for the insurance industry?\n\nSustainability has been a strategic priority for the insurance industry for many years. Not only do sustainability topics have a material impact on our business activities, but the insurance industry also plays an important role in tackling sustainability challenges and providing peace of mind to individuals and businesses.\n\nAs a result, stakeholders ranging from shareholders to clients and from regulators to civil society have heightened expectations for companies to improve their sustainability performance. Therefore,\n\na proactive approach to managing sustainability risks and opportunities is key to our license to operate.\n\nEmbedding sustainability across all our business activities - including operations, investments and underwriting - allows us to increase our own company's resilience as well as that of our clients and partners.\n\n## Which sustainability-related issues are most significant for insurers and Swiss Re?\n\nClimate change and energy security remain a top global priority.

Beyond that, social impact is also gaining increasing relevance.\n\nIn 2022, Swiss Re conducted a materiality assessment by surveying a wide range of internal and external stakeholders to identify the most material sustainability topics for our company. Climate change, natural catastrophe protection, decarbonisation and financial inclusion were rated as topics where Swiss Re's activities potentially have the highest societal impact.\n\nFinancial inclusion is an important social topic that refers to the availability, accessibility and affordability of financial services such as insurance. This is particularly relevant for ensuring that individuals have sufficient financial protection against life and health risks.\n\n## Can you explain Swiss Re's Group Sustainability Strategy, which was updated at the end of 2022?\n\nBased on the materiality assessment conducted in 2022, we adjusted the Group Sustainability Strategy. The strategy focuses on two sustainability ambitions: advancing the net-zero transition and building societal resilience.\n\nThe first ambition centres on climate mitigation and decarbonisation, in line with Swiss Re's ambition to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across our entire business. The second ambition focuses on disaster resilience including climate adaptation - and financial inclusion.\n\nUnderpinning our strategy are three sustainability enablers that help us deliver on our commitments. First, we\n\nrecognise that our sustainability efforts must begin with and build on our own people and operations. To this end, we were one of the first multi-national firms to set a triple-digit internal carbon price, which incentivises action on our operational emissions reduction while raising the funds to purchase high-quality carbon removal certificates. Second, our ESG Risk Framework helps limit our exposure to downside sustainability risks.\n\nAll of this is supported by a robust governance structure with strategic discussions relating to sustainability taking place at the Group Sustainability Council, Group Executive Committee and Board-level committees.\n\n## What have been the key achievements since the strategy's launch?\n\nWe have made significant progress on our ambition to advance the net-zero transition, particularly on the underwriting side of the business. In 2023, we published insurance-associated emissions in line with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials standard for the first time. While climate targets were already in place for our operations and asset management, in 2023 we also set near- and medium-term targets for underwriting that aim to increase the share of companies aligned to net-zero 2050 in our single risk re/insurance portfolios.\n\nWhen it comes to our own operations, in 2023, which was the first full year without COVID-19 travel restrictions, we reduced greenhouse gas emissions from business air travel by more than 60% compared to the baseline year 2018.\n\n## How is Swiss Re helping clients to address sustainability issues?\n\nWe help clients address key environmental and social challenges. We do so by building on our established modelling and\n\n'Embedding sustainability across all our business activities allows us to increase our own company's resilience as well as that of our clients and partners.'",

For example, in 2023, Swiss Re provided reinsurance cover for the construction and operation of over 20 wind farms, solar farms and battery energy storage systems in the Philippines - thereby supporting the country's renewable energy goals.\n\nThrough our long-standing public-private partnerships with Turkey and Morocco, our earthquake reinsurance provided much-needed disaster resilience in the wake of the devastating earthquakes that struck both countries.\n\nAnother example is our parametric flood risk solution, which contributes to financial inclusion by specifically supporting low- and middle-income communities in New York City's flood-prone neighbourhoods.\n\n## How does Swiss Re tackle emerging sustainability risks and opportunities?\n\nIdentification and monitoring of relevant developments are key to managing risks and seizing opportunities. Swiss Re has several expert teams supporting the early detection and monitoring of relevant sustainability trends, including technology trends on the path to a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn addition, both Corporate Solutions and P&C Re have dedicated centres of competence for renewable energy. We are investing in the knowledge, data and expertise our clients need to navigate this complex and evolving risk landscape.\n\n## What are the priorities for the coming years?\n\nWe must be prepared to meet increasing and globally fragmented sustainabilityrelated disclosure and regulatory requirements.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, if we want to increase societal resilience, we must pursue two strategies: reducing expected losses and expanding insurance coverage. We aim to continue to provide quality coverage for clients, narrow the protection gap and foster financial inclusion.\n\nWe will continue to diligently implement our decarbonisation targets and measure our progress against those targets.\n\nFinally, we can only make the world more resilient if our organisation remains resilient.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read the full report here\n\n<!-- image -->",

Together, they allow Swiss Re to realise its sustainability mission to invest, operate and share knowledge in a way that tackles sustainability challenges and creates long-term value.\n\n## Sustainability ambitions\n\n## Ambition 1: advancing the net-zero transition\n\nSwiss Re strives to minimise the environmental impacts of its business and has committed to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. To achieve this, Swiss Re focuses on:\n\n- \u00b7 Committing to a decarbonisation pathway and setting GHG emission reduction targets for assets, liabilities and operations\n- \u00b7 Providing risk transfer solutions and investments to advance the net-zero transition across different sectors\n- \u00b7 Engaging with clients and stakeholders, building on Swiss Re's risk knowledge\n\n## Ambition 2: building societal resilience\n\nSwiss Re helps build societal resilience by enhancing disaster resilience and fostering financial inclusion in both advanced and emerging economies by:\n\n- \u00b7 Narrowing the natural catastrophe protection gap by offering respective re/insurance products and services, including advancing climate adaptation\n- \u00b7 Fostering financial inclusion with a focus on household financial protection and healthcare protection\n- \u00b7 Engaging with clients and stakeholders, building on Swiss Re's risk knowledge\n\nBuilding on Swiss Re's risk knowledge, stakeholder and client engagement plays an important role in the implementation of the two ambitions of the GSS.\n\n## Group Sustainability Strategy 2023-2025:\n\n## Swiss Re's vision\n\nWe make the world more resilient.\n\n## Sustainability mission\n\nWe insure, invest, operate and share our knowledge in a way that tackles sustainability challenges and creates long-term value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdvancing the net-zero transition\n\nBuilding societal  resilience\n\n## Sustainability enablers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability ambitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeople and operations\n\nESG risk management\n\nGovernance and compliance\n\n## Sustainability enablers\n\nKey to delivering on the sustainability ambitions is a resilient organisation.

At the start of the year, a significant economic contraction was widely expected given the sharp jump in interest rates. It was believed that the US Federal Reserve would succeed in its efforts to combat inflation, but at the cost of a US labour market softening.\n\nWhat we actually witnessed was inflation slowing and economies generally remaining resilient as Central Banks ensured liquidity\n\nand stability. While European economies fared relatively well, stagnating but not experiencing a recession, the US economy was most notable for remaining buoyant. This was driven by government stimulus packages and continued strong consumer spending, as well as optimism around the promise of significant future AI-based productivity benefits.\n\nAnd let's not forget that in 2023, there were dislocations that would have previously shaken the confidence of markets to the core. In March, we saw the collapse of a number of US regional banks, and the denouement of the Credit Suisse story.",

        "page_content": "I am proud to say that we in Asset Management navigated through these challenges successfully with limited impact on our portfolio.\n\n## As Swiss Re's Group CIO, what are your top priorities for 2024?\n\nMy priorities for Asset Management for this year are clear - to continue to deliver on plan, and remain a sustainable contributor to Swiss Re's profitability and return on equity. In short, this means delivering on investment targets and prudently managing exposures, with a laser focus on the quality of the portfolio. We will also continue to build out our private market assets, in particular our private infrastructure debt investments, a platform which we started over ten years ago and something that truly differentiates us.\n\n## How will emerging trends, AI in particular, impact or reshape your approach to investing?\n\nGenerative AI has many implications for all organisations, especially for knowledgebased firms like ours. In Asset Management, we are actively assessing how the technology can best support the work we do - for instance, how it can help us identify opportunities - but just as importantly, how we can use generative AI to flag risks before they manifest. Overall, technologies such as AI should be viewed less as a threat and more as something to be harnessed and used to improve decisionmaking and productivity - and to make better investments.\n\n## Can you tell us a bit about yourself, your career path and how those experiences fit with your current role?\n\nI have had a very international upbringing and have lived and worked across three continents. I have always been open to exploring new opportunities and do not shy away from the unknown, factors that have shaped my career so far. This mindset has served me well and led me from a career in consulting to taking the role of Head of Private Equity at Swiss Re, expanding my scope as Co-Head of Client Solutions & Analytics and, of course, recently taking the Swiss Re Group CIO role. Throughout that journey, I have constantly challenged myself to learn and evolve.\n\nI have learned that regardless of your role, the value of developing a strategic mindset should never be underestimated - and that, ultimately, all successful organisations are built on their people. In any leadership position, it comes down to how you empower your teams, how you inspire them, how well you understand their needs and how you communicate to get maximum buy-in.\n\n## What attracted you to Swiss Re in the first place?\n\nI had long been intrigued by the history of the firm as a knowledge-based organisation. In fact, I had already worked with Swiss Re Asset Management in an advisory capacity, so I knew firsthand that the expertise and know-how of the organisation were, in my opinion, second to none. People here are driven, super smart and willing to make the right decision - even when it is a difficult one. This focus on what I call 'True North' is inspirational and made the decision to come to Swiss Re relatively easy. Last but not least, Swiss Re's vision to make the world more resilient is something that resonates deeply with me on a personal level.\n\n## What advice would you give someone starting out or looking to advance their career?\n\nAnybody starting their career should have an open mind. This is super important as a career spans many decades, and you don't know at the start what you will enjoy or even where your true skills lie. Indeed, I always make a point of advising new joiners at Swiss Re to avoid a myopic view of where their career will take them.\n\nInstead, I urge them to be open to new opportunities and challenges, and to always look to expand their horizons even if that means straying outside of their comfort zone. They should always ask themselves what more they can learn and how they can best contribute. The people you work with also make a huge difference and this is an important factor to consider when joining an organisation. Working life is so much more fun if you can have a great time with your colleagues - which is what I have been experiencing here at Swiss Re since I joined.\n\n'People here are driven, super smart and willing to make the right decision even when it is a difficult one.'",

        "page_content": "## Market trends\n\nSwiss Re examines the main trends that influenced the global economy and re/insurance markets in 2023. The following topics will continue to impact global and industry resilience in 2024 and beyond.\n\n## Economic outlook: slowing global growth\n\nGlobal economic growth is set to slow in 2024 as the growth impetuses of 2023 fade and the lagged impact of higher interest rates continue to filter through to the real economy. Swiss Re Institute forecasts global real GDP growth of 2.4% in 2024, down from 2.6% in 2023. Regional discrepancies will persist with Europe's economy continuing to underperform the US and China.\n\nInflation pressures are also expected to slow further, including underlying core inflation. Nominal wage growth is also subsequently set to slow meaningfully with lower headline inflation, suggesting that significant second-round effects from the past inflation surge are unlikely. However, geopolitical issues or other external shocks could pose upside risks to inflation in 2024.\n\nThe widespread progress on achieving disinflation has allowed the focus for 2024 to shift to central bank interest rate cuts. Some emerging market central banks have already started lowering policy interest rates and will continue to do so in 2024. Among advanced markets, the European Central Bank has a higher chance of starting to cut interest rates before the US Federal Reserve given the euro area's weaker economy.\n\n## Inflation in 2023: continued progress\n\nInflation remains a concern for insurers because it leads to higher claims and erodes real premium growth. While the impact of incremental economic inflation on claims is set to ease further over the course of next year, social inflation is likely to remain an issue that needs monitoring for claims, especially in the US.\n\nIn 2023, headline inflation rates eased notably after their peak in 2022. The relief came mostly from changes in global energy prices. However, core consumer inflation pressures, which strip out the more volatile energy and food price components, reached new highs in 2023 in the US and Europe. This is largely due to strong labour markets, which have kept wage growth elevated, subsequently filtering through to service prices. Nominal wage inflation, however, now appears to have peaked in developed markets.\n\nAccording to Swiss Re Institute forecasts, inflation is expected to moderate in advanced economies in 2024 and 2025. However, inflation is expected to remain volatile and be higher in the next decade than in the pre-COVID decade. This is due to structural factors, such as deglobalisation and geopolitics, decarbonisation and climate change, and debt and demographics.\n\n## Interest rates in 2023: a higher policy rate regime\n\nThe new higher interest rate regime continued to mature in 2023.\n\nDeveloped market central banks raised policy interest rates further in the first half of 2023, reaching levels seen prior to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. In the second half of the year, central banks paused rate increases as inflation slowed, keeping interest rates unchanged throughout the rest of the year. By contrast, several central banks in emerging markets already started to cut interest rates in 2023, after being the first movers in the monetary policy tightening cycle.\n\nLonger-dated sovereign bond yields in developed markets moved notably higher in nominal and real terms in 2023 and peaked at multi-year highs in the autumn, before falling again towards the end of the year as a result of disinflation progress and expectations for central bank rate cuts in 2024. Bond market volatility was also elevated throughout the year, with the MOVE index (US bond market volatility index) well above the average for the past decade.\n\nCentral bank interest rates are important for insurers, as these constitute a risk-free rate of return for their fixed income investments. With higher levels of interest rates, insurers have a more positive investment outlook, especially compared with the ultra-low interest rate environment of the 2010s. It will take some time for insurers to fully reap the benefits of higher investment yields, as these are contingent on when bond holdings mature and are reinvested.",

        "page_content": "## Social inflation\n\nThe term social inflation refers to the increase of insured claims beyond what you would expect from pure economic considerations, such as wages or core consumer price inflation.\n\nInsurers writing third party liability and motor business are impacted most by this trend. Currently, the issue is most prominent in the US, where insured losses from liability claims surged by 16% per year over the past five years. This is well above average rates of economic inflation of around 4%.\n\nSocial inflation is being driven by several factors. Social sentiment and jury attitudes reflect beliefs that corporations should be held accountable for damage done towards individuals and society.\n\nAccording to Swiss Re research, 71% of the US population thinks that punitive damages are the best way to deter corporations from wrongdoings.\n\nWhat's more, access to justice is becoming easier. Third-party litigation funding allows for better-funded cases and the number of TV advertisements for legal services in the US has increased by 93% between 2014 and mid-2022.\n\nAt the same time, legal concepts are being tested, opening new venues for litigation such as climate change and addictive software design.\n\nSwiss Re addresses the issue of social inflation proactively through a wide range of measures. These include increasing research into understanding the underlying drivers, working with clients to ensure risk-adequate rates and proactive claims handling for increased liability risks, and repositioning the portfolio towards less exposed segments.\n\n## Key publication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsigma 6/2023: Risks on the rise as headwinds blow stronger: global economic and insurance market outlook 2024-25\n\n## Find more information at\n\nswissre.com\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Market context\n\n## Increasing natural catastrophe losses\n\nAccording to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2023 was the hottest year on record and climate science predicts that global average temperatures will continue to rise in the future.\n\nOver the long term, the changing climate will translate into changes in frequency and intensity of weather-related natural catastrophes, which could contribute to increasing insured losses for certain perils in some regions in the future. The dominant drivers of rising natural catastrophe losses remain economic development, concentration of assets in exposed areas, urbanisation and changing vulnerabilities. Insured losses from natural disasters in 2023 exceeded USD 100 billion for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nA feature of the large losses for 2023 was the accumulation of low single-digit billion-dollar events. In total, severe convective storms, one of the secondary perils, were the main contributor to losses for the first time. In the US alone, there were 18 individual severe convective storms that exceeded USD 1 billion in insured losses in 2023.\n\nOther secondary perils, such as wildfires or flooding, also contributed to the elevated losses in 2023. Wildfire losses were present in several parts of the world, from Southern Europe to Canada and the US, while flooding affected all regions. Globally, 60% of insured losses have been caused by secondary perils in the past ten years, reinforcing the need to more rigorously consider these perils when assessing and mitigating natural catastrophe risk.\n\n## Property catastrophe pricing cycle\n\nWhile there is high volatility associated with natural catastrophes, insured losses have been growing by 5-7% per year, a trend expected to continue.\n\nProperty nat cat pricing remains a function of a dynamically changing risk landscape, as well as supply and demand dynamics.\n\nApart from climate change, higher claims costs are also driven by urbanisation in areas exposed to natural catastrophes; economic inflation affecting key claims costs, such as rebuilding expenses; and increasing wealth leading to greater losses when disaster strikes.\n\nAccording to the Guy Carpenter Property Catastrophe Rate on Line Index, natural catastrophe pricing rose for the sixth consecutive year. The 27.5% increase in 2023 was the largest jump in the current hard market cycle. The underwriting discipline associated with this hard market is expected to continue into 2024, as observed during the 1 January 2024 treaty renewals.\n\n## Related research\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExplore Swiss Re Institute's extensive research on climate and natural catastrophe risk\n\n## Find more information at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nswissre.com",

        "page_content": "## Life expectancy trends\n\nOver the past decade, life expectancies have plateaued in advanced markets. In 2023, landmark research from Swiss Re Institute, The future of life expectancy, investigated the reasons for slower mortality improvements.\n\nThere are various drivers of this trend. The positive impact of advances in cardiovascular diseases, such as smoking cessation, anti-hypertensives and statins, have already been realised, with minimal additional gains expected in years to come. The impact of obesity and its related health impacts, such as type 2 diabetes, is rising.\n\nRecently, excess mortality has been driven by COVID-19 and poor cardio-metabolic health, with a smaller contribution from opioid addictions and violent deaths in the US. Life expectancy is slowly trending back towards baseline expectations, especially as COVID-19 moved from a pandemic to an endemic status in 2023.\n\nMedical advances that have the potential to drive the next wave of mortality improvements are on the horizon. The earlier detection of conditions such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease is becoming more achievable due to emerging medical technologies or developments such as artificial intelligence.\n\nThe shift from more general therapies to personalised and precision medicines, such as mRNA vaccines for cancer in conjunction with immunotherapy, are expected to boost survival rates.\n\nPerhaps the greatest advances can come from lifestyle choices. Improving metabolic health through good diets, reduction of smoking and alcohol, keeping active, and getting enough sleep may just be the key to living longer.\n\nIn the longer term, a range of positive developments must come to fruition in order to build a strong case for continued mortality improvements. Ongoing investment in medical research is key, supported by public health policies and, increasingly, by individuals taking responsibility for their own health.\n\nSwiss Re's L&H Re business is employing a more balanced and robust portfolio with emphasis on large, global and diversified business lines and embedding long-term analyses of past trends with a forwardlooking view of medical advances, societal changes and technological developments.\n\n## Key publication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe future of life expectancy: forecasting long-term mortality improvement trends for insurance\n\n## Find more information at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nswissre.com",

Such scale brings the benefits of diversification, and P&C Re is wellpositioned across different geographies as well as property, casualty and specialty lines. Our strength is derived from our leading client franchise and strong relationships rooted in years of partnership. We are often the first port of call for our clients, who lean on Swiss Re's risk expertise and look to us for guidance, particularly as they navigate today's growing list of uncertainties. Effective engagement and P&C Re's insights are just two of the reasons clients continue to rank us as the number one P&C global reinsurer 1 .\n\n## Delivering on our commitment in 2023\n\nUrs Baertschi began his career in a variety of private equity and corporate development roles.

        "page_content": "## 'Our strength is derived from our leading client franchise and strong relationships rooted in years of partnership.'\n\n## Specialised expertise brings competitive edge\n\nP&C Re has a culture of commitment and expertise, supported by more than 2 500 talented colleagues across 70 different countries and five continents. Among them are engineers, underwriters, claims experts and data scientists - all of them experts in their field and many of them working side by side with local clients. This means we are accessible, and our teams are intimately familiar with important nuances of the risks we share with our clients.\n\nOur risk expertise runs deep. For our natural catastrophe business alone, we have more than 50 experts in areas like seismology, oceanography and meteorology who can tap into 200 proprietary risk models covering a wide range of risks.\n\nWe also have more than 200 colleagues who are dedicated to specialty insurance, covering engineering, marine and aviation, credit and surety, agriculture and cyber. These specialists bring years of hands-on, seasoned experience and understanding.\n\n## Increased understanding of renewable energy risk\n\nThe passion of our Specialty teams is demonstrated by a talented team in our engineering business who fulfilled their vision to create a Centre of Competence for Renewable Energy (see page 50).\n\nBuilding on work that was already ongoing within the Specialty teams, the Centre launched in 2023 with a mission to help our clients understand the range of new and emerging risks needed to insure the energy transition in coming years. The team's work will build financial protection for wind farms, solar plants and hydro installations.\n\n## Post-earthquake recovery and rebuilding\n\nThe tragic earthquake in Turkey and Syria in February was the largest natural catastrophe loss event in 2023. It provides a timely example of how we can pair expertise and the financial strength of the Swiss Re Group to multiply the benefit for clients and for society.\n\nP&C Re provided over USD 500 million in claims support to our clients in Turkey. The most significant of these payments was to the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP), a governmentbacked programme to increase insurance protection for households that typically fall outside the insurance safety net. TCIP is the result of years of engagement between Turkish authorities and Swiss Re's Public Sector Solutions (PSS) teams.\n\nIn this case, our PSS team's understanding of public needs provided an important complement to our Reinsurance work with insurance clients in Turkey, and made us uniquely suited to be able to help (see page 46).\n\n## Servicing clients across a diversified business\n\nThe example of Turkey is a reminder that natural catastrophe protection is at the heart of P&C Re's business. The trend of the past years strongly suggests that insured natural catastrophe losses exceeding USD 100 billion per annum have become the new normal. We expect to see this trend continue, especially as the impact of secondary perils increases. Unfortunately, uninsured economic losses are also\n\ngrowing, and Swiss Re continues to work with its clients to keep addressing this protection gap.\n\nOur experts have expanded P&C Re's capabilities to develop customised tailored transactions for clients to address complex capital management needs. This is highly specialised work that strengthens our client relationships.\n\nOur clients also benefit from Swiss Re's insights and technologies of our Solutions suite. Examples include CatNet\u00ae, Swiss Re's natural catastrophe underwriting tool, and the Rapid Damage Assessment (RDA) platform, which is revolutionising the speed at which insurers can assess and pay claims in the wake of a natural catastrophe. 2\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe enter 2024 with a robust and diversified\n\nportfolio.

        "page_content": "## Earthquake protection for Turkey and Morocco\n\nWith strong partnerships in Turkey and Morocco, Swiss Re helped bring innovative earthquake protection to these areas.\n\nFollowing the devastating earthquakes that struck Morocco and Turkey in 2023, Swiss Re paid over USD 500 million in claims, providing funds to areas where they were most needed in a timely manner.\n\nOn the morning of 6 February 2023, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake shook southern Turkey and Syria, followed by a 7.5 magnitude quake nine hours later. The earthquake sequence resulted in the collapse of thousands of buildings and caused over 50 000 deaths and 100 000 injuries.\n\nThe financial losses also proved extensive. However, the Turkish insurance system was well prepared to respond, having already established a government insurance programme to deal with earthquakes.\n\nAfter the 1999 earthquake in the Kocaeli Province, the Turkish government prepared for the financial impact of property loss following future catastrophes. It created a compulsory earthquake insurance system for residential buildings on registered land in urban areas, providing a basic insurance cover for millions of people.\n\n'The threat of major earthquakes has long been a concern of Turkey's government,' notes Esther Baur, Head Europe, Public Sector Solutions (PSS). 'Almost 70% of Turkey's population and 75% of its industrial facilities are vulnerable to\n\nlarge-scale earthquakes. That's why in 2000, the Turkish government partnered with the insurance industry.'\n\nThis collaboration resulted in the creation of the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP). Over the years, Swiss Re has become a leading reinsurance partner for TCIP. 'I'm proud of this partnership,' notes Esther. 'We helped grow an insurance pool covering people that would normally not have this support. In 2023, we were there for these people when it mattered the most. More than 500 000 households received a payout.'\n\nBefore the establishment of TCIP, earthquake insurance in Turkey was mostly provided as an allied peril to fire and engineering policies. 'The penetration rate was quite low - only 5% coverage of residential buildings,' Esther recalls. 'But by spreading insurance and risk awareness to the public, it jumped to 60% earthquake insurance penetration country-wide - one of the world's highest rates.'\n\n## Hand in hand with reinsurance clients\n\nSwiss Re's PSS group has also supported the core reinsurance work at Swiss Re since its establishment in 2011. Turkey represents one of PSS's original flagship markets, as well as an important market for P&C Re in the region for over a century.\n\nAnna Ziswiler, Market Head Switzerland & Mediterranean, explains: 'Swiss Re has been sharing risk with insurers in Turkey\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnna Ziswiler Market Head Switzerland & Mediterranean, P&C Re\n\nAnna's work in Turkey  builds on Swiss Re's 100-year legacy of providing global risk expertise and reinsurance capacity, combined with cutting-edge technology solutions.",

'We soon realised the extent of the damage,' recalls Anna. 'In our role as a leading reinsurer in Turkey, we felt this was our moment of truth.'\n\nThe team was well prepared: with expertise in the market and close relationships with clients and brokers, it had substantial access to potential loss information and developments.\n\n'Our understanding of our clients helped us get claims payments to them quickly, at times even within 72 hours,' Anna explains.\n\nSwiss Re's team was also present on the ground in the weeks following the earthquakes and contributed to industry discussions, sharing best practices and insights from other markets. It was a strong group effort across functions, from our natural catastrophe specialists to underwriting and claims experts.\n\n'Having our teams available for clients and sensitive to what they were going through was key,' notes Anna. 'In the face of such a devastating event, we benefitted from our solid preparation and follow-through.'\n\nAnna's team supported payouts of over 500 000 claims, stemming from over a dozen clients, including insurers, local reinsurers and TCIP, and delivered much-needed support to disaster-struck insureds. 'Reinsurance is fundamental to the long-term reconstruction of society after devasting events,' Anna reflects.\n\nEsther Baur Head Europe, Public Sector Solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEsther leads a team that works with government and public sector clients in Europe, providing them with tailored solutions that strengthen their financial resilience.",

Through a partnership with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and in collaboration with local partners, Swiss Re Foundation supported the provision of medical care. The Foundation also ran a donation programme to support Better Shelter. The Better Shelter programme offered temporary dwelling for those rendered homeless by the earthquakes.\n\n## Moroccan solidarity\n\nOn 8 September 2023, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck near the town of Ouka\u00efmedene in western Morocco. According to the US Geological Survey, over a million people were directly exposed - with 2 960 people killed and 5 800 injured.\n\nLike Turkey, Morocco's government had already recognised the dangers of disaster risk and had implemented a system of public-private partnerships to pre-finance their response to earthquakes.\n\nErik Payen from Swiss Re's PSS team worked closely with the Moroccan government to set up their catastrophe risk insurance programme. 'Until the Al Hoceima earthquake in 2004, public policies relating to recovery and reconstruction were mostly based on ad-hoc approaches put in place after disasters,' Erik explains. 'They lacked a mechanism for dedicated pre-funding.'\n\nThe government subsequently developed a two-pillar system. A National Catastrophe Insurance Pool was established to support people holding\n\nprivate insurance contracts with full protection against catastrophic risks. Meanwhile, a Solidarity Fund was created to provide cover for the uninsured and most vulnerable members of society.\n\n'The Solidarity Fund is very important for households outside the private insurance safety net,' notes Erik. 'Because it provides an example for those families to understand the value of moving to private insurance for more comprehensive coverage. It is an excellent example of how to complement private insurance covers with a government programme.'\n\nErik's work complements the larger P&C Re activities in Morocco. From engineering to energy and property lines, P&C Re provides a broad range of cover to Africa's second-largest insurance market.\n\nNicolas Christinet, P&C Re's Regional Manager for North Africa, oversees Swiss Re's Moroccan clients and regularly visits the country. Following the September earthquake, Nicolas' team acted to show support for the local insurers and brokers, as well as the public institutions.\n\n'Morocco has a refined insurance system for natural catastrophes, which we support with capacity, know-how and innovative products like parametric insurance,' explains Nicolas. 'After the 2023 earthquake, we released a substantial payment to the Solidarity Fund within a few weeks. This is work we are proud of because we can directly see how insurance builds resilience.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nicolas Christinet\n\nRegional Manager North Africa, P&C Re\n\nNicolas and his team strive to close protection gaps by strengthening the dynamic insurance markets across the North African region.",

'It is rewarding to be part of solutions that address disaster risk reduction, increase social protection and fiscal risk management, and develop the financial market.'\n\n'Our work in Turkey and Morocco is a good example of how we have been developing strong public-private partnerships,'\n\n## The ten largest earthquakes by economic loss\n\nSince the San Francisco earthquake in 1906, Swiss Re has been at the forefront of providing earthquake protection. Over 80% of large earthquakes occur around the edges of the Pacific Ocean, an area known as the Ring of Fire - and it is not surprising that the largest losses historically have occurred in this region. The Mediterranean region is also a hotspot for devastating earthquakes. Currently, well over 60% of the economic losses from earthquakes remain uninsured. As the examples of Turkey and Morocco show, strong public-private partnerships and insurance markets can go a long way to closing that gap.\n\n| Event               |   Economic losses* | Insured  losses*   |\n|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Japan 2011          |                284 | 47                 |\n| China, 2008         |                176 | 1                  |\n| Japan, 1995         |                165 | 5                  |\n| United States, 1994 |                 90 | 31                 |\n| Turkey, 2023        |                 58 | 6                  |\n| Japan, 2004         |                 47 | 1                  |\n| Italy, 1980         |                 44 | 0                  |\n| Chile, 2010         |                 42 | 11                 |\n| Turkey, 1999        |                 37 | 2                  |\n| Armenia, 1988       |                 36 | -                  |\n\n- * Figures in USD billions, at 2023 prices.\n\nSource: Swiss Re Institute\n\nErik Payen Senior Client Manager Europe, PSS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErik specialises in providing infrastructure and disaster risk finance solutions to governments and public sector clients.

Swiss Re's newly launched Centre of Competence for Renewable Energy helps clients protect and expand their renewable energy portfolios.\n\nMiguel Ignacio Senac Head Engineering GCMIT & Co-Head Renewable Energy Centre of Competence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichele Cibrario Co-Head Renewable Energy Centre of Competence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichele and Miguel head up Swiss Re's Renewable Energy Centre of Competence, which delivers expertise and reinsurance capacity for renewable energy projects.\n\nGlobal new investment in renewable energy grew to USD 358 billion in the first six months of 2023 - a 22% rise compared to the prior-year period 1 . Swiss Re Institute expects growth in this sector to continue, generating an increased need for insurance. In fact, Swiss Re's researchers predict that investments in green energy will lead to additional energy sector-related insurance premiums of USD 237 billion by 2035 2 . For the insurers and operators supporting this transition, there is a challenging risk landscape to navigate. New technology, complex projects and even the impact of climate change can leave gaps in risk knowledge and underwriting data.\n\nIn May 2023, P&C Re created a new Centre of Competence for Renewable Energy to help clients manage their renewable energy portfolios. The Co-Heads at the helm of this project, Miguel Ignacio Senac and Michele Cibrario, collaborated to launch the new Centre. 'As wind and solar grow in scale, so does the magnitude of investments, and lenders are requesting more protection for projects,' Michele explains. 'This is where reinsurance can add value - with extensive risk insight, expertise and capacity.'\n\nWith a background in marine underwriting, Michele served ten years as a risk manager for an integrated energy company. At Swiss Re, he has spent six years as an energy upstream facultative and treaty underwriter.\n\nMeanwhile, Co-Head Miguel has worked as an engineering underwriter with Swiss Re for the past 15 years. 'The idea for the Centre originated from a simple brainstorm as we were considering how to best service our clients,' notes Miguel. 'Over three years we developed it into a business plan, which we managed to bring to life.'\n\nThe Centre currently supports clients involved in offshore and onshore wind and solar technologies - giving guidance across lines of business, be it engineering, marine or property. Michele, Miguel and their growing team have regular touch points with Swiss Re's underwriters, claims handlers and risk engineers, forming a collective to deliver new solutions and insurance product offerings.\n\nFor an offshore wind project, for example, Swiss Re's marine underwriters share insights into the marine environment and logistics, while engineering underwriters add perspective about the erection and management of turbines. The energy upstream underwriting team and managing marine warranty surveyors, meanwhile, contribute input into complex underwater projects.\n\n'The team can now underwrite the risk of building wind farms in increasingly remote ocean environments, or on typhoonexposed coastlines,' notes Miguel. While offshore wind projects have historically proven a challenge to underwrite due to their complexity, a detailed overview of risks gives clients - and the investors financing the projects - more comprehensive insights.\n\nThe Centre also focuses on one of the newer areas of growth in the renewable energy market: battery energy storage systems (BESS). BESS are rechargeable batteries that can store energy from different sources and discharge it when needed. This can be used to balance the electricity grid, provide back-up power and improve grid stability.\n\nAs the BESS market matures, with new technologies emerging and costs falling, the scale of BESS installations is growing. While global investments in BESS in 2022 totalled",

'To help clients expand into this space, we developed a comprehensive tool to price BESS facilities in 2023,' explains Miguel. 'We can even share insights with clients early on in the preconstruction phase.'\n\nSolar photovoltaics (solar PV) also represents a growing area of interest for investors. In fact, solar PV demonstrated the largest absolute generation growth of all renewable technologies in 2022. Solar farms hold strong potential to support renewable energy targets. However, many solar panels are susceptible to physical risks - hazards ranging from strong wind to earthquakes and hailstorms. Meanwhile, supply chain challenges can complicate efforts to replace damaged solar panels. Thus, ensuring accurate assessments of the long-term quality and reliability of solar panels is vital for insurers.\n\nThe Solar Panel Code of Practice (SPCoP) initiative by Swiss Re and solar PV research institutions is one example of how the industry can support best practice. It sets out guidance on how to manage risks and offer sustainable options for panel warranty insurance, allowing buyers to make more informed purchasing decisions and giving greater certainty to an industry faced with long payback periods.\n\n- 'By bringing expertise to insurance for solar PV clients, we can help operators and investors with protection for solar photovoltaic farms,' explains Michele.\n\n'They can concentrate on growing their business while maintaining a more stable cash flow.'\n\n## Giving certainty to investors\n\nRenewables projects present a number of challenges for investors, including a need for high up-front investment with uncertain returns. New technologies and climate change both add to the risks and unknowns. More severe weather conditions like floods, convective storms and hail events add to the hazards associated with renewables projects.\n\nSwiss Re's work, however, is addressing the fears of investors. 'Mitigating risk and identifying climate-related exposures is important for attracting investment into renewable energy projects,' notes Michele. 'Simply put: de-risking the business of renewables means de-risking the investment into new technologies.'\n\n'It's exciting that we as reinsurers can support the growth of renewable energy,' adds Miguel. 'By boosting access to financing, helping manage risks and promoting innovation, the sector can give momentum to adding renewable capacity.'\n\n- 1 Renewable Energy Investment Hits RecordBreaking USD 358 Billion in 1H 2023 | BloombergNEF (bnef.com).\n- 2 Maintaining resilience as a new world order takes shape sigma 05/2022 | Swiss Re.\n- 3 Enabling renewable energy with battery energy storage systems | McKinsey.",

This has brought our decision-making closer to our clients, reducing turnaround time and increasing effectiveness. The new structure also supports our ability to go beyond our risk transfer business. And this year, we closed our first fee-only deal and ramped up our expertise in large, innovative tailored transactions.\n\n## Building resilience through a strong franchise\n\nL&H Re has a strong client franchise and remains top ranked in its target markets according to NMG Consulting's Global L&H Re Study. The L&H Re team has over 1 600 people in 29 offices across the globe. In a business where contracts often span multiple decades, close contact with our clients allows us to provide long-term value across the entire policy life cycle.\n\nIn recent years, we have been there for our clients when they needed us the most. L&H Re absorbed USD 3.5 billion in COVID-related mortality claims between 2020 and 2022. As COVID-19 has now moved into an endemic phase, our clients have taken measures to strengthen their businesses and protect them from shock risks - especially through tailored transactions.\n\nIn 2023, our teams tailored risk transfer structures for a wide range of risks, including interest rate volatility in clients' investment portfolios and mass lapse events. These highly specialised transactions are ideal for L&H Re and the\n\ntalented specialists capable of closing large complex transactions.\n\n## Supporting our clients across the entire value chain\n\nAlongside the traditional risk transfer business, L&H Re is active in improving life insurance along the entire value chain.\n\nAt the distribution end of the chain, much of our work focuses on understanding the risks our clients are underwriting. L&H Re's Life Guide remains the leading underwriting manual globally, according to the Global L&H Re Study by NMG Consulting. It brings scientific, evidencebacked methods of risk assessment to our clients and is now used by 781 clients in 112 countries. In a typical month, Life Guide's platform registers a staggering 1.6 million client interactions.\n\nProduct development is also important to our clients. In 2023, we were especially proud of our work in health lines. For example, we were part of a consortium to rapidly create a prototype insurance that enables access to screening, vaccinations and treatment for female cancer patients in Kenya, work which is now moving to Asia. In advanced life insurance markets, we have expanded underwriting programmes for HIV life insurance applicants through our Life Guide HIV+ philosophy.\n\nThis work is incredibly rewarding - for the thousands of people who now have access to medical and financial services, and also for the L&H Re team who can apply their knowledge to create complex medical underwriting tools.\n\nTo further enhance the experience of filing life insurance claims, we have focused on deploying our technology to make the\n\nclaims process as lean as possible. Automated claims tools, such as Automated Customer Experience (ACE) and Claims Automated Rules Engine (CARE), have taken much of the complexity out of filing a life insurance claim, thereby improving the experience for claimants.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAfter a successful 2023, we are entering 2024 with a very positive outlook. L&H Re has a powerful and diversified franchise with strong new business generation across the world. With global primary life insurance premiums predicted to grow by 1.6% in 2024, we see opportunities for further organic growth in all regions. This growth will not only benefit our business - it will help close protection gaps.\n\nWe will continue to focus on balancing and steering the L&H portfolio. We remain committed to our largest mortality book in the US and see opportunities for growth in Asia. There are also opportunities for closing health protection gaps, and we expect the health business globally to increase its share of our portfolio. For the longevity business, we will grow selectively where business can be written at riskadequate rates.\n\n2024 will see an important change in our financial reporting. With the implementation of IFRS from the first quarter of 2024, we will be able to recognise the full value of our long-term contracts.\n\nFactoring in the uplift from the IFRS accounting change, our ongoing ability to generate new business opportunities and our discipline to keep costs flat, we commit to an ambitious IFRS net income target of approximately USD 1.5 billion in 2024.",

        "page_content": "## The big deal: tailored transactions\n\nLife and health transactions are large single deals tailored to a specific need of a client. This work is highly specialised and is often at the leading edge of risk transfer.\n\nThe success of Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) is based on close client relationships, with 95% of the book written via a direct relationship. This strong direct relationship allows L&H Re to partner with its clients along the entire value chain, from product development and distribution through to risk transfer and managing in-force portfolios.\n\nLarge, tailored transactions are reinsurance deals that are customised according to the needs of a specific client. These types of transactions take risk transfer and in-force management a step further than standard risk transfer, using the underlying risk to address specific capital management issues. This type of work has been a significant contributor to L&H Re's results, delivering USD 2.5 billion in economic profits over the past five years.\n\nSwiss Re's Life & Health transactions teams include specialists with expertise in complex, tailored deals for Swiss Re's clients. On large deals with global clients, the teams work with billions of dollars' worth of underlying risk and assets.\n\nJonathan Graham, Head Financial Markets & In-Force Management, explains: 'Every tailored transaction is unique for that client's needs. This is highly strategic work, which is all about helping clients efficiently manage their risks and capital so they can grow with minimal impact to their balance sheet and earnings, while maintaining adequate solvency levels.'\n\nAlthough each tailored transaction is unique, there are several common reasons why clients might choose to structure a large deal.\n\nThey may wish to protect a block of business from specific risks, such as pandemics or changes in health trends.\n\nThe insurer may want to de-risk the investment side of their life portfolio using optimised reinsurance protection to mitigate financial market or interest rate risks.\n\n'Reinsurance is not just about insurance for insurers,' explains Jonathan. 'Tailored reinsurance solutions allow clients to de-risk their portfolios in a very specific way, addressing a specific issue such as longevity or investment risks.'\n\nA key benefit of tailored transactions is that they can release the capital needed for growth opportunities, such as moving into a new line of business or launching a new product.\n\n'There are many ways an insurer can fund new growth opportunities. Reinsurance transactions are a pragmatic, efficient method because they optimise the existing business, paving the way for a stronger overall portfolio,' explains Jonathan.\n\nThe Life & Health transactions teams draw on the strengths of a global cross-functional workforce, involving actuaries, investment and financial market specialists, risk specialists, lawyers, in-force management teams and the client market teams.\n\n'This year, literally hundreds of my Swiss Re colleagues have been involved in a diverse range of tailored transactions', notes Jonathan.

On a large scale, mass cancellation of policies could significantly reduce a life insurer's premium income and potentially cripple their business.\n\nIn 2023, Jolee Crosby, CEO Reinsurance Canada & English Caribbean, led a team which helped a large global client in North America strengthen its capital position against mass lapse.\n\n## Can you explain how Swiss Re approaches mass lapse events?\n\nFor over a decade, L&H Re has been assessing the threat of mass policy cancellations. Our work suggests that prevention is the best approach to avoid lapse - after all, we can only build resilience if people can stay insured.\n\nWe have data analytics tools which enable clients to scan their portfolios and identify customers who may be at risk of letting their life insurance lapse. We also have\n\nbehavioural economists who can advise clients on how to proactively reach out to 'at risk' customers to see if they can support those clients in keeping their protection.\n\n## How did the transaction you mentioned in North America add to our mass lapse toolbox?\n\nThis deal tackled lapse risk management from the point of view of a company's CFO and chief actuary, who are the guardians of their shareholders' capital.\n\nThis type of deal helps clients protect their reserves - and in turn their capital position - if a large mass lapse event cannot be prevented.\n\n## What has been the impact of the deal?\n\nThis deal stands out as an innovative and unique solution. Swiss Re is proud to have helped bring expertise to the market - and utilise a new strategy for tackling mass lapse risks. The deal sets a beneficial precedent for more clients to benefit from this work.\n\n## Managing financial market risks\n\nWith tailored reinsurance transactions, insurers can protect themselves against financial volatility arising from changes in life expectancy trends, health trends, regulatory requirements or even changes in financial markets. In 2023, Yong Suk Kwon and Swiss Re's Korean team structured a deal that helped a life insurer manage investment risk.\n\n## What was the challenge faced by the client?\n\nLife insurers need to set aside funds to cover the future claims in their portfolio. Although companies invest this money in safe assets, such as government bonds, these are still exposed to financial market fluctuations.\n\n## How did Swiss Re address the issue?\n\nWe optimised the underlying risk in our client's portfolio by using reinsurance to transfer that risk to Swiss Re. This meant that the client could, in turn, optimise the investments related to that book of business to a point where they were comfortable with any potential volatility in their longterm investments.\n\n## What made this deal a success?\n\nIn this case, Swiss Re's global capacity enabled our client to protect their portfolio against specific local issues, particularly interest rates. This highlights the benefits of Swiss Re's global strength. We can use our international capacity and balance sheet to solve local issues.\n\nJolee Crosby CEO Reinsurance Canada & English Caribbean\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith a long career in L&H Re at Swiss Re, Jolee now oversees Swiss Re's fifth largest market, with USD 817 million of premiums earned in L&H Canada alone in 2023.\n\nYong Suk Kwon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHead Korea Branch\n\nHaving begun his career at Swiss Re 25 years ago, Yong now heads up Swiss Re's third largest Asian market, which generated USD 696 million in L&H premiums in 2023.",

In 2023, his team and several colleagues partnered with one of Swiss Re's largest clients to help a large insurance company release capital from its life insurance business.\n\n## What was the strategic challenge for this transaction?\n\nA large insurance company had a large book of US life insurance policies which required significant capital, expense and operational capabilities to manage. The company wanted to free up that capital and reduce their expense and operational complexity. We had a solution for a large portion of their need.\n\n## How did you solve the challenge?\n\nFocusing on our strengths, we sought a partner with complementary strengths to provide a combined solution. We could take on the mortality risk, and we could provide a way to maximise the value of the business already in the portfolio. The partner we found was able to take on the asset risk, and they also had the operational capabilities required.\n\n## What demands did the transaction place on the team?\n\nThe first was the working hours required to support our portion of the transaction. Our piece alone unlocked over a billion dollars of trapped capital - but also involved hundreds of thousands of term life policies that protect real families. To accomplish this, we needed to ensure that the deal was priced correctly, which required a lot of dedication from our actuarial team to calculate the figures with precision.\n\nThe second challenge was the complexity of working with a partner to provide a comprehensive solution for the insurer, who is also a long-standing client. Thanks to their world-class expertise and technical skills, our structuring team successfully developed the solution. They were supported by our legal team, who worked tirelessly to formulate the contracts, and our client markets team, who helped us respect our relationships throughout the process.\n\nThere was a lot at stake, but ultimately it was worth every minute of the effort.\n\n## Resilience in hard economic times: mass lapse covers\n\nDifficult financial times can push policyholders to give up their life insurance policies to access the accumulated savings. For an insurer, higher-than-expected lapse activity may result in the loss of profitable business and the need to sell assets and realise capital losses to meet its obligations to those policyholders.\n\nRegulators require insurers to hold capital against lapse risks. Solvency II rules prompted life insurers to start looking for risk transfer structures to reduce the solvency capital requirement associated with lapse risks.\n\nSwiss Re offers reinsurance protection for this complicated risk. A mass lapse treaty covers a loss layer. When the level of lapse-related losses reaches a certain level, Swiss Re will support the insurer up to a specified detachment point. Apart from providing protection to the insurer, the protection layer can be set to optimise the insurer's solvency capital requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichael Bacon Head US L&H Globals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichael leads one of the key businesses within Globals, the division that serves a large number of the world's largest insurance companies and contributes an impressive 30% of Swiss Re's technical results.",

These solutions enable insurance clients to benefit from a more streamlined claims experience.\n\nWhen a loved one passes away, their family often depends on life insurance support to provide a financial safety net. And when beneficiaries file this type of claim, they hope for an easy and efficient claims process. That's why Tim Quick, Head of Global Life & Health (L&H) Claims Solutions, and his team developed a range of automated solutions that improve the overall claims experience.\n\n'As new digital processes were transforming the insurance industry, we realised that claims digitisation and automation technologies could improve the L&H claims process,' notes Tim. 'We saw an opportunity to help our Life & Health clients improve their customer experience and streamline their business.'\n\nCombining a passion for technology with the desire to make the claims process smoother, Tim and his team have developed modular, automated solutions that support beneficiaries, living policyholders and claims examiners. Swiss Re's Automated Customer Experience (ACE) portal facilitates the claims process for claimants by offering automated assistance to register a loss, provide claim requirements and receive real-time status reporting. Users can log their claim via the ACE portal, where they are guided through the process step by step - where requirement gathering and follow-up communications previously took weeks, with ACE it now takes minutes.\n\n'We wanted to make this process more efficient while still capturing the data needed for accurate assessments. So we used technology originally developed for\n\nautomated underwriting and applied it to claims,' Tim explains. The result? A rules-based automated assessment tool.\n\nOnce the claim is registered in ACE, Swiss Re's Claims Automated Rules Engine (CARE) takes over. CARE provides examiners with automated risk assessments, sorts and prioritises by risk, and provides guidance on final adjudication decisions. 'CARE enables insurers to save time and resources by automating claims assessments,' Tim says.\n\nTo further improve these tools, Swiss Re also partnered with software services providers in 2023 to integrate its claims automation solutions with policy administration and standalone claims workbench systems to enable end-to-end automation for efficient claims administration. With Swiss Re's modular claims solutions, ecosystem partnerships and cloud-based integration capabilities, the claims process has transformed into a fully digital experience regardless of the insurer's core technology. With ACE and CARE integrated into an insurer's core systems, the entire claimant experience from the customer's first input notifying the insurer of their loss to when the claims expert assesses the claim remains one all-digital and integrated experience.\n\n'With our claims-related suite of services, we can reduce the claims process from weeks to days - and in some cases even minutes,' Tim notes. 'It's gratifying to see how new technology can improve this process and can be applied to help people during a sensitive and difficult time.'\n\nTim Quick Head Global L&H Claims Solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTim and his team are helping to make claims processing more efficient for insurance clients and their customers through automation technology.",

This offers a potential customer base of around 40 000 of the world's largest companies - with a total available market premium of around USD 300 billion, expected to grow by at least 5% per annum.\n\nOur journey in this market has seen Corporate Solutions move from what was largely a follower position - a so-called 'Excess and Follow' business - to writing more Primary Lead business. Primary Lead is a more sophisticated business which creates closer client relationships and is less price sensitive. It plays to Swiss Re's strengths as a leading risk knowledge company and our robust infrastructure.\n\n## Growing value-added solutions and services\n\nSwiss Re Corporate Solutions continues to expand its value proposition through differentiated offerings and services that meet more complex risk transfer needs and the growing demand for adjacent risk analytics. This work requires substantial innovation and knowledge. The focus has been on three areas: International Programs, Innovative Risk Solutions and Risk & Data Services for Corporates.\n\nInternational Programs is an integrated platform to administrate multinational insurance programmes and reduce complexity for insurance buyers. The platform provides local policy issuance and cash-flow management in over 150 jurisdictions, allowing corporates to keep an overview of their insurance even when it involves thousands of individual policies.\n\nThe need for these services is clear. International Programs has grown\n\ntwentyfold, from 30 active clients at the end of 2018, to well over 650 at the end of 2023.\n\nInnovative Risk Solutions (IRS) is a dedicated unit offering tailor-made risk management solutions for large corporates and captives. The offering includes structured re/insurance and fronting solutions, parametric covers and reinsurance in derivative form. IRS reached a milestone in 2023, adding its 1 000th transaction. Since IRS was formed in 2021, it has generated around USD 1.4 billion in gross premiums written.\n\nOur Risk Data & Services platform is a powerful tool that allows companies to gain a granular understanding of their risk exposures. In 2023, we moved this data platform even closer to the demands our clients face by introducing modules that can support the disclosure requirement of the EU Taxonomy and the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD), as well as new regulations, such as the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act in Germany.\n\n## A bright future ahead\n\nFrom a strategic and financial point of view, the expansion into risk solutions offers our clients a range of new risk knowledge products and increases the value we can add to their risk management. For Corporate Solutions, it offers cycle-independent growth opportunities and diversification into fee-based sources of income.\n\nThe outlook for the coming years is favourable for our business. We have a strong relationship with our customers and brokers, extremely talented and dedicated teams, and a very strong financial position.\n\nFor 2024, we have again set an ambitious target. Under the IFRS 17 standard, we aim to achieve a combined ratio under 93%.\n\n'At the heart of Corporate Solutions' strategy is the goal to generate resilient returns across the cycle.

The payout is automatically triggered upon occurrence of pre-agreed factors in line with the indemnity principle. However, unlike traditional claims handling, there is no lengthy claims adjustment process to determine the value of the loss.\n\nWhen Hurricane Sandy swept the US East Coast in October 2012, it produced a catastrophic storm surge with waves powerful enough to be detected by seismometers as far away as Seattle. The storm proved especially devastating for New York and New Jersey. In New York City alone, widespread flooding damaged over 69 000 residential units. Thousands of residents were displaced and USD 19 billion in damages resulted.\n\nThe catastrophe brought to light a concerning reality - the majority of economic losses in these areas were uninsured. 'Flood has long been considered a secondary peril,' notes Jackie Higgins, Head Public Sector Solutions North America. 'However, given the growing concentration of exposures in larger cities, along coastal areas and on flood plains, we need to consider the future threat of flooding to be on par with perils such as earthquakes.'\n\nFollowing Hurricane Sandy's catastrophic impact, the City of New York started looking at ways to address the physical and financial disruption of floods. Swiss Re began proactively engaging city offices in discussions to help share knowledge including insights into the benefit of simple parametric solutions. Working with the Bloomberg administration on the Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resilience, Swiss Re produced robust analyses and projections on flood impact. These enabled city officials to use data points like sea level rise and shifts in hurricane frequency to predict the potential financial impact on New York City. Officials gained an oversight of how future floods might damage the city's assets and building stock.\n\nMegan Linkin, Senior Parametric Nat Cat Structurer for Corporate Solutions, performed the analysis. 'We worked closely with the city to understand the distribution and value of assets across the five boroughs, and what economic growth projections were anticipated,' notes Megan. 'We then ran these asset portfolios through our catastrophe models to determine potential losses. We also isolated the impact of economic growth versus climate change-related sea level rise and hurricane activity.' Megan and her team were then able to implement various resiliency measures into their catastrophe models to determine the loss reduction of each, providing the city with the capability to perform a cost-benefit analysis.\n\n## Closing the protection gap in New York City\n\nAs New York officials realised the importance of closing the flood risk protection gap, Swiss Re's teams were asked to collaborate with the city on a solution. 'Swiss Re already had a deep understanding of flood risk,' notes Jackie. This made Swiss Re a natural partner for government groups working on this ambitious project. 'Our innovative developments in parametric insurance have put us at the forefront of understanding this peril and allowed us to deliver an innovative solution,' adds Megan.\n\nSwiss Re joined forces with the Center for NYC Neighborhoods (CNYCN), in partnership with the Mayor's Office of Climate & Environmental Justice (MOCEJ), the Environmental Defense Fund and SBP USA, to launch a pilot project to provide emergency cash funds to low and moderate-income communities.

In these areas, Sandy's impact had been especially devastating, as residents and businesses had little financial cushion to rebuild with.\n\nWorking with the reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter and the satellite technology firm ICEYE, Swiss Re developed a pilot parametric flood programme in 2023. The programme transfers flood risk to the private market, alleviating some financial burden on the city and enabling a more equitable recovery for low- to moderateincome residents of New York City.\n\n'The new programme is a good first step in assisting the city to help low- to moderateincome communities recover more quickly after a flood,' explains Jackie.\n\nUnder the programme, if a flood occurs, the percentage of each insured neighbourhood inundated by floodwaters is determined based on satellite data from partner data provider ICEYE. If the proportion exceeds a predetermined threshold, Swiss Re will issue a payment to the Center for NYC\n\nNeighborhoods, who will subsequently distribute grants to households.\n\nMegan explains: 'Parametric insurance provides claims adjudication that is transparent, proceeds that can be paid out quickly and liquidity that can be used flexibly. Growing up and living in the New York area, it is encouraging to see the US's largest city embrace the value proposition of parametric insurance, and this will hopefully lead to larger and more comprehensive programmes in years to come.'\n\n## Enabling resilience with a parametric solution\n\nPublic Sector Solutions has had a long history of enabling innovative insurance. By working with governments from Uruguay to Nepal, the team has been instrumental in developing bespoke covers to close protection gaps.

Corporates get an in-depth understanding of how climate change, supply chain disruptions or other shocks could impact their business. As part of this suite of solutions, Sustainability Compass focuses on gauging physical climate risks, such as flood, extreme wind and drought.\n\n'Our goal is to empower clients to manage their own risks. Sustainability Compass gives clients an overview of climate-related risk to a company's facilities and operations. The understanding of potential future developments helps them to put mitigation measures in place, such as shifting production activities away from exposed areas,' explains Bernhard Rannegger, Sustainability Solutions Expert.\n\nThe solution came from the team's deep engagement with corporate clients. They realised that while companies needed to understand the risk of severe weather to their business, they did not have the means to adequately inform themselves.\n\nBuilding on Risk Data & Services' philosophy of helping clients to get ahead of risk, Bernhard and team have addressed this issue. Their tool can simulate various future hazard risk scenarios related to climate change, such as heavy storms, sea level rise and wildfires across locations. Sustainability Compass comprises climate risk data and analytics capabilities powered by\n\nSwiss Re's Climate Risk Score data and its natural catastrophe models.\n\n'By uploading their asset portfolio and data onto the Risk Data & Services platform, clients can create a single source of information across teams. The insights can be used for portfoliolevel reporting on existing assets as well as to inform themselves of future developments. Ultimately, Sustainability Compass helps companies to put their climate risk management strategy into action,' says Anja Zimmermann, Solution Design & Delivery Lead.\n\n## Stress testing assets with a digital twin\n\nSustainability Compass helps clients build a digital twin of their business to get an accurate overview of their risk exposure. With this precise virtual representation of their assets, they then analyse and stress-test their business activities in the near and long term based on three different climate change scenarios of low, medium and high global temperature increases. This provides actionable insights into the risks and impacts of events such as tropical cyclones or floods, which in turn helps corporates formulate mitigation plans. For example, they can factor in the likely impact of physical climate risks on their supply chain as part of their vendor selection process.\n\n'When you're building a new offshore wind park, or setting up a new production site, you don't want to wait for a big hurricane or flood to find out how your investment is exposed.

Close collaboration with corporates led to the realisation that global clients also need help coordinating their insurance needs across countries. Thus, the team created International Programs.\n\n'We saw that global clients were dealing with the complexity of different local regulations,' notes Reto Collenberg, Head International Programs EMEA & APAC. 'We knew that with our expertise in the global risks space, we could provide solutions.'\n\nSwiss Re's work with Ericsson, the Swedish multinational networking and telecommunications company, also goes back over a decade. In 2022, Ericsson approached Swiss Re with an interest in expanding the partnership. Swiss Re thus became the new leader for Ericsson's property damage and business interruption insurance programme.\n\n## Local complexities for international business\n\nEricsson's core business - delivering products and services to support the infrastructure for mobile communications - gives the company a far-reaching international footprint. Growth in the enterprise business, with offerings for wireless solutions for companies, means even greater international exposure. With about 105 000 employees globally, spread across 180 countries, Ericsson needed an insurance partner to help navigate the complexity of international business.\n\n'A diverse international presence means dealing with different local regulatory regimes,' notes Lars Stensg\u00e5rd, Head of Group Insurance Risk Management at\n\nEricsson. 'These factors complicate the procurement of insurance coverage,' he adds.\n\n## An expanded partnership\n\nWhen Ericsson was looking for a lead carrier, International Programs was the top candidate due to Swiss Re's enterprisewide expertise and the comprehensive servicing offerings.\n\n'Dealing with a multitude of local policies creates overwhelming complexity,' notes Lars. 'So one of the driving factors for us is the ability to provide proof of insurance locally. We need to effectively manage and pay claims in each region. Swiss Re helps us navigate the arena of complex compliance requirements.'\n\nCombined with insurance partners, Swiss Re's overall network covers over 150 countries. 'We leverage this extensive network to maximise territorial coverage,' notes Reto. 'But we also saw that clients need personal service.

'We also looked for a provider with a strong risk transfer appetite, and an experienced claims team with strong global and local expertise,' notes Lars.

Swiss Re set up meetings and trainings on claims-handling protocols, ensuring clear engagement with the claims team. This practical and clear process means that claims-handling now proceeds more smoothly and with better efficiency.\n\n'We also focused on bringing together our underwriting, operations, claims and complex account management expertise,' Reto explains. 'It is the collective team effort, and the close involvement of our senior management, that made us stand out from the competition.'\n\n## The advantage of PULSE portal\n\nPULSE portal, the Swiss Re broker and customer portal, also helped Ericsson gain transparency throughout the implementation of their international\n\nprogramme. 'The advantage of the PULSE portal is that our clients and brokers get real-time information about the status of the implementation of their policies and premium payments,' notes Reto. 'Furthermore, customers can follow the lifecycle of a claim on the portal.'\n\nThe platform helps with navigating the complexity of a broad international footprint by simplifying the flow of data and information in one secure place.\n\n'The access to natural catastrophe information proves especially valuable,' explains Lars. 'Through PULSE portal, we get alerts on natural catastrophe events that are happening in proximity to our locations. We can keep in touch with the local teams as events unfold.' The feature even has an interactive map where Ericsson can see all the locations and exposure values of their properties.\n\n'Maintaining international oversight is a huge challenge,' explains Lars. 'Working with Swiss Re's International Programs, my team has a real partner and resources on hand.'",
