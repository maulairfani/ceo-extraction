In our private lives, this means taking care of our family and friends, and increasingly also looking after ourselves and achieving a healthy work-life balance. In a professional context, we are responsible for our work but also for the way we treat the people we work with. Companies have a responsibility too - toward their stakeholders but also toward the world around them. This is particularly true for Symrise: We bene/fit from the environment and from biodiversity since most of our products are of natural origin. This means that acting sustainably is the way to continue our commercial success - another responsibility.\n\nThis responsible approach is serving us well, and we achieved another good result in the past /fiscal year. Despite the geopolitical upheaval impacting our supply chains, and despite high in/flation and exchange rate e/ffects that more than halved our organic growth, we increased our sales by 7.9 %. This was the 18th successive year of growth. We again outperformed our 5 % to 7 % target for sales growth, putting us in an industry-leading position.\n\nDr. Stephanie Co\u00dfmann , President Human Resources & Legal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll segments played their part in this success. Sales in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment were up by 9.3 % in organic terms. In the Scent & Care segment, the /figure was 5.6 %. High growth was also seen for Food & Beverage, for example. Pet Food sales, too, were up sharply, posting double-digit growth in percentage terms. In the Scent & Care segment, the dynamic trend continued particularly in Fine Fragrances, Cosmetic Ingredients, Micro Protection and Sun Protection.\n\nThis ongoing positive development was thanks to our three-pillar strategy: growth, e/fficiency and portfolio. Building on this strategy, we have been the /first in the industry to diversify our business model in recent years, making us less vulnerable to crises and economic /fluctuations. Where it makes sense, we have added to our core business areas of /flavor and fragrances. In 2008, around 10 % of our sales came from products outside our traditional /fields. Today, it is already more than 30 %. In 2028, we want these products to account for half of our sales, and we have also de/fined new medium-term targets for that same year. We intend to generate product sales of",

Our broad regional presence, and a customer base ranging from small regional companies to global corporations, will help us achieve this.\n\nOur commitment to greater sustainability is also bearing fruit. We are on course to achieve the target of net zero emissions (Scope 1+2) in 2030. In this way, we are actively supporting the principles of responsible management in the United Nations Global Compact. Our commitment is also re/flected in the many awards we have received for our sustainability e/fforts.\n\nTogether with our approximately 13,000 employees, we are excited about the year ahead, which is a very special one for our company. Exactly a century and a half ago, in 1874, Wilhelm Haarmann and Ferdinand Tiemann made a discovery. Working in Holzminden, they developed a process for synthesizing vanillin using the sap of conifer wood. Haarmann\n\nDr. J\u00f6rn Andreas , President Scent & Care\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwent on to establish the company Haarmann & Reimer, which in 2003 merged with Dragoco, another longstanding Holzminden business, to create Symrise. The founders embodied the qualities we want to continue: They took responsibility - for themselves, their employees and all other stakeholders. We, the members of the Executive Board team, feel deeply honor-bound to this tradition. This commitment will not waver one bit under the board leadership of Jean-Yves Parisot, who will succeed Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Bertram as CEO. Building on our strong foundation and inspired by a culture that has evolved during more than 150 successful years in business, we will continue to shape our industry and sustainably and successfully operate our company. You can read about how we have put this ambition into practice over the past year in our Corporate Report 2023.\n\nThe Executive Board of Symrise AG",

The aforementioned laws and standards use the terms 'net zero' or 'greenhouse gas neutrality' (GHG neutrality).\n\nIn order to ensure the highest possible degree of congruence with the terms used in the regulations, the term 'climate positive' will be replaced by the term 'net zero' in Symrise's future external communications. However, this will have no impact on the global implementation of Symrise AG's integrated climate strategy and, in particular, the planned activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAccording to the above-mentioned regulatory developments and other common standards, the term 'climate positive' implies a net negative GHG balance, taking into account all of the company's activities.\n\nThe term 'net zero' refers to the net emissions of an organization, which are calculated by subtracting the greenhouse gas reduc tions or removals from the atmosphere from the greenhouse gas emissions in the GHG balance. Furthermore, this term only includes greenhouse gases that are defined as such in the UN framework. It is also the basis for important initiatives such as the Science Based Targets initiative and global industry standards such as ISO.\n\nAccording to the current state of discussion, 'positivity' cannot be achieved, or can only be achieved at high cost. The desired state is a balanced greenhouse gas balance of remaining (residual) emissions and offsetting or other compensation measures, which can be described as 'net zero.'\n\nIn our sustainability reporting, we comply with the 2021 GRI Standards version of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, including all updates from previous years.\n\n  As an active member of the Global Compact, we adhere to its universal principles for responsible corporate management as well as to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. We actively contribute to achieving them along our entire value chain, from the generation of raw materials and product development to our customer relationships.\n\nWe act sustainably throughout these stages of the value creation process and with regard to our material topics. This chapter focuses on the four topics for which we bear particular responsibility and on which we have signi/fi cant in/fl uence. Sustainable partnerships and dialogue with our employees and stakeholders are our main starting point and our motivation. With this in mind, the following pages present the perspectives of several of our internal dialogue partners on the topics identi/fi ed by means of a materiality analysis and the biggest challenges associated with them.\n\nWe have integrated all quantitative and qualitative transparency information, our strategic approach and the management concepts of our material topics into our Sustainability Record in accordance with the GRI and thus meet the requirements of the CSR Directive Implementation Law (CSR-RUG) pursuant to Section 289b (3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB).

Ingredients that are healthy and tasty for the nutrition of people and animals. Perfume compositions and cosmetics solutions that o/ffer added value with innovative and active ingredients. We look to the future, take heed of trends and pay attention to what our customers and consumers want. We are continuously expanding our portfolio and collecting knowledge. We secure our economic success by developing solutions that are sustainable in the long term while keeping our sights on the environment.\n\n## What we are proud of\n\nOf our international, highly diverse team, which is on all continents and in all markets. Every team member plays an active role through its entrepreneurial spirit and visionary ideas. Of the 10,000 raw materials produced around the world through our close cooperation with manufacturers and - where possible and sensible - integrated backward into our value chain. Of our processes that are both scienti/fically and economically excellent. Of our 35,000 innovative products that o/ffer renowned brands an unmistakable character and added value. And of course we are proud of our commitment to more climate protection, biodiversity and social equality. Because for us, acting sustainably is not only a duty but an aspiration to operate successfully.\n\nPeople want to meet their basic needs in a safe and reliable way: they need to eat and drink, want to look after themselves and enjoy their lives. But we only have limited resources. Furthermore, the economy is global and still it is marked by many regional and even local features in many respects. This is also due in great part to digitalization, which makes many aspects clearer and more individual and ensures greater speed - to which companies must adjust their processes. Last but not least, the preferences of consumers are also changing rapidly. There has not been a 'one-size-/fits-all' solution for quite some time now. People demand products that have the smallest possible impact on the environment and simultaneously have a positive e/ffect on all areas of life.\n\n## Our commitment How we think and act\n\nWe must work as a team along the entire value chain. That applies to us at Symrise, where we cooperate in a cross-business manner, work together to unlock potential and produce sustainably. And we do not di/fferentiate when it comes to our partners. We work together with our suppliers and partners on equal footing and based on trust in order to reach our common goals. In doing so, we keep our focus on  people - the consumers. They tell us what they want and we deliver the best solutions. And we always act guided by the core of our business model: We want to sustainably ensure the protection of biological diversity. At the same time, we observe our social responsibility toward people and animals. Because only then can we continue to be successful.",

We must act in a commercially successful, sustainable and socially responsible manner in order to continuously increase the company's value and minimize risks. We bolster the future of our company by taking this approach.\n\n  As we previously announced, we plan to increase our sales to the level of between \u20ac 5.5 billion and \u20ac 6 billion by 2025. We have set a new long-term target for sales as well: We plan to increase sales to the level of \u20ac 7.5 billion to \u20ac 8 billion by 2028.\n\nTo achieve this goal for the long term, we must simultaneously keep a close eye on the climate, the environment and use of resources. Faced with a world population that crossed the 8 billion barrier in 2022, we can no longer do business the way that we used to. One solution is to separate our commercial activities from the use of /finite resources. This is a really important task for Symrise, because our business model is based on the diversity of nature. We manufacture more than 35,000 products that we make from around 10,000 - mostly natural - raw materials such as vanilla, citrus products and /flower and plant materials. Nature is a source of inspiration and innovation for us. This is why we have worked from the beginning to protect biodiversity and the environment by applying a responsible sourcing strategy. It covers all steps in the supply chain and includes in particular the observance of human rights along with environmental issues.\n\nWe are also increasing our sustainability performance along the entire value chain. As part of this e/ffort, we have been applying the principles of a circular economy for years and have integrated them into more and more processes. This approach enables us to eliminate waste and environmental pollution, circulate nonrenewable resources in cycles, sustainably obtain renewable resources and regenerate nature all at the same time.\n\nOne milestone in the sustainability concept we developed in 2020 is the goal of achieving greenhouse\n\ngas neutrality by 2030. From this point forward, the business activities of Symrise should help prevent or sequester more greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere than we produce in our operations.\n\n## Four pillars for greater sustainability\n\nOne key driver behind our integrated corporate strategy is the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

It turned out that the material topics have not changed signi/ficantly. Please see the Sustainability Record 2023 (GRI) for additional information on this materiality analysis.\n\nWe have to be successful in business to hit our sustainability targets. We focus on three pillars to do so: growth, e/fficiency and portfolio.\n\n## Growth\n\nWe plan to expand our market share by increasing sales on an above-average and organic basis by 5 % to 7 % (CAGR). To do so, we began to work early and intensely in rapidly growing emerging countries. We have been represented in Brazil since 1956, in China since 1982 and in India since 1994. We are also working to remain the innovation leader in our core areas of expertise, provide our broad line of products to our customers even more systematically and strengthen collaboration in the process.

In this process, we analyze the needs and wishes of our customers and consumers around the world, search for products that we can use to achieve above-average margins thanks to our innovativeness and look for products that o/ffer new growth potential for us. To achieve these goals, we became the /first company in our industry years ago to venture into related business /fields. One example: While the traditional /flavor and fragrance markets are growing very solidly at an average of 3 % to 4 % per year, the pet food market, for example, is growing far more signi/ficantly. Today, we generate more than 30 % of our sales in these additional application areas. We aim to increase this proportion to 50 % over the next few years - for the bene/fit of growth and pro/fitability. Our acquisitions are contributing to this growth as well.\n\nOur integrated corporate strategy helps us grow dynamically, generate a high level of pro/fitability and continuously improve our sustainability performance. This type of holistic thinking and acting is part of Symrise's DNA. Chemists Wilhelm Haarmann and Ferdinand Tiemann from Holzminden discovered how to synthesize vanilla from the sap of conifers 150 years ago. Soon after, they helped to build the aroma and fragrance industry - worldwide. The Haarmann & Reimer company and later Dragoco, which became part of Symrise in 2003, stood for innovation, creativity and sustainable use of raw materials in many areas for decades. Symrise continues to travel down this path by providing our customers with a comprehensive value proposition, conserving resources and achieving long-term business success: We intend to become the global market leader in the areas of food, beverages and pet food as we do so.\n\nCorporate strategy beyond sales growth and EBITDA margin: Symrise has its sights /firmly set on non/financial key performance indicators.\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CO 2 (t) / \u20ac million of added value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HAZARDOUS WASTE AND CHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND\n\n(t) / \u20ac million of added value\n\nWATER USE (m 3 ) / \u20ac million of added value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This protects the natural environment and its biodiversity, which form the basis of our business. In our /five target dimensions of 'Business,' 'Footprint,' 'Innovation,' 'Sourcing' and 'Care,' we meet the requirements for non/financial corporate reporting as set out in the CSR Directive Implementation Act (see www.symrise.com/sustainability).\n\nAt the same time, we enjoy great commercial success, even in times of crisis: In 2023, despite all the challenges we faced, we once again achieved our targets. Our more than 12,000 employees around the world generated sales of \u20ac 4,730 million, an organic growth of  7.9 %.  Our EBITDA margin 1 likewise reached a healthy value of 19.1 %. That makes us one of the most pro/fitable companies in the industry, just like in previous years.\n\nWith this performance, we are laying the foundations for our long-term goals, which we have set out in our integrated corporate strategy. In 2025, we aim to achieve sales of \u20ac 5.5 billion to \u20ac 6.0 billion with annual growth of 5 % to 7 %. But we are committed to achieving our goals at all levels, including with regard to sustainability, where our aim is for the company as a whole to be net zero starting in 2030.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability management\n\nWe make our more than 35,000 products from about 10,000 raw materials, most of which are naturally occurring - and in doing so we work with tens of thousands of people around the world. Diversity is the foundation of our business operations - and sustainability, in all of its many facets, is an integral part of our business model, our strategy and our purpose. We have deeply integrated this mentality into the Group over the years: with committees, structures and dedicated employees.\n\n## Four pillars for greater sustainability\n\nIn recent years, Symrise has collected, analyzed and evaluated key sustainability aspects for the Group. We have bundled the aspects of sustainability that are relevant to Symrise into the four pillars of environmental protection (footprint), sustainable innovation (innovation), raw material sourcing (sourcing) and employees and society (care). We have drawn on these four pillars to formulate speci/fic goals that we intend to accomplish by 2025 (see page 27). Each goal has a direct connection to our major issues and is based on such programs as the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The aims of our pillars are closely interwoven into our business model, a strategy that is based largely on a circular economy. In turn, this tight integration enables us to form a bond between our commercial success and sustainable company management and social acceptance.\n\n## All are called on\n\nAll employees are urged to constantly reevaluate their work processes in terms of e/fficiency, safety and resource conservation, and to develop ways to improve them. A global network of more than 150 Sustainability Ambassadors carries out targeted initiatives on energy and waste management, climate, water and environmental protection, and occupational health and safety at the company's business locations. Managers are responsible for integrating sustainability into their teams and setting clear goals. Sustainability objectives are also a component of individual goals\n\nfor all senior executives, including the members of the Executive Board. This enables us to vigorously apply our sustainability strategy in all divisions.\n\nTo complement the work performed by individual teams at all of our business locations, we have structured the Group in a way that further advances sustainability. The global and cross-business Symrise Sustainability Board is comprised of the sustainability o/fficers for the business segments Taste, Nutrition & Health and Scent & Care; one representative each from the sta/ff departments Human Resources, Finance / Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and Corporate Sustainability; and the Head of the Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee. The board meets several times a year and is led by the Chief Sustainability O/fficer (CSO). The Sustainability Board ensures that topics relevant to sustainability and issues important to key stakeholder groups along the entire value chain are taken into consideration. It sets sustainability objectives that are achieved directly in the company's individual divisions. Direct responsibility for strategy lies with the Chief Executive O/fficer of Symrise AG, who receives regular reports on the progress of all sustainability activities.\n\n## Exceptional commitment\n\nOur commitment to sustainability regularly receives recognition. Symrise has earned a top position once again on the annual sustainability ratings issued by CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure",

        "page_content": "Project). The company received two top 'A' grades in the categories of climate and water and an exceptional 'A -' in the forest category. The Sustainable Future Award 2023 given by the F.A.Z.-Institut and Cision Germany was also presented to Symrise for its exemplary activities as a sustainable company and the company became the /first producer in its sector to be certi/fied as a B Corporation in Brazil. We are proud of these honors - they motivate us to become even better. The challenges are multiplying: We continue to face the negative impact of climate change and the decline in biodiversity. We must use resources responsibly. We are also still working to overcome the rami/fications of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine.\n\n## Dialogue with all stakeholders\n\nWe seek out conversations with all relevant stakeholders for the purposes of positioning our company as broadly as possible, discussing current developments and considering the expectations that various stakeholders have about sustainable company management. Examples of this dialogue include various WBCSD committees, the global representative bodies IFRA and IOFI and such initiatives as OP2B and the Development and Climate Alliance. We also conduct a particularly in-depth dialogue about sustainability with the company's shareholders, investors, voting proxies and rating agencies. Such rating agencies as MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS ESG have a high degree of quality and a major impact for our company regarding the communication of our ESG performance to investors. In addition, internationally recognized institutions like CDP, EcoVadis or SEDEX regularly grade our sustainability performance. This is important because both our customers and our investors expect us to continuously enhance our sustainability reporting. This is the only way that we can make our business processes more transparent and better estimate the opportunities and risks of our business activity.\n\nC h i e f S u st a in a b ili t y O /ffi c e r C h i e f E x e c u t i v e O /ffi c e r\n\nS u st a in a b ili t y B o a r d\n\nDr. Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Bertram, CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBernhard Kott, CSO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRanjeeta Boscolo, Global Procurement, Sustainability Scent & Care\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGa\u00eblle Bathany, Cosmetic Ingredients Marketing & Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Marcus Eh, Sustainability Aroma Molecules\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDoris Gattermann, Corporate Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOliver Kemmerich, Global Procurement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTobias Erfurth, Investor RelationsMarie Le Hena/ff, Sustainability Taste, Nutrition & Health\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSascha Liese, Corporate Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Philippa Smith, Sustainability Scent & Care\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore than 150 Sustainability Ambassadors worldwide\n\nMore than 12,000 employees in more than 40 countries\n\nGabriele Vielhaber, Sustainability Taste, Nutrition & Health\n\nFriedrich-Wilhelm Micus, Corporate CommunicationsDr. Stephanie Co\u00dfmann, Human Resources & Legal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Helmut Frieden, Corporate Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJasper H\u00f6lzchen, Corporate Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Making sustainability measurable\n\nThrough the introduction of the EU Taxonomy, the European Union has classi/fied environmentally sustainable business activities. Beginning in 2023, companies must demonstrate how they will incorporate six environmental goals into such areas as their capital expenditures or production technologies. Because Symrise's business model is sustainably structured per se, the Group must report and audit only a small portion of its activities. The company is well prepared for this work.\n\n  The European Green Deal is designed to make the EU the world's /first net zero economic region by 2050. The EU Taxonomy is an important aspect of this plan. This uniform classi/fication system is aimed at channeling private and public investments in a way that will /finance the transformation to a sustainable economy. The taxonomy is designed to answer many questions: What does sustainability mean in a commercial context and what does it not mean? Or: How can a company's own activities be assessed to determine which investments are sustainable? Symrise has posed these questions to itself - and found answers: 'The EU Taxonomy contains precise de/finitions and a speci/fic roadmap that shows how the economy in Europe can become more sustainable,' says Bernhard Kott, the Chief Sustainability O/fficer at Symrise.\n\nThe EU has de/fined six overarching environmental goals to structure the process:\n\n- 1. Climate protection\n- 2. Climate change adaption\n- 3. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. Transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nThe environmental taxonomy will be followed in the future by a social taxonomy that will include objectives in such areas as education and health. Aspects of good company management are to be integrated as well. 'At this point, all of our sustainability issues that we summarize under the pillars of footprint, sourcing, innovation and care will be covered by the taxonomy,' Bernhard Kott says.\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible versus taxonomy-aligned\n\nThe EU Taxonomy breaks down its six environmental goals into 16 segments that comprise a total of 230 activities. To meet the requirements, companies must carry out two di/fferent tasks per activity. They initially must identify the taxonomy-eligible commercial activities that a/ffect them. Taxonomy-eligible means that an activity has the potential to help achieve one of the six environmental goals. A company must then determine whether this activity is actually taxonomy-aligned, that is, if it is environmentally sustainable on the basis of the criteria. To be considered sustainable, they must apply three central principles:",

        "page_content": "- 1. Signi/ficant contribution: Companies must make a signi/ficant and measurable contribution to at least one of the environmental targets based on prede/fined technical criteria.\n- 2. No damage: The principle of do no signi/ficant harm has been introduced to ensure that none of the goals has a negative impact on any of the /five other objectives. For instance, climate protection measures should not have a harmful e/ffect on biodiversity.\n- 3. Minimum social standards: Even before the social taxonomy is adopted, companies should ensure that the taxonomy-eligible activities do not violate any minimum social standards - such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises or the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\n## Integration of the EU taxonomy and results\n\nThe policy classi/fies only those activities that have the potential to make the greatest contribution to the six EU environmental targets. For Symrise, this means that only 2 % of sales and 9 % of investments are taxonomy-eligible. The di/fference between taxonomyeligible and taxonomy-aligned is much more important. 'A small di/fference between the two indicates that a business or investment activity has a comparatively high degree of environmental compatibility,' Bernhard Kott says. At Symrise, the di/fference is relatively small. In /fiscal year 2023, it was about 2 % of annual sales at Symrise that were taxonomyeligible and -aligned. Of capital expenditures (CapEx), 9 % were taxonomy-eligible and 3 % taxonomyaligned.\n\nThe key reason for the good performance is that Symrise applies high standards. For instance, its environmental management system applies the standard ISO 14001. With SMETA, the company uses an audit standard of the Sedex organization to demonstrate its compliance with requirements regarding human rights, the environment, health, occupational\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhealth and safety and business ethics. To ensure that things remain this way, Symrise has included taxonomy-relevant requirements in the global CapEx tool. 'Sustainability is an important issue in every /financing activity,' Bernhard Kott says. He adds that about 200 Group employees around the world have been trained in taxonomy-related tasks.\n\n## Impulse for more sustainability\n\nFor Symrise, the EU Taxonomy is a time-consuming, but pro/fitable responsibility. 'We are very transparent about our sustainability activities,' Bernhard Kott says. 'We have been reporting on the basis of all relevant standards for more than 10 years now. We view these standards as both a guideline and a textbook.' As a result, Kott welcomes the EU Taxonomy that much more because it facilitates uniform standards. 'For many years, experts have complained about the lack of clear de/finitions for sustainable action,' Kott says. 'We now have comparability. Greenwashing is more di/fficult - and good sustainability performance has become more visible. For this reason, we do not view the EU Taxonomy as an obligation or burden. Rather, we want to use it as a way to become more and more sustainable.'\n\n|                     | Taxonomy-eligible  share   | Taxonomy-aligned   share   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Sales               | 2 %                        | 2 %                        |\n| Capital expenditure | 9 %                        | 3 %                        |",

In this interview, CEO Dr. Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Bertram explains how the company was able to grow for the 18th year in succession and how he will continue to implement the long-term strategy.\n\n## GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Dr. Bertram, the motto of this year's /financial report is 'Responsibility is in our nature.' What does this mean to you?\n\n  Symrise has always assumed responsibility: for its employees, for the neighbors of our sites and for the people who invest in our company and buy our shares. We considered this the right thing to do because we want all our stakeholders to share in the company's success. We greatly expanded this commitment more than ten years ago, focusing on sustainability at an early stage because it is very much in our own interest. Our products depend on nature and we must commit to sustainability for this reason alone.\n\n## This is not easy when the world is facing many other challenges. How did Symrise perform in 2023?\n\n  We are in the same position as many other international companies in that we are greatly a/ffected by geopolitical events. They have had a large impact on our supply chains and, coupled with high in/flation and currency translation e/ffects, this has more than halved our organic growth. Nevertheless, we were able to grow our sales organically by 7.9 %, thus exceeding our target of between 5 % and 7 %. This makes us the absolute leader in our industry.\n\n## You are aiming to achieve sales of between \u20ac 5.5 and 6 billion by 2025. Are you sticking to this target?\n\n  We remain committed to this target in light of our performance in the past /fiscal year and we've set ourselves a new mid-term target for 2028. By then, we intend to achieve sales of \u20ac 7.5 to 8 billion, at the same time maintaining our margin.\n\n## What makes you con/fident you can achieve this growth?\n\n  We are continuing to pursue our strategy based on the three pillars of growth, e/fficiency and portfolio, and this is linked inextricably to our sustainability targets. Our growth has two drivers. On the one hand, we are growing organically, for example, in the luxury fragrance sector, where we continue to develop and manufacture exciting new products for our global customers. The same applies in the body care, fragrance products, food and beverages, pet food and oral care businesses. At the same time, we have expanded our expertise and the basis for our activities through new acquisitions. For example, we have increased our stake in US company Kobo, a manufacturer of inorganic UV /filters. This acquisition is enabling us to accelerate the implementation of our growth strategy for cosmetic ingredients. We have also increased our stake in Swedencare to 42 %.\n\nAs a result of these acquisitions, the portfolio is shifting further away from the traditional /flavors and fragrance businesses in which you built your career. Why are you doing this?\n\n  We were the /first in our industry to start making sensible additions to our core businesses. At the same time, this was the /first step in the transformation toward the use of natural, sustainable and traceable raw materials. We are moving fast in this. Whereas around 10 % of our business was outside Flavor and Fragrance in 2008, it is now more than 30 % - and our new target is for half of sales in 2028 to be achieved outside our traditional business. This diversi/fication was and is critical to our success. It is enabling us to access entirely new markets and sales potential, putting our business on a broader footing. At the same time, though, we",

One way of doing this is by using the trendscope study for the food and beverages industry (see page 74). We use  similar market and consumer research tools in other areas of the company.\n\n## Can you give an example of one of these future markets?\n\n  Instead of pet food, we now talk about pet care, which also includes dietary supplements and preventive healthcare solutions. This is evidenced by the investment in Swedencare, for example. The company is growing strongly and is aiming for sales of \u20ac 400 million by 2026. Its portfolio includes oral care products for dogs and food products to control weight or improve mobility. Vegan protein sources for pet food are another focus because many dog and cat owners who are vegan themselves want to feed their animals in the same way. The pet market has been growing for years - and we are growing with it.\n\nYou mentioned preventive healthcare and are aiming to increase healthcare solutions in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment. How did you come to this decision?\n\n  For years, our portfolio has included solutions such as cranberry extracts, which have a scienti/fically proven bene/fit and a positive e/ffect on the urinary tract. We are now consolidating our knowledge of bioactives in a unit with its own strategy, vision and leadership and a dedicated team (see page 80), which will be working intensively in this area where we see enormous growth opportunities.\n\n## What other /fields of innovation are you addressing?\n\nThis shows that Symrise products are the result of a lot of research and development. Why don't you move into easier markets and applications in order to increase sales?\n\n  We focus on sustainable products that also deliver healthy margins in the long term. That is why we only acquire companies that match our pro/fitability level of around 20 % or that we can take to that level within three years. This cannot be achieved with mass products that have no speci/fic underlying know-how. At the same time, innovation has always been in our blood. We are now seeking to strengthen our innovative capability with the IGNITE program that aims to accelerate research and development (see page 104). Or, speci/fically, we are growing our AgroScience activities to investigate the methods of farming, harvesting and processing plant-based raw materials (see page 98).\n\nSymrise is very international with more than 100 locations worldwide. There is a trend toward deglobalization in some industries. Is that also a/ffecting you?\n\n  The markets are still extremely volatile and the use of digital marketing channels is growing signi/ficantly. We need to prepare our organization for this and develop a certain degree of /flexibility. However, we will continue to internationalize our business because we want to be close to our markets. It is the only way to really understand consumers and the speci/fic characteristics of individual regions. At the same time, we procure our raw materials from all over the world. Some 90 % of these are natural in origin. In order to monitor these materials, ensure their availability and purchase sustainably, it's important to be present. This is something we demonstrate in many instances. For example, in Madagascar, we work very closely with the small farmers that supply us (see page 54).\n\n  One trend is personalization. You just mentioned healthcare, for which we are developing probiotics, prebiotics and postbiotics. Our microbiome research is also delivering products tailored to individual users. The same applies to care and cosmetic products and to food. Thanks to our natural products, our portfolio holds the best solutions in all these /fields.",

For example, we are increasing our use of arti/ficial intelligence to optimize our fragrance compositions. The fundamental decisions are made by our perfumers, but we can make the upstream process more e/fficient by using AI to suggest certain parameters during fragrance development. However, these innovative technologies aren't only helping us in product creation. In the years ahead, we will be applying them to a growing extent in increasing e/fficiency - the third pillar of our corporate strategy. To this end, we will be implementing digital solutions in production and our supply chains, for example. That is how we aim to become more e/fficient.\n\nLet's now turn to the company's internal development. You've made a number of changes to the Executive Board. Why?\n\n  At the start of the year, Dr. J\u00f6rn Andreas took over as head of the Scent & Care segment, which I was in charge of temporarily for a year-and-a-half. He previously headed the Cosmetic Ingredients division. His appointment makes optimal use of our management resources. The company is growing fast and there is a lot to do. This is also the case in the Human Resources and Legal department, which is now headed by Dr. Stephanie Co\u00dfmann. She was previously a member of the Board of Management and Labor Director of Lanxess AG and will be shaping our human resource strategy for the future (see interview page 92). With this strategy, we aim to attract the best talents and develop our employees.\n\n\u00bb\n\nThe pet market has been growing for years - and we are growing with it.\n\n\u00ab\n\nThe most important change on the Executive Board will be the transfer of CEO responsibility to Jean-Yves Parisot. What should we expect from the change?\n\n  In fact, after 21 intensive years with the company, 19 of them on the board and 15 as CEO, I am retiring at the end of March 31st. I am proud of the things we accomplished together during these 21 years: Symrise has grown. Continuously and pro/fitably. Today, Symrise stands for ingenuity, the very highest quality and absolute reliability in our industry. This is primarily the result of the hard work done by our tremendous team. It was an honor to lead this team during these eventful years. Now is the right time to pass on the baton. Symrise will be in the very best hands under the guidance of Jean-Yves Parisot. We have known each other for years. I have the utmost respect for him both as a manager and a human being. He was one of the key architects of Symrise's far-reaching strategic focus in recent years. You can expect continuity from him. But it is also clear that my successor will set new priorities. And this is exactly as it should be.\n\nWe've talked about the present and the future, but the past will also play a big role in 2024. It was 150 years ago that chemists Wilhelm Haarmann and Ferdinand Tiemann /first synthesized vanillin in Holzminden, thus laying the foundation for Symrise. How important is this for you?\n\n  Our history is very important to us because it's a story of inventiveness and responsibility. Symrise was created in 2003 from the merger of Dragoco and Haarmann & Reimer, two Holzminden-based companies with long traditions. In 1874, Wilhelm Haarmann collaborated with Ferdinand Tiemann to develop a process for manufacturing vanillin from the sap of conifer trees, matching the natural /flavor of vanilla. He established the company one year later. Dragoco, on the other hand, /first saw success in fragrances in 1919. Both companies were pioneers in their /fields and industry leaders from the start. We are building on this heritage through our sustainable and successful research and business activities.",

Which issue did the company focus on during the past /fiscal year?\n\n  We broke down our sustainability activities into the four areas of footprint, sourcing, innovation and care. We transparently meet all SDGs in each of these categories. We are active in the entire range of issues because we are determined to become more sustainable. At the same time, we certainly want to remain commercially successful and be socially accepted. We focused last year on the issues of climate and supply chains.\n\n## Let's start with the climate. What are your objectives there?\n\n  We intend to be completely climate neutral by 2045, and this includes raw materials that we source from suppliers. We plan to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions to such a low level that we will be climate neutral in this area in 2030. By that point, we intend to lower our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, the segment that encompasses the emissions that occur during raw material production and transport, by 30 % compared with 2020. These levels are linked to the targets of the Executive Board and the next management levels to create a /financial incentive.\n\n## Symrise is a huge business group. How do you implement these plans?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  The headquarters in Holzminden is large and diverse. 80 % of all technologies that we use in the entire Group is located here. Holzminden serves as something of a blueprint for Symrise. We have identi/fied the processes here that emit the most CO2. We have analyzed the current state and the future of energy-production technologies as well as price trends for electricity, gas and hydrogen. Based on this research, we drew up a concept that will enable us to hit our climate targets and calculated investments in higher-impact sustainability technologies. In the process, we will reduce our use of oil and gas, electrify our operations to the greatest degree possible and stop emitting CO2 by 2045.",

        "page_content": "You just mentioned electri/fication, an area that is seen as a key weapon in the battle against climate change. What measures do you plan to introduce?\n\n  We have to create a smart system whose features are intelligently based on one another. As part of this e/ffort, we are using solar energy to generate electricity wherever we have large areas of space. In Germany, we are talking about the halls used by our logistics operation. But, above all, we are taking this approach in countries that get tremendous amounts of sunshine. We have installed a 4,800 square-meter photovoltaic system in our plant in Granada, Spain. This system can generate up to 1.6 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year. This is enough to meet 15 % of the production operation's power needs. Producing energy where it functions is a good lever for us. But the energy we produce ourselves will not meet our total demand. This is why we continue to purchase electricity. We have been exclusively using green power around the world since 2020.\n\n## From power generation to consumption: How do you intend to further reduce this level?\n\n  For years now, we have been doing the same thing that every household does: We cut our use of electricity wherever we can, from o/ffices to plants. In our production operation, we can take other approaches as well. In many cases, we use steam at 30 bar pressure in our processes. We use gas to do so. But, for some processes, you only need steam at three or eight bar pressure. We can produce this steam with an electrode boiler. We are taking a similar approach with heat, an area where we have switched to heat pumps just like private households. You could not have done this on an industrial scale a few years ago. But the technological progress made since then has created all sorts of new alternatives.\n\nSymrise faces a challenge: It intends to grow and will grow. By 2028 - the new long-term goal - you want to generate sales of between \u20ac 7.5 billion and \u20ac 8 billion. How will you meet the additional energy needs that a signi/ficantly higher production level will require?\n\n  We are con/fident that the current measures we have taken will enable us to save tremendous amounts of energy, something that we can also scale. We also think that energy-generating technologies and the technologies that we use in our processes will become increasingly more e/fficient. Long range, we also have completely new forms of energy on our radar, things like developments in hydrogen technologies. We are intensively monitoring them. We are planning to have made huge strides in this area by 2040 - we will not include hydrogen in our planning until then.\n\n## How will the /findings in Holzminden be used?\n\n  The pilot project has been completed. We are now rolling it out at all locations. We will conduct the same analyses and assessments everywhere and then introduce measures to address the individual situation. In step one, we will take a look at those locations where we can quickly prevent the most emissions. This will be good for the climate and for us, too, because we can lower long-term costs. With Germany and the United States, we cover 75 % of all CO2 emissions right now. We will tackle the rest of the world at a later stage, but in a very timely fashion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this work, we plan to analyze and assess emissions that arise on the product basis. We have to look very deeply into the value chain in this process. This also involves water consumption that we are directly recording. We are talking about scarce resources here. Starting in 2024, we have to base our reporting on the new CSRD Directive. This makes water consumption a higher priority.\n\nThe second major issue in 2023 was supply chains. What did you do in this area?\n\n  Last year, we focused closely on the natural raw materials that are essential to our company. We have had a very good overview of the challenges we face in various countries and regions for a long time. For this reason, it was not hard for us to include sourcing practices and human rights in our materiality analysis as the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act requires.\n\n## What does that mean?\n\n  Over the past few years, we have set up teams that examined the issues of health, safety and overall work conditions among suppliers - and focused in particular on the so-called vulnerable groups. In our case, we are talking about very many small farmers who possess little and earn little. We collected data on more than 20,000 suppliers, structured it and evaluated it on the basis of our Supplier Code of Conduct. By the way, we posted the code in various languages on our website.\n\n## How time-consuming was this process?\n\n  It involved a whole lot of work. You can see what I mean by looking at the small farmers again. They frequently do not own a computer, only smartphones. As a result, they cannot even express their consent to our Code of Conduct in writing. For this reason, our employees drove to them, inspected their work conditions and documented them. The results of this multi-stage process have to be organized in a way that enables them to be audited. But one /finding really pleased us: There were just a few cases where we needed to make improvements.",

What was done here?\n\n  The circular economy continues to be one of the core focal points of our sustainability activities. We work in all areas to do such things as use packaging materials as smartly as possible - through the selection of materials or innovative ways to pack products. The Pet Food division shows us how the circular economy works regarding the use of raw materials. Virtually all raw materials used here come from side streams or other production operations or reuse. We will continue to take this approach, throughout the entire Group.\n\nLet's talk about occupational health and safety for a moment. Symrise has done somewhat poorly here in recent years. Has the situation changed any?\n\n  Yes, we have made tremendous progress. We launched our Symsafe initiative in 2022 to improve our performance in terms of occupational health and safety. In the process, we improved our MAQ level - this is a German metric that is used to measure the number of occupational accidents with at least one lost day per million hours worked. We have lowered the level from 2.8 to 2.3. We intend to reach 2.2 this year. Our mid-range goal is to decrease it below 1.5 and keep it there. As part of the Symsafe initiative, we appointed occupational health and safety o/fficers around the world and introduced a series of rules and measures that apply to the everyday workplace.\n\nAll of these measures require large amounts of resources. You now face another EU directive that you will have to implement in 2024. Reporting will change drastically once again as a result of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). How have you prepared for it?\n\n  We devoted a very large amount of time to the topic of the CSRD in 2023. The area of double materiality will play a role starting this year. This means that we have to report not only on the way that our business activities impact people and the environment, but also on the impact of sustainability issues on our company. There is no doubt about it. This will require a lot of work on the one hand. On the other, we have been reporting very transparently on our sustainability performance for a long time, in part because we want our customers to gain an understanding of the impact that our products have on the environment. Apart from that, we are happy to take on the great amount of work involved. It's obvious. We must stop climate change - and Symrise has been doing its part for years.\n\n\u00bb\n\nWe must stop climate change and Symrise has been doing its part for years.\n\n\u00ab",

Yet their product was indeed very special. It could be used in place of vanilla - the costly queen of spices in some applications, making this /flavor a/ffordable and accessible to a broader consumer group.\n\nThe two scientists used a natural raw material that the company still uses today, extracting the vanillin in several stages from the sap of conifers. While Tiemann went on to work in academia, Haarmann laid the cornerstone for Symrise. He established his /first company in 1875, joining Karl Ludwig Reimer one year later to form Haarmann & Reimer.\n\nThe second predecessor of Symrise was also established in Holzminden. In 1919, hairdresser CarlWilhelm Gerberding founded Dragoco to manufacture perfume and soap compositions. The two companies evolved in parallel, went international and merged in 2003 to create what was then the world's fourth largest supplier of fragrances and /flavorings. Since its public listing in 2006, the company has continued to grow and move into new areas. In doing so, Symrise has focused on sustainability, developing an extensive strategy for this as early as 2005 that it has expanded massively in recent years.\n\nAnd so the company has come full circle. Now, as in 1874, nature is the foundation of Symrise's business, enabling it to continue operating both sustainably and successfully in the future as well.\n\n1874\n\n1919\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\nThe founders of Haarmann & Reimer discovered a way to synthesize aromatic vanillin.

The country has hardly any infrastructure, like roads, schools and hospitals. The infrastructure that does exist is in poor condition. It lacks social safety nets like insurance or government disaster-relief funds that are provided in the aftermath of natural catastrophes. Most of the farms are also so small that the farmers can hardly earn a living from them. Our network helps farmers increase their productivity and tap several sources of income so that they are able to get through crises more easily. As part of this e/ffort, we work with them to develop various value chains, purchase products at di/fferent times of year to ensure that they have an income throughout the year and pay prices that cover the sustainable production costs. We help them go into aquaculture, beekeeping and poultry farming. We also distribute seeds and seedlings to the farmers.\n\n## Sustainable support for a better future\n\nOne other top priority is to teach farmers to manage their budget and savings in order to pay o/ff their debts. More than 20,000 people now have health insurance thanks to our e/fforts. We have about 7,000 farmers in the farm management program and have trained about 11,000 in good farming practices.

Some farmers may view planting certain trees as too risky because they have no experience with them. Exam ples of these plants include bay, ylang-ylang and citrus trees. Some farmers prefer to grow only vanilla because it has the highest yield. Madagascar is also subject to crop-damaging typhoons.

The team used the principles of green chemistry to adapt and improve the processes to more e/fficiently manu facture the product, thereby making it more sustainable.\n\nINNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n  If you ask a perfumer what fragrance they wouldn't want to do without, the reply is often the same: musk. It certainly is omnipresent, commonly found in the most popular blends of /fine fragrances and in household products. The signi/ficance of the fragrance comes from its properties that have been recognized for centuries: 'Musk fragrances tend not to dominate the top note but remain in the background, enabling other substances to take e/ffect and the perfume to be smelled on the skin for a long time,' says Dr. Peter Esser. This also applies to its use in detergents, for example. 'Musk deposits the fragrances in a towel so that it still smells fresh weeks after being washed,' explains the head of chemical production. He is responsible for the Symrise production operations in Holzminden (Germany), Granada (Spain), Bushy Park, Colonels Island and Jacksonville (all USA) as well as Monterrey (Mexico).\n\nPeter Esser has been working with fragrance molecules for decades. He and his team are always /finding new ways to make their production more e/fficient and more sustainable. And now Symrise has also made great advances with musk fragrances. At the Bushy Park plant in South Carolina, Peter Esser has developed and optimized the production technology of the well-known and biodegradable musk fragrance Globanone \u00ae so that almost no waste results from its manufacture. 'The process dates back to our work in the late 1990s, and we /first produced Globanone \u00ae in 2002 in Bushy Park,' recalls Esser. The decisive step is the metathesis reaction, which makes complex synthesis possible in just a few steps and therefore requires fewer resources and gives o/ff fewer byproducts.\n\n\u00bb\n\n## We also always keep an eye on improving processes.\n\n\u00ab\n\nDr. Peter Esser, Vice President Global Chemical Production",

'The demand for Globanone \u00ae has steadily increased since then, and so we continued to develop production plans and are now working with three times the capacity,' says Esser. It is important to the chemist, however, that Symrise think beyond emissions when planning expansion. 'We always have an eye on optimizing the process as well.'\n\nIn the case of Globanone \u00ae , this means that Symrise has improved the already extremely e/ffective process based on the twelve principles of green chemistry. But optimizing an established, successful process is not easy. 'We are on a constant learning curve that has enabled us over the years to greatly enhance our understanding of how certain technologies function,' says Dr. Tom Brunzel, manager at Bushy Park for the last year. The 32-year-old was involved with Globanone \u00ae during his doctorate and enjoys tinkering with processes to make them better. 'For example, we still use the same catalyst as before, but use far less material,' he explains, describing one of their successes.\n\nThe consumption of solvents has fallen drastically, and the solvents used are now based on renewable raw materials. 'We can also recycle both solvents by condensing them from the gas byproducts and keeping them in the cycle,' says Brunzel, explaining another bene/fit. Other decisive factors for process improvement are e/fficient energy recovery and a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nclear reduction in water consumption. Both have been achieved. Symrise uses what is known as vapor recompression to recover evaporation heat. This means that much less external energy is required and far less water is used. 'The /first stage of our production is free of process wastewater.  We are currently working on solutions for the further stages in order to eliminate the very small amounts of wastewater,' says Dr. Tom Brunzel.\n\nAll these steps mean that Globanone \u00ae can be produced with virtually zero waste. 'Globanone \u00ae works on both a sensory and a practical level,' says Peter Esser. 'Our perfumers have told us that the fragrance molecule gives a warm, velvety and long-lasting musk note. It lifts other fragrances but doesn't overpower them. It also o/ffers substance, stability and volume.' The investment in Bushy Park has been very worthwhile, says Esser - both for the product and the environment.",

The photovoltaic system meets 15 % of the power needs of the fragrance production operation.\n\nThe system in Spain is one of hundreds of steps that Symrise will take in coming years to reduce its CO2 emissions. 'We formulated our climate strategy back in 2010, and we were one of the /first companies to do so,' says Dr. Helmut Frieden, Vice President for Corporate Sustainability at Symrise. 'At the time, we set the goal of cutting our CO2 emissions by onethird by 2020. We achieved this goal in 2016 and then immediately set more ambitious targets.' Symrise is striving to reach the below-1.5-degree target for Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions - that is, the emission of greenhouse gases that arise directly in the production operation or come from purchased forms of energy. For Scope 3, which covers climate-damaging gases in the upstream and downstream supply chain, the company is working to reach the below-2degree goal, Helmut Frieden says. By 2030, the Group aims to be climate neutral in Scope 1 and 2 and have reduced emissions by 30 % for Scope 3 the entire Group should be climate neutral by 2045.\n\nDr. Helmut Frieden works with the sustainability team at Symrise to achieve the company's climate goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate protection is important to Symrise and its business model. 'We source most of our raw materials directly from nature. For this reason, it is only natural for us to protect the climate and foster biodiversity,' Helmut Frieden says.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the sustainability team in Holzminden has worked closely with the company's locations in Germany to plan future years and decades and set investment totals. Initially, some relatively simple steps are to be taken. Things like installing photovoltaic systems and switching the company's /fleet to electric vehicles. After that, the techno logically challenging part begins. 'We plan\n\n\u00bb\n\nWe source most of our raw materials directly from nature.

        "page_content": "to electrify our production operation in order to give up fossil fuels like natural gas,' Helmut Frieden says. Part of this transition involves installing electrode boilers for high-pressure steam networks or industrial heat pumps, among other things. But the planning extends much further than this. 'We have also included the industrial-scale use of hydrogen in our plans, even though there are no networks for it right now,' Frieden says. 'But we are con/fident that we can get started in 15 years.' The sustainability manager thinks the plans can be realized if Symrise continues to steadily grow as it has in the past. 'We have directly included higher production volumes in order to be prepared for the future.' The investments are high, Frieden stresses. 'But the investments will quickly pay for themselves in many places because we will take certain actions, such as sharply lowering our energy and CO2 costs,' he notes.\n\nThe activities carried out in Germany will now be rolled out worldwide. The /first step in this process will identify the locations with the highest emission levels. Production operations in the United States cause more than half of all CO2 emissions. The next focal point is to be set there. Germany ranks second due to the size of the plants at the company's headquarters. It is followed by Ecuador and Mexico. 'We are now setting the exact amounts of investment by identifying the business locations with the highest optimization potential,' Helmut Frieden says.\n\nFrance, where the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment primarily operates numerous plants, ranks fourth. From here, in Rennes in Brittany, Thierry Lenice reviews\n\nthe plans. 'We will start with our plants in the United States, Mexico and China and then quickly integrate all remaining production operations,' the Low Carbon Transition Manager says. He also works intensely with Scope 3, the core of which focuses on the carbon footprint of raw materials. 'About 80 % of greenhouse gases are created during the production and transport of our natural substances,' Thierry Lenice says.\n\nOne focal area is the recipes for products whose life cycle was analyzed by his team in recent years. In addition to other aspects, this includes environmental impacts such as emissions of CO2 equivalents. To illustrate his point, Thierry Lenice has placed two glasses of a soft drink in front of him. One beverage is the original version. The other is a re/fined version made with an optimized recipe that is designed to reduce the carbon footprint of the entire product. 'In the past, we used pure orange extract for this soft drink,' the manager says. 'We have now changed the /flavoring ingredients by using a di/fferent mixture. We previously used 100 % orange extract from Brazil. We changed the recipe to include 20 % domestic mushroom extract that contributes the same texture and the same /flavor.' Both products are totally natural, taste the same - and the new mixture produces fewer greenhouse gases along the entire value chain.\n\nWith the help of this eco-design, emissions can be reduced by an average of 30 %. As part of this e/ffort, Thierry Lenice also focuses on local producers. 'We work closely with them,' he says. 'On the one hand, we assess their e/fforts to reduce our carbon footprint and, on the other hand, consider ways that we can help them become more sustainable,' Thierry Lenice says. But he adds that the suppliers who work with thousands of small farmers face some challenges in this e/ffort. 'Due to their size alone, it is not easy for many of them to meet and document the standards,' he says. Lenice considers this type of collaboration to be especially important. 'We live from agriculture and obtain our raw materials there,' he says. 'By playing an active role here, we can pull the right levers and make our products more sustainable.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Driven by a strong vision and answering a growing demand from its customers, Symrise plans to continue reducing its carbon footprint, with the goal of reaching net zero by 2045. To achieve this ambitious goal, the company has launched the Houston program, which is meant to build and implement a uniform approach to calculate the carbon and water footprint (at product and corporate level) throughout the Group and to raise awareness among all employees on the topic of sustainability.\n\nINNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT, CLIMATE\n\n  In the early 1960s, the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, the command center of the US space program, made its home in the city of Houston, Texas, in the United States. Humanity has made great strides with Houston in control, for example the /first manned /flight to the moon and space shuttle launches into outer space. Houston has become a symbol for well-conceived, tightly organized projects - and that is what Symrise is counting on with its Houston program, which began in 2023. The objective here, however, is not to reach the moon - it's to /find a path to greater sustainability for the entire Group.\n\n'As is the case with space travel, we divided the Houston program into three phases that build upon one another and are designed to make Symrise more sustainable on multiple levels,' says Claire Du Peloux. A native of France, Du Peloux is heading up the project and oversees a team that is spread across functions, regions and organizational units. She has worked in Symrise's /finance and controlling department in Rennes since 2010, in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, and joined the sustainability team two years ago. During the Ignition phase, which was /finalized in January 2024, the team gathered data and facts to understand the needs and priorities of internal and external stakeholders. Based on this input, they decided on a way forward, and built a concrete roadmap to shape the company's vision. This /first phase entailed, among others things, the de/finition of global business requirements and the identi/fication of technical IT solutions that could deliver on them. The Lift-o/ff phase will then be dedicated to testing the chosen IT platform throughout spring 2024. Finally, the Orbit phase will support the tool's rollout within the whole Group by the end of 2025.\n\nThe project started with intensive research. 'We surveyed stakeholders on all levels - here in the Group, but also our sustainability colleagues at our customers, for example,' Claire Du Peloux explains. 'Houston can only be e/ffective if we align our activities with those of our customers and other stakeholders.' In view of the fact that 80 % of Symrise sales are generated with only 25 % of Symrise's /finished products, the team made the choice to build Houston on this basis, focusing their e/fforts on these 25 % of products for the two years to come, to quickly meet customers' high expectations. Indeed, more and more customers are inquiring about the carbon footprint of their products. 'They want to know what the /figures show today, but they also want to see our roadmap for decarbonization,' Claire Du Peloux says. Just like Symrise, all companies of a certain size have written out their climate targets. 'Global customers are passing the pressure on to suppliers, expecting us to move on from pledge to plan. This is why we have to measure, track and analyze our footprint from Group view down to product level in order to design and o/ffer to our customers - as much as possible - low-carbon and, in a second step, low-water alternatives. User-friendliness, data accuracy and safety are key criteria for the new tool.'\n\nLaure Vassel was also involved in the 50 interviews with 140 stakeholders. She has worked for the company since the beginning of 2022 and is involved in the Houston program as a business sustainability analyst. 'By 2030, we plan to reduce our Scope 3 emissions (e.g., the emissions linked to the cultivation, production and transport of the company's purchased raw materials) by 30 %,' Laure Vassel says. 'To this end, we touched on all parts of the value chain in our",

        "page_content": "interviews, as all business areas have their role to play. From alternative sourcing, innovative recipes, more e/fficient production processes and clever solutions in logistics, the whole Symrise organization and upstream value chain has a part to play,' she says, listing numerous reduction levers. This collective e/ffort is of paramount importance, as purchased products represent 85 % of our emissions today.\n\nLaure Vassel also makes it clear that, although corporate targets are set at a global level and apply all around the globe across all divisions, the challenges to reach them may vary greatly. 'The Houston program won't churn out a one-size-/fits-all solution. Instead, it will support the emergence of a new mindset that we strive to introduce and implement as one Symrise team: a common framework and way of working, accounting for all business speci/ficities.' Claire Du Peloux con/firms this, as she sees the program as the foundation upon which Symrise's Low Carbon Transition Plan can come to fruition. 'With the Houston program, our aim is to build up cohesion within the Group and become a geared team for greater sustainability around the world.' Sustainability should be the focus of the global value promise, and Symrise should remain a pioneer in the industry and business.\n\nThe project team is aware that a deep mindset change is required for this tool to reach its objective. This is why they put together a set of proposals articulated in four pillars: Leadership, EcoSystem, People and Data. Leadership is expected to drive the sustainability strategy toward action mode, transition and innovation. As part of an EcoSystem, the Group shall rally its network and expand partnership culture in its interactions with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.\n\nAs an example falling under the People pillar, which focuses on education and training, every employee could be given the opportunity to take part in a Climate Fresk workshop - based on the card game of the same name, with which an NGO has already explained the fundamentals of climate change to hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. 'It's important to make what is happening right now tangible for people,' says Claire Du Peloux. 'Above all, we have to give ourselves the tools to do something about it.' Finally, an example to illustrate the data\n\nenhancement vision could be the data management workstream, which would allow harmonization and ensure a satisfactory level of data quality. 'We at Symrise have to properly collect, structure and analyze our data in order to be successful,' Claire Du Peloux says.\n\nDu Peloux and Vassel are con/fident that the Houston program will provide a lot of impetus - even though the processes, standards and regulations can di/ffer greatly between Pet Food and Cosmetic Ingredients, for example, or Fine Fragrance and Food & Beverage. 'The learning curve is still steep,' Claire Du Peloux and Laure Vessel say. 'With Houston's /first phase, however, we have taken the /first step - compiling the different needs and creating an approach that's suitable for the entire Group.'\n\n32\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nkey actions have been identi/fied in the Low Carbon Transition Plan.\n\n\u00bb\n\n## By 2030, we plan to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 30 %.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\nLaure Vassel,\n\nBusiness Sustainability Analyst\n\n<!-- image -->",

Initially it was merely a matter of satisfying hunger; enjoyment and health were secondary. And today? Food has become an important part of our life, especially once basic needs have been met. Compared with centuries ago, people are far more concerned these days with what they are eating, how it a/ffects their health and whether their eating habits are socially acceptable. The industry must constantly up its game and adapt to new trends.\n\nFor Symrise, this means continuously monitoring and analyzing consumer behavior in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, to provide our customers with the best solution for their products in order to satisfy consumers. This applies to small food startups and global food companies alike. Our trendscope\u2122 report, conceived in 2007 originally for the beverages market, is intended to serve precisely this purpose. 'Our customers and internal departments found the results so helpful that we have continued to develop the report and now include other food categories,' says Regine Lueghausen, Vice President Global Marketing\n\nThe trendscope\u2122 team now draws on a large number of qualitative and quantitative approaches combined with a variety of di/fferent data sources. 'For example, we analyze consumer reports about food that we /find online or on social media,' says Leif Jago of a signi/ficant part of their research. He is Global Marketing Manager Food & Beverage at Symrise and since 2021 has been one of the people responsible for the report. The team also analyzes studies, market reports and other surveys in order to better understand consumer behavior and preferences. The research also looks at the new products being launched by the food and beverages industry. 'Many trends emerge in the world's urban hotspots. In twelve of those, including Shanghai, Berlin, Tokyo and New York, we have conducted interviews with food bloggers, journalists and trendspotters,' says Jago. The /findings are shared and discussed with Symrise colleagues from marketing and product development at sites all over the world, who contribute their expert knowledge of local trends. 'We also take this opportunity to /find out which concepts are in particularly high demand among our customers at the moment, to be sure their side is also re/flected,' explains Regine Lueghausen. This holistic approach goes even further: The research provides the basis for individual reports for the beverages, food, dairy products, snacks and confectionery product categories.

To take an example from trendscope\u2122 2024+: 'The topic of health is becoming increasingly important, particularly since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, and physical and mental well-being are a priority for many people,' says Leif Jago. According to him, consumers are gaining a better understanding of how closely the two are linked. trendscope\u2122 features another similar trend, which it calls 'mindful choices,' referring to the push to consume less sugar, salt and fat but without sacri/ficing taste; the term 'plant-based' is generally used as a synonym for meat substitutes. 'But we are noticing that the phenomenon is much broader: Consumers are increasingly asking for plant-based products that are tasty and healthy, and not only as an alternative to eating meat,' says Leif Jago. For instance: 'Activist Eating' sees consumers seeking out products that can be manufactured with signi/ficantly lower carbon emissions than others. 'This trend will be around for a while.' For Symrise, there is always the question of what the macro trends mean for our own portfolio, says Regine Lueghausen. 'We are extremely agile and are always keeping an eye on the\n\nskill sets we need. The objective is to help our customers achieve their goals and simultaneously contribute to the sustainable success of Symrise.'\n\nOnce trendscope\u2122 is developed for a particular product category, it sets o/ff a structured process. The Symrise business units that implement the /findings receive in-depth webinar training, supplemented by a toolbox of materials, ranging from brief descriptions of the trends, infographics, right through to presentations and videos tailored to individual customers. 'We can then build on this knowledge to develop taste solutions that we can use to reconcile consumer demands with our customers' strategies,' says Barbara Bridges. 'We can use trendscope\u2122 to create value by making better use of our resources.' The Food & Beverage Global Account Director passes on the report's /findings to her international customers.

'There are promising /findings showing that Prebiocran\u2122 can help support metabolic health,' says Renata Leite. An in vitro study using a simulation of the gastrointestinal tract supports the product's e/ffectiveness. A clinical pilot study was also conducted. For a complete and additional value solution, products like Prebiocran\u2122 can also be combined with other Symrise expertise, such as taste-masking.",

Using a pipette, she drops exactly 3.5 grams of a fragrance ingredient into a glass beaker that already contains a few centiliters of a clear liquid. She carefully shakes the beaker, dips a paper scent strip into it, pulls it out and carefully approaches it with her nose. She smells it and nods - she likes the composition.\n\nWorking in the laboratory is part of the daily routine for this 29-year-old, who studied chemistry in Strasbourg and then at the renowned ISIPCA perfumery school in Paris before graduating as a perfumer at Symrise in September 2023. She now develops perfume compositions on the computer, has them mixed together and tests them. From time to time, however, she carries out the manual process herself to get a /firsthand impression. But Anne Dussourt has a much bigger goal in mind beyond her daily work: She wants to help minimize the carbon footprint of perfumes. That's a major task, since Symrise has a palette of over a thousand raw materials which are currently actively used for new compositions.\n\nTraining at the Symrise Perfumery School takes /five years. For her masterpiece, Anne Dussourt examined the impact of carbon footprint on fragrance creations. Although only a few grams of fragrance oil are used in a typical bottle of perfume, the quantity makes all the di/fference. Worldwide, millions upon millions of perfumes are sold every year in the /fine fragrance segment alone. Fragrances are also used in detergents, shampoos, soaps and lotions. Anne Dussourt mentions another /figure: 'The average French person produces eight to twelve tons of CO2 per year. Although the fragrances only make up a tiny fraction of that, we can still contribute to reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Symrise perfumer Anne Dussourt examined the impact of the carbon footprint on the creation of fragrances.\n\n<!-- image -->",

She already dealt with biodegradable and renewable raw materials for her exam as a junior perfumer. 'Sustainability is part of the creation process,' she says. 'We have to constantly rethink and implement it.' In her masterpiece, she took her ideas further, evaluated them and created a range of fragrances, focusing on di/fferent sustainability parameters. A panel of experienced managers, perfumers and HR managers judged the creations.\n\nShe was assisted by Seynabou Ndao. The 24-year-old, who focused on sustainability and green chemistry during her chemistry studies, started as an intern at Symrise. She analyzed how much CO2 is emitted during the entire value chain up to the completion of the perfume - from the cultivation of the individual raw materials to mixing in the laboratories. She spent several months analyzing the portfolio of raw materials and collecting information. 'With some materials, such as alcohols or esters, it's relatively easy because the processes are so clearly structured and well doc umented,' says the chemical engineer, who comes from Senegal and studied in France. The substances that Symrise produces from sidestreams at its plant in Jacksonville in the United States are relatively easy to cluster and evaluate, says Seynabou Ndao. 'With essential oils that come from natural raw materials such as plants, however, it's much more complex.' She is continuously working to improve data quality. To that end, she also involves the suppliers: 'We work with them to support them and encourage them on their carbon footprint journey.'\n\nThe topic has gained huge momentum overall for Symrise since 2022. 'The carbon footprint of raw\n\nmaterials and fragrance compositions is becoming increasingly important for our customers,' says Philippa Smith, Sustainability Director Scent & Care at Symrise. 'That's why we focused on examining our range of raw materials at an early stage and are proud of this project. It's  groundbreaking in our industry.' The degree of innovation in the masterpiece is very high. 'Before my thesis, there was no clear de/finition of what a low carbon footprint should mean for a  fragrance,' says Anne Dussourt. 'Linking fragrance creation to carbon footprint data in our system was a key part of the project.'\n\nIn her master's thesis, Anne Dussourt focused on the application of sustainability data to fragrances. She created a range of fragrance compositions that Symrise customers use, for example in shampoos, shower gels and deodorants. To do so, she /first created a conventional fragrance, such as a fruit-scented\n\nSeynabou Ndao analyzed the raw material portfolio of Symrise to determine how much CO 2 is emitted by the value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the other blends, she replaced various ingredients in order to reduce the carbon emissions and use as many biodegradable and renewable raw materials as possible. 'We were able to show that we could reduce the carbon footprint by up to 20 %, for example,' says Anne Dussourt. They discovered that it's easier to replace certain fragrance ingredients, but more di/fficult to do so for others. One positive\n\nresult was that through careful ingredient selection, costs and performance could be maintained.\n\nHowever, determining the carbon footprint alone is not enough. The industry cannot simply dispense with fragrances that have high carbon emissions. 'We face a challenge on several levels: Fragrances have to continue to smell as good as they did before,",

In addition, Symrise's customers often have di/fferent demands when it comes to the biodegradability of products or the renewability of raw materials, for example. What's more, they want to set themselves apart from each other.\n\nConsumers also only buy what they like on all levels: They want sustainability, but also the familiar fragrance. That includes ensuring that a fragrance, for example in a detergent, doesn't evaporate immediately. It still has to be perceptible when an item of clothing is taken out of the closet after being there for a while. Because some molecules only interact with others in a speci/fic way, perfumers cannot simply swap raw materials. At the same time, certain substances are essential for a perfume: 'We need musky base notes, for example, which often have a higher carbon footprint. They do, however, ensure longevity,' says Anne Dussourt. This is exactly where great savings can be made if there are good substitutes or other compositions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

'The substances are almost always produced according to the principles of green chemistry from sidestreams in other sectors and are therefore very sustainable,' says Anne Dussourt. Philippa Smith is also aware of several levers that Symrise can use. 'We will talk to suppliers about how they can use these materials to reduce the carbon footprint,' says the Sustainability Director. Symrise has a close relationship with producers, thus allowing the company to select the most sustainable suppliers. 'We also decide for ourselves what we include in the portfolio and can therefore also pay attention to the CO2 values. And we have a lot of in/fluence on the creation process, in which we can put together the best possible compositions.' To that end, the team is rolling out the /findings for all perfumers around the world to answer questions and also raise awareness of the topic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nraw materials are actively used by Symrise for new fragrance compositions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhilippa Smith and Anne Dussourt also put the work on the carbon footprint in perspective: 'Sustainability is much more than just preventing greenhouse gases,' says Philippa Smith. 'The topic is highly complex when we include the other dimensions of sustainability,' Anne Dussourt adds. In Madagascar, for example, where Symrise distills a range of natural substances, the focus is on social impact with the smallholder farmers, while in India the focus is on supporting farming communities through climatesmart agriculture, such as solar-powered irrigation. At the same time, natural substances have the disadvantage that they use large areas of land, but the advantage that they can support biodiversity. 'We have to therefore always look at how we can improve products in all areas,' says Philippa Smith. To that end, the data will be optimized in the coming years as a basis, hence making more and more fragrance compositions more sustainable. 'We'll continue to work on the topic so that we can use increasingly better and more sustainable raw materials to develop sustainable creations,' says Anne Dussourt. 'Our journey has only just begun.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

After your /first year, what is your impression of the corporate culture at Symrise and where do you see the challenges?\n\n  Symrise has a fantastic culture that impressed me from the start. It is the people and how they work together that make the di/fference. The company's employees have a very entrepreneurial mindset, with a pragmatic and hands-on approach to solving problems. They are sometimes hindered by what I see as the biggest challenge in our function. The strong growth and many acquisitions in recent years have changed the company but the structures and processes haven't quite kept pace. We lack a suitable framework for both HR and compliance.\n\n## What is your response to this?\n\n  In order to refocus on the company's employees, as we should do in our work, we need to create structures like a transparent salary structure that enables us to see what talents we have and track the performance of both our employees and business units. If we don't do this, we'll be stuck in silos. Our starting point is the tHRive project, which is aimed at making our HR organization /fit for the future. A core element of this is harmonizing the framework and procedures for all the company's HR teams.\n\n## How will their work change?\n\n  We have established four Centers of Expertise covering 'Talent Acquisition,' 'Compensation and Bene/fits,' 'Talent Management' and 'Systems, Analytics and Sustainability.' These are all future issues that impact the entire company.\n\nThis is certain to change the tasks of our HR colleagues. Could you give some examples?\n\n  The old ways of working are not adequate in the battle for new employees. Our recruiters now operate in global networks, using LinkedIn and other social media to identify future candidates. They are able to engage with them and hopefully attract them to join us. Another example: We are working on uniform remuneration structures and job titles to also facilitate the transfer of employees between regions. To date, there have been no standard assessment criteria in talent management and few talent programs. In order to implement all these plans, we are introducing Workday, a human capital management tool. The /first module should be up and running by the end of the year. There's still a lot of work to be done before then in order to collate, analyze and process all the existing data within the company. The system will represent a quantum leap for us, enabling us to work faster, more transparently and with greater focus. It will also put us in a better position to achieve the fourth goal of our work. As part of our sustainability activities, we must intensify our reporting of HR indicators such as diversity and occupational safety and manage these accordingly.\n\n## It sounds as if a lot of e/ffort is involved. Why is HR doing this?\n\n  We are living in an era in which companies have to compete for talents and not vice versa as used to be the case. People still want to be paid well for their work, but aspects such as a company's purpose, culture, products and teams are becoming increasingly important. We at Symrise have a lot to o/ffer - and we aim to highlight this.",

In the past, we were very fragmented, with di/fferent roles, processes and standards in the various regions and segments. Now we are working on a new system that functions in all countries and organizations, no matter how big they are. The goal is 'One HR,' a global HR community. In this connection, we have rede/fined some roles. These employees will move from being generalists to specialists who perform a variety of tasks. They will provide global process support to their colleagues in the regions, who in turn will ensure that the processes are applied regionally. HR work is often governed by di/fferent rules depending on the country. Cultural circumstances vary, employment contracts may be structured di/fferently and laws and regulations aren't the same everywhere. All this needs to be taken into account.\n\nWe are currently in the transition phase toward a joint system with harmonized global standards that will be mapped in our Workday HR suite. It is important that the entire team is on board with this. We are training some 200 employees who are all very experienced in their own /fields and familiar with the speci/fic features of their regions. It is remarkable to see the commitment demonstrated by our colleagues in all time zones and the expertise they are contributing to shape this change. We will be supporting them in familiarizing themselves with the new structure and working in a digitalized process landscape. One thing is clear: Such far-reaching changes require equally intensive support. And we also should not forget that it's a work in progress - and that's a great challenge.

On the one hand, this applies to our HR colleagues, who will be able to map the recruitment, talent management, HR planning and all other core processes in many di/fferent languages. It also applies to the company's employees. They will receive access to Workday, which is being implemented as a cloud solution, enabling them to consult their own data and documents and to obtain information about development opportunities. We want satis/fied employees and Workday will help achieve this. It will also be a powerful tool for the company's executives. They will be able to analyze which talents they have in their organization, identify suitable development opportunities and plan further steps together with their employees. In a later expansion phase, this transparency will also increase mobility within the company.\n\nBy involving employees more closely in this way, we hope to keep them with the company longer. It is known that transparency and an open corporate culture can contribute to this. We are aiming to reach the entire workforce of some 13,000 employees, including those in production roles. That is why it was important to us that employees can also use Workday on their private cellphones - of course, in compliance with clear security rules.\n\nAt the moment, we are preparing the data and consulting on the processes worldwide. We are leaving behind a fragmented system landscape in which various systems previously ran in parallel. We now have to collect, validate and cleanse data so that we can make a fresh start with Workday.

The focus is on recruitment, employer branding, onboarding processes, contract design and training and development. These are all important tasks without which a company cannot function. At Symrise, we are now going one step further by becoming a strategic business partner which strengthens the link between HR and business strategies.\n\nOne example of this is strategic HR planning, which we intend to address with a stronger focus. We will be creating structures that enable us to document our employees' strengths worldwide. This will enable us to see where we need certain skills within the company and plan better for the next /five years. It will also make it possible to improve the management of our business activities and facilitate the transfer of talents. As a result, we won't be a pure service function but will be involved in conception and design, working both with the individual segments and across the entire company. To this end, we have created new structures in which four HR Business Partners have regional responsibility while three others work globally across the di/fferent stages of the value chain. This close connection to the business is also evident in my case. I was formerly Director Category & Product Management in the APAC region; now I'm the Global HR Business Partner and a member of the Leadership team in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment.

'It was given a boost in the 2010s as advances in LED technology made the requisite lighting a/ffordable,' says Dr. Jakob Ley. 'We have long been working on this and are currently concentrating on around 10 di/fferent varieties of plant that previously were hardly ever cultivated or only grow in the tropics,' explains the Director Research Biobased Ingredients. In addition to AgroScience, he is also responsible for four other research areas. 'This means that we can farm and analyze more unusual varieties here in Holzminden.'\n\nOne challenge was to obtain the plant material in the /first place. 'The Nagoya Protocol seeks to safeguard biodiversity, particularly in emerging and developing countries, and prevents the exploitation of natural resources,' explains Ley. 'We therefore only have plant o/ffspring obtained from the countries of origin as per the Nagoya Protocol or that were available and freely traded in Europe prior to its introduction in 2014, for example in nurseries, but also research facilities or botanical gardens.' For further research, Symrise also makes use of seedlings.\n\nLey is keen to point out that the countries of origin too will bene/fit from the work at a later date. For example, the team is working on improving their understanding of when the vanilla buds blossom. 'The small farmers in Madagascar must check all the plants every morning during the growing season. The orchids only bloom for one day and the farmer must pollinate them by hand,' says Ley of the timeconsuming work. 'If we understand how this process works in the plant, how we can predict it and maybe even shorten it, that would be a great help.' Symrise is also experimenting with light and moisture control. The researchers analyze leaves, roots and stems to try to gain a better understanding of the phytohormones that, as signaling molecules, regulate the development of the plants. The team is also investig ating infections in the vanilla plant caused by fusarium. The sac fungi are responsible for the loss of 30 % of plants in the plantation. 'We experiment with di/fferent irrigation methods or substrates that could prevent the fungus from growing,' says Ley. The /findings will then also be passed on to the farmers in Madagascar.\n\nFor Jakob Ley, AgroScience is here to stay, and his platform works closely with other research departments. There are collaboration projects in place with universities and other industrial partners, with know-how and analytical equipment being shared. For Dr. Gerhard Krammer too, AgroScience is inextricably linked to Symrise. 'We have a long tradition of processing natural substances.

Today, we buy natural substances from all over the world,' says the head of the Research & Technology division in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment. And he believes it makes perfect sense to also conduct research in farming. 'If we combine the growing methods of biotechnology with modern farming practices, we can produce better harvests and better quality. We also prevent waste and develop innovative products, thereby becoming increasingly sustainable.' Krammer sees indoor farming as key in this regard. 'With de/fined growing environments and modern ana lytical technology, we can undertake more structured experiments to produce the best farming conditions.' These must also take into account how di/fferent plant species are cultivated, how the ingredients of these plants are optimized and how the growing season is extended.\n\nBut the goal is always the same: 'Symrise currently uses around 1,500 to 2,000 botanical raw materials that must primarily be extracted and processed. So it is important to develop products with particular properties that have an unmis takable smell, taste and e/ffect,' says Gerhard Krammer. One example for this is the onion. Symrise has worked with farmers in the region to optimize methods to such an extent that the extract is exported as far a/field as Japan. 'We have cultivated a very reasonably priced raw material in such a way and in such formulations that it is unmistakable.' Gerhard Krammer sees further work on raw materials in AgroScience as essential. 'It gives us such a unique selling proposition that we can achieve sustained success.'\n\n## SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT IN SINGAPORE\n\nWhen space is at a premium, build upward. This works just as well with plants as it does with buildings. Lettuce, herbs and strawberries can be grown in multiple levels one on top of the other under arti/ficial light and without soil, receiving nutrients in liquid form. This does indeed save space: One hectare of vertical farming is the equivalent of 10 hectares of conventional /fields. On the one hand, this farming method could in future help to feed people regionally and sustainably in towns. On the other, the plants can be farmed in a controlled environment in such a way that they produce more valuable ingredients.\n\nTo this end, the Symrise Scent & Care segment has embarked on an experiment together with Taste, Nutrition & Health in Singapore. A multidisciplinary team selected plants that are already part of Symrise's raw materials portfolio or will be of interest in the future and brought together plant geneticists, agronomists, /flavor and fragrance scientists as well as data analysts. Local company VertiVegies provided the vertical farming knowhow. The experiments varied the light spectrum and intensity, for example, as well as the nutrition of the plants in order to observe the e/ffect on their olfactory and organoleptic properties. 'The partnership with VertiVegies has given us fascinating new insights into how we can develop /flavor and fragrance raw materials in the future,' says Dr. Norbert Braun, Vice President Innovation & QC at Symrise Asia Paci/fic. 'We have also gleaned a lot about how the farming of the future will be, and we can apply some of this within the framework of our sustainability strategy\n\nin collaborations with small farmers in Asia.'",

The aim is to greatly accelerate the pace at which products and solutions are developed and commercialized in the future.

With our IGNITE program, we aim to make our innovation approach even better.' The Briton is a member of the Leadership Team of Symrise's Taste, Nutrition & Health segment and is now responsible for the innovation program that was launched in 2023 with the aim of further increasing Symrise's growth and pro/fitability.\n\nT\n\nH E R\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere are many reasons for introducing this new way of thinking and acting. 'At the moment, the world is changing very rapidly - with a corresponding impact on consumers' needs and wishes,' says Nick Russell. 'Our customers expect us to deliver unique solutions that make a di/fference. They want to be able to use these solutions immediately, irrespective of whether they address sustainability issues, new product design challenges or trends such as vegan alternatives and natural foods.' At the same time, development is moving toward open innovation in collaboration with partners such as suppliers, customers and external experts - an approach that Symrise is also seeking to strengthen. Lastly, the company aims to break down information silos, connect unrelated innovation pipelines and make better use of its own resources.\n\nTo respond to customers' wishes and, at the same time, be a /first mover in other areas, Taste, Nutrition & Health must go down new paths. 'It is important that IGNITE does not overturn those things that were already good but that we develop a complementary approach. We will continue to invest in proprietary design and new molecules,' says Nick Russell. That is why the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment launched IGNITE as a very open-ended initiative. The entire organization was involved and around 250 experts from all regions and functions were canvassed. The /findings were then evaluated and analyzed. In the next step, a core team of around 60 employees devised a viable process. 'We established four working groups to look at strategy, processes, implementation and /finance,' explains Betty Fan, the IGNITE program lead. Throughout 2023, the team collaborated closely to deliver the design of our renewed approach.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The next phase of the program will be starting in 2024. Aptly named SPRINT, moving from the former IGNITE design phase, to the implementing and learning phase. It will collect and implement the /first ideas. 'It's about being fast and agile and about shortening development times, which until now could take up to anywhere between 18 to 24 months,' says Betty Fan. Traditionally, we have used our own technologies to innovate on behalf of our major customers and we were highly successful. Now, a growing number of companies - including smaller ones are coming to us with projects to implement with much shorter launch time expectations,' explains the program lead. One example of this are new beverage concepts such as the sustainable energy drinks from German start-up Holy, which are taking the market by storm thanks to their entirely natural fruit /flavors and colorants, very low sugar content and the absence of taurine and extenders. Although these products were not created with the aid of IGNITE, this kind of collaboration is a great example of what we will be looking for more in the future. 'The team met us via an innovation hub for food and beverage start-ups with which we cooper ated closely,' says Betty Fan. 'Working with the start-up's founders, our colleagues developed and commercialized concepts in a very short time.'\n\nfunctions. 'We aim to move from an organization structure-driven approach to a much more projectdriven approach, and equip the project team with the best experts no matter where they sit. This will enable us to accelerate processes and view innovation from the perspective of the entire value chain,' says Betty Fan. This should yield service and process innovations as well as product innovations.\n\nOne especially important aspect of IGNITE is change and communication, a primary task for Kaylee Pretorius, change management practitioner for the program. One important point to emphasize is that this is not only a process change, but a cultural and mindset change. 'Our team is committed to engaging and supporting all employees in this transformation', says Kaylee Pretorius, who will be leading\n\n60\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployees made up the core team that devised a viable process.\n\nAccording to Nick Russell, speed is a crucial factor in success. 'We have learned that we sometimes stay wedded to ideas for too long and try to translate them into products, even if markets, customers and trends have long since moved on. IGNITE is intended to change that. With IGNITE, we want to encourage people not to fall in love with their /first ideas and to start getting more comfortable with 'failure' - as a very important step of the process,' says Russell. The aim is to continuously question the innovation process in a structured way to reduce the use of resources and achieve greater success rates. 'Our priority is to focus on the right ideas,' says Russell. 'It's okay to make mistakes but we need to be faster at recog nizing them.'\n\nIn the same way as the creation of IGNITE, implementation will involve employees from all regions and\n\nthe communication materials and rollout campaign. 'We are continuously learning where our employees stand and where the changes need to be communicated.'\n\nWith support from the core team, events and training sessions are in motion to develop the future platform for innovation that will also be opened externally to customers and suppliers. 'We will provide clearly de/fined channels that can be used to share and evaluate ideas\n\nbefore they are implemented,' says Kelvin Bartley, Global Project Management O/fficer for the program. Arti/ficial intelligence and automation will be used to analyze the large data volumes and make them usable.\n\nIGNITE is to be introduced across the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment in the coming months. The team is collaborating with all the business units to achieve this and is also working on synergies with the Scent & Care segment. Taste, Nutrition & Health has an ambitious goal, as Nick Russell explains: 'Our sales currently stand at around three billion. In the years ahead, innovation will be a critical enabler in contributing to growing the sales of products and services from innovation streams to a share of between 10 and 20 % - in addition to the innovations that we are already bringing to market.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

The pond is called Nalla Thanni Kulam and once played a key role in the lives of the 400 families who live in the neighborhood: Residents spent their leisure time here and used the rainwater captured by the pond to drink and use at home. In recent years, though, maintenance of the pond stopped.\n\nSymrise India, the local community and the United Way of Chennai have now taken the initiative and thoroughly cleaned Nalla Thanni Kulam with the goal of making it usable once again. The United Way of Chennai is an NGO that is active in such areas as the environment, education and health. The pond was dredged and desludged. A nature path leading around the pond was created. A play area for children was built, and benches and solar-powered lights were installed.\n\nThe project in India is just one of many that Symrise is conducting in the immediate neighborhood there. This project and several others were honored during the SMETA 4-Pillar audit that the company conducted. The abbreviation stands for Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit.

The value chain of the two segments extends across research and development, purchasing, production, and the sale of products and solutions. Natural ingredients, flavors, perfume oils and active ingredients are generally central functional components in Symrise customers' end products and are often a key factor in consumers' purchasing decisions. Along with the typical product characteristics such as fragrance and taste, value creation at Symrise lies in the development of products with additional benefits. Examples of how food ingredients and perfume oils are combined with other innovative components include flavors that enable the sugar or salt content of foods to be reduced or a moisturizing cosmetic ingredient that lowers the preservative content in care products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Majority shareholder in the Swedish company Probi AB",

In the Menthols business unit, Symrise manufactures nature-identical menthol, which is primarily used in manufacturing oral care products, chewing gum and shower gels. Fragrance Ingredients manufactures aroma chemicals (intermediate products for perfume oils) of especially high quality. These aroma chemicals are used both in the production of perfume oils at Symrise as well as marketed to companies in the consumer goods industry and other companies in the fragrance and flavor industry. This business unit additionally offers terpene-based products obtained from renewable and sustainable raw materials.\n\n## MARKET AND COMPETITION\n\n## MARKET STRUCTURE\n\nThe Symrise Group is active in many different markets around the world. These include the traditional market for flavors and fragrances (F & F market), which grew from \u20ac 31.2 billion in 2022 to \u20ac 32.0 billion in 2023, according to calculations made by the IAL Consultants market research institute (13th Edition, September 2022). In addition, with the Cosmetic Ingredients and Aroma Molecules divisions, the company is active in the market for aroma chemicals and cosmetic ingredients, which grew from \u20ac 7.8 billion in 2022 to \u20ac 8.0 billion in 2023, according to IAL reports (3rd Edition, December 2022). Together, these markets are also referred to as the AFF market, which would have a volume of \u20ac 40.0 billion. This market will grow by around 3 % to 4 % in the long term. However, in 2023, the relevant market grew by only 2.6 % because inflation-related price effects were offset by slight volume declines.\n\nWorldwide, more than 500 companies are active in the relevant market for Symrise. Following the most recent acquisitions and mergers, the four largest players (Givaudan, the AFFrelevant units of IFF, DSM-Firmenich and Symrise) together hold a market share of 67 %.\n\nThe F & F market is characterized worldwide by high entry barriers. There is increasing customer demand for higher quality and more differentiated products with ever-shorter product life cycles. The majority of products and recipes are manufactured specially for individual customers. Furthermore, local taste preferences often dictate that there are many different recipes for a single end product that vary depending on the country in which it is marketed. Moreover, customer relations are often characterized by intensive cooperation in product development.\n\nIn addition to varying local taste preferences and consumer behaviors, there are other factors that also influence the demand for end products in which Symrise products are used. The population's increasing income in emerging markets is having a positive impact on the development of demand for products containing fragrances and flavorings or cosmetic ingredients. Market growth also depends on more basic products that meet everyday needs and already have an established presence in the markets of industrialized nations. In the developed Western European, Asian and North American markets, consumer trends such as beauty, health, well-being, convenience and naturalness determine the growing demand for products containing Symrise ingredients.",

Symrise has expanded the traditional segments to include additional applications such as cosmetic ingredients in Scent & Care and pet food ingredients in Taste, Nutrition & Health. Greater value creation can be achieved on the basis of these more complex product solutions.

        "page_content": "- Market position: With long-term organic growth of 5 % to 7 % per year (CAGR) 1 , sales growth at Symrise should exceed the growth of the market, which is expanding by about 3 % to 4 % per year on average. This will enable Symrise to gradually increase the distance between it and smaller competitors and to gain market share.\n- Value orientation: Symrise wants to consistently be counted among the most profitable companies in the industry. The Group aims to achieve an average EBITDA margin of 20 % to 23 %.\n\nPerformance results are described in more detail in the corporate development section. Symrise ensures that its shareholders have an appropriate share in the company's success. The dividend policy is oriented toward the company's profitability.\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nThe corporate strategy of Symrise is based on three pillars: growth, efficiency and portfolio. It incorporates aspects of sustainability at all levels in order to enhance the Group's value over the long term and minimize risks. In this way, Symrise is making sustainability an integral part of its business model and turning it into a clear competitive advantage. The goal is a completely integrated corporate strategy.\n\n- Growth: Symrise strengthens cooperation with its strategic customers around the world and expands its business in emerging markets. The Group makes sure that it remains an innovation leader in its core competencies. This ensures its continued growth.\n- Efficiency: Symrise continually improves its processes and focuses on products with a high level of value creation. With backward integration for key raw materials, Symrise ensures a consistent, high-quality supply of these materials in sufficient quantities and at set delivery conditions. Symrise works cost-consciously in every division. This ensures the Group's profitability.\n- Portfolio: Symrise enhances its product portfolio and taps into new markets and related business activities. The Group continues to expand its expertise outside the traditional flavor and fragrances industry. This ensures its prominent market position.\n\nSymrise grows organically. When it makes sense, the Group engages in expansive acquisitions or enters into strategic partnerships for product development. At the same time, Symrise wants to ensure that the Group remains capable of taking advantage of any growth opportunities that arise without jeopardizing the company's financial stability.\n\n## VALUE-ORIENTED MANAGEMENT\n\nDifferent variables are at play within the framework of valueoriented management 2 . The company is aiming for average organic sales growth of between 5 % and 7 % per year (CAGR) 1 in the long term. The EBITDA margin, for which Symrise has defined a strategic target of 20 % to 23 % (until 2025), serves as an indicator of the company's profitability. In addition, the company introduced business free cash flow in 2018 as the primary internal control variable to assess its performance in order to strengthen the Group's cash flow orientation. Symrise aims to continuously increase the business free cash flow, which consists of EBITDA, investments (including cash effects from leasing) and changes in working capital. Increasing the value of the company is accounted for in the remuneration system for the Executive Board and selected managerial staff. In addition, Symrise attaches great importance to the Group's financial stability. Management's focus, therefore, is guided by these financial control parameters. Nonfinancial performance indicators in the areas of environment, procurement, employees and innovation are reported separately in the Corporate Report. Further information on the nonfinancial control variables can be found in the separate nonfinancial report pursuant to Section 289b of the German Commercial Code (HGB), which is published on the website of Symrise AG. at: https://symrise.com/corporatereport/2023/company/ sustainability-record/index.html .\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## GUIDELINES\n\nIn research and development (R & D), Symrise aims to connect the individual components of product development, such as market and consumer research, basic research and creation throughout the Group. In the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, new development potential is actively fostered through an incubator approach. Through the close linkup of R & D with business units, sales, marketing, purchasing and manufacturing/production, as well as quality assurance and regulatory issues, Symrise checks early on to see whether new products and technologies can be implemented, digitalized and if they",

Strategic research fields include the area of sustainable processes and products, such as green chemistry and the increased demand for perfumery ingredients based on renewable raw materials, as well as the area of taste optimization (taste balancing), the sensory optimization of preparations based on plant protein and the development of sustainable, resourcesaving manufacturing processes. Essential research results are secured by way of stringent IP management in the form of patent and trademark protection. Furthermore, all R & D activities are geared to the guidelines of global mega trends, consumer needs, customer requirements, naturalness & authenticity, sustainability, digitalization, innovation and cost efficiency.\n\n## ORGANIZATION\n\nFrom idea to marketable product, the innovation process at Symrise is organized around a uniform, stage gate process with decision filters, which has been implemented across the company. Here, more and more elements of agile project management are being used. In this context, a uniform project management system was introduced for all business areas in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment. A business plan containing exact project descriptions, including the project's costs and resource usage, is developed for every project at Taste, Nutrition & Health and Scent & Care. The research and development projects are also regularly evaluated based on criteria from the four pillars of the sustainability strategy (FISC)  and prioritized accordingly. As part of this process in 2023, the area of fair use of biodiversity was further developed according to the provisions of the Nagoya Protocol and anchored in our project management processes. One future field is the utilization of legacy varieties of known agricultural raw materials in order to preserve and expand biodiversity. Symrise is also an active member of the OP2B consortium 1 of various industrial companies. The two segments at Symrise each manage their own R & D activities due to the varying requirements of their respective markets and customers. At the same time, technologies, processes and findings are made available to all segments, in order to achieve synergies and improve resource efficiency. Multiple R & D centers around the world ensure that the regional ac tivities of the segments are optimally supported. The research activities of the Scent & Care segment, especially the centers for development and application technologies, are located in Holzminden (Germany), Teterboro (USA), Singapore, Shanghai (China), Tokyo (Japan), Chennai and Mumbai (India), Paris (France), Antananarivo (Madagascar), S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) and Cuautitl\u00e1n (Mexico). In addition, there is a hair research center at the S\u00e3o Paulo site. Furthermore, the Cosmetic\n\nIngredients division carries out basic skin biology research on innovative skin models, thereby driving forward the preclinical development of new cosmetic active ingredients. In the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, R & D activities are organized according to the Food & Beverage and Pet Food divisions as well as the Business Incubation Group (BIG). The majority of this segment's R & D activities are located in Holzminden (Germany), Teterboro (USA), Singapore, Shanghai (China), Tokyo (Japan), Paris (France), Rennes (France), Elven (France), S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil), and Lund (Sweden).\n\n## EXTERNAL COOPERATIONS\n\nExternal cooperations and networks (Open Innovation) bring a considerable amount of additional approaches and ideas into the development process. Along with ideas from Open Innovation, Symrise also maintains a global project network with industrial, institutional and academic partners that covers every step of the innovative process - from basic research to marketing concepts.\n\nSymrise participates in numerous scientific research projects that are supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK), via the Research Group of the Food Industry (FEI)/Working Group for Industrial Research (AiF), the European Union (EU, Horizon 2020), TKI (Top Consortium for Knowledge and Innovation, Netherlands), the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), the French Cr\u00e9dit d'imp\u00f4t recherche (CIR) and other public and private funding institutions. Increasingly, tax rebate options are being used for research activities in France and Germany. Topics related to the following areas play a key role: sustainability, the establishment of cultures and the breeding of plants with special flavor properties, the development and sensory improvement of plant proteins, raw material sourcing and biotechnological processing and improvement, the added health value of food ingredients, technologies and sustainable ingredients for perfume oils and oral hygiene. Symrise has joined the Sustainable Food Initiative (SFI), founded by Wageningen University & Research, in which various universities and industrial companies conduct joint research in the field of future and sustainable food production.",

To this end, special statistical processes were optimized and applied, making a significant contribution to reducing project development cycles. Symrise presented an example of this way of working at the 21st FEI Cooperation Forum entitled 'Characterization, processing and use of plant proteins - Concepts for foods of the future' held in Bonn on April 18, 2023. A further use of modern digital tools in identifying flavors to reduce sugar in food applications was presented by Symrise in a paper entitled 'Identification of taste actives from cultural food heritage via combined text-mining and senso- analytical approach' that was delivered at the 13th Wartburg Symposium held in Eisenach on October 3, 2023. At the same conference, the company also presented current findings from citrus research in a paper entitled 'Molecular-sensory decoding of Citrus latifolia Aroma' and described biotechnological approaches to manufacturing taste-balancing raw materials in a paper entitled 'Biotransformation of flavonoids by fungal mycelium from edible Lentinus spp. to produce taste active flavonoids with isovanilloid motif.' The further development of our citrus expertise is of great importance in light of the widespread use of these products in beverages, sweets and other foods. That is why the molecular-sensory decoding process developed by Symrise is crucial for the exact characterization of flavor molecules and their combinations. This information is used by our developers and application technologists to create authentic product solutions for our customers.\n\nThe use of renewable raw materials is becoming increasingly important in continuing to evolve selected technologies for the formulation of fragrances and product solutions. In this regard, Taste, Nutrition & Health presented its current work on spray drying coacervates on plant protein at the 21st Gums and Stabilisers for the Food Industry Conference that took place in Greece in July 2023.\n\nThe research and technology strategy is being implemented on the basis of various research platforms. A large number of key topics are being worked on with a special focus on sustainability aspects. In the Food & Beverage division, examples include the development and adaptation of new, gentle and environmentally friendly separation technologies (Selective Enrichment Technologies Flavors SETFlavors \u00ae ) and the expansion and elaboration of raw material sources for sustainable and natural product solutions for the Symrise Code of Nature \u00ae platform, which are primarily used for healthy food concepts; the continuous development of natural and sustainable raw materials for flavor solutions that lead to the sensory-preferred reformulation of low-sugar, low-salt and low-fat food concepts; and the development of energy-efficient and low-solvent methods for concentration, beginning with plant-based raw materials. In 2023, a special focus was placed on the challenge of improving the taste of plant proteins as meat substitutes or for use in dairy products. Another focus is on reducing sugar in beverages and dairy products as well as in savory applications. In this context, the selection of varieties and new cultivation methods for a sustainable supply chain were developed and established for specific plant-based raw materials for the Taste Balancing product platform. Another focus of research in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment is the development and application of modern digital tools for the rapid and targeted development of flavor solutions for selected food applications. The ProtiScan\u2122 process - developed by Symrise for recording the flavor release from innovative food preparations made with vegetable protein - is noteworthy in this context and was developed further in 2023. This process enables a significant reduction in project development times and forms a solid foundation for IT-based development concepts.",

        "page_content": "In addition, work is being carried out on the continuous improvement of product safety and the targeted optimization of the use of flavor solutions for application in reduced sugar and plant protein-based foods. In recent years, particular attention has been given to the development of digital prediction tools to support flavor development and creation. A significant portion of this work was continued and completed in 2023 and grouped under the umbrella term 'PropheSY'.\n\nIn the Pet Food division, the Elven site was equipped with state- of-the-art extrusion equipment to develop more powerful and safer products. In addition, the VIDEKA \u00ae laboratory in Elven was designed for EAME customer support with shelflife studies, research and development and analytical requirements. This laboratory is used to carry out shelf-life studies for pet food and pet care compounds using the latest analytical instruments.\n\nIn the Aqua business, an important focus of product development was the utilization of shrimp shells as raw materials or functional ingredients. Projects for the development and application of flavor enhancers for carnivorous fish species were continued.\n\nProbi and the Naturals business unit have launched a joint project to develop new symbiotic products containing live microorganisms and polyphenols extracted from fruits.\n\nWith regard to its R & D strategy, the Scent & Care segment focuses on raw materials and technologies in accordance with the Fragrances division's strategic research fields of captives and ingredients, delivery systems, health and emotion, and malodor. The strategic field of captives and ingredients is researching individual perfume raw materials for the Fragrance and Oral Care business units. In the case of new synthetic substances (captives) based on petrochemicals and renewable raw materials, the focus is on floral, woody and musky fragrances. In respect of the captives based on natural raw materials such as roots, flowers and fruits, work is concentrated on the strategic fields of biodiversity essential oils, natural technologies (Supernature) and artisan. In 2023, Cocoa Shell Madagascar, Neroli Oil Egypt, Supernature Sympep, Apple Symtrap, Strawberry Symtrap, Banana Symtrap and Blackcurrant Symtrap were added to the portfolio.\n\n## Core functions of research and development at Symrise\n\n<!-- image -->",

Symrise has also added Natural Neofresh \u00ae to its Neofresh platform to meet customers' desire for sustainable products made from renewable raw materials.\n\nHaving continued the development of its combined expertise in fragrances and pet food especially for dogs and cats in recent years, Symrise is now deploying these developments increasingly in direct customer projects.\n\nThe marketing of Symcap BG \u00ae biodegradable capsules has generated a great deal of interest from some customers for use in fabric softeners. Research for capsules for fragrance oils is now heading to vegan capsules with improved efficacy for other areas of application as well. There is also growing customer demand for vegan capsules. Symcap BG contains gelatin so an alternative raw material based on pea protein has been found and developed into the new Symcap BP capsule that is market-ready. There is also increasing demand for kosher and halal products.\n\nThe Oral Care business unit has developed Fuji, a new cooling agent that is expected to be market-ready in 2024.\n\nResearch for the Aroma Molecules division is focused on improving existing manufacturing processes for market products such as menthol and on increasing process efficiency.\n\nIn the Cosmetic Ingredients division, there is an interdisciplinary group of cell biologists, molecular biologists and microbiologists researching the human microbiome. The new research area is investigating the benefits and risks of interactions between humans and microorganisms, and is providing scientific and cross-divisional support in the development of new products for skin, scalp and oral care, or in the area of nutrition. The first products and product concepts have already been introduced to the market. In addition, in-depth analyses on healthy volunteers showed that neither multifunctional active ingredients nor modern UV filters have an effect on the microbiome. In 2023, microbiome expertise was expanded to the armpit. The proprietary ex vivo model developed to identify active ingredients for deodorants was presented at a number of conferences, including the International Federation of Cosmetic Chemists and Scientists (IFSCC) Congress. It is expected that the first active substance based on the research model and the specific method will be market-ready in 2024.\n\n## PATENTS AND AWARDS\n\nThe number of patents filed (34 new applications in 2023) is used to measure innovation results and quality and to evaluate global coverage and competitive impact.\n\nIn 2023, as in previous years, Symrise research was recognized with awards for its high level of innovation. Launched in 2023, the yarrow-based Supervisome \u00ae EPH received two awards: a European BSB Innovation Award in the 'Cosmetics/Raw Materials/Actives' category and the Pure Beauty Award UK. The product is manufactured in a special process which extracts the juice from fresh, organically grown yarrow and spray dries it to yield a stable raw material that, when used in cosmetic products, is proven to give the skin a more even appearance. Also launched in 2023, SymProt'in\u2122 Oat is manufactured by enzymatic extraction from organically grown oats and is rich in hydrolyzed proteins. Thanks to its special composition, the product helps to protect the structure of hair and received the BSB Award in the 'Natural Products/Raw Materials/Actives' category. SymHair \u00ae Thermo, which was already launched in 2022 and has garnered numerous awards, won the Pure Beauty Global Award in the 'Best Ingredient' category. It is a sustainable product that combines carbohydrates with different chain lengths, providing outstanding protection for the hair against thermal damage. Launched back in 2020, Crinipan PMC green impressed another jury in 2023 to win the prestigious PCHi Fountain Award in the 'Hair Care/Scalp Care Ingredient' category. The product delivers proven efficacy against dandruff and satisfies consumer demands for environmentally compatible products.",

For us as a global company, diversity has the added value of creative and innovative cooperation in diverse teams. Equal opportunities are more important than ever, and promoting diversity is central to the company's success. Furthermore, promoting diversity is essential to ensuring employee recruitment now and in the future.\n\nWe put our commitment to diversity into practice with specific measures on both local and global level.\n\n## Group strategic development of senior executives and employees\n\nOur talent scouting and succession planning processes reconcile employees' individual career ambitions with our divisions' organizational development. In this connection, we define key positions within the company that we consider to be essential and for which we must identify and develop potential successors in the context of career development. Training activities are consolidated worldwide in programs based on four strategic pillars:\n\n- Our flavorist and perfumer school\n- Technical and specialist training for our employees\n- Training for our sales representatives\n- Executive development\n\nAs part of the strategic transformation of our HR management activities, we are planning a new talent management program for which we will be starting a pilot project in 2024. In our Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, we are developing leadership programs to build management skills such as transparency, trust, the eye-to-eye principle, courage and team spirit. We expect these skills to be important for preparing our future ex ecutives. At the same time, our training programs include methods such as coaching and mentoring. Mentors are in the unique position to pass on valuable experience to their mentees, who are usually younger.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, Symrise also continued to expand the topic area of modern and digital learning. Employees were provided with a global 'Learning Management System' (LMS) and a digital learning platform ('Skillsoft'). More than 5,000 learning hours have now been completed worldwide on the Skillsoft platform.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In our talent development, we ensure that there are many women among the participants. In this way, we intentionally promote the preparation of young women for taking on greater management responsibility in our company. The pipeline of female senior executives has almost met the target we set for 2025.\n\n## Equitable remuneration for women and men\n\nIn 2021, Symrise carried out a gender-specific analysis of the wages for the employees at its largest site in Germany. In the in-depth analysis on the subject of equal pay, comparable job groups were formed and pay differences were analyzed against the backdrop of whether there is possible discrimination in this area. For this purpose, aspects such as length of service, age, education and vocational training were considered, along with the requirements level and professional position.\n\n## Training and education\n\nEducating young people is of particular importance at Symrise. This is evidenced by multiple awards in company comparisons over the past four years. Symrise recruits qualified young individuals who it specifically trains with the company's needs in mind, thus fulfilling its social obligation to the next generation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 141 apprentices and trainees were employed at the sites in Germany, representing an increase of 12 % compared to 2022 (126).\n\nDepending on the occupation, training lasts two to three years. All trainees are taken on at least temporarily after completing their training if they meet the minimum requirements regarding the success of their training. With this investment in training, Symrise is meeting the demand for future specialists in chemical production and the laboratories as well as in commercial, marketing, IT and sales positions. Symrise also runs apprenticeship programs at other sites around the world with the goal of training and developing the young talents the company needs.\n\nSymrise constantly trains experts over a period of around three years at its own flavorist and perfumer school, where they master raw materials and their applications in Symrise products and then successfully use them in product development. In addition, our employees have a wide variety of opportunities for completing a bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree alongside their work through cooperation agreements with universities, academies and institutes.\n\n## Management & Corporate Culture\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration and wage agreements\n\nEqual pay for both men and women is a matter of course for us. Remuneration levels are based only on an employee's qualification and the value they contribute to the company. Most of the workforce is paid on the basis of collective wage agreements that are negotiated with the labor unions. Each year, we perform analyses at all our main sites to avoid any genderspecific differences in remuneration. The last official analysis in Germany was conducted in 2021. We regularly analyze equality indicators in France as well. Most of our companies there are subject to French legislation that requires gender equality reporting. An annual index is published for the companies affected. In 2023, our companies in Rennes, Antrain, Elven and Clichy scored an average of 87 out of 100 points.\n\nThe wage differences reflected in the absolute wage level may arise due to the job type. For example, shift workers are paid shift allowances that are not gender-specific.\n\nThe regularly scheduled bargaining on our collective wage agreements in Germany took place in 2022. As part of the successful negotiations, a collective wage agreement adapted to the economic challenges faced by companies and employees was concluded with a term of 18 months. This envisaged wage increases in January, July and December 2023. Moreover, Symrise paid all full-time employees an inflation bonus of \u20ac 1,500 in December 2023.\n\nSymrise will also continue to give its employees covered by the collective wage agreement in Germany a share of the company's profits. The possible profit-sharing bonus linked to the EBITDA margin was also increased for 2023 and 2024.\n\nFor employees not covered by the collective wage agreement, separate global performance bonus plans apply to our managers with global or regional responsibilities. These support the achievement of the set corporate goals through results- and performance-based variable remuneration. Our creative employees are also included in this management and incentive system.",

        "page_content": "## COMPANY DEVELOPMENT AT A GLANCE\n\nIMPORTANT EVENTS\n\nDespite a volatile market environment with challenging political and economic conditions, Symrise was able to pursue its strategy systematically in the 2023 fiscal year. So far, the ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have had only little impact on business development at Symrise. However, the continuing high level of inflation in the 2023 fiscal year led to in part significant cost increases at Symrise, accompanied by the consistent implementation of price rises.\n\nIn March, Symrise launched a number of bioactives under the diana food\u2122 brand for use in beauty from within products. The company is expanding its offer with the development of these differentiating and innovative nutricosmetic ingredients. The range includes a full line of solutions for skin conditioning and anti-aging, skin brightening, as well as hair and nail care. It is composed of naturally sourced bioactives, such as collagen type I, vitamins C and A, and polyphenols from various fruits. This product range expands Symrise's expertise to include solutions for skin care from within, complementing the company's existing cosmetic ingredients offering.\n\nIn May 2023, Symrise inaugurated the Little Red House as a creative center for fine fragrances in the heart of Shanghai, further strengthening the company's position on the key Chinese fragrance market. The Little Red House is located in The Roof, an iconic building in Shanghai's Xuhui District. With the new hub, Symrise offers its customers a unique and inspiring space for developing and co-creating ideas and devising modern solutions in real time. The hub's name - 'Xiaohongwu' in Chinese - relates to the red Symrise logo, the red walls of the chosen location, the familiar concept of a home and The Little Red Book, a Chinese social media platform. It serves as a meeting place for fragrance creation and also offers space for market research, creative arts and olfactory culture, featuring exclusive events and cultural programs.\n\nIn June, Symrise Cosmetic Ingredients opened a new Center of Expertise for Beauty & Home Care at the Symrise site in Clichy near Paris. It houses a microbiological laboratory dedicated to customer support for the EAME (Europe, Africa, Middle East) region as well as the Cosmetic Ingredients division's first  application laboratory for home care products. This move strengthens Symrise's position as a leading company in the development of cosmetic ingredients and innovative solutions for customers around the world.\n\nAt the end of August, Symrise Pet Food inaugurated a new production facility in Chapec\u00f3, Brazil. The state-of-the-art production plant manufactures palatability solutions for dog and cat food and covers an area of more than 10,000 square meters, making it the largest of its kind in Latin America and the largest producer of pet food palatability solutions worldwide. It features advanced technologies with full automation delivering high operational efficiency. With this facility, the company has greatly expanded its production capacities in Brazil in preparation for the growing demand for pet food in Brazil and other Latin American markets. In addition, the site will deliver a number of products to global markets.\n\nAt the start of October, the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment launched its new SET Flavors\u2122 brand. SET stands for selective enrichment technologies, which can be used alone or in combination. In this way, valuable natural aroma components can be obtained from the side streams and byproducts of food processing. The efficient processes and advanced technologies enable Symrise to select and enrich aroma substances from byproducts. These can be used as raw materials to develop innovative and authentic flavor profiles. Symrise SET Flavors\u2122 address consumer wishes concerning future sustainability and environmental requirements.\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Symrise inaugurated Jardin Arabia, the new creative center for fine fragrances in the heart of Dubai. In this way, Symrise is strengthening its strategic foothold in the thriving Middle Eastern fragrance market. The name 'Jardin Arabia' pays homage to the region and the elegant building structure, at the same time, embodying its central location at the crossroads between Europe and Asia. The elegant and inspiring collaborative hub is located in Internet City, Dubai's innovation district near the iconic Palm neighborhood. It showcases Symrise's fine fragrance market expertise and strengthens the company's creative approach.\n\n## GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE COURSE OF BUSINESS AND ON THE GROUP'S NET ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe Symrise Group generated sales of \u20ac 4,730 million in the 2023 fiscal year. Sales increased by 2.4 % in the reporting currency compared to the previous year. Excluding portfolio effects, organic sales growth amounted to 7.9 %.

        "page_content": "ciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA 1 ) were \u20ac 18 million lower than the previous year's figure of \u20ac 922 million 2 . This corresponds to a margin 3 of 19.1 % (2022 2 :  20.0 %).\n\nNet income attributable to the shareholders of Symrise AG amounted to \u20ac 340 million, which was \u20ac 66 million lower than the previous year's figure 2 . Earnings per share were \u20ac 2.44 and thus \u20ac 0.47 below the previous year's figure 2 of \u20ac 2.91.\n\nIn light of the overall good business performance, the Symrise AG Executive Board will, in consultation with the Supervisory Board, propose raising the dividend from \u20ac 1.05 in the previous year to \u20ac 1.10 per share for the 2023 fiscal year at the Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2024.\n\n## A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND FORECAST COURSE OF BUSINESS\n\nAt the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year, Symrise had set itself the goal of achieving organic sales growth of 5 % to 7 % and thus noticeably above market growth (approx. 3 % to 4 %). This growth target was confirmed at the end of the first half. However, in 2023, Symrise's relevant market grew by only around\n\n2 Excluding impairment of the associated company Swedencare AB, Malm\u00f6, Sweden\n\n2.6 % because inflation-related price effects were offset by slight volume declines.\n\nFor 2023, Symrise had expected an EBITDA margin of around 20 % despite rising raw material prices. Debt, as measured by the key indicator of net debt (including provisions for pensions and similar obligations as well as lease liabilities) to EBITDA, should have been within the range of 2.5 and 2.7. For the business free cash flow in relation to sales, Symrise had set itself a target of 12 % at the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year. In its reporting for the first half of 2023, Symrise lowered its expectation for business free cash flow for the 2023 fiscal year to between 9 % and 11 %.\n\nWith organic sales growth of 7.9 % (excluding portfolio and currency translation effects), Symrise surpassed its sales goals in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin 3 of 19.1 % was below the value expected for 2023. At 3.0 times EBITDA 3 , net debt was higher than the level expected for 2023, due especially to the weaker earnings performance and the still high working capital to ensure supply availability. On the reporting date, the adjusted business free cash flow 3 was 11.7 % and thus higher than the target of 9 % to 11 % forecast at the end of the first half.\n\n## Achievement of targets in 2023\n\n| Sales growth  (at local currency)                                                         | 5 - 7 % Target at the beginning of the /fi scal year   | 7.9 %  1 Figure achieved   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| EBITDA margin                                                                             | Around 20 %                                            | 19.1 %  2                  |\n| and similar obligations as well as lease  liabilities) / EBITDA ( excluding acquisitions) | Between  2.5 and 2.7                                   | 3.0  2                     |\n| Business free cash flow                                                                   | Around 12 %                                            | 11.7 %  2                  |\n\n1 Organic growth 2 Adjusted for one-time effects; please refer to the 'Alternative performance indicators' section on page 143 for details about the adjustments.",

Taking account of portfolio and currency translation effects, the segment's sales in the reporting currency amounted to \u20ac 2,978 million. Compared to the previous year, this corresponds to an increase of 2.2 %. The positive portfolio effect from the acquisition of Wing Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China, was around \u20ac 20 million.\n\nIn the Food & Beverage division, the business units responsible for sweet and savory products and for beverage flavoring developed very positively, all achieving high single-digit and double-digit organic growth, respectively. The EAME (Europe, Africa, Middle East) and Latin America regions in particular saw strong gains. The main growth drivers here were the markets of Western and Eastern Europe, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as well as Mexico and Brazil. The Naturals business unit increased sales in the EAME and Asia/Pacific regions especially.\n\nThe Pet Food division also posted double-digit organic growth. Sales development was particularly dynamic in the Western and Eastern European markets, especially Poland and France, as well as in the USA, Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia, driven especially by global and regional customers. With the ongoing expansion of production capacities and the joint venture with Fujian Sunner Development Co. Ltd. in China (Sunner), Symrise has laid the foundation for the continued accelerated growth of the pet food business.\n\n## Taste, Nutrition & Health segment EBITDA\n\nin \u20ac million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales by the Aqua Feed division also developed positively to deliver double-digit organic growth. Key growth impulses came from the EAME and Asia/Pacific regions, especially from the markets in Germany, China, Portugal and South Korea.\n\nThe probiotics business, which includes the majority interest in the listed company Probi AB, Lund, Sweden, was unable to maintain the level of the previous year and recorded a slight decline in sales. This was due to general market weakness, especially in North America. Sales development in EAME also saw a negative impact from the reduction in safety stocks by a number of major customers.\n\nEBITDA Taste, Nutrition & Health: Adjusted EBITDA 1 of the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment in the reporting year amounted to \u20ac 627 million, which was lower than in the previous year 2 (2022: \u20ac 631 million). This was mainly attributable to the lack of the previous year's positive one-time effects from the sale of the Velcorin \u00ae business and the partial sale of the celery business and to higher operating costs. Due to the aforementioned effects, the adjusted EBITDA margin 1 of 21.0 % failed to match the previous year's 2 level (2022: 21.6 %).\n\n2 Excluding impairment of the associated company Swedencare AB, Malm\u00f6, Sweden",

Compared to the previous year, this represents an increase of 2.7 %. Excluding portfolio and currency translation effects, organic sales growth amounted to 5.6 %. The portfolio effects from the acquisitions of Neroli Invest DL (Groupe N\u00e9roli) and Essence Ciel with its subsidiary SFA Romani (Romani) - both are based in Saint-C\u00e9zaire-surSiagne, France - contributed a total of around \u20ac 15 million.\n\nThe Fragrance division increased sales organically by a high single-digit percentage. The Fine Fragrances business in particular continued its dynamic development and followed its strong performance of the previous year with renewed doubledigit percentage organic growth. The recent acquisitions also contributed to the business unit's growth. The growth rates in the EAME, North America and Latin America regions were particularly pronounced. The Consumer Fragrances business unit posted good single-digit percentage growth. Here, too, the biggest gains were posted by the EAME and Latin America regions, followed by Asia/Pacific, especially for laundry and cleaning products. The Oral Care business unit saw low singledigit percentage organic growth, with the biggest increases in the Asia/Pacific region.\n\n## Scent & Care segment EBITDA\n\nin \u20ac million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales development in the Aroma Molecules division was negatively impacted in particular by a difficult market environment and the production stoppage at Colonel Island, USA, following a fire in November 2022. Demand for fragrances and menthol was held back by customers reducing their inventories. The sum of sales across all business units and regions was significantly lower than in the previous year.\n\nSales by the Cosmetic Ingredients division continued to develop very positively, again posting double-digit percentage organic growth, especially in the EAME and Latin America regions. Sales also increased in North America and Asia/Pacific but by a smaller single-digit percentage. The strongest growth was posted by the sun protection business and the Micro Protection business unit.\n\nEBITDA Scent & Care: In 2023, Scent & Care generated adjusted EBITDA 1 of \u20ac 277 million, which was 4.9 % lower than in the previous year (2022: \u20ac 291 million), due especially to increased raw material prices and higher operating costs.

The cost of goods sold increased slightly faster than sales, which was mainly attributable to higher raw material and manufacturing costs. The gross margin in the reporting year was 36.8 %, virtually level with the previous year's figure of 36.9 %. The share of selling and marketing expenses in Group sales declined from 14.7 % in 2022 to 14.2 % in the reporting year. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower logistics costs. Compared to the previous year, the R & D rate relative to sales increased\n\nfrom 5.5 % to 5.6 %, due especially to higher expenses for basic research in both segments. Administration expenses as a share of Group sales grew from 5.6 % a year earlier to 5.8 % in the reporting year, in particular as a result of increased IT system costs.\n\nThe decrease in other operating income is attributable primarily to the lack of the previous year's positive one-time effects in connection with the sale of the Velcorin \u00ae business as well as the partial sale of the celery business in North America, each amounting to around \u20ac 18 million in 2022.\n\nMoreover, earnings were depressed by negative currency translation effects and smaller contributions from companies accounted for using the equity method.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 amounted to \u20ac 903 million, \u20ac 18 million lower than the previous year's value 2 (2022: \u20ac 922 million). The adjusted EBITDA margin 1 of 19.1 % was also below the previous year's value 2 of 20.0 %.",

        "page_content": "## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nThe management report and financial statements of the Symrise Group are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards. In addition to the disclosures and performance indicators required by these standards, Symrise also publishes alternative performance indicators that are not subject to these regulations and for which there is no generally accepted reporting standard. Symrise calculates these alternative performance indicators with the aim of facilitating the comparability of its performance over time and vis-\u00e0-vis other companies in the industry. The alternative performance indicators apply to all periods and are used both internally to manage the business and measure performance and externally by analysts and investors to assess the company's performance. Symrise calculates the following alternative performance indicators:\n\n- Nominal and organic changes in sales and changes due to portfolio and currency translation effects\n- EBITDA\n- EBITDA margin\n- Adjusted EBITDA\n- Adjusted EBITDA margin\n- EBIT\n- EBIT margin\n- Adjusted EBIT\n- Adjusted EBIT margin\n- Business free cash flow\n- Adjusted business free cash flow\n- Adjusted business free cash flow margin\n\nThe (nominal) change in sales is a relative performance indicator that describes the percentage change in sales compared to the previous year. The organic change in sales describes the percentage change in sales compared to the previous year, excluding the influence of portfolio and currency translation effects. The change due to portfolio effects shows the share of the change in sales that is attributable to the acquisition or sale of business activities or subsidiaries in the period under review. The change in sales due to currency translation effects provides information about the change in sales resulting from changes in the exchange rates used to translate foreign currencies into the reporting currency.\n\nEBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. This performance indicator describes a company's operating earning power, irrespective of its capital structure and investment level. EBITDA is calculated on the basis of EBIT plus the depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets recognized through profit or loss during the reporting period.\n\nEBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes and describes a company's performance capability, excluding the effects of different international taxation systems and financing activities.\n\nIn order to strengthen the company's cash flow orientation, Symrise has introduced business free cash flow as the primary internal control variable. The business free cash flow consists of EBITDA, investments (including cash effects from leasing) and changes in working capital.\n\nThe EBITDA margin and EBIT margin are relative indicators used by Symrise for the internal and external comparison of operating earning power. The indicators are calculated on the basis of EBITDA or EBIT in relation to sales. Symrise uses these indicators in particular for the internal and external comparison of the cost structure and profitability of its businesses.\n\nThe business free cash flow margin is a relative performance indicator which describes business free cash flow in relation to sales.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, as a result of special circumstances, the aforementioned indicators were adjusted for the following one-time effects:\n\n- Costs in connection with the production stoppage at the Colonel Island site (\u20ac 46.5 million)\n- Reorganization costs resulting from the new strategic focus of the Scent & Care segment (\u20ac 4.3 million)\n- Costs associated with antitrust investigation (\u20ac 5.8 million)\n- Income from an insurance reimbursement for a cybersecurity incident in 2020 (\u20ac 4.8 million)",

        "page_content": "## FUTURE COMPANY DEVELOPMENT\n\nFor 2024, Symrise is reaffirming its long-term growth and profitability goals. The Group remains confident that it will continue to grow at a faster pace than the relevant market. According  to  IAL Consultants, the forecast long-term growth of the relevant market is around 3 % to 4 % worldwide. For the Group, expected long-term growth of 5 % to 7 % (CAGR) remains unchanged and is also anticipated to be achieved in 2024. The company aims to generate sales of \u20ac 5.5 to 6.0 billion by the end of 2025. In addition, Symrise recently extended its long-term growth expectation to 2028 and aims to generate sales of \u20ac 7.5 to 8.0 billion by that time.\n\nIn order to increase earnings and profitability further, the company will be implementing targeted measures that include an efficiency program with disciplined cost management and initiatives to reduce process and workflow complexity and optimize the global production network and the portfolio with a focus on high-margin businesses. Moreover, the development of innovative sustainable products and technologies continues to be a fundamental aspect of the Symrise strategy.\n\nAssuming that prices for raw materials remain largely stable, the Group expects an EBITDA margin for 2024 of around 20 %, which is at the lower end of the target corridor. In the medium term, the Group is seeking to maintain an EBITDA margin between 20 % and 23 %. The ratio of net debt (including provisions for pensions and similar obligations as well as lease liabilities)  to  EBITDA should be between 2.6 and 2.8 at the end of 2024. For the business free cash flow, the Group is aiming for a rate relative to sales of 12 % in 2024. The medium-term target is a rate of 14 %.\n\n## GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Executive Board at Symrise AG sees the company as being optimally positioned to continue developing in every division and growth region. A proven strategy will be used to achieve the goals set. The three pillars of the strategy remain unchanged. They stand for the continued improvement of the competitive position and the sustainable expansion of the business:\n\n- Growth: Close cooperation with selected customers, particularly as a way to further expand the share of sales in emerging markets\n- Efficiency: The continuous improvement of processes and the expansion of backward integration with renewable raw materials\n- Portfolio: Tapping into new markets and market segments beyond the traditional business with flavors and fragrances\n\nSymrise aims to grow primarily organically. Where it is expedient and creates added value, the Group will make acquisitions or forge strategic alliances to ensure access to new technologies, new markets and customers or ensure that it can obtain sustainable, renewable raw materials.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Corporate Governance Statement has been made available on the Symrise AG website at: https://www.symrise.com/ corporate-governance-statement\n\nThe company will continue its earnings-oriented dividend policy and give its shareholders an appropriate share in the company's success.",

The future course of business and the results actually achieved by Symrise AG and its a/ffi  liates are subject to a large number of risks and uncertainties and may therefore di/ff er substantially from the forward-looking statements. Many of these factors are outside of Symrise AG's sphere of in/fl  uence and cannot be assessed in detail ahead of events. They include, for example, unfavorable development of the global economy, a change in consumer behavior, and changes to laws, regulations and o/ffi  cial guidelines. Should one of these uncertainty factors, named or otherwise, occur or should the assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based prove to be incorrect, the actual results may di/ff  er signi/fi  cantly from the results anticipated. Symrise undertakes no obli gation to update forward-looking statements contin uously and to adjust them to future events or devel opments.\n\n## Publication Date of the Report\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n## Symrise online\n\nwww.symrise.com\n\nwww.symrise.com/corporatereport/2023/company/ sustainability-record/index.html www.symrise.com/investors\n\nwww.symrise.com/corporatereport/2023/index.html\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
