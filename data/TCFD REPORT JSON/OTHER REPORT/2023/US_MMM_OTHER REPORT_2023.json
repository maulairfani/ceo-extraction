To leverage technology  to enable shareholder participation from any location, the 2023 Annual Meeting will be held exclusively online.\n\n2022 was an important year for 3M. The company focused on delivering for customers and shareholders in a slowing macroeconomic environment, while taking actions to position 3M for the future. As we managed through external challenges - from supply chain disruptions, to COVID-related lockdowns, to softening in key end markets - we applied 3M science to solve customer needs, and introduce new innovations across our market-leading businesses. We drove strong pricing, proactively managed costs, strengthened our balance sheet and reduced total debt by $1.4 billion - while returning $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nAt the same time, we continued to build 3M for long-term success. We managed our portfolio - including the divestiture of our Food Safety business, planned spin-off of our Health Care business, and commitment to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) manufacturing by the end of 2025 - while advancing strategies to resolve legal matters. We invested in growth and productivity, and followed through on sustainability commitments. We supported employees with new flexible work arrangements and factory investments, and advanced diversity, equity, and inclusion with new initiatives from each of our businesses.\n\nWe are building a stronger company. Looking forward, our focus remains on executing our strategic priorities and delivering the best performance for our customers, shareholders, and all stakeholders in 2023.\n\nWe sincerely hope you will join us at our  virtual Annual Meeting.  You will have a chance at the meeting to vote on the matters set forth in the accompanying Notice of  Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement. There will also be time for  your questions and comments. Shareholders who wish to submit questions in advance of  the meeting may do so by using their 16-digit control number  to access www.proxyvote.com.\n\nFor information on how to attend the meeting, please read 'Participating in the virtual Annual Meeting' on page 110 of the accompanying Proxy Statement.\n\nYour vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please vote as soon as possible. You may vote your proxy on the Internet, by telephone, or if this Proxy Statement was mailed to you, by completing and mailing the enclosed traditional proxy card. Please review the instructions on the proxy card or the electronic proxy material delivery notice regarding each of these voting options.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support of 3M.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichael F.

Four out of the nine independent director nominees standing for this year's election have joined our board within the past five years, and all four have diverse traits, such as gender, racial, or ethnic diversity. In recruiting directors, we focus on how the experience and skill set of each individual complements those of their fellow directors to create a balanced board with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds, deep expertise, and strong leadership experience.",

We engage regularly with our global investors to share updates on our strategic, financial, and operating performance and to understand valuable shareholder perspectives on governance and sustainability issues about which they care most. We aim to seek a collaborative and mutually beneficial approach to issues of importance to investors that affect our business. Shareholder feedback is shared with the appropriate Board committees or the full Board to ensure our governance policies reflect priorities that are important to our shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Participants\n\nDuring 2022, members of senior management met with a crosssection of shareholders owning approximately:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n22% of our outstanding shares\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n33% of our institutional shareholders\n\nTwo of our directors - our Lead Independent Director and Chairman of  the Board - participated in our 2022 engagement.\n\n## Topics Discussed\n\n## Board / Corporate Governance\n\n- \u00b7 Process related to health care business spin-off\n- \u00b7 Board composition, including refreshment, skills matrix, and diversity\n- \u00b7 Director orientation, education, and evaluation\n- \u00b7 Risk oversight (sustainability and litigation/regulatory)\n- \u00b7 Executive compensation\n- \u00b7 Board interactions with management and broader organization\n\n## Operations / Supply Chain\n\n- \u00b7 Current challenges, strategy, and business model evolution\n\n## Environmental / Social / Sustainability\n\n- \u00b7 Carbon/water stewardship goals, plastics reduction, investments, and pathway  to achieve goals\n\n## Litigation\n\n- \u00b7 PFAS and other litigation management\n- \u00b7 Impact on culture\n\n## 3M's sustainability highlights\n\nAt 3M, we are people committed to helping other people. We seek to observe, understand, and solve. Every day we help tackle problems, big and small, in pursuit of our promise to improve lives. Our goals and sustainability metrics reflect a heightened commitment to thinking holistically about how our operations and products can unlock the power of people, ideas, and science to reimagine what's possible, inspiring progress to transform aspirations into action and delivering on our promises across science, society, and sustainability.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to follow through on our sustainability goals, including our $1 billion commitment to achieve carbon neutrality, reduce water use, improve water quality, and reduce our use of plastics. Since announcing our carbon neutrality goal, we've seen an additional 37.8 percent reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions building from a 78.8 percent reduction over the last two decades while more than doubling our revenue. We are also ahead of schedule installing state-of-the-art filtration technologies around the world, and we now have capabilities running at all three of our largest water-using sites in the United States, and in Zwijndrecht. Since 2021, we achieved a 54.2 million pound reduction in the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Feedback\n\nInvestors provided valuable comments and perspectives on the Company's governance practices, including the process related to the Company's planned spin-off of its health care business; the Board's overall diversity; director refreshment (including director skills matrix); risk oversight; litigation management; and the Company's actions in managing supply chain challenges and environmental stewardship, social justice, and sustainability matters, including investments, progress towards goals, and the addition of an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) modifier to the Company's executive compensation program.\n\nThe feedback from these meetings was shared with the Board of Directors and helped inform the Board on corporate governance practices and trends.\n\nor",

        "page_content": "use of virgin fossil-based plastic in our packaging and products toward our goal of 125 million pounds by 2025. We've incorporated recycled and bio-based materials and reduced plastic use in products and packaging such as tapes and dispensers, sponges, packaging, workspace solutions, insulation, optical films, floor pads, sorbents, and more.\n\nWe believe a sustainable future is one in which ecosystems and communities thrive and opportunities are equitable and accessible for all. We advance meaningful actions toward a more equitable future for our global employee base, including training, development, and recruitment efforts focused on underrepresented populations. We foster an inclusive culture that supports and appreciates differences and provides fair and equal opportunities for everyone. And we continue our efforts toward building a diverse workforce around the world. We recognize the importance of equal access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers. Equitable opportunities in STEM lead to stronger communities, a stronger 3M, and a brighter collective future. To advance our social justice and impact agenda, we created a 3M Equity & Community organization to support our goals and commitments to progress equity in our workplaces, business practices, and communities globally. This holistic and cross-functional organization connects our teams and strategies across the areas of diversity and inclusion in our workforce; 3Mgives dedicated to building community partnerships and supporting volunteerism with a focus on closing the opportunity gap for underrepresented groups in STEM and skilled trades, and administering our $50 million social justice fund; and Social Justice Strategy & Initiatives dedicated to leading workstreams across the enterprise to address policies and practices advancing equitable societal solutions, including environmental justice, supplier diversity, product development, and policy advocacy.\n\nWe apply our expertise to create bold ambitions to shape a sustainable future in three priority areas: Science for Circular, Science for Climate, and Science for Community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Science for Circular\n\nWe see the circular economy as an opportunity  to create impactful solutions, inspire leadership, and implement disruptive change across all industries. In September 2022, 3M was one of 85 global businesses, financial institutions, and NGOs to endorse the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, a common vision for an effective and ambitious global treaty to end plastic pollution. This vision will guide policy engagements with governments to accelerate progress toward a circular economy.\n\n3M is on the Water Resilience Coalition leadership committee joining other leading companies to inspire others and accelerate our collective impact. 3M is also taking steps to reduce water use and improve water quality  through installation of  technologies at key manufacturing sites worldwide. This includes a commitment to install state-of-the art water purification technology at its largest waterusing facilities. Since 2019, we have reduced our  water usage by 16.8 percent indexed to net sales.\n\nWe continue to advance our goal of 100 percent of products entering 3M's new product commercialization process to include descriptions of their sustainability impact, such as an environmental or social challenge like improving air quality, reducing GHG emissions, or improving patient and worker sa fety.\n\n## Science for Community\n\nWe recognize the importance of cultivating a connected community by listening, understanding, and acting, bringing forward community voices and perspectives to advise 3M on plans for directing a $50 million investment to address racial opportunity gaps.\n\nSince 2021, we've supported over 1 million unique STEM and skilled trades learning experiences, putting us well on track to deliver on our goal to create 5 million such experiences by the end of 2025. Data from 3M's State of Science Index (SOSI) helps guide our strategic STEM investments with insights from across the globe.\n\nIn 2022, we created the new role of director of environmental justice to elevate and advance a global environmental justice program. We now have a cohesive strategy and approach for working alongside underserved communities, especially in areas where we have a manufacturing presence.\n\nIn support of  the United Nations LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business, 3M joined other companies in committing to processes, policies, and programs that promote equality and safety, prevent harassment and discrimination, and advance LGBTQI+ individuals in the workplace and the community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Science for Climate\n\nWe are advancing our impact through bigger intermediate and long-term goals and actions that align with the latest findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). During Climate Week NYC, 3M solutions for decarbonization, electrification, energy efficiency, and sustainable infrastructure were included in an interactive display.\n\n3M is in the middle of a three-year partnership with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to advance the Paris Agreement and UN sustainable development goals. This collaboration helps us highlight technology and solutions that inspire forward movement on climate commitments.\n\nExpanding our access to opportunities to invest in climate technology companies, 3M is invested in TPG Rise Climate Fund, a multi-billion dollar climate impact investing fund that deploys missiondriven capital at scale.\n\nThrough select 3M product platforms, we helped our customers avoid emitting over 121 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the last five years alone. Examples include helping customers in electronics, automotive, and construction industries improve their energy efficiency and reduce waste through the use of 3M materials and solutions.",

The Company took decisive actions that are foundational for our future, while maintaining an unwavering focus on the priorities of our shareholders, the needs of our customers, and our broader stakeholders.\n\n## Navigating macroeconomic challenges\n\nThe combination of ongoing litigation challenges together with significant external uncertainties, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, and slowing sales in key end-markets, impacted the Company's total shareholder return performance. In response, the Company took action to address inflation through selling price actions, proactively managed costs as demand softened throughout the year, and continued to address litigation challenges. To address supply chain disruptions, we did what was necessary to serve customers and reduce cycle times. We also navigated COVID-related lockdowns in China, reached agreement with the Flemish government to restart operations in Zwijndrecht, and exited our Russian business.\n\n## Building a stronger, leaner, and a more focused 3M\n\nIn 2022, we delivered the following financial results:\n\n- \u00b7 Organic sales growth of 1.2 percent, which included a 2.0 percent headwind from the decline in disposable respirator demand and the Russia exit;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EPS of $10.10; (1)\n- \u00b7 Adjusted free cash flow of $4.7 billion; (1)\n- \u00b7 Adjusted free cash flow conversion of 82 percent; (1)\n- \u00b7 Reduced total debt by $1.4 billion to strengthen our balance sheet; and\n- \u00b7  Returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nWe divested our Food Safety business, receiving approximately $1 billion in consideration and reducing our outstanding share count by 16 million. We continued to progress the spin-off of our Health Care business, which will create two world-class public companies, each better positioned to drive growth and value creation. We also simplified and streamlined our supply chain organization and advanced our digital strategies to better serve customers.\n\n- (1) See Appendix A to this Proxy Statement for a reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow, and adjusted free cash flow conversion to our results for the most directly comparable financial measures as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).",

The Compensation and Talent Committee also approved a new ESG performance payout modifier for the 2022 annual incentive program to support progress toward 3M's sustainability priorities and updated the benchmark used for the relative performance metric in the 2022-2024 long-term incentive program to improve alignment with 3M's business portfolio.\n\nAs we enter 2023, we are taking decisive actions to streamline the organization and improve our manufacturing and supply chain operations. We are staying close to our customers and continuing to invest in innovation as we forge the foundation for 3M's sustainable growth built on the strength of 3M's people, industry-leading innovation, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities, and our iconic brands.",

Such amounts do not reflect special items such as hiring bonuses, one-time make-whole and inducement awards granted in connection with the commencement of employment, or retention awards. The percentages shown for the Other NEOs also do not reflect items provided to Ms. Poul, who retired in 2022. If Ms. Poul had been included, the percentages shown would have been as follows:  Base Salary - 16%; AIP - 16%; PSAs - 34%; Stock Options - 17%; and RSUs - 17%. Numbers may not add to 100 percent due to rounding.\n- (2) In determining the level of achievement of the performance goals established under the AIP and the performance share awards for any given period, the costs, sales and impact on assets and liabilities from acquisitions are excluded in the year that the acquisition is completed. The Compensation and Talent Committee also makes other adjustments from time to time for special items that it believes are unrelated to the operational performance of the Company for the relevant measurement period (e.g., changes in tax laws or accounting principles, asset write-downs, the impact of restructurings, divestitures, or asset sales, unusual tax transactions, litigation or claim judgments and settlements, and other special items described in management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations appearing in the Company's annual/quarterly report to shareholders for the applicable period). These adjustments can have either a positive or negative impact on award payouts.\n- (3) For the Company's CEO, the Compensation and Talent Committee chose to deliver 50 percent of the target grant value of his annual long-term incentive awards in the form of performance shares and the remaining 50 percent in the form of stock options. Each of the Company's other executives was given an opportunity to indicate a preference to receive 50 percent of the target grant value of their annual long-term incentive awards in the form of RSUs, stock options, or an equal split of both stock options and RSUs. Regardless of an executive's indicated preference, the remaining 50 percent of the target grant value of his or her 2022 annual long-term incentive awards was delivered in the form of performance shares. The percentages shown reflect the apportionment of stock options and RSUs based on the elections for 2022 made by the NEOs (other than our CEO, who was not offered an opportunity to make an election).",

For more information about the new design, see 'Annual incentive' on page 71.\n- \u00b7 Added a new ESG modifier to the formula used to calculate the annual incentive compensation earned by the Company's senior executives, including our Named Executive Officers. Beginning in 2022, amounts earned by the Company's senior executives may be increased 10 percent of target, decreased 10 percent of target, or left unchanged based on the Compensation and Talent Committee's assessment of 3M's performance against a selection of pre-set goals ESG goals. For more information about the new ESG modifier, see 'Annual incentive - ESG Modifier' on page 72.\n- \u00b7 Effective for grants made to executives in 2022, updated the metrics, weightings, and certain other aspects of the Company's performance share awards. The changes generally are intended to strengthen the link to value creation for 3M in the current environment and better align the macro benchmark used as the basis of the relative metric with 3M's business portfolio. For more information, see 'Long-term incentives - 2022 performance share awards' on page 72.\n- \u00b7 Beginning with the annual grants made in 2022, increased (from 25 percent to 50 percent) the portion of the target grant value that the Company's executives (other than our CEO) may ask to receive in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, or a combination of both. Regardless of an executive's indicated preference, the remaining 50 percent o f the target grant value of his or her annual long-term incentive awards was delivered in the form of performance shares.\n- \u00b7 Effective August 11, 2022, amended the Executive Severance Plan to cap at target the amount of any payment under the Annual Incentive Plan that relates to the period following the participant's termination of employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Advisory  Approval on the Frequency of  Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation (page 56)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvery '1 year'\n\n- \u00b7 Approve, on an advisory basis, the frequency at which the Company holds advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers.\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote in favor of conducting an advisory  vote on executive compensation every '1 year.'",

All nominees are presently 3M directors who were elected by shareholders at the 2022 Annual Meeting, except for Ms. Anne H. Chow and Mr. Pedro J. Pizarro, both of whom joined the board on February 9, 2023 and are standing for election for the first time. A director search firm assisted with the identification of Ms. Chow and Mr. Pizarro for recommendation by the Nominating and Governance Committee for their election to the Board. We expect each nominee for election as a director to be able to serve if elected. If any nominee is not able to serve, proxies will be voted in favor of the remainder of those nominated and may be voted for substitute nominees, unless the Board chooses to reduce the number of directors serving on the Board. Each nominee elected as a director will continue in office until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or retirement. Pamela J. Craig, Muhtar Kent, and Dambisa F. Moyo are not seeking re-election for personal reasons unrelated to the Company and will retire from their service on the 3M Board on May 9, 2023, when their terms expire. We thank Ms. Craig, Mr. Kent, and Ms. Moyo for their many contributions to the Board and to the Company. The decision of three directors not to stand for re-election dovetails with the Company's objective of maintaining its more traditional board size. With two new directors elected to the Board as of February 9, 2023, no additional director replacements are being announced at this time. The Company will continue to refresh its Board of Directors regularly with the skills and experiences deemed most critical for setting strategic objectives and positioning 3M to drive long-term shareholder value. In addition, the Board has appointed two new committee chairs. As of April 5, 2023, Thomas K. Brown will chair the Nominating and Governance Committee and James R. Fitterling will chair the Compensation and Talent Committee.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee reviewed the Board Membership Criteria (described on page 26) and the specific experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills of each nominee, including membership(s) on the boards of directors of other public companies. The following pages contain biographical and other information about the nominees. Following each nominee's biographical information, we have provided information concerning the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills that are deemed most critical to 3M's long-term success and led the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board to determine that each nominee should serve as a director. In addition, the majority of our directors serve or have served on boards and board committees (including as committee chairs) of other public companies, which the Board believes provides them with additional board leadership and governance experience, exposure to best practices, and substantial knowledge and skills that further enhance the functioning of our Board.",

Shareholders should send the required information about the proposed nominee to:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate  Secretary 3M Company 3M Center Building 220-9E-02 St. Paul, MN 55144-1000\n\nFor an individual proposed by a shareholder to be considered by the Committee for recommendation as a Board nominee for the 2024 Annual Meeting, the Corporate Secretary must receive the proposal by November 23, 2023. Such proposals must be sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the shareholder to determine when the proposal was received by the Company). The Corporate Secretary will refer properly submitted shareholder proposed nominations to the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee for consideration at a future Committee meeting. Individuals proposed by shareholders in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration received by individuals identified to the Committee through other means.\n\n## Shareholder nominations - advance notice bylaw\n\nIn addition, 3M's Bylaws permit shareholders to nominate directors at an annual meeting of shareholders or at a special meeting at which directors are to be elected in accordance with the notice of meeting. Shareholders intending to nominate a person for election as a director must comply with the requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws. With respect to nominations to be acted upon at our 2024 Annual Meeting, our Bylaws would require, among other things, that the Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the record shareholder no earlier than November 23, 2023, and no later than December 23, 2023. The notice must contain the information required by the Bylaws, a copy of which is available on our website at www.3M.com , under Investor Relations - Governance. Nominations received after December 23, 2023, will not be acted upon at the 2024 Annual Meeting.\n\n## Shareholder nominations - universal proxy rules\n\nIn addition to satisfying the foregoing advance notice requirements under 3M's Bylaws, to comply with the universal proxy rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), shareholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the Company's nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than March 10, 2024, which is 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the 2023 Annual Meeting. Shareholders utilizing universal proxy are also required to follow other requirements contained in 3M's Bylaws, including the requirements for shareholder nominations set forth in our advance notice bylaw provision discussed above.\n\n## Proxy access nominations\n\nFurther, pursuant to the proxy access Bylaw adopted by the Board in November 2015, a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, continuously owning for three years at least three percent of our outstanding common shares may nominate and include in our proxy materials up to the greater of two directors and 20 percent of the number of directors currently serving, if the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the Bylaw requirements. For eligible shareholders to include in our proxy materials nominees for the 2023 Annual Meeting, proxy access nomination notices must be received by the Company no earlier than November 23, 2023, and no later than December 23, 2023. The notice must contain the information required by the Bylaws.\n\n## Director orientation and continuing education\n\nOur orientation programs familiarize new directors with 3M's businesses, strategic plans, and policies, and help prepare them for their role on their assigned committees. Continuing education programs assist directors in maintaining skills and knowledge necessary for the performance of their duties. These programs may be part of regular Board and Committee meetings or provided by academic or other qualified third parties. The programs have also included visits to the Company's laboratories and manufacturing facilities.",

        "page_content": "## Director independence\n\nThe Board has adopted a formal set of Director Independence Guidelines with respect to the determination of director independence, which either conform to or are more exacting than the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards, and the full text of which is available on our website at www.3M.com , under Investor Relations - Governance. In accordance with these Guidelines, a director or nominee for director must be determined to have no material relationship with the Company other  than as a director. The Guidelines specify  the criteria by  which the independence of our directors will be determined, including strict guidelines for directors and their immediate family members with respect to past employment or affiliation with the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm. The Guidelines also prohibit Audit and Compensation and Talent Committee members from having any direct or indirect financial relationship with the Company and restrict both commercial and not-forprofit relationships of all directors with the Company. Directors may not be given personal loans or extensions of credit by  the Company, and all directors are required to deal at arm's length with the Company and its subsidiaries, and to disclose any circumstance that might be perceived as a conflict of interest.\n\nIn accordance with these Guidelines, the Board undertook its annual review of director independence. During this review, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each director, or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in each of the most recent three completed fiscal years. The Board also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between the Company and a director or any members of a director's immediate family (or any entity of which a director or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner, or significant equity holder). The Board considered that in the ordinary course of business, transactions may occur between the Company and its subsidiaries and companies at which some of our directors are or have been officers. In particular, the Board considered the annual amount of sales to 3M for each of the most recent three completed fiscal years by each of the companies where directors serve or have served as an executive officer, as well as purchases by those companies from 3M. The Board determined that the amount of sales and purchases in each fiscal year was below one percent of the annual revenues of each of those companies, the threshold set forth in the Director Independence Guidelines. The Board also considered charitable contributions to notfor-profit organizations with which our directors or immediate family members are affiliated, none of which exceeded the threshold set forth in our Director Independence Guidelines.\n\nAs a result of this review, the Board affirmatively determined that the following directors are independent under these Guidelines: Thomas 'Tony' K. Brown, Anne H. Chow, David B. Dillon, Michael L. Eskew, James R. Fitterling, Amy E. Hood, Suzan Kereere, Gregory R. Page, and Pedro J. Pizarro. The Board has also determined that members of the Audit Committee and Compensation and Talent Committee received no compensation from the Company other than for service as a director. Michael F. Roman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is considered to not be independent because of his employment by the Company.\n\n## Corporate governance practices and policies\n\nThe Company believes that good corporate governance practices serve the long-term interests of shareholders, strengthen the Board and management, and further enhance the public trust 3M has earned from more than a century of operating with uncompromising integrity and doing business the right way. The following sections provide an overview of 3M's corporate governance practices, which are published on the Company's website, including the Corporate Governance Guidelines, our shareholder outreach and engagement practices, the Codes of Conduct for directors and employees, public policy engagement, and other important governance-related policies.",

The guidelines address matters such as the respective roles and responsibilities of the Board and management, the Board's leadership structure, the responsibilities of the independent Lead Director, director independence, the Board Membership Criteria, Board committees, and Board and management evaluation. The Board's Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and reviewing the Guidelines at least annually and recommending any proposed changes to the Board for approval. Some key governance guidelines, not otherwise addressed in our Proxy Statement, are set forth below. The Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, the charters of the Board committees, the Director Independence Guidelines, and the Codes of Conduct provide the framework for the governance of the Company and are available on our website at www.3M.com , under Investor Relations - Governance.\n\n## Mandatory Retirement Age\n\n- \u00b7 The retirement age of a nonemployee director is 74. A director elected to the Board prior  to their 74 th birthday may continue to serve until the annual shareholder meeting coincident with or  following their 74 th birthday. Absent special circumstances, directors will not be nominated for election after  their 74 th birthday.\n\n## Outside Board Policy\n\n- \u00b7 Independent directors who also serve as CEOs of publicly-traded companies or in equivalent positions should not serve on more than two boards of public companies in addition to the 3M Board, and other independent directors should not serve on more than four other boards of public companies in addition to the 3M Board. Independent directors must advise the Chairman/CEO before accepting an invitation to serve on another for-profit board.\n\n## Access to Employees and Outside Advisors\n\n- \u00b7 Board members have complete access to all members of 3M management and its employees, as well as outside advisors.\n\n## Communication with directors\n\nThe Board of Directors has adopted the following process for shareholders and other interested parties to send communications to members of the Board. Shareholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Lead Independent Director, the chairs of the Audit, Compensation and Talent, Nominating and Governance, and Science, Technology & Sustainability Committees of the Board, or with any of our other independent directors, or all of them as a group, by sending a letter to the following address: Corporate Secretary, 3M Company, 3M Center, Building 220-9E-02, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000. The Corporate Secretary reviews communications to the independent directors and forwards those communications to the independent directors as discussed below. Communications involving substantive accounting or auditing matters will be immediately forwarded to the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Company's Chief Compliance Officer consistent with time frames established by the Audit Committee for the receipt of communications dealing with these matters. Communications that pertain to non-financial matters will be forwarded promptly. Items that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board will not be forwarded, such as: business solicitation or advertisements, product-related inquiries, mass mailings, resumes or other job-related inquiries, and unsolicited commercial e-mails.\n\n## 3M's codes of conduct\n\nMore than a century of operating with uncompromising integrity has earned 3M trust from our customers, credibility with our communities, and dedication from our employees. All of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, are required to abide by 3M's Code of Conduct to ensure that our business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner. The Code forms the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with corporate policies and procedures and a Company-wide focus on uncompromising integrity in every aspect of our operations. Our Code of Conduct covers many topics, including antitrust and competition law, conflicts of interest, financial reporting, protection of confidential information, and compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of our business.",

The Audit Committee has adopted procedures to receive, retain, and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential and anonymous submission by employees or others of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. Information on how to submit any such communications can be found on 3M's Investor Relations website, under Governance Governance Documents - Employee Business Conduct Policies - 'Report a concern or ask a question.' Our Chief Compliance Officer, who has direct reporting obligations to the Audit Committee, periodically reports to the Audit Committee on compliance with the Company's Code of Conduct, including the effectiveness of the Company's compliance program.\n\nThe Board also has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors of the Company. This Code incorporates long-standing principles of conduct the Company and the Board follow to ensure the Company's business and the activities of the Board are conducted with integrity and adherence to the highest ethical standards, and in compliance with the law. The Company's Code of Conduct for employees and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors are available on our website at www.3M.com under Investor Relations - Governance - Governance Documents.\n\n## Public policy engagement\n\nThe Company believes that transparency with respect to the consideration, processes, and oversight of our engagement with lawmakers is important to our shareholders, and continuously makes efforts to give our shareholders useful information about our public policy engagement. Since 2007, the Company has voluntarily published a detailed explanation of the Company's political activities which is available on our website at www.3M.com under Investor Relations - Governance - Governance Documents - 'Lobbying and Political Activities Governance.' There, the Company explains its principles and governance procedures and provides detailed information about 3M's lobbying, political activities, and engagement with industry associations. We discuss our positions on important public policy issues, the factors we consider when evaluating contribution proposals, and the processes we use for legal, financial, executive, and Board oversight of our political activities and contributions. We also provide links to the reports the 3M Political Action Committee files monthly with the Federal Election Commission and the Company's quarterly Lobbying Disclosure reports, as well as a detailed list of our contributions to state candidates and political parties, and contributions to '527' political organizations. The Company also discloses on its website the trade associations the Company joined where $25,000 or more of the dues are allocated for lobbying purposes by the trade association. Certain tax-exempt organizations, organized under U.S. Internal Revenue Code \u00a7501(c)(4) and known as 'social welfare' organizations, may engage in lobbying activities related to their primary purpose. If the portion of any of our dues or other contribution in excess of $25,000 are allocated to lobbying activities, we will disclose the association and amount so allocated. The Company believes that these disclosures on our website, which exceed the disclosures required by law, offer transparency respecting the Company's public policy engagement and political activities.\n\n## Related person transaction policy and procedures\n\nThe Board of Directors has adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy and Procedures that is administered by the Nominating and Governance Committee. This Policy applies to any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a Related Person (as that term is defined in the Policy) has a direct or indirect material interest and which is required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Transactions that fall within this definition are referred to the Committee for approval or other action. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Committee decides whether or not to approve a transaction and approves only those transactions that are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In the course of its review and approval or ratification of a transaction, the Committee considers:\n\n- \u00b7 The nature of the Related Person's interest in the transaction;\n- \u00b7 The material terms of the transaction, including whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances;\n- \u00b7 The significance of the transaction to the Related Person;\n- \u00b7 The significance of the transaction to the Company;\n- \u00b7 Whether the related person is involved in the negotiation of the terms of the transaction or receives any special benefit as a result of the transaction;\n- \u00b7 Whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders; and\n- \u00b7 Any other matters the Committee deems appropriate.",

There were no Related Person Transactions that were referred to the Committee in 2022.\n\n## Policy on adoption of a rights plan\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, a 3M shareholder submitted a shareholder proposal to 3M regarding the approval process for adopting a shareholders' rights plan (also known as a 'poison pill'). 3M does not have a rights plan and is not currently considering adopting one. The Board continues to believe, however, that there may be circumstances under which adoption of a rights plan would give the Board the negotiating power and leverage necessary to obtain the best result for 3M shareholders in the context of a takeover effort.\n\nFollowing consideration of the favorable vote the shareholder proposal received and in light of this belief, the Board adopted and has reaffirmed a statement of policy on this topic. The Board's policy is that it will only adopt a rights plan if either: (1) shareholders have approved adoption of the rights plan; or (2) the Board (including a majority of the independent members of the Board), in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, makes a determination that, under the circumstances existing at the time, it is in the best interests of 3M's shareholders to adopt a rights plan without the delay in adoption resulting from seeking shareholder approval.\n\nThe Board has directed the Nominating and Governance Committee to review this policy statement on an annual basis and to report to the Board on any recommendations it may have concerning the policy. The terms of the policy, as in effect, are included in 3M's published Corporate Governance Guidelines in addition to this Proxy Statement.\n\n## Key areas of Board oversight\n\n## Board's role in strategy\n\nEach year management presents to the Board, and the Board discusses and approves, detailed long-term strategic plans for the Company. In addition to the Company's overall strategic plan, financial strategic plan, and enterprise strategic plans and priorities, including enterprise operations and sustainability matters, the discussions also focused on breakout sessions with the directors on strategic plans and priorities for each of the four business groups. Information about these plans and priorities can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Board's role in risk oversight\n\nThe Board oversees the Company's risk profile and management's processes for assessing and managing risk. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee the primary responsibility for oversight of policies and procedures with respect to Company risk assessment and risk management activities, the Company's major risk exposures, and management monitoring and mitigation activities. The Board has also delegated oversight of specific risks to various committees.\n\nThe Board reviews enterprise risks at least annually. The full Board review has included, among other things, portfolio management; major litigation; fluorochemical stewardship; supply chain resiliency; human capital management; sustainability; cybersecurity and information security; geopolitical risks; and environmental, health, and safety compliance. Other categories of risk and certain sustainability elements have been assigned to designated Board committees as summarized below. The chair of each committee that oversees risk provides a summary of the matters discussed with the committee to the full Board following each committee meeting, and the minutes of each committee meeting are also provided to all Board members.\n\nThe Board believes that its practices related to oversight of risk, including through delegation to its committees and the sharing of information with the full Board, is appropriate for a diversified technology and manufacturing company like 3M. The Board also believes its oversight of risk is enhanced by its current leadership structure (further discussed below) because the CEO, who is ultimately responsible for the Company's management of risk, also chairs regular Board meetings. Given his in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, the CEO is best able to bring key business issues and risks to the Board's attention. A summary of risk oversight roles is included on the following page.",

        "page_content": "## Board structure and processes\n\n## Board's leadership structure\n\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines allow the independent directors flexibility to split or combine the Chairman and CEO responsibilities. The independent directors annually review our leadership structure to determine the structure that is in the best interest of 3M and its shareholders.\n\nThe Board's current leadership structure is characterized by:\n\n- \u00b7 A combined Chairman of the Board and CEO;\n- \u00b7 A strong, independent, and highly experienced Lead Independent Director with well-defined responsibilities that support the Board's oversight responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 A robust committee structure consisting entirely of independent directors with oversight of various types of risks; and\n- \u00b7  An engaged and independent Board.\n\nThe Board believes that this leadership structure provides independent board leadership and engagement while deriving the benefits of having our CEO also serve as Chairman of the Board. As the individual with primary responsibility for managing the Company's day-to-day operations and with in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, the CEO is best positioned to chair regular Board meetings as the directors discuss key business and strategic issues. Coupled with the Lead Independent Director, this combined structure provides independent oversight while avoiding unnecessary confusion regarding the Board's oversight responsibilities and the day-to-day management of business operations.\n\nThe Board believes that adopting a rigid policy on whether to separate or combine the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO would inhibit the Board's ability to provide for a leadership structure that would best serve shareholders. As a result, the Board has rejected adopting a policy permanently separating or combining the positions of Chairman and CEO in its Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are reviewed at least annually and available on our website at www.3M.com , under Investor Relations - Governance. Instead, the Board adopted an approach that allows it, in representing the shareholders' best interests, to decide who should serve as Chairman or CEO, or both.\n\nThe Board believes that combining the roles of CEO and Chairman contributes to an efficient and effective Board. The Board believes that to drive change and continuous improvement within the Company, tempered by respect for 3M's traditions and values, the CEO must have maximum authority. The CEO is primarily responsible for effectively leading significant change, improving operational efficiency, driving growth, managing the Company's day-to-day business, managing the various risks facing the Company, and reinforcing the expectation for all employees of continuing to build on 3M's century-old tradition of uncompromising integrity and doing business the right way.\n\nThe Board also believes that the Company's corporate governance measures ensure that strong, independent directors continue to effectively oversee the Company's management and key issues related to executive compensation, CEO evaluation and succession planning, strategy, risk, and integrity. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide, in part, that:\n\n- \u00b7 Independent directors comprise a substantial majority of the Board;\n- \u00b7 Directors are elected annually by a majority vote in uncontested director elections;\n- \u00b7 Only independent directors serve on the Audit, Compensation and Talent, Nominating and Governance, and Science, Technology & Sustainability Committees;\n- \u00b7 The committee chairs establish their respective agendas;\n- \u00b7 The Board and committees may retain their own advisors;\n- \u00b7 Independent directors have complete access to management and employees;\n- \u00b7 Independent directors meet in executive session without the CEO or other employees during each regular Board meeting; and\n- \u00b7  The Board and each committee regularly conduct a self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees function effectively.\n\nThe Board has also designated one of its members to serve as Lead Independent Director, with responsibilities that are similar to those typically performed by an independent chairman.",

The Board reviews the recommendations of the Nominating and Governance Committee and determines the form and amount of director compensation.\n\nIn developing its recommendations, the Nominating and Governance Committee is guided by the following goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Compensation should fairly pay directors for work required in a company of 3M's size and complexity;\n- \u00b7 A significant portion of the total compensation should be paid in common stock (or common stock equivalents) to align directors' interests with the long-term interests of shareholders; and\n- \u00b7 The structure of the compensation should be simple and transparent.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee works with an independent compensation consultant to support its objectives of maintaining a reasonable and appropriate program. For 2022, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook) provided the Nominating and Governance Committee with expert advice on the compensation of non-employee directors, in addition to analyzing market data on director compensation at the same peer group of companies approved by the Compensation and Talent Committee for evaluating Named Executive Officer compensation. Neither the Company nor the Nominating and Governance Committee has any arrangement with any other compensation consultant who has a role in determining or recommending the amount or form of director compensation. For more information on the peer group, see 'Executive compensation peer group' on page 69.\n\nDirectors who are employees of the Company do not receive payment for their Board service.\n\n## Elements of annual compensation for non-employee directors\n\nOur non-employee directors receive annual compensation, as summarized below, that is intended to approximate the peer-group median mix (cash vs. equity) and provide an overall target total direct compensation that is consistent with 3M's size and market-capitalization value relative to its peers. To better align the interests of our directors with those of our shareholders, the annual stock retainer is subject to a rigorous hold-until-departure requirement. For more information on the peer group, please see the section entitled 'Executive compensation peer group' on page 69 of this Proxy Statement.\n\nIn May 2022, the Nominating and Governance Committee considered a director compensation study prepared by FW Cook and recommended not to change the non-employee directors' compensation arrangements, which the Board accepted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbbreviations: AC = Audit Committee; STSC = Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Unless a director elects otherwise (see 'Alternative Times and Forms of Payment' below), the annual cash retainer, annual Lead Director fee and annual Committee Chair fee are paid in cash on a quarterly basis, and the annual stock retainer is paid shortly after the Annual Meeting in deferred stock units (DSUs). All such cash fees are prorated based on the number of days of relevant service during the calendar quarter in which the fees are earned, and directors joining the Board after the Annual Meeting receive a prorated annual stock retainer.",

        "page_content": "DSUs . Each DSU represents the right to receive one share of 3M common stock at a future date. For fees paid in DSUs, the number of units credited to the director's recordkeeping account is determined by dividing the value of the fees to be paid by the closing price for a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for the last trading day immediately preceding the earliest date such amount otherwise could have been paid to the director if taken on a current basis. The Company also credits the director's account with an additional number of DSUs for each ordinary cash dividend paid on the shares of the Company's common stock. Appropriate adjustments to the DSUs credited to each director's account will be made for stock splits, stock dividends, spinoffs, mergers, consolidations, payments of dividends other than in cash, and similar circumstances affecting 3M common stock. Unless a different time or form of payment is elected (see 'Alternative Times and Forms of Payment' below), the shares of 3M common stock underlying the DSUs will be distributed in a single lump sum during the month of January in the first year after the director leaves the Board.\n\nAlternative Times and Forms of Payment. In lieu of receiving all or a portion of the annual stock retainer in DSUs, a director may elect to receive shares of 3M common stock on a current basis, but the net after-tax portion of such shares must be retained by the director until he or she leaves the Board. Similarly, in lieu of cash fees, a director may opt to receive 3M common shares, DSUs, or deferred cash. Directors also may elect to receive distribution of their deferred cash or settlement of their DSUs as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a single lump sum during the month of January in the first or second year following the year in which they leave the Board; or\n- \u00b7 in a series of three, five, or ten annual installments beginning during the month of January in the first year after they leave the Board.\n\n## 2022 director compensation table\n\nThe table below shows the amounts earned by our non-employee directors in 2022.

Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Company's matching gift program on the same terms as 3M employees. Under this program, the 3M Foundation will match up to $5,000 a year in contributions made by the director to eligible educational institutions and up to $1,000 a year in contributions by the director to eligible charitable organizations.\n\n## Reasonableness of non-employee director compensation\n\nAs described above, our philosophy on director compensation is to pay directors fairly for work required in a company of our size and complexity, provide a significant portion of the total compensation in the form of equity-based compensation to align directors' interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders, and structure compensation in a simple and transparent manner. We believe that the application of this philosophy has resulted in a non-employee director compensation program that reflects best-in-class design with the following provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Retainer-only compensation delivered in a combination of cash and stock-based awards with no fees for attending meetings that are an expected part of board service.\n- \u00b7 Additional retainers for special roles having greater responsibilities, such as Lead Director and committee chairs, to recognize the incremental additional time and effort required.\n- \u00b7 Equity delivered in the form of current or deferred full-value shares, where annual grants are based on a competitive fixed-value formula and immediate vesting helps avoid director entrenchment.\n- \u00b7 A requirement that directors hold until the end of their Board service all annual stock retainers earned on or after October 1, 2007, which includes net after-tax shares attributable to current payments and pre-tax shares attributable to deferrals.\n- \u00b7 Flexible voluntary deferral provisions.\n- \u00b7 No material benefits or perquisites.\n- \u00b7 Our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, most recently approved by shareholders at the 2021 Annual Meeting, includes a $600,000 annual compensation limit on all forms of compensation for non-employee directors.",

Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted ' FOR ' ratification unless a shareholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.\n\nThe Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation (including approval of all fees), retention, and oversight of the Company's Independent Accounting Firm retained to perform the audit of our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe Audit Committee has appointed PwC to serve as 3M's Independent Accounting Firm for 2023. PwC has been 3M's Independent Accounting Firm since 1998. Prior to that, 3M's Independent Accounting Firm was Coopers & Lybrand from 1975 until its merger with Price Waterhouse in 1998. In accordance with SEC rules and PwC policy, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide service to our Company. For lead and concurring audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of the Company's lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation policy involves a meeting between the Chair of the Audit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well as discussion by the full Committee and with management.\n\nThe Audit Committee annually reviews PwC's independence and performance in connection with the Audit Committee's determination of whether to retain PwC or engage another firm as our Independent Accounting Firm. In the course of these reviews, the Audit Committee considers, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 PwC's historical and recent performance on the 3M audit, including input from those 3M employees with substantial contact with PwC throughout the year about PwC's quality of service provided, and the independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism demonstrated throughout the engagement by PwC and its audit team;\n- \u00b7 an analysis of PwC's known legal risks and significant proceedings;\n- \u00b7 external data relating to audit quality and performance, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board reports on PwC and its peer firms;\n- \u00b7 PwC's independence;\n- \u00b7 the appropriateness of PwC's fees, on both an absolute basis and as compared to its peer firms;\n- \u00b7 PwC's tenure as our independent auditor and its familiarity with our global operations and businesses, accounting policies and practices and internal control over financial reporting; and\n- \u00b7 PwC's capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of our global operations, including the Company's phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning system on a worldwide basis over the next several years.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the Audit Committee believes that PwC is independent and that it is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders to retain PwC to serve as our Independent Accounting Firm for 2023.",

Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of PwC to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. If the selection of PwC is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another Independent Accounting Firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may in its discretion select a different Independent Accounting Firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.\n\nPwC representatives are expected to attend the Annual Meeting where they will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement.\n\n## Audit Committee report\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The management of the Company is responsible for (i) the preparation of complete and accurate annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements (financial statements) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (ii) maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and internal controls designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and laws and regulations, and (iii) an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Independent Accounting Firm is responsible for planning and conducting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) an audit of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and a review of the Company's quarterly financial statements and expressing opinions on the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting based on the integrated audits.\n\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the Independent Accounting Firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of the Company's results and the assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed significant accounting policies applied by the Company in its financial statements, as well as alternative treatments. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated audited financial statements with management and the Independent Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee has discussed with the Independent Accounting Firm matters required to be discussed pursuant to the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and the Securities and Exchange Commission with Audit Committees.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with the Independent Accounting Firm the auditor's independence from the Company and its management. As part of that review, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letters required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the Independent Accounting Firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed the Independent Accounting Firm's independence from the Company.\n\nThe Audit Committee also has considered whether the Independent Accounting Firm's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that the Independent Accounting Firm is independent from the Company and its management.\n\nThe Audit Committee has discussed with the Company's Internal Audit Department and Independent Accounting Firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel, and representatives of the Independent Accounting Firm in regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting and compliance programs.\n\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSubmitted by the Audit Committee\n\nDavid B. Dillon, Chair Thomas 'Tony' K. Brown Pamela J. Craig Michael L. Eskew Dambisa F. Moyo\n\nPedro J. Pizarro joined the Audit Committee after the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and his name is therefore not included in the above report.",

The Audit Committee has established a policy requiring its pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Accounting Firm.\n\nThe policy identifies the guiding principles that must be considered by the Audit Committee in approving services to ensure that the Independent Accounting Firm's independence is not impaired; describes the Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services that may be provided and the non-audit services that may not be performed; and sets forth the pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. The policy provides for the pre-approval of specific types of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other services and a limited fee estimate range for such services on an annual basis. The policy also requires specific pre-approval of all permitted services not already included in the annual pre-approval. The Independent Accounting Firm is required to report periodically to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided in accordance with their pre-approval and the fees for the services performed to date.\n\nThe Audit Committee's policy delegates to its Chair the authority to address requests for pre-approval of services in certain limited circumstances between Audit Committee meetings. The chair, in his discretion, must either seek immediate approval by e-mail from the other Audit Committee members, or report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee for its approval at its next scheduled meeting.\n\nThe Audit Committee may not delegate to management the Audit Committee's responsibility to pre-approve permitted services of the Independent Accounting Firm.\n\nAll Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services described below were approved by the Audit Committee before services were rendered.\n\n## Fees of the independent accounting firm\n\nThe following table represents fees billed for professional services rendered by PwC for the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, and fees billed for other services rendered by PwC during those periods.\n\n## Audit and non-audit fees ($ in millions)\n\n|                    | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Audit Fees         | $21.9  | $26.5  |\n| Audit-Related Fees | 0.5    | 0.4    |\n| Tax Fees           | 0.5    | 0.3    |\n| All Other Fees     | 0.0    | 0.0    |\n| Total              | $22.9  | $27.2  |\n\nIn the above table, in accordance with SEC rules, 'Audit' fees consisted of audit work and review services, as well as work generally only the independent registered public accounting firm can reasonably be expected to provide, such as statutory audits, comfort letters, consents, and review of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2021 and 2022, these fees also included services related to the carve-out audit of the Food Safety business. In 2022, these fees also included services related to the carve-out audit of the Health Care business. 'Audit-related' fees consisted principally of internal control and system audit procedures for periods prior to the rollout of the ERP system, agreed-upon procedures, employee benefit plan audits, and other attestation services. 'Tax' fees consisted principally of tax compliance services in foreign jurisdictions, assistance with transfer pricing documentation, and advice on foreign and domestic tax related matters. 'All Other' fees consist of licenses for accounting research software and other permissible services that do not fall into the three categories listed above.",

Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted ' FOR ' this proposal unless a shareholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.\n\nSection 14A of the Exchange Act provides our shareholders with the opportunity to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as described in this Proxy Statement. The Company has asked shareholders to vote on this type of proposal, known as a 'say-on-pay' proposal, every year since 2011.\n\nWe believe that our executive compensation program is consistent with our core compensation principles and is structured to assure that those principles are implemented. At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 10, 2022, approximately 88 percent of the votes cast on this issue voted to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in last year's Proxy Statement. Although the vote was non-binding, the Compensation and Talent Committee believes this level of approval percentage indicates that our shareholders strongly support our core compensation principles and our executive compensation program.\n\nThus, the Company is submitting to shareholders the following resolution for their consideration and approval:\n\n'RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of  the Company's Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of  the Securities and Exchange Commission (including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and related narrative).'\n\nWe encourage you to read the entire Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement to learn more about our executive compensation program and the impact that our financial performance has on the annual and long-term incentive compensation earned by our leadership team.\n\nWhile the Board of Directors and the Compensation and Talent Committee intend to carefully consider the results of the voting on this proposal when making future decisions regarding executive compensation, the vote is not binding on the Company or the Board and is advisory in nature. The Company currently holds advisory votes on the compensation of named executive officers annually. Assuming that the Company's shareholders vote in favor of maintaining the same frequency when voting on Proposal 4, the next such advisory vote is expected to occur at the 2024 Annual Meeting.",

        "page_content": "## Section I: Executive overview\n\n2022 was a pivotal year for 3M. The Company took decisive actions that are foundational for our future, while maintaining an unwavering focus on the priorities of our shareholders, the needs of our customers, and our broader stakeholders.\n\n## Navigating macroeconomic challenges\n\nThe combination of ongoing litigation challenges together with significant external uncertainties, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, and slowing sales in key end-markets, impacted the Company's total shareholder return performance. In response, the Company took action to address inflation through selling price actions, proactively managed costs as demand softened throughout the year, and continued to address litigation challenges. To address supply chain disruptions, we did what was necessary to serve customers and reduce cycle times. We also navigated COVID-related lockdowns in China, reached agreement with the Flemish government to restart operations in Zwijndrecht, and exited our Russian business.\n\n## Building a stronger, leaner, and a more focused 3M\n\nIn 2022, we delivered the following financial results:\n\n- \u00b7 Organic sales growth of 1.2 percent, which included a 2.0 percent headwind from the decline in disposable respirator demand and the Russia exit;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EPS of $10.10; (1)\n- \u00b7 Adjusted free cash flow of $4.7 billion; (1)\n- \u00b7 Adjusted free cash flow conversion of 82 percent; (1)\n- \u00b7 Reduced total debt by $1.4 billion to strengthen our balance sheet; and\n- \u00b7 Returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nWe divested our Food Safety business, receiving approximately $1 billion in consideration and reducing our outstanding share count by 16 million. We continued to progress the spin-off of our Health Care business, which will create two world-class public companies, each better positioned to drive growth and value creation. We also simplified and streamlined our supply chain organization and advanced our digital strategies to better serve customers.\n\nAs always, we put 3M science to work to solve customer needs and continued to make progress against our sustainability commitments to support employee health, safety, and well-being - including new flexible work arrangements and investments in our factories - and to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion priorities throughout our organization and the communities we serve.\n\n## Executive compensation program aligned with shareholders\n\nDespite many of our positive financial and strategic results during 2022, as previously mentioned, we also faced several business challenges relating to ongoing litigation and an extremely fluid global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment with slowing growth, inflation, and supply chain disruptions. 3M's executive compensation program outcomes for 2022 reflected our slower than expected growth with pay realized by the Company's executives in 2022 closely aligned with the experience of our shareholder.\n\n- \u00b7 The short-term incentive program paid out at 54 percent of target for our CEO and between 40.3 percent and 84.8 percent of target for our other Named Executive Officers;\n- \u00b7 The long-term performance shares for the 2020-2022 performance period were earned at 94.8 percent of target, which represented 84.4 percent of the initial target grant value after considering the change in market value of 3M's common stock over the performance period and accounting for the dividend equivalents associated with earned performance shares; and\n- \u00b7 The Company's 2022 performance also resulted in accruals significantly below target, at 6.8 percent and zero percent of target, for the 2022 performance year of the outstanding 2021 performance share awards (2021 - 2023 performance period, where 2022 performance is weighted 30 percent) and 2022 performance share awards (2022 - 2024 performance period, where 2022 performance is weighted 50 percent), respectively.\n- (1) See Appendix A to this Proxy Statement for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.",

The Committee also makes other adjustments from time to time for special items that it believes are unrelated to the operational performance of the Company for the relevant measurement period (e.g., changes in tax laws or accounting principles, asset write-downs, the impact of restructurings, divestitures, or asset sales, unusual tax transactions, litigation or claim judgments and settlements, and other special items described in management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations appearing in the Company's annual/quarterly report to shareholders for the applicable period). These adjustments can have either a positive or negative impact on award payouts.\n- (3) For the Company's CEO, the Committee chose to deliver 50 percent of the target grant value of his annual long-term incentive awards in the form of performance shares and the remaining 50 percent in the form of stock options. Each of the Company's other executives was given an opportunity to indicate a preference to receive 50 percent of the target grant value of their annual long-term incentive awards in the form of RSUs, stock options, or an equal split of both stock options and RSUs. Regardless of an executive's indicated preference, the remaining 50 percent of the target grant value of his or her 2022 annual long-term incentive awards was delivered in the form of performance shares. The percentages shown reflect the apportionment of stock options and RSUs based on the NEO's 2022 elections (other than our CEO, who was not offered an opportunity to make an election).",

The Company's performance directly impacted incentive compensation pay outcomes for our Named Executive Officers as discussed below.\n\n## 2022 annual incentive compensation\n\nFor the Named Executive Officers whose 2022 annual incentive compensation payout was calculated based on the Company's overall performance, the payout (before any adjustment for individual performance) was 54.0 percent of the target amount. The payouts reflect the Committee's view of our performance against the financial goals established for 2022, as shown below, and its decision not to increase or decrease the payouts using the ESG modifier.\n\nAll 2022 financial performance targets for the AIP were set at or above 2021 results. In approving these targets, the Committee considered 3M's internal business plans, which were reviewed and approved by the Board and reflected external market conditions, continuing uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other items.

calculation of the 2022 annual incentive payout for each Named Executive Officer, including the threshold, target, and maximum goals and attainments used to calculate the annual incentive payouts of the Named Executive Officers who are paid, in part, based on the performance of a business group, see '2022 AIP attainments and payouts' on page 75.\n\n## Performance share award payouts and accruals (long-term incentive compensation)\n\nThe three-year performance period for the 2020 performance share awards issued to the Named Executive Officers ended on December 31, 2022. Based on the financial results achieved during 2020 - 2022 and excluding dividend equivalents, the Named Executive Officers received 94.8 percent of the target performance shares subject to their 2020 performance share awards. After considering the change in the market value of 3M's common stock over the three-year performance period and the additional shares delivered pursuant to the dividend equivalent rights granted as part of the 2020 performance share awards, the value of the total number of 3M shares delivered to the Named Executive Officers in settlement of these awards (determined using the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 31, 2022) equaled 84.4 percent of the initial target grant value approved by the Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Impact of changes in stock price\n\nThe performance of 3M's stock has a material impact on the amount of compensation realized by our Named Executive Officers. Our stock ownership guidelines also require covered executives, including the Named Executive Officers, to own amounts of Company stock having a value exceeding a specified multiple of their base salary. If the market price of 3M's stock declines, so does the value of the stock they own. Similarly, all long-term incentives awarded to our Named Executive Officers are equity-based and therefore increase or decrease in value consistent with 3M's total shareholder return or, in the case of stock options, the value of 3M's common stock.\n\nThe stock and stock options held by our Named Executive Officers throughout 2022 decreased in value during the year as the closing price for a share of the Company's common stock on the NYSE decreased from $177.63 on December 31, 2021, to $119.92 on December 30, 2022, at which time all outstanding stock options held by our Named Executive Offers were underwater. Likewise, the value of the performance shares and restricted stock units held by our Named Executive Officers throughout the year decreased consistent with the one-year total shareholder return for the Company's stock.\n\nThe chart below shows how our CEO's target Total Direct Compensation for each of the last three fiscal years compared to his realizable pay as of the end of each such year and demonstrates that our compensation programs have been working as the Committee intended to align our CEO's realizable pay to the Company's performance. Realizable pay provides a retrospective look at pay versus performance that reflects the intrinsic value of equity awards granted during the year.\n\nTarget Total Direct Compensation vs. Realizable CEO Compensation ($ millions)\n\nBase Salary Bonus Stock Options Performance Shares\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmounts reflected in the realizable compensation figures shown in the chart above reflect (a) base salary earned during the year specified; (b) annual incentive compensation earned during the year specified; (c) the intrinsic value of all stock options granted to our CEO during the year specified, as determined using the closing price for a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 30, 2022 ($119.92); and (d) the intrinsic value of performance share awards (including the related dividend equivalents) granted to our CEO during the year specified, as determined based on actual performance results for years 2020 through 2022, assuming target performance for years after 2022, and using the closing price for a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 30, 2022 ($119.92).

For more information about the new design, see 'Annual incentive' on page 71.\n- \u00b7 Added a new ESG modifier to the formula used to calculate the annual incentive compensation earned by the Company's senior executives, including our Named Executive Officers. Beginning in 2022, amounts earned by the Company's senior executives may be increased 10 percent of target, decreased 10 percent of target, or left unchanged based on the Committee's assessment of 3M's performance against a selection of pre-set objective ESG goals. For more information about the new ESG modifier, see 'Annual incentive - ESG Modifier' on page 72.\n- \u00b7 Effective for grants made to executives in 2022, updated the metrics, weightings, and certain other aspects of the Company's performance share awards. The changes generally are intended to strengthen the link to value creation for 3M in the current environment and better align the macro benchmark used as the basis of the relative metric with 3M's business portfolio. For more information, see 'Long-term incentives - 2022 performance share awards' on page 72.\n- \u00b7 Beginning with the annual grants made in 2022, increased (from 25 percent to 50 percent) the portion of the target grant value that the Company's executives (other than our CEO) may ask to receive in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, or a combination of both. Regardless of an executive's indicated preference, the remaining 50 percent of the target grant value of his or her 2022 annual long-term incentive awards was delivered in the form of performance shares.\n- \u00b7 Effective August 11, 2022, amended the Executive Severance Plan to cap at target the amount of any payment under the Annual Incentive Plan that relates to the period following the participant's termination of employment.",

These principles align with the Company's vision and strategies, balance both individual and enterprise performance, and seek to provide wages and benefits that are competitive in the most-relevant markets to employees based on roles, responsibilities, skills, and performance.\n\nWith respect to 3M's executive compensation program, we use the following core principles, which are intended to support our pay-for-performance philosophy:\n\n- \u00b7 Total Direct Compensation should be competitive to attract the best talent to 3M, motivate executives to perform at their highest levels, reward individual contributions that improve the Company's ability to deliver outstanding performance, and retain those executives with the leadership abilities and skills necessary for building long-term shareholder value;\n- \u00b7 The portion of Total Direct Compensation that is at-risk and performance-based should increase with the level of an individual's responsibility;\n- \u00b7 The program should balance incentives for delivering outstanding long-term, sustainable performance against the potential to encourage inappropriate risk-taking;\n- \u00b7 The metrics and targets for earning performance-based incentives should be consistent with, and aligned to, increasing shareholder value over the long term; and\n- \u00b7 A significant portion of each executive's personal net worth should be tied to the value of 3M common stock as further motivation to build long-term shareholder value and mitigate the risk of inappropriate risk-taking.\n\nTo monitor and support the effectiveness of this program, the Committee periodically reviews the compensation principles used for setting target annual Total Cash Compensation for the Company's global workforce and approves the methodology for determining annual long-term incentive target grant values for employees eligible to receive such awards. The Company also periodically compares its pay components to those of other premier companies and adjusts them as necessary to stay competitive and attract, retain, and motivate a highly qualified, diverse workforce at all levels throughout the organization, not just for its executives.",

To ensure that we are providing Total Direct Compensation that is competitive, the Committee annually considers the available pay data of two peer groups: an executive compensation peer group and a survey peer group.\n\n## Executive compensation peer group\n\nFor 2022, the executive compensation peer group consisted of the companies identified below (which remained the same as in the previous year), as recommended by the Committee's independent compensation consultant and approved by the Committee. The companies in this executive compensation peer group were selected because (1) their performance was monitored regularly by the same market analysts who monitor the performance of 3M (investment peers) and they are considered major business-segment competitors used internally for performance comparisons, or (2) they met certain criteria based on similarity of their business, market capitalization (based on an eight-quarter rolling average), annual revenues, and/or Midwest corporate headquarters, and compete with 3M for capital or talent.\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n## Latest

compensation peer group to determine whether any changes are appropriate. Following its review in August 2022, the Committee determined that no changes were needed at that time.\n\nThe Company receives market surveys with pay data and information on the executive compensation practices at the companies in 3M's executive compensation peer group from Aon plc.\n\n## Survey peer group\n\nFor 2022, there were approximately 350 comparator companies in the survey peer group. Although the number and identity of the companies varies from year to year and from survey to survey, each of the companies included in the survey peer group had annual revenue exceeding $10 billion. All companies in the survey peer group also participate in one or more executive compensation surveys obtained from three consulting firms: Aon plc, FW Cook, and Willis Towers Watson plc. Pay data for the survey peer group is statistically regressed (based on annual revenues) to recognize",

The pay data for the survey peer group is then used to assess the reasonableness of the executive compensation peer group data received, helping to ensure that the Company's compensation objectives are being met. The Committee does not review the identity of the companies in the survey peer group.\n\n## How the Committee establishes target compensation levels\n\nThe Committee considers pay data from the executive compensation peer group as one of several reference points it uses to inform its decisions about overall compensation opportunities and specific compensation elements. The Committee does not benchmark specific compensation elements or total compensation to any specific percentile relative to the Peer Groups or the broader United States market. The Committee instead applies informed judgment in establishing targeted pay levels for the Named Executive Officers, considering pay data from the executive compensation peer group and other factors, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the breadth and complexity of the executive's duties and responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 the quality of the executive's leadership;\n- \u00b7 the financial and operational performance of the business activities for which the executive is responsible;\n- \u00b7 the executive's ability to successfully achieve assigned goals related to company culture;\n- \u00b7 the annual performance evaluation that Mr. Roman, assisted by 3M's Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer and other Company employees, completes for each Named Executive Officer (other than himself) and the annual performance evaluation that the Committee completes for Mr. Roman;\n- \u00b7 the executive's ability to successfully achieve assigned goals related to environmental, social, and governance matters, including sustainability goals;\n- \u00b7 the executive's performance rating for the prior year;\n- \u00b7 experience and time in their current position (or other positions with comparable duties and responsibilities); and\n- \u00b7 internal pay equity.\n\nThe Committee also uses information on the executive compensation practices at companies in the executive compensation peer group when considering design changes to the Company's executive compensation program. Overall, the Company believes that use of this information from the Peer Groups enables the Committee to create better alignment between executive pay and performance and to help ensure that 3M can attract and retain high-performing executive leaders.\n\n## Section III: Overview of compensation program design\n\n## Target total direct compensation mix for 2022\n\nThe illustrations below show how the 2022 target Total Direct Compensation of our CEO and other Named Executive Officers was apportioned among base salary, annual incentives, performance share awards, restricted stock units, and stock options. To provide a better representation of the intended mix of annual compensation provided to the Named Executive Officers, the percentages shown below do not take into consideration non-recurring special items such as one-time make-whole and inducement awards granted in connection with the commencement of employment or retention awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other NEOs (average)*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbbreviations: AIP = annual incentive pay; PSAs = performance share awards; RSUs = restricted stock units.\n\n- * Amounts shown reflect the average apportionment for all Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Roman and Ms. Poul. If Ms. Poul had been included, the percentages shown would have been as follows:  Base Salary - 16%; AIP - 16%; PSAs - 34%; Stock Options - 17%; and RSUs - 17%.

        "page_content": "## Annual incentive\n\n3M provides its executives with an opportunity to earn annual incentive compensation under the 3M Annual Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the 'AIP.' Participation in the AIP is intended to align a significant portion of participants' Total Cash Compensation with the near-term financial performance of the Company and its business units. Each executive is assigned a target amount of annual incentive compensation as part of his or her target Total Cash Compensation, but the actual amount paid under the AIP depends on the financial performance of 3M and its relevant business units and the executive's individual performance, in each case, measured against preestablished goals and objectives.\n\nNew AIP design for 2022. In consultation with its independent compensation consultant and following discussions with management of the Company, the Committee approved significant changes to the design of the AIP offered to the Company's executive officers in 2022 by:\n\n- \u00b7 replacing the business unit and total 3M economic profit metrics with new metrics tied to business unit Operating Income and total 3M Operating Cash Flow Conversion to sharpen focus on performance against the operating plan, prioritize Operating Cash Flow Conversion as a key driver of operating value, and enhance focus on inventory and receivables performance as key contributors to cash;\n- \u00b7 updating the weightings to place a stronger emphasis on items within the control of the business units and improve alignment with market practices; and\n- \u00b7 adding a modifier to incentivize the executive team to exceed the Committee's expectations on progress toward our ESG goals and hold them accountable when they fall short of the Committee's expectations.\n\nBasic calculation.

The amount of annual incentive compensation paid to an eligible employee may be increased, decreased, or left unchanged depending on his or her performance during the year. When determining the individual performance multipliers to be used for the Named Executive Officers, the Committee considers the individual performance of the Named Executive Officers using the performance evaluations described under 'How the Committee establishes target compensation levels' on page 70.\n\nESG Modifier. Amounts earned by senior executives may be increased by 10 percent of target, decreased by 10 percent of target, or left unchanged based on the Committee's determination of 3M's holistic performance against a set of preestablished, objective ESG metrics (referred to as the 'ESG Scorecard'). For 2022, the metrics included on the ESG Scorecard related to the Company's carbon and water commitments; operational improvements in the area of environment, health, and safety; progress on key social measures; and on-time completion of required ethics and compliance training.\n\n## Long-term incentives\n\nIn order to improve alignment with the Company's practices for non-executive employees and mitigate potential retention challenges associated with pay delivery, the Committee increased (from 25 percent to 50 percent) the portion of the target grant value that the Company's executives (other than our CEO) may ask to receive in the form of RSUs, stock options, or an equal split of both stock options and RSUs. Regardless of an executive's indicated preference, the remaining 50 percent of the target grant value of his or her 2022 annual long-term incentive awards was delivered in the form of performance shares. For the Company's CEO, the Committee chose to deliver 50 percent of the target grant value of his annual long-term incentive awards in the form of performance shares and the remaining 50 percent in the form of stock options. The terms of the 2022 performance share awards, 2022 stock options, and 2022 restricted stock units are described in detail below.\n\nIn limited circumstances, our Named Executive Officers also may receive other equity awards on an ad hoc basis as new hires or for recognition and retention, promotions, or other purposes. For additional information about a special restricted stock unit award granted to Mr. Lavers in July 2022 in connection with a significant expansion of his duties and responsibilities and as a further incentive for Mr. Lavers to remain with the Company, see 'Section V: 2022 compensation decisions and performance highlights - Jeffrey R. Lavers - Compensation Decisions' on page 84.\n\n## 2022 performance share awards\n\nIn consultation with its independent compensation consultant and following discussions with management of the Company, the Committee approved significant changes to the design of the performance shares awarded in 2022 by:\n\n- \u00b7 replacing the Free Cash Flow Conversion metric with a Free Cash Flow Growth metric that is intended to strengthen the link to shareholder returns by measuring cash flow improvement;\n- \u00b7 replacing the Relative Organic Volume Growth metric with a Relative Organic Sales Growth metric that is intended to enhance alignment with the Company's operating plan and external guidance;",

The number of shares of 3M common stock that will be issued for each 2022 performance share is linked to the Company's performance as measured by the equally weighted criteria of Earnings per Share Growth, Relative Organic Sales Growth, and Free Cash Flow Growth. These performance criteria were selected because they are aligned with 3M's operating plan and the financial objectives communicated to shareholders, and the Committee believes that they are important drivers of long-term shareholder value. Attainment of these three independent performance criteria is measured separately for each calendar year during the three-year measurement period, with each year weighted as follows: 2022 - 50 percent; 2023 - 30 percent; and 2024 - 20 percent. However, the targets against which the Company's performance is measured over the course of the three-year performance period are fixed at the time the grant is awarded, subject to adjustments only in limited circumstances (such as a stock split, spinoff, etc.).\n\nThe actual number of shares of 3M common stock that will be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2024, may be anywhere from 0 percent to 200 percent of the target number of performance shares awarded, depending on the performance of the Company over the course of the performance period. However, an executive may forfeit all or a portion of such shares if he or she does not remain employed by the Company throughout the three-year performance period. Each performance share award also includes cash-settled dividend equivalent rights that are payable only on the final number of shares earned.\n\nFor awards tied to the achievement of performance goals over the years 2022, 2023, and 2024, the Committee approved the targets shown below for determining the number of shares of 3M common stock to be delivered for each target performance share awarded, with the total number of shares actually delivered being the sum of the number of shares earned as a result of the Company's achievement of each of the three financial goals. If the Company's performance as measured by any of these performance criteria falls between any of the percentages listed below, the number of shares of 3M common stock earned will be determined by linear interpolation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2022 Performance Share Award Targets   |     |             | 2022  Performance  Levels*   | 2023-2024  Performance  Levels*   | Payout Level  (% of Target)   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Earnings Per Share Growth              |     | Threshold** | 1%                           | 3%                                | 6 2/3%                        |\n|                                        | 33% | Target      | 4%                           | 6%                                | 33 1/3%                       |\n|                                        |     | Maximum     | 7%                           | 9%                                | 66 2/3%                       |\n| Relative Organic Sales Growth          |     | Threshold** | -1.5%                        | -1.5%                             | 6 2/3%                        |\n|                                        | 33% | Target      | 0.0%                         | 0.0%                              | 33 1/3%                       |\n|                                        |     | Maximum     | 1.5%                         | 1.5%                              | 66 2/3%                       |\n| Free Cash Flow Growth                  |     | Threshold** | -7%                          | 3%                                | 6 2/3%                        |\n|                                        | 33% | Target      | -4%                          | 6%                                | 33 1/3%                       |\n|                                        |     | Maximum     | -1%                          | 9%                                | 66 2/3%                       |\n\nThe above targets are not a prediction of how 3M will perform during the years 2022 through 2024 or any other period in the future.

They also are eligible to receive certain additional benefits and perquisites that are provided for the executives' convenience (relocation assistance for moves required by 3M, financial planning assistance, and meals when attending to 3M business, for example), financial security (nonqualified deferred compensation plans and additional group term life insurance coverage, for example), personal security (home security equipment/monitoring, for example) or personal health (on-site exercise facilities and physical exams, for example). Our Named Executive Officers and other employees also may receive Company tickets for sporting or other events. The Company believes that the benefits and perquisites offered generally are similar to those of our peers and assist in attracting and retaining executives. In some cases, there is no incremental cost to the Company associated with providing these additional benefits and perquisites (physical exams and certain tickets to events, for example) or the executives pay all or a substantial portion of the incremental costs incurred by the Company (on-site exercise facilities, for example).\n\nThese additional benefits and perquisites generally are provided on a consistent basis only to a limited group of our most senior U.S. employees (including all of the Named Executive Officers), although enhanced personal security equipment and monitoring is provided only to our Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Company also operates aircraft that are used by our senior officers and other employees to conduct company business. For personal security reasons, the Board of Directors requires our Chief Executive Officer to use the Company's aircraft for all air travel, both business and personal. Our Chief Executive Officer's spouse and other guests also may accompany him on flights.\n\nThe incremental cost to the Company of providing these additional benefits to the Named Executive Officers is reflected in the All Other Compensation Table. No tax gross ups are provided on any of these additional benefits and perquisites other than taxable relocation benefits.",

Each Named Executive Officer's target annual incentive for  the year equaled the difference between his or her  target Total Cash Compensation and annual base salary (weighted to reflect mid-year adjustments, if appropriate).\n\nBusiness performance factor. For purposes of measuring business performance against the targets established for 2022 and converting that performance into a business performance factor determined in accordance with the terms of  the AIP, each Named Executive Officer  was assigned to an appropriate business unit for each metric (the entire Company, in some cases). The metrics, relevant business unit, goals, and attainments used to calculate the business performance factor  for each Named Executive Officer are shown below.\n\n## Business performance factor calculation for Mr. Roman, Mr. Patolawala, Mr. Gibbons, and, for  the period July 1 thru December 31, Mr. Lavers *, **\n\n## Dollar amounts in millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Performance  Metric                        | Business Unit               | Threshold  ($)   | Target  ($)   | Maximum  ($)   | Actual vs.  Target   | Payout  %   | Weighting   | Weighted  Payout %   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Local                                      | 3M Worldwide                | 35,809           |               |                |                      |             | 50%         | 36.0%                |\n| Currency    Sales vs. Plan                 | 3M Worldwide                | 34,009           | 36,966        | 39,923         | 97%                  | 71.9%       | 50%         | 36.0%                |\n| Operating  Income vs.                      | 3M Worldwide                | 6,745            | 7,687         |                | 88%                  | 40%         | 30%         | 12.0%                |\n| Plan                                       |                             | 6,534            |               | 8,840          |                      |             |             |                      |\n| Operating  Cash Flow  Conversion  vs. Plan | 3M Worldwide                | 109% 108%        | 127%          | 146%           | 86%                  | 30%         | 20%         | 6.0%                 |\n| Business Performance Factor                | Business Performance Factor |                  |               |                |                      |             |             | 54.0%                |\n\nBusiness performance factor calculation for Mr. Lavers  for the period January  1 thru June 30 *, **\n\n## Dollar amounts in millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Performance  Metric            | Business Unit   | Threshold  ($)   | Target  ($)   | Maximum  ($)   | Actual vs.   Target   | Payout  %   | Weighting   | Weighted  Payout %   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Local                          | Consumer        | 5,442            |               |                |                       |             | 50%         | 17.2%                |\n| Currency   Sales vs. Plan      |                 | 5,377            | 5,844         | 6,312          | 93%                   | 34.4%       | 50%         |                      |\n| Operating  Income vs.  Plan    |                 | 994              |               |                | 79%                   | 0%          | 30%         | 0.0%                 |\n| Operating  Cash Flow  vs. Plan | Consumer        | 1,065            | 1,253         | 1,441          | 79%                   | 30%         | 20%         |                      |\n| Conversion                     | 3M Worldwide    | 109%             |               |                | 86%                   | 30%         | 20%         | 6.0%                 |\n| Business Performance Factor    |                 | 108%             | 127%          | 146%           | 79%                   | 30%         |             | 23.2%                |",

The amount of annual incentive compensation paid to an eligible employee may be increased, decreased, or left unchanged depending on his or her performance during the year. The Committee determined the individual performance multiplier  for each Named Executive Officer, as shown in the table under 'Final 2022 AIP payouts' below, based upon the annual performance evaluation completed for each Named Executive Officer other than Ms. Poul. The Committee generally does not conduct detailed performance assessments for executives who depart the Company before the end of  the year, but instead discusses the former executive's performance with the Company's Chief Executive Officer  to determine whether a sufficient basis exists to increase or decrease the executive's AIP payout for  the year on the basis of individual performance. Following this approach, the Committee discussed Ms. Poul's 2022 performance with Mr. Roman and decided not to increase or decrease the amount of her prorated 2022 AIP payout based on individual performance. For a listing of selected 2022 performance highlights of each Named Executive Officer (other than Ms. Poul), see 'Section V: 2022 compensation decisions and performance highlights' beginning on page 81.",

At its meeting in February 2023, the Committee approved (and with respect to Mr. Roman, the independent members of  the Board of Directors ratified) a payment under  the AIP  to each Named Executive Officer, as shown below.\n\n| Named Executive Officer   | (a)  Total  Weighted- Average Target  AIP Payout*  ($)   | (b)  Business  Performance  Factor   | (c)  Individual  Performance  Multiplier**   | (d)  ESG Modifier   ($)  -   | (c)  +  (d)  Approved 2022  AIP Payout   ($)   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Michael F.

Regardless of an executive's indicated preference, the remaining 50 percent of the target grant value of  their 2022 annual long-term incentive awards was delivered in the form of performance shares. For  the Company's CEO, the Committee chose to deliver 50 percent of  the target grant value of his annual long-term incentive awards in the form of performance shares and the remaining 50 percent in the form of stock options.\n\n## Status of outstanding performance share awards\n\nThe Company's annual award cycle and three-year performance periods result in an overlap of awards. For example, the performance goals for 2022 performance share awards relate to the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. Similarly, the performance goals for 2021 performance share awards relate to the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, and so on, as shown below. Performance against the goals established for each award are measured separately for each calendar year during the measurement period, with each year weighted as shown below in parenthesis. The Committee believes this structure reduces motivation to maximize performance in any one period by providing the highest-level rewards only by building sustainable long-term results.\n\n| Award    | 2019         | 2020         | 2021         | 2022         | 2023         |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 2019 PSA | Year 1 (50%) | Year 2 (30%) | Year 3 (20%) |              |              |\n| 2020 PSA |              | Year 1 (50%) | Year 2 (30%) | Year 3 (20%) |              |\n| 2021 PSA |              |              | Year 1 (50%) | Year 2 (30%) | Year 3 (20%) |\n\nThe Committee periodically reviews the Company's performance against the goals established for each performance share award throughout the duration of its measurement period. The tables below summarize the status of the different performance share awards held by the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## 2022 PSA (2022-2024 measurement period)\n\n|                                               |                     |                            |                           | Three-year Performance Period -  Actual Performance Level Achieved (1)   | Three-year Performance Period -  Actual Performance Level Achieved (1)   | Three-year Performance Period -  Actual Performance Level Achieved (1)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance Measures  and Weighting           | Threshold           | Performance Levels  Target | Maximum                   | 2022  (Year 1;

The number of shares required to be beneficially owned in order  to comply  with the guidelines is determined by dividing the specified multiple of  the executive's annual base salary on the calculation date by the closing price of 3M common stock on such date.\n\nCalculation Dates. The number of shares required to comply  with the guidelines is calculated (or recalculated) on each of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the date an executive first becomes subject to the guidelines;\n- \u00b7 the date an executive's target ownership multiple increases or decreases due to a change in position; and\n- \u00b7  every third anniversary of December 31, 2022.\n\nGrace Period. Each covered executive is expected to attain beneficial ownership of  the required number of shares of 3M stock by the later of the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment to the position triggering the calculation date or, if an executive's required ownership level increases as a result of a triennial recalculation, the third anniversary of the calculation date. If a covered executive who is within the five-year period described above becomes subject to an increased stock ownership requirement as a result of a triennial recalculation, the covered executive will have until the later of (a) the expiration of  the five-year compliance window or (b) the third anniversary of  the recalculation date to attain the higher level of ownership.\n\nShares Counted. For purposes of determining compliance with the stock ownership guidelines, the following shares are considered to be beneficially owned by the covered executive:\n\n- \u00b7 shares owned directly by a covered executive or by members of the covered executive's immediate family;\n- \u00b7 shares owned indirectly  through a covered executive's account in the Company's 401(k) plan or another deferred compensation plan;\n- \u00b7 outstanding shares of restricted stock owned by a covered executive; and\n- \u00b7  shares underlying outstanding restricted stock units held by a covered executive.\n\nStock Holding Requirements . If a covered executive is not making adequate progress to meet the specified level of ownership by  the end of  the grace period, the guidelines provide that he or she must hold a sufficient number of  the after-tax 3M shares received upon the payout of his or her performance shares to be on track to satisfy the required ownership level.\n\nFor more information concerning the 3M stock ownership of the Named Executive Officers, see 'Security ownership of management' beginning on page 108.",

        "page_content": "On February 24, 2023, the NYSE proposed the adoption of a new rule that would require all listed companies (including 3M) to develop and implement a policy providing for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentivebased compensation received by current or  former executive officers.  Although the Company's existing policy goes beyond the requirements of  the proposed rule in many respects, certain updates would be required in order  to ensure compliance with the new rule if implemented as proposed.  The Company's Board of Directors fully intends to bring the Company's executive compensation recoupment arrangements into compliance with the new requirements of any  final rule adopted by  the NYSE.\n\nOther remedial actions. Whether or not an executive's actions trigger a potential clawback, 3M also may take other remedial actions to appropriately address employee conduct that is considered detrimental to the Company. Depending on the circumstances, such other actions may include, without limitation, reducing the executive's duties and responsibilities, limiting the progression of the executive's career with 3M, reducing the executive's base salary or target Total Cash Compensation, reducing the target grant value of  the executive's future long-term incentive compensation awards, causing the forfeiture of  the executive's outstanding long-term incentive awards, or  terminating the executive's employment with 3M.\n\n## Assessment of risk related to compensation programs\n\nFollowing completion of a recent compensation risk assessment, the Company concluded that none of its compensation policies and practices is reasonably likely  to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In connection with this assessment, the Company completed an inventory of its executive and non-executive compensation programs globally, with particular emphasis on incentive compensation plans or programs. The Committee's independent compensation consultant, FW Cook, conducted a risk assessment of the Company's executive compensation policies and practices and reviewed the inventory of non-executive compensation programs compiled by management. The scope of  the fiscal 2022 risk assessment generally  was consistent with that conducted in recent years, through which the Company evaluated the primary components of its compensation plans and practices to identify  whether  those components, either alone or in combination, properly balanced compensation opportunities and risk.\n\nThe Company believes that its overall cash versus equity pay mix, balance of shorter-term versus longer-term performance focus, balance of revenue- versus profit-focused performance measures, stock ownership guidelines, forfeiture provisions, and 'clawback' policy all work together to provide our employees and executives with incentives to deliver outstanding performance to build long-term shareholder value, while taking only necessary and prudent risks. In this regard, the Company's strong ethics and its corporate compliance systems, which are overseen by the Audit Committee, further mitigate against excessive or inappropriate risk taking. In addition, the Company's employee sales plans are designed under global guidelines, where oversight of plan terms, administration, and operation is strong and governance roles are segregated.\n\nBased on its consideration of these assessments, the Committee concurred with the Company's determination that none of its compensation policies and practices is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n## Tally sheets\n\nThe Committee periodically reviews a report comparing the amounts of compensation actually received by the Company's Named Executive Officers to the amounts reported in its annual proxy statement and summarizing the compensation that would be owed to such individuals in the event of the termination of their employment under certain circumstances. Reviewing this report helps the Committee better understand the Company's potential obligations to the Named Executive Officers following the termination of their employment. It also helps the Committee better assess the risk of any of the Named Executive Officers leaving the Company prematurely because the Company is not providing sufficient retention incentives.\n\n## Tax considerations\n\nSection 162(m) of  the Internal Revenue Code disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation paid in any given year in excess of $1 million to certain current and former executive officers of the Company. As a result, we expect that compensation paid per  year  to our Named Executive Officers and certain other current and former executive officers in excess of $1 million generally will not be deductible, subject to limited exceptions. Interpretations of and changes in applicable tax laws and regulations as well as other  factors beyond the control of  the Committee can affect deductibility of compensation, and there can be no assurance that compensation paid to our executive officers will be tax deductible. The Committee reserves the right to make changes or amendments to existing compensation programs and arrangements, including changes or amendments that may result in the loss of  tax deductions, if  the Committee believes it is in the best interests of  the Company and its shareholders to do so.",

The amounts included in this column for the performance share awards made during 2022 are calculated based on the probable satisfaction of  the performance conditions for such awards, determined as of  the grant date. If  the highest level of performance is achieved for  these performance share awards, the maximum value of these awards at the grant date would be as follows: Mr. Roman - $11,000,132; Mr. Patolawala $5,590,245; Mr. Gibbons - $3,020,064; Mr. Lavers - $2,700,167; Mr. Vale - $3,020,064; and Ms. Poul - $3,926,489.\n\n- (3) The amounts in the Option Awards column reflect the aggregate grant date fair  value of such awards computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. Assumptions made in the calculation of  these amounts are included in Note 18 to the Company's audited financial statements for  the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2023.\n- (4) The amounts in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column reflect the annual incentive compensation earned by each individual during the year specified pursuant to the Company's Annual Incentive Plan.\n- (5) The amounts in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column reflect the actuarial increase in the present value (if any) of each individual's pension benefits under all defined benefit pension plans of the Company, determined using the same interest rate and mortality assumptions as those used for financial statement reporting purposes. See Note 13 to the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2023.

All eligible employees under this plan may receive 3M matching contributions on their pre-tax or Roth 401(k) contributions to the plan on up to five percent of their eligible pay. Eligible employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, also receive additional automatic 3M retirement income contributions equal to three percent of their eligible pay.\n- (2) The amounts shown reflect 3M contributions under the VIP Excess Plan, a nonqualified defined contribution plan. Eligibility for this plan and the Company contributions is limited to employees whose compensation exceeds a limit established by Federal income tax laws for tax-qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits eligible employees to save additional amounts from their current cash compensation beyond the contribution limits established by Federal tax laws, and to receive Company contributions similar to those provided under the tax-qualified 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan.\n- (3) The amounts shown reflect the amount of premiums paid by the Company on behalf of each individual for additional group term life insurance coverage obtained for them under the Executive Life Insurance Plan.\n- (4) These amounts reflect fees for personal financial planning and tax return preparation services paid by the Company on behalf of each individual.\n- (5) This amount reflects the aggregate incremental cost to the Company for Mr. Roman's personal use of corporate aircraft during 2022. This aggregate incremental cost was calculated by combining the variable operating costs of such travel, including the cost of fuel, landing fees, parking fees, trip preparation fees, en route communication charges, en route navigation charges, on-board catering, and crew travel expenses. The Compensation and Talent Committee required Mr. Roman to use the corporate aircraft for all business and personal travel.",

Because Ms. Poul was no longer employed by the Company when the error was discovered, and the failure to make the required payment exposed the Company to potential penalties, the Company remitted a payment, in the amount of $4,118, to the IRS for Ms. Poul's account.\n\n## Grants of plan-based awards\n\nThe following table reflects the various equity and non-equity plan awards granted to the Named Executive Officers during 2022. Except for the annual incentive compensation earned by such Named Executive Officers under the Annual Incentive Plan, all of the equity incentive plan awards referred to in this table were granted under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n\n## 2022 grants of plan-based awards table\n\n|                     |          |          | Estimated Future Payouts  Under Non-Equity Incentive  Plan Awards (2)   | Estimated Future Payouts  Under Non-Equity Incentive  Plan Awards (2)   | Estimated Future   Payouts Under Equity Incentive   | Estimated Future   Payouts Under Equity Incentive   | Estimated Future   Payouts Under Equity Incentive   | Plan Awards (3)   | Stock  Awards:  Number   of Shares   | Exercise  or Base  Price of   | Grant  Date Fair   Value of   Stock and  Option   |\n|---------------------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                     | Grant    | Approval | Threshold                                                               | Target                                                                  | Maximum                                             | Threshold                                           | Target                                              | Maximum           | of Stock   or Units                  | Option  Awards                | Awards                                            |\n| Name/Award Type (1) | Date     | Date     | ( $ )                                                                   | ($)                                                                     | ($)                                                 | (#)                                                 | (#)                                                 | (#)               | (#) (4)                              | ($/Sh) (6)                    | ($) (7)                                           |\n| Michael F.

If the amounts reported were adjusted to reflect mid-year departures, the amounts shown for Ms. Poul would have been as follows: threshold ($2,215); target ($369,242); and maximum ($738,483). For more information, see 'Annual Incentive' beginning on page 71.\n- (3) The amounts shown as the Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards with respect to 2022 performance shares reflect the threshold, target, and maximum number of shares of 3M common stock that may be earned by each individual pursuant to their 2022 performance share awards. The actual number of shares of 3M common stock to be delivered as a result of these performance shares will be determined by the performance of the Company during the three-year performance period of 2022, 2023, and 2024, as measured against three performance criteria selected by the Compensation and Talent Committee (Relative Organic Sales Growth, Earnings per Share Growth, and Free Cash Flow Growth).

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company amended the ERIP to include a pension equity formula for (1) employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2001, and (2) employees who voluntarily elected the pension equity formula during the one-time choice election period in 2001. The ERIP was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009, meaning that employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2009 (including Mr. Patolawala, Mr. Gibbons, and Ms. Poul), do not participate in the plan. Of the Named Executive Officers, Mr. Roman and Mr. Lavers, participate under the non-pension equity formula of the ERIP (referred to as the Portfolio I Plan), while Mr. Vale participates under the pension equity formula of the ERIP (referred to as the Portfolio II Plan). Retirement benefits under the ERIP are based on an employee's years of service and average annual earnings during the employee's four highest-paid consecutive years of service. As applied to the Named Executive Officers, earnings for purposes of the ERIP include base salary and target annual incentive compensation. All benefits earned under the ERIP by the Named Executive Officers will be payable in the form of life annuities, unless an individual elects at the time their employment ends to receive the entire amount of his or her earned pension benefits in the form of a single lump-sum cash payment.\n\nUnder the Portfolio I Plan, employees earn annual benefits payable at retirement generally equal to 1.15 percent of their high-four average annual earnings multiplied by their years of service plus 0.35 percent of their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security breakpoint multiplied by their years of service (up to a maximum of 35 years). The Social Security breakpoint is an average of the Social Security taxable wage bases for each of the 35 years ending with the year each employee qualifies to receive unreduced Social Security retirement benefits. Under the Portfolio I Plan, an employee may retire with an unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62 for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively). If the employee's age and service at the time of retirement total at least 90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively) the employee also would receive a Social Security bridge payment until age 62. As of March 13, 2023, Mr. Lavers was eligible to retire with reduced early retirement benefits, with the reduction being equal to 5 percent of the pension otherwise payable for each year that he retires prior to age 62. Mr. Roman is eligible to retire with unreduced retirement benefits.\n\nUnder the Portfolio II Plan, employees earn pension credits (from 3 percent to 12 percent) for each year of employment based on their age and accumulated years of service under the plan. Once their employment ends, these accumulated pension credits are multiplied by their high-four average annual earnings and added to an amount determined by multiplying one-half of these accumulated pension credits by their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security integration level (70 percent of the Social Security taxable wage base in the year employment ends). The sum of these two amounts is then converted into an annuity payable over the lifetime of the employee using fixed conversion factors. The Portfolio II Plan does not provide any subsidies for early retirement.",

        "page_content": "As a tax-qualified plan, the ERIP is subject to a variety of limits that apply to both the amount of any employee's earnings that may be considered when determining the benefits earned under the plan as well as the maximum amount of benefits that any employee may earn. The Nonqualified Pension Plan is designed to provide additional benefits to employees, including the Named Executive Officers, affected by these limits. The amount of benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan generally equals the amount of benefits an employee was not able to earn under the ERIP as a result of the limits imposed by Federal tax laws. The benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan generally are paid in the form of a single lump-sum cash payment following the termination of their employment (subject to any applicable delay under Federal tax laws). Each of the Named Executive Officers who participates in the Nonqualified Pension Plan was given a one-time opportunity during 2008 to elect to receive their benefits earned under such plan in the form of a life annuity following their retirement, and none of them elected to receive their benefits in the form of a life annuity.\n\n## Nonqualified deferred compensation\n\nThe following table reflects the participation during 2022 by the Named Executive Officers in three nonqualified deferred compensation plans offered by the Company. The Deferred Compensation Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until retirement from the Company the receipt of a portion of their base salary and annual incentive compensation. The Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until retirement from the Company the payout of their performance share awards under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The VIP Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer until retirement from the Company the receipt of a portion of their base salary and annual incentive compensation. All three plans generally allow the eligible employees to elect to receive payment of their account balances in the form of either a single lump sum payment or in up to ten annual installments. With the exception of deferrals of performance shares under the Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan, earnings are credited to the amounts deferred under all three plans based on the returns paid on the investment funds available to participants in 3M's qualified 401(k) plan or a fixed rate of return based on corporate bond yields (as selected by each participant). Earnings are credited to the deferrals of performance shares under the Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan based on the return on shares of 3M common stock, including reinvested dividends.",

The Summary Compensation Table does not reflect any portion of the contributions from the payout of Mr. Roman's and Ms. Poul's performance share awards for the 2019-2021 performance period because those awards were granted prior to the earliest year covered by the Summary Compensation Table.\n- (2) The amounts shown reflect 3M contributions under the VIP Excess Plan, a nonqualified defined contribution plan. Eligibility for this plan and the Company contributions is limited to employees whose compensation exceeds a limit established by Federal income tax laws for tax-qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits eligible employees to save additional amounts from their current cash compensation beyond the contribution limits established by Federal tax laws, and to receive Company contributions similar to the Company contributions provided under the tax-qualified 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. All amounts contributed by the Company on behalf of these individuals during 2022 are included in the 'All Other Compensation' column of the Summary Compensation Table.",

        "page_content": "## Potential payments upon termination or change in control\n\nAs reflected in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, 3M has no employment agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers nor does it have any change in control plans or arrangements that would provide benefits to any of the Named Executive Officers solely in the event of a change in control of the Company. We also do not have any agreements that would provide automatic 'single-trigger' accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to any of our Named Executive Officers in the event of a change in control of the Company. 3M does maintain a severance plan that provides separation benefits to eligible U.S. employees (including the Named Executive Officers) who incur a qualifying termination. In addition, certain of the Company's executive compensation and benefit plans provide all participants (including the Named Executive Officers) with certain rights or the right to receive payments in the event of the termination of their employment or upon a change in control of the Company. The terms applicable to these potential rights or payments in various situations are described below. Payments or benefits under other plans and arrangements that generally are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated employees of the Company upon the termination of their employment are not described, including:\n\n- \u00b7 accrued base salary;\n- \u00b7 annual incentive earned with respect to completed performance periods;\n- \u00b7 retiree welfare benefits provided to substantially all of the Company's U.S. employees, including retiree medical benefits;\n- \u00b7 distribution of vested account balances under the Company's qualified 401(k) plan;\n- \u00b7 accrued pension benefits under the Company's defined benefit pension plans payable following an employee's retirement or other termination of employment (the amounts of these benefits earned by the Named Executive Officers are reported in the 2022 Pension Benefits Table);\n- \u00b7 life insurance benefits generally available to all salaried employees; and\n- \u00b7 distribution of account balances under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plans (the account balances of the Named Executive Officers are reported in the 2022 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table).\n\n## Rights and payments upon retirement\n\nFollowing retirement (as described below), the Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive:\n\n- \u00b7 continued vesting of stock options previously granted under the Company's stock plans, and the opportunity to exercise vested stock options previously granted under such plans during the remainder of the original term (up to 10 years) of such options;\n- \u00b7 an annual incentive plan payment for the year of retirement, prorated based on the number of days worked prior to the date of separation;\n- \u00b7 for those Named Executive Officers initially appointed to a 3M executive position before January 1, 2006, or after December 31, 2017, payment for all previously granted performance shares upon completion of the respective threeyear performance period (prorated to reflect the portion of the year worked only with respect to the performance shares granted in the year of retirement) and based on actual performance; and\n- \u00b7 for those Named Executive Officers initially appointed to a 3M executive position on or after January 1, 2006, and on or before December 31, 2017, payment for all previously granted performance shares upon completion of the respective three-year performance period (prorated to reflect the portion of the three-year performance period completed prior to the date of the Named Executive Officer's retirement) and based on actual performance.\n\nFor this purpose, the term 'Retirement' means a termination of employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with at least 10 years of service (age 55 with at least five years of service for stock options granted before January 1, 2016).",

An eligible employee who becomes entitled to benefits under the Severance Plan receives the following:\n\n- \u00b7 continued payment of his or her annual base salary for a number of months (24 months for the Chief Executive Officer, and 18 months for all other Named Executive Officers);\n- \u00b7 continued payment of annual incentive payments that would have been paid if the participant remained employed through the end of the severance payment period, calculated based on actual results for the relevant year, using the participant's final performance rating as of the end of the applicable year (or if none, a performance rating of 'fully meets expectations' or equivalent), and prorated based on the number of days in the year preceding the end of the severance period (if the severance payment period ends prior to the end of a year); provided, however, that any such annual incentive payment related to the period following the participant's termination of employment will not exceed 100 percent of the prorated target annual incentive compensation opportunity that otherwise would have been in effect for such period if he or she remained employed with the Company;\n- \u00b7 an opportunity to exercise all vested stock options and stock appreciation rights following the participant's termination and prior to the expiration date of such award;\n- \u00b7 accelerated vesting and payment of a prorated portion of the participant's outstanding 'annual' restricted stock units, with proration based on the number of full years of the participant's completed service over the number of years required to vest under the original vesting schedule;\n- \u00b7 outstanding performance share awards will not be forfeited solely as a result of the participant's termination, and the target number of shares under each award will be prorated based on the number of months the participant worked during the applicable performance period;\n- \u00b7 full vesting of the participant's VIP company contribution account; and\n- \u00b7 outplacement services in accordance with 3M's policy.",

        "page_content": "In addition, if Mr. Patolawala voluntarily resigns from employment with the Company for Good Reason or his employment is terminated by the Company other than for Misconduct, he also will be entitled to receive accelerated vesting of certain make-whole and inducement equity awards granted in connection with his commencement of employment, subject to Mr. Patolawala's execution of an effective and irrevocable general release of all claims against the Company and its affiliates and without duplication of any benefits to which he may become entitled under the Severance Plan. These additional benefits are not part of the Severance Plan but were negotiated in connection with Mr. Patolawala's commencement of employment.\n\nAny severance payments under the Severance Plan will reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis (but not below $0) any amounts the participant may otherwise be eligible to receive under his or her non-competition agreement with 3M. In addition, severance payments will cease in the event the participant becomes reemployed by 3M.\n\nThe Severance Plan does not provide severance benefits to employees who terminate pursuant to a mandatory retirement policy adopted by the Board. Employees who terminate in connection with a spinoff, divestiture or similar transaction involving the employee's business unit may be eligible to participate at the discretion of the Company. To be eligible to receive benefits under the Severance Plan, an employee must execute and not revoke a general release of claims in favor of the Company in a form approved by the Company.\n\nIn the event a Named Executive Officer's payments under the Severance Plan would be subject to an excise tax on 'parachute payments' in connection with a change in control of the Company due to the application of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the Named Executive Officer will not be entitled to a 'gross-up.' Instead, the Named Executive Officer's 'parachute payments' may be reduced if such reduction would provide the Named Executive Officer with a greater post-tax benefit than he or she would receive if the excise taxes were to apply.\n\nFor purposes of the Severance Plan and Mr. Patolawala's special equity benefits, the terms 'Misconduct' and 'Good Reason' mean the following:\n\n'Misconduct' means (i) the employee's willful failure to substantially perform his or her duties (other than a failure resulting from his or her disability); (ii) the employee's willful failure to carry out, or comply with any lawful and reasonable directive of the Board or his or her immediate supervisor; (iii) the occurrence of any act or omission by the employee that could reasonably be expected to result in (or has resulted in) his or her conviction, plea of no contest, plea of nolo contendere, or imposition of unadjudicated probation for any felony or indictable offense or crime involving moral turpitude; (iv) the employee's commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, misconduct, or breach of fiduciary duty against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their officers, directors, employees, customers, suppliers, insurers or agents; (v) for purposes of the Severance Plan only, the employee's material breach of any material provision of any written agreement with the Company or any subsidiary; (vi) any action (or inaction) by the employee that 3M reasonably determines constitutes gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duties and responsibilities; or (vii) any other intentional misconduct by the Named Executive Officer that significantly affects the business or affairs of the Company or any subsidiary in an adverse manner.\n\n'Good Reason' means, with respect to a voluntary termination occurring within 18 months following a change in control of the Company, (i) a material diminution in the employee's position, authority, duties or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to the change in control, (ii) a material diminution in the employee's base salary or annual planned cash compensation, or (iii) a material change in the geographic location at which the employee is required to perform services for his or her employer. If the voluntary termination does not occur within 18 months following a change in control, 'Good Reason' means (i) a material diminution in the employee's base salary or annual planned cash compensation, other than an across-the-board reduction that applies to all comparable positions, or (ii) a change in excess of 100 miles in the primary work location at which the employee is required to perform services for his or her employer. For terminations that do not occur within 18 months following a change in control, the employee will be required to provide written notice to the Company of the grounds for a Good Reason termination within 30 days of the initial existence of such grounds, and the Company has 30 days from the date of such notice to cure such circumstances. An employee must terminate employment for Good Reason within 60 days after the first occurrence of the applicable grounds.",

As of December 31, 2022, Mr. Roman, Mr. Lavers, and Mr. Vale were eligible to retire (as that term is defined for purposes of 3M's stock plans). Ms. Poul retired from employment with the Company effective as of July 1, 2022, and became entitled to receive the payments and benefits described under 'Potential payments upon termination or change in control - Rights and payments upon retirement' on page 99 above. She was not eligible to receive, and did not receive, any severance payments or benefits under the Executive Severance Plan or otherwise.",

        "page_content": "FOOTNOTES TO 2022 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL TABLE\n\n- (1) Amounts shown reflect the value of performance share awards (PSAs) under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan for which the three-year performance period has not been completed (adjusted to reflect the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 30, 2022 ($119.92)), and which would be paid upon the occurrence of the respective triggering events in accordance with the terms of the awards.\n- (2) Amounts shown reflect the value of the shares underlying the unvested 3M restricted stock units that would vest upon the occurrence of the respective triggering events in accordance with the terms of the awards. Share values are based on the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 30, 2022 ($119.92).\n- (3) Amounts shown reflect the intrinsic value on December 31, 2022, of unvested, in-the-money 3M stock options that will vest upon the occurrence of the respective triggering events in accordance with the existing contractual terms of the stock options. Intrinsic values are based on the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 30, 2022 ($119.92).\n- (4) Amounts shown reflect the group term life insurance proceeds that would be payable to each individual's beneficiary or beneficiaries pursuant to the policies obtained for them under the Executive Life Insurance Plan.\n\n## Pay ratio\n\nPresented below is the ratio of annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our CEO) for 2022. The ratio reflects a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.\n\nIn identifying our median employee (a full-time production employee in the Midwestern United States), we calculated the target annual Total Cash Compensation of each employee as of December 31, 2022. For these purposes, annual Total Cash Compensation included base salary or hourly wages, cash incentives, commissions, and comparable cash elements of compensation in non-U.S. jurisdictions and was calculated using internal human resources records. All amounts were annualized for permanent employees who did not work for the entire year, such as new hires, employees on paid or unpaid leave of absence and employees called for active military duty. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation.\n\nWe selected the median employee from among 93,001 full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal workers who were employed as of December 31, 2022. We did not exclude any employees (whether pursuant to the de minimis exemption for foreign employees or any other permitted exclusion) when making this determination.\n\nAs determined in accordance with Item 402 of Regulation S-K, the 2022 annual total compensation was $14,031,387 for our CEO and $70,905 for our median employee. Among other things, these amounts include base salary, overtime, incentive payments, stock-based compensation (based on the grant date fair value of awards granted during 2022), changes in pension values and retirement plan contributions. As calculated in this manner, the ratio of our CEO's total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal year 2022 is 198 to 1.\n\n## Pay versus performance disclosure\n\nProvided below is the Company's 'pay versus performance' disclosure as required pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. We have included:\n\n- \u00b7 A tabular list of the most important financial performance measures used by our Compensation and Talent Committee in setting performance-based compensation in 2022;\n- \u00b7 A table that compares the total compensation of our named executive officers (NEOs) as presented in the Summary Compensation Table (SCT) to 'compensation actually paid' as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (CAP) and that compares CAP to specified performance measures; and\n- \u00b7 Graphs that describe:\n- -the relationship between our total shareholder return (TSR) and the TSR of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Peer Group TSR); and\n- -the relationships between CAP and our cumulative TSR, GAAP Net Income, and our company selected measure, Organic Sales Growth.\n\nCAP, like total compensation disclosed in the SCT, does not necessarily reflect value actually realized by the executives or how our Committee evaluates compensation decisions in light of Company or individual performance. In particular, our Committee has not used CAP as a basis for making compensation decisions, nor does it use GAAP Net Income or Peer Group TSR for purposes of determining incentive compensation. In addition, a significant portion of the CAP amounts shown relate to changes in values of unvested awards over the course of the reporting year. These unvested awards remain subject to significant risk from forfeiture conditions and possible future declines in value based on changes in our stock price.

The ultimate values actually realized by our NEOs from unvested equity awards, if any, will not be determined until the awards fully vest and are settled (or exercised). Please refer to the CD&A for a discussion of our executive compensation program objectives and the ways in which we align executive compensation pay with performance.\n\nSalary, bonus, non-equity incentive plan compensation, nonqualified deferred compensation earnings, and all other compensation are each calculated in the same manner for purposes of both CAP and SCT. For 3M, there are two primary differences between the calculation of CAP and SCT total compensation:\n\n|                         | SCT Total                                                                  | CAP                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pension                 | Year over  year change in the actuarial  present value of pension benefits | Current year service cost and any   change in prior  year service cost (if   a plan amendment occurred during  the year)                                             |\n| Stock and Option Awards | Grant date fair  value of stock and  option awards granted during the year | Year over  year change in the fair  value  of stock and option awards that are  unvested as of  the end of  the year, or   vested or  were forfeited during the year |\n\nMetrics Used for Linking Pay and Performance. The following is a list of financial performance measures, which in our assessment represent the most important performance measures used by the Company to link compensation actually paid to the NEOs for 2022. Each metric below is used for purposes of determining payouts under either our annual incentive program or vesting of our performance share awards. The measures in this table are not ranked. Please see the CD&A for a further description of these metrics and how they are used in the Company's executive compensation program.\n\n- \u00b7 Local Currency Sales\n- \u00b7 Operating Income\n- \u00b7 Operating Cash Flow Conversion\n- \u00b7 Earnings Per Share Growth\n- \u00b7 Relative Organic Sales Growth\n- \u00b7 Return on Invested Capital\n- \u00b7 Free Cash Flow Conversion\n\nOrganic Sales Growth is considered an important top-line measure that supports long-term shareholder value creation. For this reason, the Compensation and Talent Committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, chose Organic Sales Growth as the foundation for the relative metric used to calculate one-third of the payout opportunity for the 2022 performance share awards granted to the Company's executives, which comprise 50 percent of the annual long-term incentive compensation opportunity each executive received in 2022. While Organic Sales Growth is being used as the Company-selected measure included in the tabular disclosure above and the table and graphs that follow, it may not have been the most important financial performance measure for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, and the most important financial performance measure used in future years may be different.\n\nPay Versus Performance Table. Provided below is tabular compensation data for the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (our Principal Executive Officer) and our NEOs other than the CEO for 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n\n|      |                 | All amounts in U.S. dollars   |                 |                  | Value of Initial Fixed $100  Investment Based on:   | Value of Initial Fixed $100  Investment Based on:   |         |                |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|\n| (a)  | (b)             | (c)                           | (d)             | (e)              | (f)                                                 | (g)                                                 | (h)     | (i)            |\n|      |                 |                               | Average         |                  |                                                     |                                                     |         | Company        |\n|      | Summary         |                               | Summary         | Average          |                                                     | Peer Group                                          |         | Selected       |\n|      | Compensation    | Compensation                  | Compensation    | Compensation     | Total                                               | Total                                               | GAAPNet | Measure:       |\n|      | Table Total for | Actually Paid                 | Table Total for | Actually Paid to | Shareholder                                         | Shareholder                                         | Income  | Organic  Sales |\n| Year | CEO (1)         | to CEO (2)                    | Other NEOs (1)  | Other NEOs (2)   | Return                                              | Return (3)                                          | ($mil.) | Growth (4)     |\n| 2022 | 14,031,387      | 152,482                       | 5,325,306       | 1,854,462        | 75.89                                               | 123.60                                              | 5,777   | 1.2%           |\n| 2021 | 18,200,584      | 18,438,692                    | 5,518,734       | 3,545,107        | 107.80                                              | 132.71                                              | 5,921   | 8.8%           |\n| 2020 | 20,700,347      | 15,704,765                    | 5,810,620       | 2,335,315        | 102.79                                              | 109.72                                              | 5,384   | -1.7%          |",

Stock Compensation. The fair value of unvested time-based share awards, as well as the fair value of all share-based awards upon vesting, is based upon the closing price for a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for the applicable date of measurement. The fair value of unvested performance share awards is based upon the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions at the time of measurement. The fair value of unvested options, and the fair value received upon the vesting of stock options, is based upon the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as of the date of measurement, consistent with the stock option valuation model used to determine amounts reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n- (3) Reflects total shareholder return indexed to $100 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index, which is an industry line peer group reported in the performance graph included in the Company's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and assuming reinvestment of all dividends, where applicable.\n- (4) Please see Appendix B for a definition of Organic Sales Growth. Values shown reflect Organic Sales Growth as calculated for purposes of our executive compensation program for the applicable reporting year.",

You are receiving a Proxy Statement because you own shares of 3M common stock that entitle you to vote at the meeting. By use of a proxy you can vote, whether or not you attend the meeting. The Proxy Statement describes the matters we would like you to vote on and provides information on those matters so you can make an informed decision.\n\nThe information included in this Proxy Statement relates to proposals to be voted on at the meeting (if properly presented), the voting process, 3M's Board and Board committees, the compensation of directors and certain executive officers, and other required information.\n\n## Purpose of the Annual Meeting\n\nThe purpose of the Annual Meeting is to elect the directors identified in this Proxy Statement and to conduct the business described in the Notice of Annual Meeting.\n\n## Participating in the virtual Annual Meeting\n\n## How do I attend the 2023 virtual Annual Meeting?\n\nIf you are a holder of 3M common stock as of the close of business on March 14, 2023, the record date, you or your proxy holder may participate, vote, submit questions, and examine a list of shareholders of record via www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MMM2023 by entering your 16-digit control number.

If you are a record date shareholder with a 16-digit control number, you may submit questions both in advance of and during the meeting. If you wish to submit a question in advance of the meeting, you may use your 16-digit control number to access www.proxyvote.com . Questions may also be submitted shortly before or during the meeting, by logging into the virtual meeting platform at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MMM2023 , select the 'Q&A' button and type your questions into the 'Submit a Question' field, and click 'Submit.' Questions relevant to meeting matters will be answered during the meeting, subject to time constraints. To allow us to address questions from as many shareholders as possible, each shareholder will be limited to two questions. Questions from multiple shareholders on the same topic or relating to the same topic may be grouped, summarized, and answered together. We ask that all shareholders provide their name and contact details when submitting questions through the virtual meeting platform, so that we may address any individual concerns or follow up matters directly. Responses to questions relevant to meeting matters that we do not have time to respond to during the meeting will be posted to our Investor Relations website at https://investors.3M.com as soon as practicable after the meeting. Questions regarding personal matters or matters not relevant to meeting matters will not be answered. Please refer to the Rules of Conduct and Procedures for the shareholder meeting that will be posted on the meeting website.\n\n## Information about the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials\n\n## Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of the Proxy Materials and not the printed proxy materials?\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission allows companies to furnish their proxy materials to shareholders over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing to many of our shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. In addition, we are providing the notice and proxy materials by e-mail to some of our shareholders who previously consented to electronic delivery of proxy materials. Those shareholders should have received an e-mail containing a link to the website where the proxy materials are available, as well as a link to the proxy voting website. All shareholders receiving the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and to request to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found in the notice. In addition, the notice contains instructions on how you may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or to access them electronically in connection with future distributions of proxy materials. Distributing proxy materials electronically conserves natural resources and reduces the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials.\n\n## Why did I receive a printed copy of the proxy materials and not the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?\n\nWe are providing some of our shareholders, including shareholders who have previously requested to receive paper copies of the proxy materials, with paper copies of the proxy materials instead of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.\n\n## How do I view the proxy materials online?\n\nGo to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions to view the materials. You will need to provide the control number printed in the box marked by the arrow located on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (see example below - the information in the box is an example only - your number will be different and is unique to you).\n\n1234 5678 9012 3456",

If you choose to access future proxy materials electronically, you will receive an e-mail with instructions containing a link to the website where those materials are available and a link to the proxy voting website. Your election to access proxy materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it.\n\nPlease note that you MAY NOT USE your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to vote your shares; it is NOT a form for voting. If you return the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in an attempt to vote your shares, that vote will not count.\n\nFor more information about the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, please visit: www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxymatters/e-proxy.shtml.\n\n## Shareholders entitled to vote\n\nEach share of our common stock outstanding as of the close of business on March 14, 2023, the record date, is entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting on each matter properly brought before the meeting. As of that date, there were 551,468,878 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.\n\nMost 3M shareholders hold their shares through a broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee (which for simplicity we refer to as a 'broker or other nominee') rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially:\n\n## Shareholder of Record\n\n## Beneficial Owner\n\nIf  your shares are registered directly in your name with 3M's transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered the shareholder of record of  those shares and the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or if  you requested paper delivery, a copy of  these proxy materials are being sent directly  to you by 3M. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your  voting proxy directly  to 3M or  to vote electronically at the meeting. You may also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under  the heading 'Voting methods.'\n\nIf  your shares are held by a broker or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by  your broker or other nominee who is considered the shareholder of record of  those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other nominee on how  to vote and are also invited to attend the meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares electronically at the meeting, unless you obtain a legal proxy  from the broker or other nominee. Your broker or other nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting instruction card for  you to use. You may also vote on the Internet or by  telephone, as described in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under  the heading 'Voting methods.' If  you fail to provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee, it will have discretion to vote your shares with respect to Proposal 2, but not with respect to Proposals 1, 3, and 4 as described below under 'Voting requirements to elect directors and approve each of  the proposals described in this Proxy Statement.'",

Participants in 3M's Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or  the 3M Savings Plan may direct the trustee on how  to vote the shares allocated to their account via the Internet, by  telephone, or by signing and submitting the proxy card as described in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under  the heading 'Voting methods.' Participants in 3M's Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or  the 3M Savings Plan may also direct the trustee how  to vote a proportionate number of allocated shares of common stock for  which it has not received direction by  following the same voting instructions.

If you hold shares beneficially in street name, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker or other nominee or electronically at the Annual Meeting by requesting a legal proxy from your broker or other nominee. If you own shares beneficially as a participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to the trustee. In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.\n\nPlease refer to the summary instructions below and those included on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card or, for shares held in street name, the voting instruction card provided by your broker or other nominee.\n\nThe Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareholders by use of a control number and to allow you to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote by telephone or on the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card.

        "page_content": "## Changing your vote\n\nYou may change your proxy voting instructions at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting. You may enter a new vote by using the Internet or the telephone or by mailing a new proxy card or new voting instruction card bearing a later date (which will automatically revoke your earlier voting instructions), so long as the new vote is received before the deadlines described above under the heading 'Voting methods.' You may also change your vote by granting a new proxy or by voting electronically at the virtual Annual Meeting.\n\n## Counting the vote\n\nIn the election of directors, you may vote 'FOR' or 'AGAINST' one or more of the nominees or you may 'ABSTAIN.' Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. For Proposals 2 and 3, you may vote 'FOR,' 'AGAINST,' or 'ABSTAIN,' but please note that abstentions will have the same effect as a vote 'AGAINST.' Proposal 4, with multiple choices, is subject to a plurality vote standard. If you sign your proxy card or broker voting instruction card but provide no voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. Shares held in your account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan will be voted by the trustee as described in 'Shareholders entitled to vote' beginning on page 112.\n\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes and act as the inspectors of election.\n\n## Confidentiality\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors has a policy that all shareholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify shareholders are to be maintained in confidence. No such document will be available for examination, and the identity and vote of any shareholder will not be disclosed, except as necessary to meet legal requirements and allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of the shareholder vote. The policy also provides that inspectors of election for shareholder votes must be independent and cannot be employees of the Company. Occasionally, shareholders provide written comments on their proxy card that may be forwarded to 3M management.\n\n## Results of the vote\n\nWe will issue a press release announcing the preliminary voting results for items of business properly presented at the meeting and will disclose the results for those items in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days of the Annual Meeting date. The press release with voting results will also be available on our website at www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.jhtml .\n\n## Delivery of documents to shareholders sharing an address\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission rules allow us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to any household not participating in electronic proxy material delivery at which two or more shareholders reside, if we believe the shareholders are members of the same family (a practice called 'householding'). We believe that householding benefits both you and the Company by eliminating duplicate mailings to shareholders living at the same address and by reducing our printing and mailing costs. Each shareholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card.\n\nYour household may have received a single set of proxy materials this year. If you prefer to receive your own copy now or in future years, please request a duplicate set by calling 1-800-579-1639, by going to www.proxyvote.com , by e-mailing sendmaterial@proxyvote.com, or by writing to 3M Company, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Alternatively, if your household received multiple sets of proxy materials this year, and members of your household who are entitled to receive proxy materials would all prefer to receive only a single set of proxy materials, you may submit such a request as specified in the preceding sentence.\n\nIf a broker or other nominee holds your shares, you may continue to receive some duplicate mailings. Certain brokers will eliminate duplicate account mailings by allowing shareholders to consent to such elimination, or through implied consent if a shareholder does not request continuation of duplicate mailings. Since not all brokers and nominees may offer shareholders the opportunity this year to eliminate duplicate mailings, you may need to contact your broker or other nominee directly to discontinue duplicate mailings to your household.",

The list also will be available for ten days prior to the meeting during normal business hours at 3M Center, St. Paul, MN 55144, by contacting the Secretary of the Company.\n\n## Cost of proxy solicitation\n\n3M will pay for the cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing, and distributing these proxy materials. You will need to obtain your own Internet access if you choose to access the proxy materials and/or vote over the Internet. In addition to mailing these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by telephone, or by electronic communication by our directors, officers, and employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for these solicitation activities. We have hired Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of votes. We will pay Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. a fee of $24,200 plus expenses for these services. We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to beneficial owners of stock.\n\n## Transfer agent\n\nOur  transfer agent is EQ Shareowner Services. All communications concerning shareholders of record accounts, including address changes, name changes, common stock transfer requirements, and similar issues can be handled by contacting EQ Shareowner Services at 1-800-401-1952 (U.S.), 651-450-4064 (outside the U.S.), www.shareowneronline.com or in writing, P.O. Box 64854, St. Paul, MN 55164-0854.\n\n## Requirements for submission of shareholder proposals for next year's Annual Meeting\n\nIn order for a shareholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in 3M's Proxy Statement for next year's Annual Meeting, our Corporate Secretary must receive the proposal by November 23, 2023. Such proposals must be sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the shareholder to determine when the proposal was received by the Company) to: Michael M. Dai, Vice President, Associate General Counsel and Secretary, 3M Company, 3M Center, Building 220-9E-02, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000. Such proposals must comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulations regarding the inclusion of shareholder proposals in Company sponsored proxy materials, such as the shareholder continuing to own a minimum number of shares until the Annual Meeting and appearing or having an authorized representative appear at the meeting to present the proposal.\n\nAlternatively, shareholders intending to present a proposal at next year's Annual Meeting without having it included in the Company's Proxy Statement must comply with the requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws, a copy of which is available at www.3M.com under Investor Relations - Governance. Our Bylaws require, among other things, that our Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the shareholder no earlier than the close of business on November 23, 2023, and no later than the close of business on December 23, 2023. The notice must contain the information required by our Bylaws.\n\nProposals received by the Corporate Secretary after the dates mentioned will not be included in the Proxy Statement or acted upon at next year's Annual Meeting.\n\nBy order of the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichael M.

Operating income, net income attributable to 3M, and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders (hereafter referred to as 'earnings per diluted share') are all measures for  which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure (excluding special items). Free cash flow (FCF) growth (FCF percentage change), FCF Conversion, Return on Invested Capital, and Operating Cash Flow Conversion all adjusted for special items are nonGAAP measures that the Company believes are meaningful in measuring the payouts for its compensation plans. These measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of  the Company's ongoing operations. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly  titled measures used by other companies and the adjusted amounts for compensation purposes included in this section, may differ  from the adjusted amounts included in the Company's Form 10-K. Note 2020 financial results provided below are for  the 2020 financial results before the pension accounting change in the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in the restatement of 2020 amounts in 2021, however, since the 2020 compensation plans were measured using the original 2020 results, these amounts are presented below. See footnote (f) below  for  further discussion of  the pension accounting change.\n\nThe reconciliations provided below reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Performance share award metrics:\n\n## Adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP measure)\n\n|                                                   | 2022                    | 2022                                                         | 2022                                                       | 2022                                                         | 2022                                    | 2022                                         | 2022                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions, except per   share amounts) | Reported GAAP   Measure | Adjustment  for Significant  Litigation  Related  Charges(a) | Food Safety   Divestiture, net  of Restructuring  Items(b) | Adjustment  for Health  Care Business  Divestiture  Costs(c) | Adjustment  for Russia Exit  Charges(d) | Adjustment  for PFAS  manufacturing  exit(e) | Adjusted Non- GAAP Measure |\n| Net income attributable to 3M                     | $ 5,777                 | $ 1,815                                                      | $ (2,648)                                                  | $ 42                                                         | $ 111                                   | $ 638                                        | $ 5,735                    |\n| Earnings per diluted share                        | $ 10.18                 | $ 3.20                                                       | $ (4.67)                                                   | $ 0.07                                                       | $ 0.20                                  | $ 1.12                                       | $ 10.10                    |\n| Earnings per diluted share                        | 0.6%                    |                                                              |                                                            |                                                              |                                         |                                              | -0.2%                      |\n\n|                                                 | 2021                       | 2020                       | 2020                                                        | 2020                                                              | 2020                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) | Reported GAAP   Measure(f) | Reported GAAP   Measure(f) | Adjustment  for Significant  Litigation Related  Charges(a) | DDSD & Adv   Ballistic Sale Gain,  net of Restructuring  Items(g) | Adjusted Non- GAAP Measure |\n| Net income attributable to 3M                   | $ 5,921                    | $ 5,384                    | $ (39)                                                      | $ (257)                                                           | $ 5,088                    |\n| Earnings per diluted share                      | $ 10.12                    | $ 9.25                     | $(0.07)                                                     | $(0.44)                                                           | $ 8.74                     |\n| Earnings per diluted share percent  change      | 14.4%                      | 18.4%                      |                                                             |                                                                   | -5.7%                      |",

        "page_content": "- (a) Net costs for significant litigation relate to 3M's respirator mask/asbestos, PFAS-related other environmental, and Combat Arms Earplugs matters (as discussed in Note 16 to 3M Company's Form 10-K). Net costs include the impacts of any changes in accrued liabilities, external legal fees, and insurance recoveries, along with associated tax impacts. In 2020, 3M recorded a net pre-tax charge of $17 million ($13 million after tax) related to PFAS matters. The charge was more than offset by a reduction in tax expense of $52 million related to the resolution of tax treatment with authorities regarding the previously disclosed 2018 agreement reached with the State of Minnesota that resolved the Natural Resources Damages lawsuit. These items, in aggregate, resulted in a $39 million after tax benefit.\n- (b) In 2022, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion ($2.7 billion after tax) related to the split-off and combination of its Food Safety business with Neogen Corporation. Refer to Note 3 to 3M Company's Form 10-K for further details. Also in 2022, following the split-off of the Food Safety business, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions addressing corporate functional costs across 3M in relation to the magnitude of amounts previously allocated to the divested businesses. Refer to Note 5 to 3M Company's Form 10-K for further details.\n- (c) Health Care Business Divestiture Costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\n- (d) In 2022, 3M recorded a charge primarily related to impairment of net assets in Russia in connection with management's committed exit and disposal plan. Refer to Note 15 to 3M Company's Form 10-K for further details.\n- (e) PFAS manufacturing exit amounts relate to 3M's December 2022 commitment to a plan to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. Charges for the applicable period relate to asset impairments. Refer to Note 15 to 3M Company's Form 10-K for further details.\n- (f) In the first quarter of 2021, 3M changed the method it uses to calculate the market-related value of fixed income securities included in its pension and other post-retirement plan assets. This change was applied retrospectively to all periods presented within 3M's financial statements. The change did not impact consolidated operating income or net cash provided by operating activities but did impact the previously reported portion of pension and post-retirement net periodic benefit cost (benefit) that was included within non-operating other expense (income) along with related consolidated income items such as net income and earnings per share. The 2020 restatement increased 2020 net income by $65 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.11. This increases the 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share from $8.74 to $8.85 on a restated basis. The diluted earnings per share of $8.85 is the base amount for calculating the 14.4% earnings per diluted share percent increase in 2021. The net income amounts for 2020 are not adjusted in the tables above in order to reflect the financial results used for measurements of the 2020 performance periods.\n- (g) In the first quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2 million ($1 million loss after tax) related to the sale of its advanced ballistic protection business and recognition of certain contingent consideration. In the second quarter of 2020, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $387 million ($304 million after tax) related to the sale of its drug delivery business. In the second quarter of 2020, following the divestiture of substantially all of the drug delivery business, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions addressing corporate functional costs and manufacturing footprint across 3M in relation to the magnitude of amounts previously allocated/burdened to the divested business. As a result, 3M recorded a second quarter 2020 pre-tax charge of $55 million ($46 million after tax) and made a subsequent immaterial adjustment thereto.\n- (h) During 2022, 2021, and 2020, 3M made payments related to previously adjusted items for PFAS (certain perfluorinated compounds) matters, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the restructuring actions related to the drug delivery business divestiture.\n- (i) Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under GAAP. Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Cash payments associated with special items in the determination of adjusted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities are reflected net of applicable tax using the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate during the period of payment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash.\n- (j) Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under GAAP. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation.\n- (k) Operating cash flow conversion is not defined under GAAP. Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Cash payments associated with special items in the determination of adjusted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities are reflected net of applicable tax using the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate during the period of payment. The Company defines operating cash flow conversion as operating cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M.",
