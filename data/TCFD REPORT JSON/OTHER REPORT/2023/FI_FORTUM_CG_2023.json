        "page_content": "## Governance 2023\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement 2023\n\nCorporate governance at Fortum is based on Finnish laws and the company's Articles of Association. Fortum fully complies with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020. The corporate governance statement is issued separately from the operating and financial review, and it has been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee of Fortum Board of Directors.\n\nFortum Corporation ('Fortum' or the 'company') has been listed on Nasdaq Helsinki stock exchange since 1998. Fortum's industrial sector according to the Global Industry Classification Standard is Electric Utilities. The State of Finland through the Ownership Steering Department of the Prime Minister's Office of the Finnish Government is the majority owner in Fortum with a total of 51.26% of the shares as on 31 December 2023.\n\nFortum prepares the consolidated financial statements and interim reports in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, the Finnish Securities Markets Act, as well as the applicable Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines and Nasdaq Helsinki rules.\n\nThe company's operating and financial review and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act, Accounting Act, Securities Markets Act, EU Taxonomy Regulation, and the opinions and guidelines of the Finnish Accounting Board. The consolidated financial statements are also published in accordance with the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) reporting requirement. The company's external auditor, Deloitte Oy, has provided an independent auditor's reasonable assurance report on Fortum's ESEF financial statements in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised). The auditor's report covers the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.\n\nThe Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020 is available on the website of the Securities Market Association at 4 www.cgfinland.fi .\n\n## Governing bodies of Fortum\n\nThe decision-making bodies managing and overseeing Fortum's administration and operations are the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors with its Audit and Risk Committee, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Technology and Investment Committee, and the President and CEO, supported by the Fortum Leadership Team.\n\nFurther, Fortum has an informal Advisory Council consisting of representatives of Fortum's different key stakeholder groups as invited by the Board of Directors. The Advisory Council aims at maintaining and furthering the dialogue with Fortum's key stakeholders to advance Fortum's interests, brand and reputation. In 2023, the Advisory Council consisted of 15 representatives of Fortum's different stakeholder groups, including three employee representatives.\n\n## Governing bodies of Fortum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy and operations, the highest level of decision-making on sustainability and climate-related matters is with the Board of Directors. Therefore, Fortum has not established a specific Sustainability Committee for the decision-making on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters. The Audit and Risk Committee, the Technology and Investment Committee, members of the Fortum Leadership Team, and other senior executives support the Board of Directors in the decision-making in these matters.\n\n## Major changes in Group structure in 2023\n\n## New business structure\n\nIn March 2023, Fortum launched its new strategy and simultaneously reorganised its operating structure. The target of the new organisation is successful implementation of the company's purpose and strategy. The new business structure mirrors the key value drivers in Fortum's main business; reliable clean power generation based on strong sales and trading capabilities as well as customer orientation to drive decarbonisation.\n\nFortum's business units and enabling functions since March 2023 are:\n\n## Hydro Generation\n\nThe Hydro Generation business unit is responsible for operating, maintaining and developing Fortum's 4.7 gigawatt (GW) hydropower assets. The unit's key value drivers include safe operations and the ability to optimise and increase the assets' flexibility and availability.",

        "page_content": "## Governance 2023\n\n## Nuclear Generation\n\nThe Nuclear Generation business unit operates, maintains and develops Fortum's fully-owned Loviisa nuclear power plant, and it manages Fortum's ownership in the co-owned nuclear assets in Finland and Sweden, 3.2 GW in total. The business has significant in-house engineering competencies and it also offers expert services that cover the whole lifecycle of nuclear power plants, from newbuilds to decommissioning and final disposal of nuclear waste.\n\n## Renewables and Decarbonisation\n\nThe Renewables and Decarbonisation business unit is responsible for driving growth in wind and solar power business through project development and execution. The unit is also responsible for Fortum's district heating and cooling business and the decarbonisation of heat production assets. Furthermore, the business unit explores projects in clean hydrogen in the Nordics.\n\n## Corporate Customers and Markets\n\nThe Corporate Customers and Markets business unit is responsible for hedging and value creation in both physical and financial power markets, locking in revenues for Fortum's power generation and managing the supply for the Consumer Solutions unit. The unit also serves as the customer interface for large industrial customers and thereby pursues long-term value through power demand creation in the Nordic market.\n\n## Consumer Solutions\n\nThe Consumer Solutions business unit is responsible for offering energy solutions to consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises predominantly in the Nordics and Poland, including customer service and invoicing services. With its over two million customers, Fortum is the largest energy solution provider in the Nordics.\n\n## Circular Solutions\n\nThe Circular Solutions business unit is responsible for operating, maintaining and developing Fortum's recycling and waste assets. These businesses are\n\nnot in the core of Fortum's new strategy. In August 2023, Fortum announced that it had decided to assess strategic options, including potential divestments, of its Circular Solutions businesses.\n\n## Enabling functions\n\nFortum's enabling functions are Finance, Sustainability and Corporate Relations, People and Procurement, Legal, and Transformation and IT.\n\n## Russia\n\nThe Russia segment consisting of Fortum's Russian operations was fully deconsolidated in the second quarter of 2023 and has since been reported as discontinued operations. In April, the Russian authorities seized control of Fortum's assets in Russia and Fortum lost control of PAO Fortum, which triggered full impairments and deconsolidation of the company's Russian assets in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n## Launch of the new strategy\n\nAt the beginning of March 2023, following the decision to pursue a controlled exit from Russia, Fortum's Board of Directors resolved on the new strategy. In accordance with the strategy, Fortum's strategic priorities are to deliver reliable clean energy and drive decarbonisation in industries in the Nordics.\n\nThe financial and sustainability targets are as follows: \u00b7 Updated financial guidance to ensure a credit rating of at least BBB and optimal financial flexibility for future growth with long-term financial net debt-tocomparable EBITDA of 2.0-2.5 times;\n\n- \u00b7 Disciplined growth in clean energy with capital expenditure of up to EUR 1.0 billion during 2023-2025. Investment hurdles of project WACC + 150-400 basis points will be applied and evaluated against the company's climate and biodiversity targets;\n- \u00b7 Renewed dividend policy with a payout ratio of 60-90% of comparable EPS;\n- \u00b7 Tightened environmental and decarbonisation ambitions with updated targets to reach carbon\n\nneutrality already by 2030, exit coal by the end of 2027, a target for specific emissions and commitment to SBTi (1.5 \u00b0C) and biodiversity targets.\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nThe General Meeting of Shareholders is the highest decisionmaking body of Fortum. Every shareholder has the right to participate in the General Meeting, to propose items to be included in the agenda of the General Meeting and to exercise his/her power of decision in the matters belonging to the General Meeting by law, as stipulated in the Finnish Companies Act.\n\nEach share entitles to one vote. In accordance with the Finnish Companies Act, a shareholder also has the right to ask questions concerning the matters discussed at the General Meeting of Shareholders. By the end of each financial year, Fortum discloses the date by which a shareholder may propose items to be included on the agenda of the following Annual General Meeting on its Annual General Meeting website.\n\nThe resolutions at the General Meeting of Shareholders are primarily made by a simple majority of votes. Such resolutions include, for example, resolutions on the adoption of the financial statements, payment of dividend, on discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability, election of members of the Board of Directors and the external auditor, and the resolution on their remuneration.\n\nIn accordance with Fortum's Articles of Association and the Finnish Companies Act, a notice to convene the General Meeting of Shareholders is issued by the Board of Directors. The notice is delivered no earlier than three months and no later than three weeks before the date of the General Meeting of Shareholders by publishing the notice on the company's website. The Annual General Meeting shall be held once a year, in June at the latest.\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders shall be held whenever the Board of Directors deems it necessary or when it is otherwise required by law to convene such a meeting.",

In addition, the board composition shall include both genders.

The Shareholders' Nomination Board has deemed that the current board composition and the board member candidates proposed to be elected by the Annual General Meeting 2024 possess all the competences defined in the diversity principles in a well-balanced manner.\n\nThe proposal for the board members for the Annual General Meeting 2024 consists of 3 women and 6 men.
