These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent only the Bank's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside the Bank's control. The words 'anticipate', 'believe', 'estimate', 'expect', 'intend', 'plan', 'predict', 'target', 'forecast', 'guideline', 'should', 'project' and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. It is possible that the Bank's actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nInformation regarding important factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those in the Bank's  forward-looking  statements  appear  in  a  number  of  places  in  this  Annual  Report,  including  in  Item  3.  'Key Information - D. Risk Factors' and Item 5. 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects'. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) changes in general economic, business, political, social, fiscal or other conditions in Colombia, or in any of the other countries where the Bank operates; taking into account (A) economic challenges persisting due to high levels of inflation globally driven in part by supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions such as the continuing armed conflict in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, which pose potential impacts such as higher prices for energy raw materials and agricultural items, among others; and (B) an ambitious legal reform agenda that the government  of Colombia is implementing; (ii) changes in capital markets or in markets in general that may affect policies, overall liquidity or attitudes towards lending; (iii) unanticipated increases in financing and other costs or the inability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on attractive terms; (iv) prolonged inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and unemployment rates; (v) sovereign risks; (vi) liquidity risks; (vii) increases in delinquencies by the Bank's borrowers; (viii) lack of acceptance of new products or services by the Bank's targeted customers; (ix) competition in the banking,  financial  services,  credit  card  services,  insurance,  asset management  or  remittances  businesses  or  other industries in which the Bank operates; (x) adverse determination of legal or regulatory disputes or proceedings and the consequences                     thereof; (xi) changes in official policies, regulations and the Colombian government's banking policy as well as changes in laws, regulations or policies in other jurisdictions in which the Bank does business; (xii) factors specific to the Bank, including changes to the estimates and assumptions underlying our financial statements; our success in identifying risks (such as the incidence of loan delinquencies) and managing risks; our inability to achieve our financial and capital targets, which may result in failure to achieve any of the expected benefits of our strategies; a reduction in our credit ratings, which would decrease our funding availability; failure to achieve regulatory stress testing; and changes to the reliability and security of our data management, data privacy, information and technology infrastructure, including cyber-attack threats which may impact our ability to serve clients; and (xiii) failure to attract, hire or retain key talent.\n\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are subject to change, and, except as required by law, the Bank does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events arising after the date of this Annual Report.",

Accordingly, a slowdown in the economic growth rate, periods of negative growth, increases in inflation, changes in economic  policy,  or  future  judicial  interpretations  of  policies  involving  exchange  controls  and  other  matters  such  as currency depreciation, interest rates, taxation, banking laws and regulations, and other political or economic developments in such jurisdictions may affect the overall business environment and may, in turn, negatively affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn particular, the governments of Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala have historically exercised substantial influence on their economies, and in the future, they may implement decisions that could impact the business and results of companies in such countries (including the Bank), market conditions, and prices and rates of return on securities of local  issuers  (including  the  Bank's  securities).  Potential  changes  in  laws,  public  policies  and  regulations  may  cause instability in Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala, and their respective markets.\n\nThe evolution of government policies and polarization could adversely affect the financial and commercial condition of the Bank and the market value of its securities. Furthermore, it is foreseeable that in the coming years this risk will become more significant, due to the global trend of 'pendulum movement' within the political spectrum in the elections of political leaders in different countries, increasing global tensions, international conflicts, polarization, distrust in governments and growing social discontent, which could increase social protests. This combination of elements could trigger a mediumterm environment in which instability and political risks may be greater than those that have predominated in recent years.\n\nIn Colombia, our expectation is that GDP growth will slow down as the government attempts to reduce inflation to target levels through the current high interest rate policy of the Central Bank. 2024 is expected to be one of the slowest years of GDP growth in the current economic cycle for Colombia after an already weak 2023 (0.6% of annual GDP growth, a figure lower than what is typically considered as representing potential growth capacity). The slowdown in economic growth has resulted and may in the future result in weakening of the labor market and decrease in domestic demand, factors that have impacted and may continue to stress the ability of our customers to meet their financial obligations. Meanwhile, in 2024, the ongoing discussions around the comprehensive reform agenda that the government is implementing (pensions, labor, healthcare, and public services) has and may continue to create uncertainty (including with respect to fiscal sustainability and capital markets) and affect investment and consumer confidence.\n\nOn January 2024, Standard & Poor's revised Colombia's sovereign credit rating outlook from stable to negative, due to concerns  about  low  levels  of  public  and  private  investment  that  could  affect  the  medium-term  growth  capacity  of Colombia's  GDP.  In  the  next  24  months,  there  could  be  another  downgrade  in  Colombia's  sovereign  rating  if  the government does not implement initiatives to boost productive investment or control public finances. While the recent changes in market interest rates that the Government pays on its debt is already higher than what would be reasonable given  its  current  sovereign  rating,  indicating  that  the  market  has  incorporated  the  possibility  of  a  new  credit  rating downgrade, the primary medium-term impact could be a steeper yield curve for sovereign debt. This, in turn, would affect",

The  fiscal  outlook  for  the  country  is uncertain, and although short-term liquidity risks have been addressed with measures adopted by the government in 2023, fiscal pressures may still have negative impacts on public finances. These uncertainties are having negative effects on the country's access to capital markets for financial resources, making it dependent on capital flows from multilateral entities or other countries. Uncertainty also exists with respect to the possibility of the country reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) because of El Salvador maintaining Bitcoin as legal tender, which has led to the deterioration of the relationship between the government and the IMF.\n\nOn the other hand, Guatemala faces significant short-term risk arising from the political environment following the 2023 elections. The president-elect's party is undergoing questioning as to the validity of its constitution as a political party, which could lead to the invalidation of the election results and social mobilizations by the government's supporters. This constitutes a significant risk for the country, as it represents a shift from the traditional political and economic stability that has characterized Guatemala and may disrupt its economy. Additionally, the country continues to face a structural risk due to its high dependence on remittances, primarily from the United States. A weakening of the U.S. labor market could profoundly affect Guatemala's economic growth capacity.\n\nIn Panama, challenges arising from the potential impacts of the tensions between China and the United States and the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East may result in adverse impacts in the medium-term global trade and the flow of trade routes through the Panama Canal, which results in a significant risk to the country's economy. In the short-term, there is uncertainty arising from the dispute between Panama and the operator of Cobre Panama, which could lead to an extended halt of operations. This could have significant implications for the country's trade balance, current accounts, labor market, public finances, and short-term growth rate. In addition, the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon could limit Panama Canal operations during the first half of 2024 if water levels continue to be affected by a period of drought, which could lead to continued restrictions on ships that can access the canal and lower the number of vessels allowed to transit per day. As a result of such phenomenon, the country's income derived from the operation of the Panama Canal would be adversely impacted. In 2024 there will be general elections in Panama and the new government may carry out changes to the country's economic policy approach, which may result in uncertainties which could adversely affect our operations.\n\nRecent polls do not reflect a clear favority candidate, resulting in a high level of uncertainty in this electoral process compared to what is typical for these processes. However, the economic proposals of most of the candidates can be categorized as convential or moderate, so the probability of a profound change in the country's economic policy direction resulting from these elections is low.\n\nThe economies of the countries where the Bank operates are vulnerable to external effects as result of economic difficulties experienced by major regional trading partners or by general contagion effects resulting from economic or geopolitical shocks, which could have a material adverse effect on economic growth in these countries and their ability to service their public debt.\n\nA significant decline in economic growth or a sustained economic downturn of any of Colombia, Panama, El Salvador or Guatemala's major trading partners or countries with close economic ties (i.e., the European Union, the United States, China  and  other  Latin  American  countries  for  Colombia;  and  the  United  States  and  European  Union  for  Panama, Guatemala and El Salvador) could have a material adverse impact on Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala's foreign trade, remittances inflows and foreign direct investment, resulting in lower economic growth.",

Any future tensions may cause political and economic uncertainty, instability, market volatility, low confidence levels and higher risk aversion by investors and market participants that may negatively affect economic activity in any of those jurisdictions.\n\nEvents  occurring  in  a  market  where  we  do  not  operate  may  cause  international  investors  to  have  an  increased  risk perception of an entire region or class of investment, which could in turn negatively affect market prices and liquidity of securities issued or owned by the Bank.\n\nRecent global geopolitical fragmentation poses a greater risk for the countries where the Bank has a presence. This has resulted and may continue to result in a decrease of capital flows towards countries with emerging economies and exert pressure in such countries, leading to a higher level of volatility than what would be considered normal in commodity price behavior, especially for commodities like oil. This situation may impact inflation trends, particularly in El Salvador, Panama, and Guatemala. Conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East can result in additional uncertainty and volatility in international markets, which could negatively affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the global context of economic deceleration and persistently high interest rates, despite expectations of a decrease  in  2024,  creates  an  environment  where  financial  stress  and  the  high  reactivity  of  capital  flows  to  emerging economies can keep financial stress elevated. As a result of this, it is reasonable to expect that debt service payments in government spending budgets will continue to be high from an historical perspective. This combination of low economic growth and, although decreasing, still high interest rates (with greater relevance in Colombia and El Salvador) represents a short-term risk inherent in the economic cycle these countries are experiencing. It requires responsible macroeconomic management by authorities.  In  respect  of  this,  the  primary  challenge  for  Colombia  and  El  Salvador  relates  to  public finances and how adverse risks in this area may play out in 2024 and the subsequent years, due to significant risks to achieving the tax revenues necessary to reliably finance spending goals.\n\n## Colombia  and  El  Salvador  have  experienced  several  periods  of  violence  and  instability  that  could  affect  the economy and the Bank.\n\nColombia has experienced periods of criminal violence over the past five decades, primarily due to the activities of guerilla groups and drug cartels. Colombia is currently implementing the peace treaty signed with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ('Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia' or 'FARC'). There are presently a number of other illegal armed groups in Colombia, such as the National Liberation Army ('Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional' or 'ELN'), among others. Furthermore, the Colombian government has started peace negotiations with several rebel groups throughout the country,  yet  negotiations  are  at  a  very  early  stage.  Notwithstanding  the  implementation  of  these  peace  treaties  and dialogues, the successful integration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society may not be achieved. An escalation of violence or drug-related crime may have a negative impact on the Colombian economy and on the Bank as a result of the  downgrade  of  sovereign  ratings  increasing  the  funding  costs,  discouraging  foreign  investment,  and  leading  to  an economic slowdown.\n\nAdditionally, in El Salvador, the increase in violence led the legislative assembly, to adopt certain exceptional measures on March 27, 2022, conferring some powers to the Executive Power and suspending four constitutional guarantees. The suspension of constitutional guarantees has been extended 22 times, with the most recent suspension occurring from March 12, 2024 to April 10, 2024.\n\n## Any additional taxes resulting from changes to tax regulations or the interpretation thereof in countries where the Bank operates, could adversely affect the Bank's consolidated results.\n\nUncertainty related to tax legislation represents a constant  risk for the Group. Changes in legislation, regulation, and developments resulting from judicial judgments, could affect the Group's tax burdens by increasing tax rates and fees, creating new taxes, limiting deductions and exemptions, and eliminating incentives and non-taxed income.",

Different interpretations of tax regulations could result in future tax audits, litigation, and associated costs, which could negatively affect our results.\n\n## Allegations of corruption against the government, politicians, and the private sector in the countries where we operate could create economic and political uncertainty and could expose us to additional credit risk.\n\nAllegations of corruption against the government, politicians, and the private sector in the countries where we operate could create economic and political uncertainty. For example, findings or convictions of illicit conduct committed by such entities, including government personnel, or alleged wrongdoings, could have adverse effects on the political and economic stability of the countries where the Bank operates. These adverse political and economic effects may negatively impact our business, by depressing business volumes, reducing our ability to recover amounts we have lent to persons or projects involved in illicit or allegedly illicit conduct.\n\n## Risk Factors relating to the Bank's Business and the Banking Industry\n\n## The Bank is subject to credit risk and estimating exposure to credit risk involves subjective and complex judgments.\n\nA number of our products expose the Bank to credit  risk. These products include loans, financial leases, guarantees, financial derivatives and lending commitments.\n\nThe Bank estimates and establishes reserves for credit risk and potential credit losses. This process involves subjective and complex judgments, including projections of economic conditions and assumptions about the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. This process is also subject to human error as the Bank's employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit risk rating to a client, which may result in the Bank's exposure to a higher credit risk than one indicated by the Bank's risk rating system. The Bank may not be able to timely detect these risks before they materialize, or due to limited resources or available infrastructure, the Bank's employees may not be able to effectively implement its credit risk management system, which may increase the Bank's exposure to credit risk. Moreover, the Bank's failure to continuously refine its credit risk management system may result in a higher risk exposure for the Bank, which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.\n\nOverall, if the Bank is unable to effectively control the level of non-performing or poor credit quality loans in the future, or  if  its  loan  loss  reserves  are  insufficient  to  cover  future  loan  losses,  the  Bank's  financial  condition  and  results  of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe amount of the Bank's non-performing loans may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond the Bank's control, such as changes in the income levels of the Bank's borrowers, increases in the inflation rate or an increase in interest rates, the impact of macroeconomic trends and political events affecting Colombia and other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates or has exposure (especially Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala) or events affecting specific industries. Any of these developments could have a negative effect on the quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, requiring the Bank to increase provisions for loan losses resulting in reduced profits or in losses.\n\n## The Bank is subject to risks from concentration in its loan portfolio. Problems with one or more of its largest borrowers may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Bank's 20 largest economic groups, on a consolidated basis, represented 110.9% of the Bank's Tier 1 and 13.4% of the Bank's loan portfolio. No  single group exposure represented more than 1.5% of the loan book. Problems with one or more of the Bank's largest economic groups could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.\n\nThe value of the collateral securing the outstanding principal and interest balance of the Bank's loans may not be sufficient to cover such outstanding principal and interest. In addition, the Bank may be unable to realize the full value of the collateral or guarantees securing the outstanding principal and interest balance of its loans.",

        "page_content": "The Bank's loan collateral primarily includes real estate, owned assets used for financial leasing transactions and other assets that are located primarily in Colombia, El Salvador, Panama and Guatemala, the value of which may significantly fluctuate or decline due to factors beyond the Bank's control. Such factors include market factors, environmental risks, macroeconomic factors and political events affecting the local economy. In addition, the Bank may face  difficulties in enforcing its rights as a secured creditor. Timing delays, procedural problems enforcing collateral and local protectionism may make foreclosures on collateral and enforcement of judgments difficult. Any decline in the value of the collateral securing the Bank's loans may result in a reduction in the recovery from collateral realization and may have an adverse impact on the Bank's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Downgrades in the credit ratings of the Bank and its subsidiaries would increase their cost of borrowing funds and make their ability to raise new funds, attract deposits or renew maturing debt more difficult.\n\nThe credit ratings of Bancolombia and its subsidiaries are an important component of the liquidity profile of the Bank and each of its subsidiaries. The Bank's ability to successfully compete depends on various factors, including the financial stability of each of its entities, as reflected by their credit ratings. A downgrade in the credit ratings of the Bank or its subsidiaries would increase the cost of raising funds from other banks, or in capital markets. Furthermore, purchases of Bancolombia's securities by institutional investors could be reduced if these securities experiment a decline in their credit ratings. The ability of the Bank or its subsidiaries to renew maturing debt could become restricted and the terms for such renewal could become more expensive if their credit ratings were to decline. The Bank's, lenders and counterparties in derivative transactions are also sensitive to the risk of a credit rating downgrade. A downgrade in the credit rating of the Bank or its subsidiaries may adversely affect perception of their financial stability and their ability to raise deposits, which could make each entity less successful when competing for deposits and loans in the marketplace.\n\nIn January 2024, Standard & Poor's revised Colombia's sovereign credit rating outlook from stable to negative, due to concerns  about  low  levels  of  public  and  private  investment  that  could  affect  the  medium-term  growth  capacity  of Colombia's GDP. The agency affirmed its 'BB+' long-term foreign currency and 'BBB-' long-term local currency sovereign credit ratings in Colombia. This revision was followed by a revision by Standard & Poor's of its outlook from stable to negative  for  three  Colombian  commercial  banks  and  subsidiaries  and  for  two  government-owned  banks  (including Bancolombia and its Panama-based subsidiaries, Banistmo S.A. and Bancolombia Panama S.A.). Due to the direct and indirect impacts that sovereign stress can have on banks' business operations and creditworthiness, the agency typically do not rate Colombian financial institutions higher than the foreign currency sovereign ratings.\n\n## The Bank's results of operations are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.\n\nThe  Bank  holds  a  substantial  portfolio  including  loans,  deposits,  securities,  bonds,  long-term  debt  and  short-term borrowings and derivatives as swaps that have both fixed and floating interest rates. Therefore, changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margins as well as the value of the debt instruments. Increases in interest rates may reduce the market value of the Bank's debt instruments, leading to smaller gains or larger losses on these investments (a 100 bps increase in interest rate could reduce the market value of the debt instruments in approximately 1.3%). Sustained high interest rates have historically discouraged customers from borrowing and have resulted in increased delinquencies in outstanding loans and deterioration in the quality of assets. On the other hand, cuts in interest rates may cause margin compression  and  lower  net  interest  income  as  the  Bank  usually  holds  more  assets  than  liabilities  at  variable  rates. Decreasing interest rates also may trigger loan prepayments which could negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. Generally, in a declining interest rate environment, prepayment activity increases, reducing the weighted average maturity of the Bank's interest earning assets and adversely affecting its operating results.\n\nPrepayment risk  also  has  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  the  Bank's  earnings  from  its  credit  card  and  collateralized mortgage obligations, since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these portfolios, which may result in a  mismatch  in  funding  or  in  reinvestment  of  the  prepayment  proceeds  at  lower  yields.  In  addition,  these  risks  could significantly impact the Bank's portfolio as well as portfolios managed by the Bank and owned by third parties. To the extent  we  experience  withdrawals  of  third-party  assets,  our  asset  management  revenues  and  related  income  could  be adversely affected.",

Market risk, or the risk of losses in positions arising from movements in market prices, is inherent in the products and instruments associated with our operations, including securities, bonds, proprietary trading in assets and liabilities and derivatives, among others. Changes in market conditions that may affect our financial condition and results of operations include fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, securities prices, and changes in the implied volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, among others.\n\nThe Bank derives a portion of its profits from its proprietary trading activities. Income from this activity is highly volatile and depends on numerous factors beyond the Bank's control, such as the general market environment, overall market trading activity, interest rate levels, fluctuations in exchange rates, oil prices and general market volatility. A significant decline in the Bank's trading income, or the incurrence of a trading loss, could adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank has significant exposure to sovereign risk, and especially Colombian, United States and Salvadoran, Panama and Guatemala sovereign risk, and the Bank's results could be adversely affected by decreases in the value of its sovereign debt instruments.\n\nThe Bank's debt portfolio is primarily composed of sovereign debt securities. Therefore, the Bank's results are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risk associated with sovereign debt, in particular risk associated with securities issued or guaranteed by the Colombian Government. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank's total debt instruments represented 7.32% of its total assets, and 29.97% of these securities were issued or guaranteed by the Colombian Government, and 8.90% were issued or guaranteed by the El Salvador Government. A significant decline in the value of the securities issued or guaranteed by the Colombian Government could adversely affect the Bank's debt portfolio and consequently the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\nIn addition, during the last year, the sovereign risk associated with the securities issued or guaranteed by the Panama, Guatemala and United States Governments have increased. Its 5-year credit default swap, credit derivative contracts that enable investors to swap credit risk on a company, a country or another entity, showed an increase during 2023 due to political uncertainty in Panama and Guatemala, and the concern about United States government finances and its debt burden. The securities issued or guaranteed by the governments of Panama, Guatemala and United States represented 5.38%, 4.12% and 14.18% of the Bank's total debt instruments, as of December 31, 2023, and a significant decline in the value of these securities could affect the Bank's debt instruments portfolio.\n\n## The Bank is subject to credit risk with respect to its non-traditional banking businesses including investing in securities  and  entering  into  derivatives  transactions.  The  Bank  is  subject  to  market,  liquidity,  operational  and counterparty credit risks associated with its derivative transactions.\n\nNon- traditional sources of credit risk can arise from, among other things: investing in securities, entering into derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to the Bank, executing securities, or currency trades  from  the  Bank's  proprietary  trading  desk  that  fail  to  settle  at  the  required  time  due  to  non-delivery  by  the counterparty  or  system  failures  by  clearing  agents,  exchanges,  clearing  houses  or  other  financial  intermediaries.  A significant increase in exposure to any of these non-traditional risks, or a significant decline in the credit quality or the insolvency of any of the counterparties, could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\nThe Bank enters into derivative transactions for hedging purposes on its own account and for its customers. The Bank is subject to market, liquidity (due to the difficulty in closing out a trade prior to maturity if bid-ask spreads are too large, representing a significant cost) and operational risk associated with these transactions, including basis risk (the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost) and credit or",

In  addition,  the  market  practice  and  documentation  for  derivative  transactions  is  less  developed  in  the jurisdictions where the Bank operates as compared to other more economically developed countries, and the court systems in such jurisdictions have limited experience in dealing with issues related to derivative transactions. As a result, there are increased operating and structural risks associated with derivatives transactions in these jurisdictions.\n\nIn addition, the execution and performance of derivatives transactions depend on the Bank's ability to develop adequate control and administrative systems, and to hire and retain qualified personnel. Moreover, the Bank's ability to adequately monitor, analyze and report these derivative transactions depends, to a great extent, on its information technology systems. These factors may further increase the risks associated with these transactions and could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank's results could adversely be affected by high levels of inflation.\n\nHigh levels of inflation increase the interest rates, generating effects such as increases in the cost of funding, increases in credit risk, a slowdown in the placement of loans and, the potential reduction of net interest income. Additionally, high levels of inflation reduce the market value of the Bank's debt instruments, while increasing the market risk. Another impact of inflation is its effect on the real interest rate. When the inflation rate is higher than the nominal interest rate, negative real interest rates discourage savings, and increase uncertainty and risk in the loan market and the stock market.\n\nRecently, the inflationary challenge that started in 2022 has largely been addressed in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Panama, such that it is not a significant source of concern in any of these countries today. CPI Inflation went from 7.3% in the end of 2022 to 1.2% in the end of 2023 in El Salvador, from 9.2% to 4.2% in Guatemala, and from 2.6% to 2.1% in Panama. However, the situation in Colombia is somewhat different. The annual inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index started to decline in Colombia beginning in the second quarter of 2023, which resulted in the annual CPI decreasing from 13.1% at the end of 2022 to 9.3% at the end of 2023; however, this is still significantly above the Central Bank's mediumterm target of 3%.\n\nIn Colombia, there are persistent upside risks that suggest the process of reducing inflation will be lengthy, and it is highly possible that even by the end of 2024, target levels may not be achieved. Risks in this regard stem from the impact of the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon on food prices and electricity tariffs, a significant increase in the minimum wage (12% in nominal terms, against a 9.3% year-end annual inflation), as well as the government-mandated increases in the price of diesel and toll rates on the country's main national roads. All of this indicates that, despite the Central Bank initiating a reduction in interest rates since December 2023, the normalization process for inflation and interest rates will be lengthy. It is reasonable to expect that the demand for credit portfolios will remain modest, and the reduction in interest rates could start negatively impacting the net interest margin of credit institutions. Therefore, 2024 may pose a more challenging year than previous years for the operation of financial intermediation due to an inflationary challenge that will continue to be more formidable compared to other major economies in Latin America, the United States, and the European Union.\n\n## The Bank is subject to a wide range of cybersecurity incidents.\n\nAmid the dynamic landscape of the digital era, we recognize the growing importance of addressing cyber risks in bank operations. In addition, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has introduced in July 2023 new regulations requiring additional disclosures related to cybersecurity processes, risks, and incidents. Complying with these directives is crucial for our organization to ensure transparency and adhere to regulatory standards.\n\nAs the Bank continues to develop its technology and business models to offer new and better financial solutions for its customers,  such  as  the  banking-as-a-service  business  model  or  digital  wallets,  the  Bank  faces  increasing  significant challenges and risks in terms of information security, including those resulting from the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in our systems. In 2023 there was a significant increase in phishing attacks on our clients (compared to 2022) in which the Bank identified and dismantled approximately 45 thousand fraudulent sites. Similarly, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into control tools enhances our capabilities, but this technology and others such as generative AI also introduce risks of disruption, technological failures, manipulation, modification or destruction of digital assets and reputation. Today, attacks are increasingly sophisticated and supported by AI itself.",

        "page_content": "Another factor that increases our exposure to cybersecurity risks is our joint work with third party service providers, whether through the use of their software or in the development of products and services. Working with third party service providers allows us to obtain the benefit of capabilities and efficiencies that are relevant to our business strategy. However, this results in risks related to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information assets and exposes us to malware attacks and ransomware, among others, that could impact the Bank through shared files or connections with these service providers and that could cause interruptions in our operations, loss of critical information, loss of clients, cost overruns and economic losses associated with the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents.\n\nThe exposure of services on the Internet combined with the exploitation of software vulnerabilities is another of the cybersecurity risks that we face. Cybercriminals constantly seek to exploit system vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities arise due to the dynamic changes and rapid obsolescence faced by technology and represent a challenge for both software service providers and their customers, as service providers must quickly put in place solutions for these vulnerabilities and customers, in turn, have to apply these solutions as swiftly as possible.\n\nTo  face  the  new  demands  of  our  competitive  landscape,  we  have  adopted  certain  workplace  strategies  that  result  in additional challenges for cybersecurity risk management. As an example, we have employees who work virtually in remote and hybrid models, these models bring challenges such as remote software updating, as well as control backdoors that can lead  to  data  leaks.  This  leaves  employees  exposed  to  email  phishing,  social  engineering,  and  the  use  of  vulnerable applications.\n\nTo date, there have not been any material cybersecurity incidents. However, our strategy, results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected by cybersecurity risks and any future material incidents. A failure to adhere to the Bank's cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls, employee misconduct, or human, governance or technological error could also endanger the Bank's ability to protect itself against cyber-attacks.\n\nFor further information see 'Item 16 k. Cybersecurity' .\n\n## The Bank's financial results may be negatively affected by changes to assumptions supporting the value of our goodwill.\n\nThe Bank tests for impairment, at least annually, the goodwill that has been recognized with respect to the financial positions of its operating segments. The impairment test for assets recognized as of December 31, 2023, indicated that the Bank's goodwill balances are not impaired. The impairment test requires that management make assumptions regarding estimated  earnings,  discount  rates,  and  long-term  growth  rates  that  impact  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  goodwill associated with each operating segment, as well as estimates of the carrying amounts of the operating segments to which the goodwill relates. Additionally, the impairment test requires that management analyzes the macroeconomic and political environment of the geographies in which each cash-generating unit ('CGUs') is located. If actual results in future periods deviate from the earnings and other assumptions on which the impairment testing is based, the value of the goodwill in any one or more of the Bank's businesses may become impaired in the future, resulting in expense charges.\n\nFor further  information,  see Note  2.E  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  Material  accounting  policies,  Use  of estimates and judgments.\n\n## Risks  relating  to  the  use  of  quantitative  models  and  information  may  adversely  impact  the  Bank's  business strategies and results.\n\nAnalytical models are tools used by the Bank to support financial and non-financial risk management and other processes in an objective, automated and efficient way. The Bank uses internal models to quantify and manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, among other internal processes. However, these models can also result in costs and heightened risks.",

        "page_content": "Most risks associated with the use of models typically arise from three main sources: deficiencies in data availability and quality, methodological errors in model design and inappropriate use of the model, which may consist of using the model outside of its intended use, errors during implementation, or failure to update or recalibrate the model as needed.\n\nModels can fail or not accurately reflect reality. This leads to what is known as model risk, which refers to the possibility of negative outcomes, including financial losses, arising from decision making processes based on inaccurate, misused, or unreliable analytical models. Such outcomes could result in financial losses or reputational damage. Moreover, decisions supported on flawed models can adversely affect several aspects of our business operations, including business strategies deployment, position valuation, stress testing, risk detection and evaluation, assessment of capital adequacy, customer asset management, the release of public information, and compliance with financial or regulatory standards.\n\n## The Bank is exposed to ESG risks that could affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWith respect to social, environmental and sustainability (ESG) trends, the financial sector faces a significant challenge in its role as a catalyst in the fight against climate change, with the sector playing a crucial role in the transition to a lowcarbon economy and adaptation to climate threats, including providing financing to projects and companies aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. The focus on ESG also highlights the importance of good governance practices related to the evaluation and supervision of non-financial and emerging risks, and the importance of social considerations to the growth of organizations.\n\nThe Bank may not be able to appropriately address ESG concerns that may arise, including as a result of its business activities and failure to meet regulatory (such as the External Circulars 031 of 2021 from Superintendecia Financiera de Colombia - SFC) or stakeholder expectations on environmental impact, including climate change. The implementation of climate risk management systems represents a challenge, since it is necessary to alter traditional risk processes for the implementation of methodologies, policies and procedures that adequately manage these particular risks.\n\nIn relation to clients' physical risks related to climate change, the potential impact on the Group is observable through the Bank's expected credit loss (ECL) and probability of default (PD) models involving clients that have been prioritized by the Bank for analysis. The output of these models is driven by the potential operational losses that climate change may have on the productive activities of our clients and on their ability to satisfy their payment obligations to us. Additionally, when considering economic sectors with an intensive carbon footprint, transition risks can result in risks to the Bank (as they  may  increase  spending  by  clients  in  these  sectors)  which  could  increase  the  probability  of  default  on  financial obligations.\n\nSerious climate events can affect business continuity, infrastructure, processes and headcount at branches and offices. As a consequence, the Group is faced with the management and administration of physical risks (both in respect of its own facilities and operations and those of its clients) and transition risks, which could negatively impact the value of the assets delivered to the Bank in payment and of its own fixed assets such as buildings, branches and ATMs, as well as the assets and operations of its clients.\n\nPhysical risks of climate change for our customers are exacerbated by their dependence on natural resources for their operations and activities, loss of biodiversity, impacts on critical ecosystems and deforestation. Our customers could also be affected by climate-related legislation and policy developments, and business trends and changes in consumer behavior related to climate change and technology (such as the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy).   Physical and transition  risks  may result  in capital  losses  either  due  to  market  changes  or  non-compliance  with  new  climate-related regulations or interpretations of existing laws requiring enhanced disclosure obligations, affecting our customers' financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows and, consequently, their ability to make required payments.\n\nOur challenges to strengthening our ability to adapt to, and resiliency against, the risks of climate change include the need for  the  emergence  of new  businesses  focused  on  resilient infrastructure,  early  warning systems  and  strategies  to  face climate change; identifying and accessing the funds and resources to support the transition to a low-carbon economy; and strengthening of corporate governance and risk processes that guide progress and strategies with respect to these matters, usually tied to compliance with ESG Key Performance indicators (KPIs). Failure to comply with these KPIs may result in",

Inadequate management of the tracking and monitoring of ESG indicators may result in risks for the Bank, both in the short and long-term and loss in market share.\n\n## The Bank is subject to operational risks and losses.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to operational risk. These include the risks of fraud by employees or third parties, human errors, inadequate process definition, or technological failures that affect the availability of services or result in the improper processing, authorization, and recording of transactions and operations.\n\nThe financial sector is particularly vulnerable to the risk of fraud due to the increasing digitization of its processes and services, including the implementation of customer experiences that allow customers to carry out transactions at any time and from anywhere, among other factors. This vulnerability makes it necessary not only to strengthen the technological infrastructure and cybersecurity of banks but also to enhance the financial education of their customers. It is essential to continually reinforce concepts related to the security and privacy of passwords and transactions.\n\nGiven  that  the  Bank  has  an  extensive  network  of  suppliers  essential  for  the  provision  of  its  services,  failures  and weaknesses in these suppliers or their inability to manage any of their risks appropriately could impact the operation of the Bank. These supplier issues could result in increased costs, compromise confidential information, and result in a decline in the quality or continuity of product and service offerings.\n\nThe Bank, in its process of evolution, aims to have a better value proposition through digital channels, the design of new business models supported, for example, by Banking as a Service, and the adoption of new technologies and systems that enable its transformation process. However, these new technologies and business models can bring about new risks or amplify existing ones.\n\n## Digital misinformation could adversely affect the Bank's reputation as well as its operational and financial results.\n\nThe increase in digital interconnectedness has increased the spread and distribution of digital content across social media networks. References to the Bank decreased by over 15% in 2023 compared to 2022; this was the first year, since the pandemic, that this figure decreased. Nonetheless, the Bank still has a strong digital presence, with a reach of 28.71 million digital users, an increase of 179% compared to 2019, and accordingly the risk of misinformation remains high. The Bank has been mentioned in media such as press articles, photos, audio, and videos. Some of these references to the Bank were used with the intent to, among other purposes, commit fraud. As a result, managing the  risk of digital misinformation remains a challenge for the Bank.\n\nDigital misinformation can be characterized by inaccurate, exaggerated, or untrue information which increases negative sentiment towards the brands in question and, including those of the Bank, if used to defame the Bank's reputation and negatively affect the trust of customers and other interest groups. Such developments could lead to reduced business and market share for the Bank, which would negatively affect the operational, economic, and reputational performance of the Bank.\n\n## The Bank's policies and procedures may not be able to detect money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption or other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis.\n\nThe  Bank  is  required  to  comply  with  applicable  anti-money  laundering,  anti-terrorism  and  anti-corruption  laws  and regulations. These laws and regulations require the Bank, among other things, to adopt and enforce 'know your customer' policies and procedures and report suspicious and large transactions to the applicable authorities; such regulations are contained in the 'SARLAFT Manual' (AML Manual) that is reviewed and updated annually or earlier if there are any relevant changes in the applicable regulation. While the Bank has adopted policies and procedures, based on risk approach, (including ultimate beneficial owners identification) aimed at preventing and detecting the use of its banking network for money laundering and terrorism financing activities and by terrorists and terrorist-related organizations and individuals",

The Bank has anti-corruption policies and procedures, aimed at preventing, detecting and responding  to  acts  of  corruption  potentially  committed  by  our  directors,  employees,  suppliers  and  other  relevant constituencies. These include its anti-corruption policy, which is reviewed biannually and updated as needed, training based on behavioral science, reporting channels such as the Ethics Line, monitoring, internal investigations, sanctions and the whistleblower protection policy. While this system is designed to prevent and detect corrupt behavior, it does not eliminate the risk that the Bank's directors, employees, suppliers and other relevant counterparts may engage in corrupt practices. If the Bank fails to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, it may face fines, penalties or other liabilities including restrictions on its ability to conduct business. In addition, the Bank's business and reputation  could suffer if it is not able to prevent and detect money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption, or other illegal practices.\n\n## The Bank is subject to regulatory inspections, examinations, inquiries or audits in Colombia and in other countries where  it  operates,  and  any  sanctions,  fines  and  other  penalties  resulting  from  such  inspections,  examinations, inquiries  or  audits  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  Bank's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and reputation.\n\nThe Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by the financial authorities of Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the other jurisdictions where the Bank operates. These financial authorities have broad powers to adopt regulations and impose other requirements affecting or restricting virtually all aspects of the Bank's capitalization, organization and operations, including the imposition of anti-money laundering measures and the authority to regulate the terms and conditions on which the Bank can extend credit. In the event of non-compliance with applicable regulations, the Bank could be subject to fines, sanctions or the revocation of licenses or permits to operate its business. In Colombia, for instance, if the Bank encounters significant financial problems or becomes insolvent or in danger of becoming insolvent, banking authorities would have the power to take over the Bank's management and operations. Any sanctions, fines or other penalties resulting from non-compliance with regulations in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama and other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates could materially and adversely affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\n\n## The Bank and most of its Subsidiaries are subject to the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 and the OECD's Automatic Exchange of Information - Common Reporting Standard (CRS).\n\nBancolombia and most of its subsidiaries are considered foreign financial institutions ('FFIs') under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 ('FATCA') (see 'Item 4. Information on the Company  - B. Business Overview - B.8. Supervision and Regulation - International regulations applicable to Bancolombia and its subsidiaries'). Additionally, Bancolombia  and  some  of  its  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  reporting  obligations  derived  from  the  Common  Reporting Standard ('CRS') Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement ('MCAA') developed by the OECD.\n\nIn light of this and Colombian law, we have taken measures and implemented policies and procedures aimed to comply with FATCA and CRS.\n\nHowever,  if  Bancolombia  or  its  Subsidiaries  fail  to  comply  with  the  requirements  thereunder,  certain  payments  to Bancolombia, or its Subsidiaries may be subject to withholding under FATCA or other penalties that tax authorities may impose  according  to  their  domestic  regulations.  Such  withholding  or  penalties  could  adversely  affect  our  results  of operations  and  financial  condition.  In  addition,  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  intergovernmental  agreements ('IGA'), FFI agreements entered into with the IRS, the CRS-MCAA, domestic laws or any other regulations enforced in the relevant jurisdictions, may increase our compliance costs.",

Banking  laws  and  regulations  may  change frequently, and changes may be adopted, enforced or interpreted in a manner that may have an adverse effect on the Bank's business.\n\nIn August 2022, Colombia shifted to a new government with a political agenda that could affect the financial sector and have  impacts  on  capital-intensive  industries.  Additionally,  the  increasing  tendency  to  improve  financial  consumer protection standards among legislators, regulators and higher courts, could result in additional operational costs and a reduction in the Bank's income.\n\nAlthough at the Congressional level, flagship projects (health reform, pension reform and labor reform) continue through legislative procedure, the risks to the financial sector could derive from provisions adopted by other authorities, such as potential intervention on interest rate limits (as indicated in item 4.B.8.1) or fees. This may limit the ability of the Bank and other lenders to manage credit risks.\n\nThe SFC has submitted for public comment new rules regarding the implementation of the internal capital and liquidity adequacy assessment process rules and stress testing procedures. The Bank could face potential financial impacts in case the rules of the SFC are more server than the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Standards, which could result in higher capital adequacy and liquidity requirements at a system level.\n\n## The Bank's financial results may be negatively affected by changes to accounting standards.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Bank are prepared in accordance with IFRS, issued by the IASB, as well as the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (hereinafter refer to as IFRSIC). Changes to IFRS or its interpretations may cause future reported results and financial position to differ from current expectations. Such changes may also impact the Bank's regulatory capital and financial ratios. Management monitors potential accounting changes and, when possible, determines their potential impact, disclosing significant future changes in the Bank's consolidated financial statements that are expected as a result of those changes. For further information about developments in financial accounting and reporting standards, see Note 2.F to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Material accounting policies, Recently issued accounting pronouncements.\n\n## The Bank faces risks relating to regulatory compliance in general, and in particular with respect to laws relating to anti-competitive practices, consumer protection and protection of personal data.\n\nThe Bank must comply with laws and regulations related to, among other things, anti-competitive practices, merger control unfair, competition provisions, personal data protection and consumer protection. While responsibility for compliance is covered by different divisions of the Bank that work as an integrated compliance framework, the Bank has also been implementing a special unit for overseeing and ensuring regulatory compliance in general, which is constantly evolving. To ensure compliance for personal data law, the Bank has developed a comprehensive data protection program.",

Any failure by the Bank to detect and prevent those practices in a timely manner could damage the Bank's reputation and cause it to incur substantial fines and penalties which could adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## Future restrictions on interest rates or banking fees could negatively affect the Bank's profitability.\n\nIn prior years, the regulators of the jurisdictions in which the Bank operates have considered various legislative and/or regulatory initiatives regarding interest rates and banking fees. Although most of such initiatives have not been adopted in the past, there may be renewed attempts to impose restrictions on interest rates or banking fees in the future. If we are prohibited or otherwise limited (including by limits with respect to pricing) from  continuing to charge our clients for certain products or services, including specified types of transactions, or from imposing charges for products or services that might be introduced in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## The Bank's businesses rely heavily on data collection, processing and storage systems, the failure of which could materially and adversely affect the effectiveness of its risk management, reputation and internal control system as well as its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAll of the Bank's principal businesses are highly dependent on the ability to timely collect and process a large amount of financial  and other  information  at  its  various  digital  and  physical  channels  across  numerous  markets,  at  a  time  when transaction processes have become increasingly complex with increasing volume. The proper functioning of financial control, accounting or other data collection and processing systems is critical to the Bank's businesses and to its ability to compete effectively.\n\nA partial or complete failure of any of these primary systems could materially and adversely affect the Bank's decisionmaking process, its risk management and internal control systems, the quality of its service, and the Bank's ability to respond on a timely basis to changing market conditions. If the Bank cannot maintain effective data collection, processing, storage and management systems, its business operations, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe Bank is also dependent on information systems to operate its website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. The Bank may experience operational problems with its information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer hackers or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of its systems could cause information, including data related to customer requests and other client information, to be lost, compromised, or to be delivered to the Bank's clients with delays or errors, which could reduce demand for the Bank's services and products, resulting in additional costs for the Bank and potentially fines and penalties by regulators which could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position. To guarantee service continuity,  the  Bank  plans  and  implements  exercises  related  to  business  continuity  and  disaster  recovery  as  well  as cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities' management, according to internal and external control areas requirements.

If any of the Bank's key service providers fail to fulfill any of their contractual obligations or causes disruptions in services, (including, failure to handle current or higher volumes, or poor performance of services and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations), the Bank's ability to conduct its businesses could be adversely affected and could also negatively impact its results of operations and financial position. In addition, the Bank may be required to incur significant additional costs to find replacement providers. Furthermore, the unavailability of the services provided by some technology and other vendors could result in the interruption of services at certain channels through which our clients execute transactions until a replacement provider is engaged, which could result in lost revenue, additional costs and, potentially, adverse regulatory consequences and reputational harm.\n\n## The Bank's ability to attract and retain specialized talent could impact some business objectives.\n\nThe current economic outlook requires our workforce to exhibit new skills and attributes such as creativity, innovation and flexibility, which are necessary to adapt the Bank's operations to constant technological advances and update business models and strategies to develop new products and services.\n\nThe quality and competitiveness of the Bank's employees are essential to its long-term performance and stability and the success of its strategic objectives. As a result, the inability to attract or retain highly skilled professionals or key employees would  result  in  a  decrease  in  operational  efficiency  and  the  inability  to  adapt  quickly  to  market  changes  and  could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFinancial institutions, including the Bank, continue to face challenges identifying specialized workers to fill positions that require specific and highly developed knowledge, as well as retain existing talent in this regard.\n\n## Acquisitions and strategic alliances may not perform in accordance with expectations or may disrupt the Bank's operations and adversely affect its profitability.\n\nAn element of the Bank's business strategy is to identify and pursue growth-enhancing strategic opportunities. The Bank may base assessments of potential acquisitions and alliances on assumptions with respect to operations, profitability and other matters that may subsequently prove to be incorrect, and any future acquisitions, investments and alliances may not produce the anticipated synergies or perform in accordance with the Bank's expectations which could adversely affect its operations and profitability. In particular, the Bank holds a minority financial investment, through a private equity fund, in an infrastructure project located in Colombia. In previous years, the main shareholder of the project and the concession company faced negative press related to irregular practices. If any of these situations result in sanctions or convictions then the company in which the Bank indirectly holds a minority stake, which is the holder of a toll road concession, may suffer a reputational harm, which in turn may have an adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition and the return on the Bank's investment.\n\n## The Bank is subject to increasing competition which may adversely affect the results of its operations.\n\nThe  Bank  operates  in  a  highly  competitive  environment  and  management  expects  increasing  competition  in  the jurisdictions where the Bank operates.\n\nIntensified  merger  activity  in  the  financial  services  industry  has  produced  larger,  better  capitalized  and  more geographically  diverse  firms  that  are  capable  of  offering  a  wider  array  of  financial  products  and  services  at  more competitive prices. Also, the expansion of financial technologies companies (known as 'FinTech'), unregulated financial intermediaries (known as 'shadow banking'), may increase competitive risks for the Bank.\n\nThe Bank's ability to maintain its competitive position depends mainly on (i) its ability to fulfill new customers' needs through the development of new products and services, (ii) the ability to offer adequate services and strengthen its customer base through cross-selling (iii) the capacity to continue with the digital and technological transformation to support growth and (iv) the ability to attract and retain human talent.

        "page_content": "Finally, the Bank's efforts to offer new services and products might not succeed if product or market opportunities develop more slowly than expected or if the profitability of opportunities is undermined by competitive pressures.\n\n## Risks Relating to the Preferred Shares and the ADSs.\n\n## Preemptive rights may not be available to holders of American Depositary Receipts ('ADRs') evidencing ADSs.\n\nThe Bank's by-laws and Colombian law require that, whenever the Bank issues new shares of any outstanding class, it must offer the holders of each class of shares (including holders of ADRs) the right to purchase a number of shares of such class sufficient to maintain their existing percentage ownership of the aggregate capital stock of the Bank. These rights are called preemptive rights. United States holders of ADRs may not be able to exercise their preemptive rights through The Bank of New York Mellon, which acts as depositary (the 'Depositary') for the Bank's ADR facility, unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is effective with respect to such rights and class of shares or an exemption from the registration  requirement  thereunder  is  available.  The  Bank  is  obligated  to  file  a  registration  statement  or  find  a corresponding exemption only if it determines to extend the rights to holders of the ADRs. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Bank intends to consider at the time of any rights offering the costs and potential liabilities associated with any such registration statement, the benefits to the Bank from enabling the holders of the ADRs to exercise those rights and any other factors deemed appropriate at the time before it makes a decision as to whether to file a registration statement. Accordingly, the Bank may in some cases decide not to file a registration statement.\n\nUnder the deposit agreement between the Bank and the Depositary, only the Depositary is entitled to exercise preemptive rights, and the Depositary has no obligation to make available preemptive rights to holders of ADRs. If the Bank offers or causes  to  be  offered  to  the  holders  of  any  deposited  securities,  including  preferred  shares  of  the  Bank,  any  rights  to subscribe for additional preferred shares of the Bank or any rights of any other nature, the Depositary has discretion as to the procedure to be followed in making such rights available to any holders of ADRs or in disposing of such rights on behalf of any holders of ADRs and making the net proceeds available to such holders of ADRs. If by the terms of such rights offering or for any other reason, the Depositary does not either make such rights available to any holders of ADRs or dispose of such rights and make the net proceeds available to such holders of ADRs, then the Depositary will allow the rights to lapse. Whenever the rights are sold or lapse, the equity interests of the holders of ADRs will be proportionately diluted.\n\n## Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the Colombian economy, the market price of the Bank's ADSs, and the dividends payable to holders of the Bank's ADSs.\n\nColombia has adopted a floating exchange rate system. The Central Bank maintains the power to intervene in the exchange market in order to consolidate or dispose of international reserves, and to control any volatility in the exchange rate. From time to time, and in particular during the past two years, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Colombian peso and the U.S. dollar. Unforeseen events in the international markets, fluctuations in interest rates, volatility of the oil price in the international markets, or changes in capital flows, may cause exchange rate instability that  could  generate  sharp  movements  in  the  value  of  the  peso.  Because  a  portion  of  our  assets  and  liabilities  are denominated in, or indexed to, foreign currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, sharp movements in exchange rates may negatively impact our results. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact the value of dividends paid to holders of our ADSs as well as the market price and liquidity of ADSs.\n\n## The Bank's preferred shares have limited voting rights.\n\nThe Bank's corporate affairs are governed by its by-laws and Colombian law. Under the Bank's by-laws and Colombian law, the Bank's preferred stockholders may have fewer rights than stockholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction.  Under the Bank's by-laws and Colombian corporate law, holders of preferred shares (and, consequently, holders of ADRs) have no voting rights in respect of preferred shares, other than in limited circumstances as described in 'Item 10. Additional Information - B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Voting Rights - Preferred Shares'. Holders of the Bank's preferred shares, including holders of ADRs, are not entitled to vote for the election of directors or to influence the Bank's management policies.",

        "page_content": "## Holders of the Bank's ADRs may encounter difficulties in the exercise of dividend and voting rights.\n\nHolders of the Bank's ADRs may encounter difficulties in the exercise of some of their rights with respect to the shares underlying ADRs. If the Bank makes a distribution to holders of underlying shares in the form of securities, the Depositary is allowed, in its discretion, to sell those securities on behalf of ADR holders and instead distribute the net proceeds to the ADR holders. Also, even in those limited instances in which the preferred shares represented by the ADRs have the power to vote, under some circumstances, ADR holders may not be able to vote by giving instructions to the depositary. This may occur if ADR holders do not receive from the Depositary a notice of meeting sufficiently prior to the instruction date to  ensure  that  the  Depositary  will  vote  the  preferred  shares  represented  by  the  ADRs  in  accordance  with  instructions received from such holders. There are no circumstances in which holders of ADRs may vote in a way other than by providing instructions to the Depositary.\n\n## Relative illiquidity of the Colombian securities markets may impair the ability of an ADR holder to sell preferred shares.\n\nThe Bank's common and preferred shares are listed on the Colombian Securities Exchange, which is relatively small and illiquid compared to securities exchanges in major financial centers. In addition, a small number of issuers represent a disproportionately large percentage of market capitalization and trading volume on the Colombian Securities Exchange. A liquid trading market for the Bank's securities might not develop on the Colombian Securities Exchange. A limited trading market could impair the ability of an ADR holder to sell preferred shares (obtained upon withdrawal of such shares from the ADR facility) on the Colombian Securities Exchange in the amount and at the price and time such holder desires and could increase the volatility of the price of the ADRs.\n\n## Changes in Colombia's tax regime may affect ADRs tax treatment.\n\nADRs do not have the same tax treatment as  other  equity  investments  in  Colombia.  ADRs  represent  Bancolombia's preferred shares and are held through a fund of foreign capital in Colombia which is subject to a specific tax regulatory regime. Accordingly, the applicable law in Colombia to equity investments, in particular, those relating to dividends and profits from sale, do not apply to ADRs, including the Bank's ADRs.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the tax regime applicable to ADRs may change, considering that the Colombian tax regime has undergone several changes in recent years.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 10. Additional Information. - E. Taxation - Colombia Taxation'.\n\n## ITEM 4 INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\n\n## A. HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\n\nBancolombia S.A is one of the largest Colombian financial institutions, with presence in other countries such as Panama, El Salvador, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, and the United States, providing a wide range of financial products and services to a diversified individual, corporate, and government customer base throughout Colombia, Latin America and the Caribbean region.\n\nBancolombia is a stock company ('sociedad an\u00f3nima') domiciled in Medellin, Colombia and operates under Colombian laws and regulations.

Since 1981 Bancolombia's  common  shares  have  been  traded  on  the  Colombian  Securities  Exchange  under  the  symbol 'BCOLOMBIA'. See 'Item 9. The Offer and Listing'.\n\nThe address and telephone numbers of the Bank's headquarters are as follows: Carrera 48 # 26-85, Medell\u00edn, Colombia; telephone + (57)601 488-5950.\n\nThe Bank's website is: https://www.grupobancolombia.com.\n\nThe Bank's agent for service of process in the United States is Puglisi & Associates, located at 850 Library Avenue, Suite 204, Newark, Delaware 19711. The SEC maintains a website at http://  www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.\n\n## RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## Tender Offer to purchase up to U.S.$370,000,000 of outstanding 3.000% senior notes due 2025 .\n\nOn July 12, 2023, the Bank announced the commencement of a tender offer to purchase for cash up to U.S.$370,000,000 of its outstanding 3.000% Senior Notes due 2025 upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an offer to purchase.\n\nOn July 26, 2023, the early tender results were announced, along with the Bank's decision to increase the maximum tender amount from U.S.$370,000,000 to U.S.$467,966,000. The Bank subsequently repurchased and submitted for cancellation U.S.$467,966,000 of the notes.\n\n## Liquidity Program\n\nOn December 14, 2023, the Bank announced that the Colombian stock exchange (BVC) authorized a liquidity program in Colombia for  its  ordinary  and  preferred  shares,  under  a  contract  between  the  Bank  and  Credicorp  Capital  Colombia executed on December 1, 2023, with an initial term of one year from its execution.\n\nThis program seeks to increase the number of transactions involving the Bank's shares through purchase and sale orders entered by Credicorp Capital Colombia in the stock market, enabling price formation.\n\nThese mechanisms contribute to promoting liquidity and mitigating volatility in stock trading and facilitating market entry and exit for investors.\n\n## PUBLIC TAKEOVER OFFERS\n\nIn 2023, and as of the date of this Annual Report, there have been no public takeover offers by third parties with respect to the Bank's shares or by the Bank with respect to other companies' shares.\n\n## CAPITAL ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n\nDuring 2023, total capital expenditures amounted to COP 699.9 billion. Such investments were mainly focused on digital transformation and technology assets (COP 520.2 billion) driven by investments in distribution channels and fixed assets (COP 179.7 billion).\n\nAlthough we had anticipated a decrease in fixed asset investments for 2024 considering the remote work trend, the Bank expects to invest approximately COP 772.9 billion (10.4% increase from 2023) mainly on channels and digital offers, data analytics  and  equipment  to  support  processing  in  non-productive  environments  and  the  evolution  of  the  Enterprise Resource  Planning  (ERP),  in  addition  to  maintaining  significant  investments  related  to  strategic  projects  such  as  its technological and digital transformation, cybersecurity and migration to cloud among others.",

Nequi is a 100% digital platform that operates independently from the Bank's brand and aims to  address  real  financial  needs  of  today's  clients  with  a  wide  range  of  possibilities  enabled  by  technology.  Nequi  is completely paperless; users interact with the platform exclusively by mobile phone, with no contact with the Bank's branch network. Nequi offers saving accounts, a digital debit card, PayPal integration, nano-loans and third-party non-financial services, like utilities, entertainment and transportation among others, to over 18.5 million users in Colombia and over 154 thousand in Panama.\n\nNequi's business will be separated from the Bank in order to unlock its business value and to enhance the development of the new company. The separation is expected to take place in the first half of 2024, subject to determination of the actual timeframe with the Colombian Superintendency of Finance (the 'Superintendency of Finance') , and is intended to be achieved through the establishment of a financing company ('Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Financiamiento'). This process consists of the following two stages: (i) formation of this financing company, consisting of the incorporation (upon registration of the public deed of incorporation, which has been completed) and operational authorization procedure before the SFC; and (ii) once the operational authorization is obtained, the assignment of assets and contracts corresponding to Nequi's business from the Bank to the newly incorporated financing company. Although Nequi provides financial services, other strategies are being developed in integrated experiences through alliances with third parties.\n\nSustainable finance: Special credit lines designed to support our customers involved in making a positive impact on the environment and society.

Currently, two companies have integrated the 'Education App' into their operations, and four have integrated the 'Clubs App'.\n\nCredit Card 100% Digital: In December 2023, we introduced the ' MasterCard \u00danica Virtual ' a fully digital credit card operating under the MasterCard franchise. This card is available solely to the Bank's customers whose credit limits range from COP 500,000 to COP 10,000,000, accessible through our App. The card is issued via customer self- management on the App and it can be activated instantly, empowering customers to engage in seamless transactions both in physical and digital retail environments. For in-store transactions, the card requires tokenization through the Bank's supported digital wallets. Meanwhile, utilizing this card for online purchases mirrors the user experience of other credit cards within the Bank's portfolio.\n\nIntegrating credit: In order to contribute to the development of the country's productive landscape across all stages of the agricultural value chain, we launched a new credit line in 2023. This option allows large and medium-sized companies to access special financing rates for settling accounts payable to their suppliers, provided that these suppliers are small and medium-sized producers in the agricultural sector.\n\nAssistance  for  Bancolombia  'A  la  mano'  Accounts: In  2023,  we  introduced  the  new  product  'Asistencia  A  la mano', which is offered via telephone. This is directed towards individuals who are low-income clients with no prior experience with banking products, specifically those who have low deposit amounts in our mobile phone-based savings",

        "page_content": "account 'Bancolombia A la mano.' With this product, our goal is to ensure well-being for customers, their families and their pets. More than 23,000 assistance policies were acquired by our customers in 2023.\n\nCancer Insurance: In October 2023, we launched a fully digital insurance providing coverage for individuals in the case of a cancer diagnosis, accidental death or death caused by cancer. This insurance can be acquired by the Bank's customers aged 18  to 70, with the monthly cost starting at COP 6,000 and with coverage ranging from COP 10 million to COP 100 million. Additionally, this insurance offers free virtual services with focus on nutrition, health and education.\n\nProtected-Family Plan: In June 2023, we introduced a digital insurance designed for clients who want to extend the advantages of insurance coverage to their families. This plan comes at a cost of COP 30,299 per month, providing coverage in the event of accidental death and benefits that can be shared with up to six family members. These benefits encompass home medical assistance, ambulance services in case of emergencies, telemedicine, access to a network of specialized doctors at preferential rates, funeral expenses in the event of death, and discounts with partner businesses.\n\nBuy now, pay later (BNPL): Launched in March 2023, this product is the Bancolombia response to the BNPL global trend. We offer loans with no monthly interest, to pay purchases in 4 equal monthly installments. Since March 2023, we have had this product available for an average of three million customers each month, making amounts available between USD 25 and USD 750 for them to use when making purchases. When using the product, customers pay a fee upfront for the loan origination and then pay the complete amount of their purchase in four equal installments with automatic monthly debits, free of interest. Merchants receive the purchase payment instantly from the bank, and pay variable fees based on the size of the purchase made by the user. This strategy aims to boost financial inclusion, allowing access to credit for underserved segments, focusing on smaller credit amounts (60-70% under 100 USD) that can go up based on payment history.\n\nNew Dollar Liquidity Income Fund: The objective of the Collective Investment Fund is to provide investors with a lowduration fixed income investment instrument with exposure to the behavior of the U.S. Dollar, in a short-term investment horizon.\n\nNew Closed Fixed Income Fund V: The objective of the New Closed Fixed Income Fund V is to provide a 1-year term fund with an investment strategy that seeks to obtain rates similar  to or higher than other investment alternatives in the local fixed income market. This is achieved through investment in a  combination of AAA-rated fixed income securities and interest rate hedges (SWAP).\n\nNequi: Top-ups and bill payments: In 2023 Nequi continued to grow the top-ups and bill payment offers to customers. In 2024, Nequi launched four new options: Tigo, Wom, Marketing Personal and Punto Red (an aggregator with ten main bill payments in Bogot\u00e1, Cali and Norte de Santander).\n\nNequi also began marketing different lines of insurance offered by insurers such as Seguros Mundial, Suramericana and Cardif  through  the  app  and  launched  three  new  insurances:  segur\u00edsimo:  personal  accidents  insurance,  civil  liability insurances, travel insurance.\n\nIn  2023,  Nequi  launched  a  contactless  functionality  to  the  Nequi  debit  card  that  enables  customers  to  make  physical payments using their cellphones trough the Nequi app, Google Pay and Garmin Pay.\n\nSustainable finance: Special credit lines designed to support our customers involved in making a positive impact on the environment and society.

This behavior is explained primarily by the increased liquidity provided by the Central Bank and the Colombian National Treasury at year end, as economic activity tends to be higher during this period resulting in a greater number of transactions.\n\nDuring 2023, inflation remained above the target range, encouraging  the Central Bank to maintain high interest rates, resulting in lower demand for liquidity, loans and increasing investments in term deposits. On the other hand, although demand deposits decreased during the year, the last quarter showed significant growth in savings and checking accounts.\n\nHowever, we do not consider the seasonality of demand deposits to have a significant impact on our business, since the excess/shortage of liquidity has been managed through the treasury portfolio.\n\n## B.4            RAW MATERIALS\n\nThe Bank is not dependent on sources or availability of raw materials.\n\n## B.5            DISTRIBUTION NETWORK\n\nBancolombia provides its products and services through a traditional branch network, sales, and customer representatives as well as through mobile branches (or 'Puntos de Atenci\u00f3n M\u00f3viles'), an ATM network, online and computer banking, telephone banking, mobile phone banking services, and points of sale (or 'Puntos de Atenci\u00f3n Cercano'), among others. Transactions performed through electronic channels represented more than 95.22% of all transactions in 2023, compared to  95.59%  of  all  transactions  in  2022.  In  addition,  as  of  December  31,  2023,  Bancolombia  had  a  sales  force  of approximately 14,400 employees.\n\nThe following are the distribution channels offered by Bancolombia as of December 31, 2023\n\n## Branch Network\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  ,  Bancolombia's  consolidated  branch  network  consisted  of  969  offices,  including  578 Bancolombia S.A. offices, 63 Renting Colombia offices, 91 Banco Agricola offices, 39 Banistmo offices, 155 BAM offices and 43 offices from other subsidiaries.",

        "page_content": "## B.7            COMPETITION\n\n## Colombian Financial System Description\n\n## Overview\n\nDuring the last years, the Colombian banking system has been experiencing an expansion period marked by a series of mergers and acquisitions that have taken place within the sector. In 2013, Bancolombia continued its internationalization process with the acquisition of the banking and insurance operations of HSBC in Panama for USD 2,234 million. In addition, Bancolombia Panama acquired 40% common shares of Grupo Agromercantil for USD 217 million. During the same year, Grupo Aval acquired 100% of the Guatemalan Reformador Financial Group (the transaction was valued at USD 411 million) and acquired BBVA Panama for USD 490 million. Furthermore, in 2013, several competitors started operations in Colombia: Itau BBA entered the market with an investment bank, as did BNP Paribas; Credicorp acquired Correval (a local brokerage firm); Brazilian broker-dealer BTG Pactual acquired Bolsa y Renta; Banco Santander reentered the Colombian market with a bank; and the Chilean company Larrain Vial started operations with a brokerage firm.\n\nIn 2014, the entry of new entities continued as the financing company Hipotecaria, specialized in mortgage loans, began operations in March 2014; also, in June, Corpbanca completed the acquisition of Helm Bank, maintaining Corpbanca's brand. During the same year, the bank GNB Sudameris acquired 99.9% of HSBC Colombia's capital operating as GNB Colombia and expanding operations to Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. In 2015, the Chilean group CorpBanca merged with Brazil's Ita\u00fa, and Bancolombia sold 50% of Tuya SA shares to Grupo Exito. During the same year, Bancolombia also increased its stake in Grupo Agromercantil to 60% and subsequently acquired its full ownership in 2020.\n\nSeveral banks underwent transformations, such as Serfinanza, which transitioned from a commercial financing company to the 26th bank in the financial system in February 2015. Additionally, in 2020 four financing companies went through changes  in  their  shareholdering  structures:  in  January,  Credifinanciera  acquired  Procredit  Bank  rebranding  it  Banco Credifinanciera; in April, Coltefinanciera acquired the rights and obligations of Multibank which ceased to act as a bank; Leasing  Bancoldex  merged  with  Arco  Bancoldex  in  August;  and  Pagos  Internacional  was  acquired  by  Banco  W  in November. In 2021 Lulo Bank became the first digital bank, and in December of that year BTG Pactual transitioned from an insurance brokerage to the 28th bank in the financial system. Furthermore, in 2022 Banco Uni\u00f3n, previously called 'Giros y Finanzas', shifted from a commercial financing company to operate as the 29th Bank in the financial system.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  according  to  the  SFC,  the  main  participants  in  the  Colombian  financial  system  were  29 commercial  banks  (18  domestic  private  banks,  10  foreign  banks,  and  1  domestic  state-owned  bank),  5  financial corporations  and  17 financing  companies.  In  addition,  trust  companies,  cooperatives,  insurance  companies,  insurance brokerage and securities intermediaries, special state-owned institutions, and severance payments and pension funds also participate in the Colombian financial system.\n\n## Market and Credit Institutions' Evolution in 2023\n\nIn  2015,  Colombian  financial  institutions  began  reporting their  consolidated  financial  results  under  IFRS  framework. However, in the case of credit institutions (including banks, financial corporations, financing companies and 38 financial cooperatives), the SFC has allowed the presentation of stand-alone financial statements under Colombian Banking GAAP basis, following Decree 1851 of August 2013, which regulates the Law 1314 of 2009 concerning the technical regulatory framework for the institutions that report their financial results. Accordingly, the following information includes figures under Colombian Banking GAAP regulation, as reported by Colombian credit institutions.\n\nLoan growth at Colombian credit institutions was 1.9% in 2023, compared to 16.9% in 2022. Commercial loans grew by 2.3% in 2023, compared to 16.7% in the previous year. Consumer loans decreased 2.4% in 2023, compared to the 18.3% growth in 2022. Mortgage loans increased 8.3% in 2023, compared to 14.6% growth in 2022, and small business loans grew 11.3% in 2023 compared to 14.6% in 2022.",

Multiple agencies are vested with the authority to regulate the financial system, including the board of directors of the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (the 'Ministry of Finance'), the Superintendency of Finance ('SFC'), the Superintendency of Industry and Commerce ('SIC') and the Self-Regulatory Organization ('Autoregulador del Mercado de Valores' or 'AMV'). The following is a description of their functions:\n\nThe Central Bank exercises the customary functions of a central bank, including price stabilization, monetary policy, regulation  of  currency  circulation,  regulation  of  credit,  exchange  rate  monitoring  and  management  of  international reserves. Its board of directors is the regulatory authority for monetary, currency exchange and credit policies, and is responsible for the direction of the Central Bank's duties. The Central Bank also acts as lender of last resort to financial institutions.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has the function, among others, of regulating, through the Unit of Financial Regulation, all aspects of financial and insurance activities. It is responsible for regulations relating to capital adequacy, legal lending limits,",

The SFC has broad discretionary powers to supervise financial institutions, including the authority to impose fines on financial institutions and  their  directors  and  officers  for  violations  of  applicable  regulations.  The  SFC  is  also  responsible  for  monitoring, supervising and regulating the market for publicly traded securities in Colombia.\n\nThe AMV is the self-regulatory organization of Colombia. The AMV may issue mandatory instructions to its members and supervise its members' compliance and impose sanctions for violations. All capital market intermediaries, including the Bank, must become members of the AMV and are subject to its instructions.\n\nThe SIC is the authority responsible anti-trust and data protection matters and has jurisdiction over the Bank.\n\n## Regulatory Framework for Colombian Banking Institutions\n\nThe basic regulatory framework of the Colombian financial sector is described below.\n\nDecree 663 of 1993, as amended, defines the structure of the Colombian financial system and establishes the permitted forms  of  business  entities  and  their  authorized  activities.  Furthermore,  Decree  663  of  1993  sets  forth  (i)  licensing requirements, (ii) the procedure applicable for mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs, and other corporate reorganizations of the aforementioned entities, (iii) specific regulations that apply to the issuance and sale of shares and other securities by such entities, and (iv) certain rules regarding the activities of officers and directors of such institutions, among others.\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010 compiles regulations that were previously issued in separate decrees, including regulations regarding banking,  insurance  and  securities  market  activities,  capital  adequacy  requirements,  financial  institutions'  corporate governance and principles relating to the determination, dissemination and publication of rates and prices of products and financial services, and lending activities.\n\nExternal Circulars 029 of 2014 and 100 of 1995 compile the rules and regulations issued by the SFC that apply to financial institutions and other entities under its supervision.\n\nFinancial institutions are subject to further rules if they engage in additional activities. Law 964 of 2005 (securities market law) regulates securities activities, which may be performed by banks, and securities offerings. External Resolution 1 of 2018 (foreign exchange regulations), and External Resolution 4 of 2006 issued by the board of directors of the Central Bank,  defines  the  different  activities  that  banks,  including  the  Bank,  may  perform  as  foreign  exchange  market intermediaries, including lending in foreign currencies and investing in foreign securities.\n\nViolations of any of the above statutes and their relevant regulations are subject to administrative sanctions and, in some cases, criminal sanctions.\n\n## Financial Conglomerates\n\nLaw  1870  of  2017  ('Law  1870')  implemented  the  legal  framework  for  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  financial conglomerates in areas such as regulatory capital, related party transactions, corporate governance principles, conflicts of interest and risk management, among others. According to Law 1870, a financial holding company may acquire that status by either (i) having significant influence over a financial institution or (ii) controlling a financial institution. A financial holding company (1) has significant influence over a financial institution when it directly or indirectly, holds more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting capital of the financial institution, excluding from the calculation voting capital held by entities that under their regulations are not allowed to control a financial institution (such as pension funds), and (2) controls a financial institution, when it has (i) more than 50% of the voting capital of the financial institution, (ii) the majority of the votes in the Board of Directors of the financial institution or the right to elect a majority of its members or (iii) a dominant influence over the decisions made by the financial institution as a result of an agreement with the financial institution or its shareholders as established in articles 260 and 261 of the Colombian Code of Commerce.",

        "page_content": "The Government has issued several decrees pursuant to its authority under Law 1870, including Decree 774 of 2018, which regulates capital adequacy requirements for financial conglomerates, and Decree 1486 of 2018, which regulates the criteria to  determine  related  parties,  risk  concentration  limits  and  conflicts  of  interest.  These  regulations  provide  that  when financial institutions fulfill capital adequacy requirements and solvency ratios on a standalone basis, authorities may not impose solvency ratios on the financial conglomerate as a whole.\n\nThe  law  also  reinforced  the  mechanism  for  the  resolution  of  credit  institutions  -  deposit-taking  institutions  under Colombian Law - by establishing the concept of the bridge bank, an entity used to facilitate the purchase of assets and transfer of liabilities from failing institutions.\n\nPursuant to the financial conglomerates regime, Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana S.A. has significant influence and, therefore,  is  the  financial  holding  company  of  Bancolombia  only  for  the  purposes  of  the  financial  conglomerates framework. These regulations require Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana S.A. to: (i) continue strengthening the Bank's Corporate Governance System as a Financial Conglomerate; (ii) review the risk management and capital adequacy models; and (iii) strengthen the internal control and information reporting systems of the companies that make up the conglomerate under this framework. The SFC has authority to implement applicable regulations and, accordingly, from time-to-time issues administrative resolutions and circulars.\n\n## Key interest rates\n\nArticle 884 of the Colombian Commercial Code provides for a limit on the amount of interest that may be charged in commercial transactions. The limit is 1.5 times the current banking interest rate ('inter\u00e9s bancario corriente' or 'IBC'), certified and calculated by the SFC as the weighted average rate of interest ordinarily charged by banks for loans made during a specified period. The certification process is carried out for the following credit portfolios: consumer & ordinary; low amount loans; and microcredit (which is divided into five different loan modalities).\n\nIn 2023, two regulatory changes resulted in the lowering of the interest rate limit for specific credit portfolios: (i) Decree 455 of 2023 divided the microcredit into five categories depending on amount and geographical characterization (ruralurban); and (ii) the SFC modified the calculation methodology to be based on weighted average instead of simple average.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the current banking interest rate certified by the SFC for the different credit portfolios are: (i) 25.04% for consumer & ordinary loans, (ii) 38.76% for low amount loans, and (iii) 32.00% in average for the remaining five microcredit categories rates.\n\n## Capital adequacy requirements - Basel III\n\nCapital adequacy requirements for Colombian financial institutions (as set forth in Decree 2555 of 2010, as amended) are based on most of the Basel III standards. This regulation provides for a gradual implementation plan beginning in 2021 and ending in 2024 for requirements regarding solvency ratios and capital buffers. The SFC issued External Circular 020 of  2019  which  sets  requirements  in  relation  to  capital  adequacy  requirements  for  credit  institutions  and  information reporting to the SFC. Some of the highlights of this regulation are as follows:\n\nThe technical capital ('Technical Capital') is calculated as the sum of Common Equity Tier One Capital (the 'patrimonio b\u00e1sico ordinario'), the Additional Tier One Capital ('patrimonio b\u00e1sico adicional') and the Tier Two Capital ('patrimonio adicional').\n\nRevised criteria for debt and equity instruments to be considered Common Equity Tier One Capital, Additional Tier One Capital, and Tier Two Capital were established. Additionally, the SFC must review whether a given instrument adequately complies with the applicable criteria in order for an instrument to be considered Tier One Capital or Tier Two Capital, upon request of the issuer. Debt and equity instruments that have not been classified by the SFC as Tier One Capital or Tier  Two  Capital  shall  not  be  considered  Tier  One  Capital  or  Tier  two  Capital  for  purposes  of  capital  adequacy requirements.\n\nThe Capital Adequacy Ratio is set at a minimum of 9% of the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets; however,",

        "page_content": "each entity must comply with: (i) a minimum basic solvency ratio of 4.5% (which is defined as the ordinary basic capital after  deductions  divided  by  the  financial  institution's  total  risk-weighted  assets  and  off-balance  sheet  items);  (ii)  a minimum additional basic solvency ratio (which is defined as the sum of Common Equity Tier One Capital after deductions and Additional Tier One Capital, divided by the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items) of 4.875% which began on January 1, 2021, increasing gradually up to 6% as of January 1, 2024; (iii) a capital conservation buffer (which is defined as the Common Equity Tier One Capital after deductions divided by the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items) of 0.375% which began on January 1, 2021, increasing gradually up to 1.5% as of January 1, 2024; (iv) a systemically important institution buffer (which is defined as the Common Equity Tier One after deductions divided by the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items) of 0.25% which began on January 1, 2021, increasing gradually up to 1% as of January 1, 2024 (Bancolombia was recognized by the SFC as a domestic systemically important institution in Colombia); and (v) a combined buffer equivalent  to  the  sum  of  the  aforementioned  buffers  as  of  January  1,  2024.  These  ratios  apply  to  credit  institutions individually and on a consolidated basis.\n\nCredit establishments must comply with a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, which is defined as the sum of the Common Equity Tier One Capital after deductions and the Additional Tier One Capital, divided by the leverage value. The leverage value  is  the  sum  of  all  net  assets,  the  net  exposures  in  all  repo,  simultaneous  transactions  and  temporary  transfer  of securities, the credit exposures in all derivative instruments, and the exposure value of all contingencies.\n\nCredit establishments must comply with minimum capital requirements for operational risk. This new capital requirement will be determined by the product of the Business Indicator ('indicador de negocio'), the Operational Risk Coefficient ('coeficiente de riesgo operacional') and the Internal Loss Multiplier ('indicador de p\u00e9rdida interna'). The Operational Risk Coefficient will be 12% of the Business Indicator, but if the Business Indicator exceeds COP 3 billion, the coefficient will be 15% for the excess amount. Each entity was required to comply with the requirement as of January 1, 2021.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - B1 Liquidity and Funding. Capital Adequacy.'\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for banks on an unconsolidated basis is established in Article 80 of Decree 633 of 1993. The minimum capital requirement for banks, including Bancolombia, for 2024 is COP 133,321 million. Failure to meet such  requirement  can  result  in  the  taking  of  possession  ('toma  de  posesi\u00f3n')  of  the  Bank  by  the  SFC  (see  Item  4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8 -Supervision and Regulation - Bankruptcy Considerations').\n\n## Mandatory Investments\n\nCentral Bank regulations require financial institutions, including the Bank, to hold minimum mandatory investments in debt  instruments  issued  by  Fondo  para  el  Financiamiento  del  Sector  Agropecuario  ('Finagro'),  a  Colombian  public financial institution that finances production and rural activities to support the agricultural sector. The amount of these mandatory investments is calculated by applying a fixed percentage (ranging from 4.3% to 5.8%, depending on the type of liability) to the quarterly average of the end of day balances of certain liabilities, primarily, deposits and short-term debt. The investment balance is computed at the end of each quarter. Any required adjustment (due to a change in the quarterly average between periods) results in the purchase of additional securities or may result in redemption by Finagro at of securities in excess of the requirement. The purchase of additional securities takes place during the month following the date as of which the computation was performed.\n\n## Foreign Currency Position Requirements\n\nAccording  to  External  Resolution  1  of  2018  issued  by  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Central  Bank  as  amended  or supplemented ('Resolution 1 of 2018'), a financial institution's foreign currency position is the difference between such institution's foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities (including any off-balance sheet items). In the case of foreign exchange market intermediaries that consolidate financial statements and have controlled foreign investments, such  as  the  Bank,  the  value  of  controlled  foreign  investments,  and  (ii)  the  value  of  derivatives  and  other  liabilities designated by the intermediary as hedging instruments for the controlled foreign investments are excluded from its foreign currency position.",

The reserve requirements for Colombian banks are measured biweekly and the amount depends on the class of deposits.\n\nAccording to External Resolution No. 20 of 2020 of Banco de la Rep\u00fablica, which amends External Resolution No. 5 of 2008 issued by the Colombian Central Bank, credit institutions must maintain reserves of (i) 8.00% over private demand deposits, government demand deposits, other deposits and liabilities; (ii) 3.50% over term deposits with maturities fewer than 540 days and (iii) 0% over term deposits with maturities equal to or more than 540 days.\n\n## Non-Performing Loan Allowance\n\nThe SFC maintains rules on non-performing loan allowances for financial institutions; the allowance level of these loans is determined by the profile and risk conditions of the clients and according to the specific conditions of the loan. These rules  apply  to  Bancolombia's  financial  statements  on  a  stand-alone  basis  for  Colombian  regulatory  purposes.  Nonperforming loan allowances in the Consolidated Financial Statements are calculated according to IFRS.\n\n## Large Exposures and Concentration Limits\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010, as amended, sets forth the legal lending limits, which provide for the maximum amounts that a financial institution may lend to a single borrower (including for this purpose all related fees, expenses and charges). These maximum amounts may not exceed 10% of a bank's technical capital. However, the limit is raised to 25% when amounts lent above 5% of technical capital are secured by guarantees that comply with the financial guidelines provided in Decree 2555 of 2010, as amended.\n\nAlso, in no event may a loan to a shareholder holding directly or indirectly 20% or more of the Bank's capital stock exceed 20% of the Bank's technical capital. In addition, no loan to a single financial institution may exceed 30% of the Bank's technical capital, with the exception of loans funded by Colombian development banks which are not subject to such limit.\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010 also sets a maximum limit of 30% of the Bank's technical capital for single-party risk, the calculation of which includes loans, leasing operations and equity and debt investments.\n\nThe  government,  through  Decree  1533  of  2022  and  the  SFC's  External  Circular  003  of  2024,  adopted  the  Basel Committee's international standard on Large Exposures (LEX), which from August 2025 will modify the current rules of legal lending limits. The set of new regulations establishes: (i) a 25% exposure limit of Tier 1 Capital with respect to the same  counterparty  or  group  of  connected  counterparties;  (ii)  the  definition  of  a  Large  Exposure  as  an  exposure  that represents more than 10% of the Tier 1 Capital; (iii) metrics that align the measurement of exposures with metrics on the risk-weighted assets in terms of capital adequacy; and (iv) the criteria for the  identification of connected counterparties, including control relationship, financial conglomerates, and economic interdependence.\n\n## Ownership and Management Restrictions\n\nThe Bank is organized as a stock company ('sociedad an\u00f3nima'). Its corporate existence is subject to the rules applicable to  commercial companies, principally the Colombian Commercial Code which requires stock companies (such as the Bank) to have a minimum of five shareholders at all times and provides that no single shareholder may own 95% or more of the Bank's subscribed capital stock. Article 262 of the Colombian Commerce Code prohibits the Bank's subsidiaries from acquiring stock of the Bank.\n\nPursuant to Decree 663 of 1993, as amended, any transaction resulting in an individual or entity holding 10% or more of",

        "page_content": "the outstanding shares of any Colombian financial institution, including, in the case of the Bank, transactions resulting in holding ADRs representing 10% or more of the subscribed capital stock of the Bank, is subject to the prior authorization of the SFC. For that purpose, the SFC must evaluate the proposed transaction based on the criteria and guidelines specified in Decree 663 of 1993. Transactions entered into without the prior approval of the SFC are null and void and cannot be recorded in the Bank's stock ledger. These restrictions apply equally to Colombian and foreign investors.\n\n## Bankruptcy Considerations\n\nColombian  banks  and  other  financial  institutions  are  subject  to  special  rules  regarding  insolvency,  restructuring  and liquidation. Pursuant to Colombian banking law, the SFC has the power to intervene in the operations of a bank in order to prevent it from, or to control and reduce the effects of, a bank failure. The SFC also conducts periodic visits to financial institutions and may impose capital or solvency obligations on financial institutions without taking control of such financial institutions\n\nThe SFC may intervene in a bank's business: (i) prior to the liquidation of the bank, in order to prevent the bank from entering into a state where the SFC would need to take possession by taking one of the following recovery measures ('institutos de salvamento'): (a) submitting the bank to a special supervision regime; (b) issuing a mandatory order to recapitalize the bank; (c) placing the bank under the management of another authorized financial institution, acting as trustee;  (d)  ordering  the  transfer  of  all  or  part  of  the  assets,  liabilities  and  contracts  of  the  bank  to  another  financial institution; (e) ordering the bank to merge with one or more financial institutions that consent to the merger; (f) ordering the adoption of a recovery plan by the bank pursuant to guidelines approved by the government; (g) ordering the exclusion of certain assets and liabilities by requiring the transfer of such assets and liabilities to another institution designated by the SFC; or (h) ordering the progressive unwinding ('desmonte progresivo') of the operations of the bank; or (ii) at any time, by taking possession of the bank to either administer the bank or order its liquidation, depending on how critical the situation is found to be by the SFC.\n\nThe financial conglomerates act also reinforced the mechanism for the resolution of credit institutions  - deposit-taking institutions under Colombian Law - by establishing the concept of the bridge bank, an entity used to facilitate the purchase of assets and transfer of liabilities from failing institutions.\n\nTaking possession is mandatory in the following events: (i) if the financial institution's technical capital falls below 40% of the legal minimum; or (ii) upon the expiration of the term of any then-current recovery plans or the non-fulfillment of the goals set forth in such plans.\n\nAdditionally, and subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance, the SFC may, at its discretion, initiate intervention procedures against a bank under the following circumstances: (i) suspension of payments; (ii) failure to pay deposits; (iii) refusal to submit its files, accounts and supporting documentation for inspection by the SFC; (iv) refusal to be interrogated under oath regarding its business; (v) repeated failure to comply with orders and instructions from the SFC; (vi) repeated violations of applicable laws and regulations or of the bank's by-laws; (vii) unauthorized or fraudulent management of the bank's business; (viii) reduction of the bank's net worth below 50% of its subscribed capital; (ix) existence of serious inconsistencies in the information provided to the SFC that, at its discretion, impedes the SFC to accurately understand the situation of the bank; (x) failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements; (xi) failure to comply with the recovery plans that were adopted by the bank; (xii) failure to comply with the order of exclusion of certain assets and liabilities to another institution designated by the SFC; and (xiii) failure to comply with the order of progressive unwinding of the operations of the bank.\n\nUpon the taking of possession of a bank, the SFC may (but is not required to) order the bank to suspend payments to its creditors. The SFC has the power to determine that such suspension will affect all of the obligations of the bank, or only certain types of obligations or even obligations up to or in excess of a specified amount.\n\nAs a result of a taking of possession, the SFC must appoint as special agent the person or entity designated by Fogafin to administer the affairs of the bank while such process lasts and until it is decided whether to liquidate the bank.\n\nIf the underlying problems that gave rise to the taking of possession of the bank are not resolved within a term not to",

        "page_content": "exceed two years, the SFC must order the liquidation of the bank.\n\nDuring a taking of possession (which period ends when the liquidation process begins), Colombian banking laws prevent any creditor of the bank from: (i) initiating any procedure for the collection of any amount owed by the bank; (ii) enforcing any judicial decision rendered against the bank to secure payment of any of its  obligations; (iii) constituting a lien or attachment over any of the assets of the bank to secure payment of any of its obligations; or (iv) making any payment, advance or compensation or assuming any obligation on behalf of the bank, with the funds or assets that may belong to it and are held by third parties,  except  for  payments  that  are  made  by  way  of  set-off  between  regulated  entities  of  the Colombian financial and insurance systems.\n\nIn the event that the bank is liquidated, the SFC must, among other measures, provide that all term obligations owed by the bank are due and payable as of the date when the order to liquidate becomes effective.\n\nIn the event of liquidation, bank deposits and certain other types of saving instruments are excluded from the process and paid prior to any other liabilities. The remaining claims are recognized in accordance with applicable law and the following rank: (i) claims related to court expenses incurred in the interest of all creditors, wages and other obligations related with employment contracts and tax authorities' credits regarding national and local taxes; (ii) claims secured by liens; (iii) claims secured by real estate collateral, such as mortgages; (iv) other claims of the tax authorities that are not included in the first class of claims and claims of suppliers of raw materials and inputs to the debtor; and (v) finally, all other claims without any priority or privilege, provided, however, that among credits of the fifth class, subordinated debt will be ranked junior to the external liabilities ('pasivos externos') and senior only to capital stock. Each category of creditors will collect in the order indicated above, whereby distributions in one category will be subject to the full satisfaction of claims in the prior category.\n\n## Deposit Insurance-Troubled Financial Institutions\n\nSubject  to  specific  limitations,  Fogafin  is  authorized  to  provide  equity  (whether  or  not  reducing  the  par  value  of  the recipient's shares) and/or secured credits to troubled financial institutions, and to insure deposits of commercial banks and certain other financial institutions.\n\nTo protect the customers of commercial banks and certain financial institutions, Resolution 1 of 2012 of the board of directors of Fogafin, as amended, requires mandatory deposit insurance. Banks must pay an annual premium of 0.30% of total funds received on saving accounts, checking accounts, certificates of deposit and other deposits, which is paid in four quarterly installments. If a bank is liquidated, the deposit insurance will cover the funds deposited by an individual or corporation with such bank up to a maximum of COP 50,000,000 regardless of the number of accounts held.\n\n## Risk Management Systems\n\nCommercial banks must have risk administration systems to meet the SFC minimum standards for compliance and to avoid and mitigate the following risks: (i) credit; (ii) liquidity; (iii) market; (iv) operational; (v) money laundering and terrorism; (vi) counterparty; (vii) interest rate risk in the banking book; and (viii) country risk.\n\nThrough  External  Circular  018  of  2021,  the  SFC  issued  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  Comprehensive  Risk Management System ('Sistema Integral de Administraci\u00f3n de Riesgos', or 'SIAR'), which is effective since June 1, 2023, except for certain provisions related to risk data aggregation and reporting, which became effective since December 31, 2023. These provisions require financial entities to have a global vision of the risks to which they are exposed, since it integrates the management of credit, market, operational, liquidity, counterparty, guarantee, insurance and country risks.\n\nCommercial banks generally have several risk measurement methods, including the risk weighted assets measurement which is calculated according to weight percentages assigned to different types of assets. There are some exceptions in which the weight percentage is higher and is calculated based on the associated risk perception of the evaluated asset. Provisions, which are calculated on a monthly basis, are another risk measurement method. The above only applies to stand-alone financial statements.",

        "page_content": "With respect to market risks, commercial banks must follow the provisions of the External Circular 100 of 1995 issued by the SFC ('Basic Accounting Circular'), which defines criteria and procedures for measuring a bank's exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks. Under such regulations, banks must submit to the SFC information on the net present value, duration, and interest rate of its assets, liabilities, and derivative positions. Colombian banks are required to calculate, for each position on the statement of financial position, a volatility rate and a parametric value at risk ('VaR'), which is calculated based on net present value, modified duration and a risk factor computed in terms of a basis points change. Each risk factor is calculated and provided by the SFC.\n\nWith respect to liquidity risk, financial entities must meet a liquidity coverage test that ensures their ability to hold liquid assets  sufficient  to  cover  potential  net  cash  outflows  for  a  period  of  30  days.  Net  cash  outflows  for  this  purpose  are contractual maturities of assets (interbank borrowings, financial assets investments, loans and advances to customers, derivative financial instruments) minus contractual maturities of liabilities (demand deposits, time deposits, interbank deposits borrowings from other financial institutions, debt instruments, derivative financial instruments) occurring within a  period of 30 days. For purposes of this calculation, liabilities do not include projections of future transactions. The maturity  of  the  loan  portfolio  is  affected  by  the  historical  default  indicator  and  the  maturity  of  deposits  is  modeled according to the regulation.\n\nFinancial  entities  are  also  required  to  meet  the  Net  Stable  Funding  Ratio  ('Coeficiente  de  Fondeo  Estable  Neto'  or 'NSFR') requirements. The NSFR requires credit institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets. The NSFR is a ratio that seeks to limit excessive dependency on unreliable financing sources for strategic assets which are often illiquid. The NSFR is defined as the amount of Available Stable Funding, which includes equity and liabilities that will remain with the credit institution for more than one year. This ratio should be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis (Fondeo Estable Disponible or 'FED') of the amount of Required Stable  Funding  ('Fondeo  Estable  Requerido').  The  ratio  started  to  be  reported  on  March  31,  2020.  Nonetheless,  the External Circular 013 of 2023 maintained until August 31, 2025 the 25% weighting for the FED in demand and term deposits (less than six months) of financial entities and open collective investment funds, noting that this does not affect the schedule of convergence and compliance with the regulatory minimum of the NSFR in the terms established in External Circular 019 of 2019.\n\nWith respect to operational risk, commercial banks must assess, according to principles provided by the Basic Accounting Circular, each of their business lines (such as corporate finance, purchases and sales of securities, commercial banking, asset management, etc.) in order to record the risk events that may occur and result in fraud, technology problems, legal and reputational problems and problems associated with labor relations at the applicable bank.\n\nFollowing international best practices to better manage adverse movements in interest rates, External Circular 025 of 2022 recently incorporated (within the SIAR), includes requirements related to interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). To adequately manage the present or future risk on capital and earnings, the aforementioned External Circular considers the Economic Value of Equity (EV) affected by possible changes in the value of assets/liabilities and the Net Interest Margin (NIM), affected by possible changes in income/expenses. Regarding country risk, the Bank must implement a model that accounts for the potential losses it could incur with respect to financial operations abroad, including equity investments, due to a deterioration in the economic and/or socio-political conditions of the receiver country.\n\n## Internal Control System Framework\n\nThe SFC updated its Internal Control System Framework by issuing External Circular 008 of 2023 with the goal of converging towards best international practices and promoting the development of robust corporate governance structures, collecting the recommendations included in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), the Three Lines Model of the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and the guidelines defined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) on corporate governance. These new rules come into effect on May 16, 2024.\n\n## Cybersecurity Rules\n\nExternal Circular 007 of 2018 issued by the SFC, modified by External Circular 033 of 2020, contains the cybersecurity",

The frameworks (i) provides financial entities with a set of minimum requirements with respect to  information  security  and  cybersecurity  management, (ii)  defines  a  single  taxonomy  to  standardize  the reporting of metrics and incidents related to information security and cybersecurity and (iii) adopts the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP).\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering Provisions\n\nThe regulatory framework to prevent and control money laundering is contained in, among others, Decree 663 of 1993; the External Circular 029 of 2014 issued by the SFC modified by External Circular 011 of 2022 ; and the Colombian Criminal Code, as amended.\n\nColombian laws adopt the latest guidelines related to anti-money laundering and other terrorist activities established by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ('FATF'). Colombia, as a member of the GAFI-SUD (a FATFstyle regional body), follows the FATF's recommendations. In 2022, the SFC introduced new requirements for financial entities  and  their  risk  management  systems  for  Anti-Money  Laundering/Combating  the  Financing  of  Terrorism (AML/CFT) - in Colombia referred to as the 'Sistema  de  Administraci\u00f3n  del  Riesgo  de  Lavado de  Activos  y  de  la Financiaci\u00f3n  del  Terrorismo'  ('SARLAFT').  The  new  SARLAFT  requirements  include  due  diligence  on  ultimate beneficial owners and politically exposed persons; countermeasures to circumstances that involve high-risk countries; information requirements in international and domestic transactions; supervision in correspondent activities; enhancement of technology tools and digital use of potential customer's identity, among others.\n\nFinancial  institutions  must  cooperate  with  the  appropriate  authorities  to  prevent  and  control  money  laundering  and terrorism financing. Finally, the Colombian Criminal Code introduced criminal rules and regulations to prevent, control, detect, eliminate and adjudicate all matters related to financing terrorism and money laundering, including the omission of reports on cash transactions, mobilization or storage of cash, and the lack of controls.\n\n## Consumer Protection\n\nLaw 1328 of 2009  establishes  a  set  of  rights  and  responsibilities  for  customers  of  the  financial  system  and  a  set  of obligations for financial institutions in order to minimize disputes. This law also gives foreign banks more flexibility to operate  in  Colombia  through  'branches'.  Following  its  adoption,  credit  institutions  are  allowed  to  operate  leasing businesses  and  banks  were  allowed  to  extend  loans  to  third  parties  so  that  borrowers  could  acquire  control  of  other companies.\n\nPursuant to External Circular 023 of 2021 issued by the SFC, Smartsupervision technology was implemented to provide a mechanism for the detailed monitoring of petitions, complaints or claims ('Peticiones, Quejas & Reclamos' or 'PQR'). This mechanism, provided by the SFC, allows financial consumers to submit petitions, complaints or claims and for them to be answered in due time and in the appropriate manner.\n\n## Payments System\n\nIn 2023, Colombia decided to promote an Immediate Payments System ('SPI' in Spanish) framework consistent with international practices in this area, such as those of Brazil with Pix and the United States with its recent FedNow system. Resolution 6 of 2023 and  Circular DSP-465 issued by the Central Bank sets out the legal framework establishing a new payment ecosystem, that will be managed by the Central Bank and will allow the interoperability of technologies, systems and entities in an interbank instant payments infrastructure, making use of secure communication protocols and advanced encryption standards. According to the announced schedule, which contemplates five implementation phases, the project will be completed in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n## Regulatory Framework for Subsidiaries that are Non-Participants in the Financial Sector\n\nBancolombia's Colombian subsidiaries that do not provide financial services are governed by the laws and regulations embodied in the Colombian Civil Code and the Colombian Commercial Code as well as any regulations issued by the SIC and the Superintendency of Corporations or any other type of special regulations that may be applicable to the commercial",

In addition, certain subsidiaries of Bancolombia located in other countries have transmitted directly to the IRS the information required pursuant to FATCA, since those other countries have not entered into an IGA.\n\n## CRS\n\nThe CRS, approved by the OECD Council in 2014, is applicable to signatory countries of the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement ('MCAA') and requires signatory countries to obtain information from their financial institutions and  automatically  exchange  that  information  with  other  jurisdictions  on  an  annual  basis.  The  CRS  defines  (i)  which financial institutions are required to report; (ii) the types of accounts covered; and (iii) the due diligence procedures that financial institutions must follow to identify the reporting information.\n\nAmong the countries where Bancolombia operates, Colombia and Panam\u00e1, have entered into the MCAA.\n\nCompliance with the terms of the international conventions signed for the exchange of information under CRS, the laws or any other regulations enforced in the relevant jurisdictions may increase Bancolombia's compliance costs.\n\n## Financial Regulation in Panama\n\nThe banking business in Panama is regulated by Law Decree 9 of 1998 (as amended to date, including by means of Law Decree 2 of 2008, the \"Banking Law\"). Pursuant to the Banking Law, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama  (the  'Superintendency  of  Banks  of  Panama'),  as  banking  supervisor,  has  the  power  to  issue  accords  and resolutions to regulate the banking system. These regulations focus mainly on matters such as bank licensing, corporate governance, banking supervision (consolidated and individual or sub consolidated), capital requirements, capital adequacy, liquidity requirements, risk management (credit, market, liquidity, country, asset and liability, operational, information technology, electronic banking), external audit, on-site inspections, reporting, compliance, changes of control, mergers and  acquisitions,  confidentiality,  money  laundering,  voluntary  liquidation,  administrative  and  operational  control, reorganization, bankruptcy, sanctions, client protection and dispute resolution.\n\nTo implement Basel III capital standards, the Superintendency of Banks of Panama issued Accord 1-2015 establishing capital adequacy standards. This accord establishes new requirements for the  composition of a banking entity's capital base, as well as for capital adequacy ratios, including the core Tier 1 capital ratio and the Tier 1 capital ratio, all in line with Basel III standards. This accord became effective in June 2016 and, as of January 1, 2019, the new rules were fully implemented.\n\nIn addition, in October 2023, the Superintendency of Banks of Panama issued Accord 5-2023, which establishes rules on the capital conservation buffer to ensure that banks accumulate reserves that can be used in the event of incurring losses. According to this new Accord, banks must establish a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets (credit, market  and  operational),  comprised  of  ordinary  primary  capital  and  in  addition  to  all  minimum  regulatory  capital requirements.  This accord will become effective as of July 1, 2024, and banks will have until July 2026 to comply with it.",

        "page_content": "In terms of liquidity, banks with a general license are required to maintain 30% of their global deposits in liquid assets (which include short-term loans to other banks and other liquid assets) of the type prescribed by the Superintendency of Banks of Panama. Additionally, banks with a general license are required to maintain assets in Panama of not less than 60% of their local deposits or any other percentage set by the Superintendency of Banks of Panama. Under the Banking Law, central bank deposits and other similar deposits of international reserves of sovereign states enjoy immunity from seizure  or  attachment  proceedings.  In  2018,  the  Superintendency  of  Banks  of  Panama,  moving  forward  with  the implementation of Basel III liquidity standards, issued a Liquidity Coverage Ratio ('LCR') Accord that requires general license banks to maintain high-quality liquid assets in relation to their short-term net cash outflows.  Daily compliance with the LCR (high-quality liquid assets as a percentage of net cash outflows) was implemented progressively, starting in December 2018 with a compliance rate of 25%, reaching a compliance rate of 100% in December 2022.\n\nThe Superintendency of Banks of Panama has also issued regulations consistent with Basel III standards regarding capital requirements for market risk in the trading book, regulations to improve country risk management and operational risk management, as well as governance and controls relating to investment in securities.\n\nPanamanian  regulations  also  require  all  financial  institutions  to  maintain  a  legal  reserve  for  certain  obligations.  The Superintendency of Banks of Panama may require additional marginal reserves. The exact level and method of calculation of these reserve requirements is established by the Superintendency of Banks of Panama.\n\nRegarding  credit  risk,  in  March  2016,  the  Superintendency  of  Banks  of  Panama  issued  Agreement  3-2016,  which establishes rules for the determination of risk-weighted assets applicable to on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, which are  more  risk-sensitive  in  line  with  Basel  II  and  Basel  III  standards.  This  Accord  introduced  the  treatment  of counterparty exposures in derivative transactions, as well as credit risk mitigation techniques, such as the treatment of financial guarantees.\n\nIn Panama, banks are prohibited from granting, directly or indirectly, to any natural or legal person, including any entity that is part of a bank's economic group, any loan or line of credit, guarantee or any other obligation (other than credit facilities fully secured by deposits in the bank) in favor of such person that exceeds at any time, individually or jointly, 25% of the bank's total regulatory capital. Related party obligations (as such term is defined in the applicable regulations) exceeding (i) 5% of its total capital, in the case of unsecured transactions, and (ii) 10% of its total capital, in the case of secured transactions (other than loans secured by deposits with the bank) are prohibited.\n\nBanks,  banking  group  companies  and  non-bank  and  non-financial  affiliates  are  subject  to  inspection  by  the Superintendency of Banks of Panama, which must take place at least once every two years. The Superintendency of Banks of Panama is empowered to request from any bank or company belonging to the economic group of which a bank in Panama is a member, the documents and reports corresponding to its operations and activities.\n\nThe Superintendency of Banks of Panama is empowered to assume administrative and operational control of a bank, including  the  possession  of  its  assets  and  the  exercise  of  its  administration,  to  defend  the  best  interest  of  the  bank's depositors and creditors, under any of the following grounds: (i) at the request of the bank; (ii) if the bank is unable to continue its operations without endangering the interests of depositors; (iii) as a consequence of the evaluation of an advisor's report; (iv) failure to comply with measures ordered by the Superintendency of Banks of Panama; (v) if the bank conducts  its  operations  in  an  illegal,  negligent  or  fraudulent  manner;  (vi)  if  the  bank  has  suspended  payment  of  its obligations;  and  (vii)  if  the  Superintendency  of  Banks  of  Panama  determines  that  the  capital  adequacy,  solvency  or liquidity of the bank has deteriorated in such a manner as to require the intervention of the Superintendency of Banks of Panama. Upon expiration of the administrative control period, the Superintendent will decide whether to proceed with the reorganization of the bank, the compulsory liquidation of the bank or the return of administrative and operational control to the directors or legal representatives of the bank.\n\nThe Superintendency of Banks of Panama is also in charge of the supervision and oversight of the trust business, regulated by (i) Law 1 of 1984 which establishes aspects such as minimum requirements for trust contracts, characteristics of trusts, rights and responsibilities of settlors, trustee and beneficiaries and (ii) Law 21 of 2017 which strengthens the supervisory and regulatory capacities of the Superintendency of Banks of Panama with respect to the trust business and imposes rules with respect to trust licensing, accounting, corporate governance and reporting.",

One of the important modifications with this rule is that it centralizes the payment of all civil, commercial, tax and labor debts, which the debtor has with or without guarantee through the bankruptcy judicial process.\n\nDecree 27-2022, Law of Preferential Interest to Facilitate Access to Social Housing (Ley de Inter\u00e9s Preferencial para Facilitar el Acceso a la Vivienda Social), regulates a mechanism where the State partially subsidizes the interest rate that customers must pay for mortgage loans on the purchase of a first home in decent conditions, promoting access to housing to the population with limited resources. It is important to note that banks and entities  authorized to grant credits, will collect the subsidy, applying the corresponding discount in their monthly income tax return or payment of other taxes caused, therefore the State will not make any disbursement for the subsidy to financial institutions, transferring the burden to the banks for the collection of the same.\n\nResolution JM-47-2022, contains the Regulations for Credit Risk Management (Reglamento para la Administraci\u00f3n de Riesgo de Cr\u00e9dito), which regulates the certain activities of banks, offshore entities and companies of a financial group that grant financing, such as the minimum information of applicants and debtors, and the valuation of credit assets.

Together, these laws reinforce the legal infrastructure for cybersecurity in Guatemala, promoting modernization and transparency in governmental management, and enhancing cybersecurity.\n\n## B.9        CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK\n\nSee Item 16 k. 'Cybersecurity'\n\n## B.10      ESG\n\n## General approach to ESG\n\nSince  2014,  we  have  sought  to  deepen  the  integration  of  sustainability  criteria  in  our  product  offering,  our recommendations to the market and our investment strategy. This commitment is aligned with a global agenda, which is to comply with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), designed to achieve more prosperous societies and protect the planet.\n\nIn the Group, we believe in responsible and sustainable investment, and we are aware that ESG criteria are essential to the conduct of our business. We seek to incorporate these criteria as a fundamental and integral element in all our investment processes.  Leading  indexes  worldwide  constantly  monitor  the  performance  of  companies  in  environmental,  social, economic,  and  corporate  governance  terms.  Bancolombia  is  included  in  many  of  these  indexes,  encouraging  the implementation of ESG practices.\n\nWe understand ESG as the environmental, social and governance issues that are relevant for the Group to endure over time, balancing the risks, opportunities and efficiencies that arise from this concept. With respect to environmental aspects, this  covers  our  climate  change  strategy,  decarbonization  strategy  and  eco-efficiency  strategy.   With  respect  to  social aspects, this covers issues related to financial inclusion, gender, human rights and talent and culture strategies. With respect to economic and governance aspects, this covers Board of Directors governance, the fiscal strategy, the codes of ethics and conduct and the sustainable business strategy.\n\nRegarding regulation of ESG matters, in Colombia, the Government issued Decree 151 of 2021, which reformed the information  disclosure  regime  by  securities  issuers,  such  as  the  Bank,  providing  a  two-year  transition  period  for  its implementation.  The Bank has identified the required disclosure under the TCFD and SASB ('Sustainability Accounting Standards Board') and is establishing a disclosure framework to comply with the new regulations. We released the first report in March 2024 for Colombia Circular 031, which includes TCFD and SASB. Last, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted its  climate-related  disclosure  rules  that  will  required  foreign  private  issuers,  such  as  the  Bank,  to  expand  its climate-related disclosure in the future.\n\n## Environmental Dimension\n\nWe seek to identify the direct and indirect impacts of our activities and encourage the prevention, mitigation, and correction of them.\n\nThe  strategy  of  our  environmental  management  model  is  directly  related  to  our  business  strategy.  We  have  set  up environmental policies, which include environmental and social risk analysis, environmental management, controversial issues in financing and investment, responsible investment, climate change and sustainable procurement.",

        "page_content": "As a field in constant evolution, climate occupies a top position in our broader environmental agenda, and we recognize that managing climate-related risks and opportunities is vital to the long-term sustainability of the Bank. For this reason, Bancolombia became one of the founding banks of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is an industry-led Alliance,  hosted  by  the  United  Nations  Environment  Program  Finance  Initiative  (UNEP  FI)  and  co-launched  by  the Financial  Services  Taskforce  (FSTF).  Under  this  alliance  (NZBA),  Bancolombia  committed  to;  (1)  transition  all operational and attributable GHG emissions from our lending and investment portfolios to align with pathways to net-zero by mid-century, or sooner, including CO2 emissions reaching net-zero at the latest by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100; (2) use decarbonization scenarios from credible and wellrecognized sources; and (3) prioritize our efforts where we have, or can have, the most significant impact, i.e. the most GHG-intensive and GHG-emitting sectors within our portfolios,  which  are key  to  the  transition  to  a  net-zero  carbon economy.\n\nBancolombia has identified physical and transition risks in some critical sectors in its loan portfolio and investments that can generate potential losses for the Bank. For more information on these risks, please refer to Item 3.D. Risk Factors 'The Bank is exposed to ESG risks that could affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations'. On February 2021, Bancolombia launched its Climate Change Policy to support our clients in the transitioning to a low carbon economy. This policy includes the following sectors: coal mining, coal-fired power generation, oil production, livestock, cement manufacturing,  iron  and  steel  manufacturing,  air  transport,  shipping,  and  vehicle  manufacturing.  We  have  stated  our commitment to provide no new financing to companies engaged in coal mining or coal-fired power generation and to progressively reduce our exposure to these sectors through 2030.  In 2023, we included unconventional sources of oil and gas (shale oil and gas, ultra-deepwater, Arctic oil, Amazon Basin oil, oil sands and liquefied natural gas) in the list of controversial activities to which we will not provide financing or invest in.\n\nWe measure and manage our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\nFor our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, we have defined a target of reducing our emissions by 95% for 2030 against a baseline for 2019. 2023 saw a reduction of 38% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions against 2022.\n\nFor Scope 3 categories 1 and 6 (purchased goods and services, business travel), the defined reduction target is 50% for 2030 with a baseline for 2019.  2023 emissions increased 3% in against 2022 as a result of the resumption of business travel.\n\nA target for Oil & Gas has been defined using the Temperature Rating methodology developed by SBTi because no Sectoral Decarbonization Approaches (SDA) has been published for this sector.\n\nTargets  for  the  Cement  and  Power  (including  electricity  derived  from  coal)  have  been  defined  using  the  Sectoral Decarbonization Approaches (SDA) published by SBTi.\n\nThe remaining sectors have been analyzed using a Temperature Rating approach, but we expect to update them as new SDA guidance and tools are released. This distribution may evolve as higher quality of data is incorporated into the analysis, e.g. emissions directly reported by clients, improved emission factors, among others.\n\nWe are implementing a strategy of engagement with our main clients from the critical sectors (i.e. those that have the highest financed emissions) to define science based targets, pathways for mitigating emissions, and commit to sectoral decarbonization approaches aligned with 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. During 2023 we engaged 25 corporate clients from the O&G, cement, power, agriculture, manufacturing, retail and food sectors, which together comprise around 25% of the financed emissions from our commercial loans portfolio, to better understand and support their climate strategies.\n\nFrom the investment perspective through the asset management business, Bancolombia has joined the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative by committing to align investment portfolios with carbon-neutral scenarios by 2050 and we have implemented actions to achieve our goals. We measure the CO2e emissions financed by our investment portfolio, and we defined our science-based targets, submitted for validation by Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi). The emissions are coming mainly from investments in Private Debt, followed by ETFs and Mutual Funds.",

        "page_content": "Our risk management system uses a risk map, in which we consolidate relevant information and knowledge from various experts that supplements the management of traditional financial risks with information on emerging risks such as climate change. We carry out this process annually, with the purpose of keeping the risk assessment updated and being able to adjust our strategy with respect to the most significant risks identified. As part of this process, climate change has been highlighted as a key risk since 2021 and integrated for analysis with other traditional financial risks. This approach allows us to strengthen our climate change responses and prepares us for opportunities in a changing business environment.\n\nBancolombia also defined a goal of financing the transition to a low carbon economy for an amount of COP 40 trillion by 2030. We are working to engage clients and ensure an adequate transformation of their practices towards a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn 2023 we applied a methodological process to measure the impacts of physical and transition risks, of certain of our clients, through the identification and prioritization of economic sectors that generate high levels of greenhouse gases. This process was carried out for the oil & gas, cement, and iron and steel economic sectors which are considered as highly intensive sectors in the generation of greenhouse gas emissions and managed through the ESG Risk Corporate Policy. This policy determines the support mechanisms for clients that are greenhouse gas emissions intensive and drives them towards a  low-carbon  economy  which,  in  turn,  facilitates  the  decarbonization  of  our  portfolio.  Likewise,  in  the  prioritization process carried out in Bancolombia's credit portfolio in 2022, these sectors were also identified by their vulnerability to climate events and regulatory, technological and market changes.\n\nIn terms of physical risk, Bancolombia has developed assessments to quantify physical risks related to our clients and our own  operation.  These  assessments  consider  the  effect  of  physical  risks  on  real  estate  guarantees,  effects  on  loans guaranteed by trust vehicles and impacts on clients or industries affected by extreme climate events.\n\nThe identification and prioritization processes began in Bancolombia and then expanded to the other subsidiaries of the Group in 2024, following the recommendations of  UNEP-FI. This process covers various analyzes, such as dependence on natural  resources,  energy sources,  operational  assets,  productive  activities,  as  well  as  socio-environmental  impact, among others.\n\nWe also assess transition risks that could arise, for example, from climate-related legislation and policy developments, and business  trends  and  changes  in  consumer  behavior  related  to  climate  change  and  technology  (such  as  the  process  of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy). New climate-related regulations or interpretations of existing laws may result in enhanced disclosure obligations, which could negatively affect our clients and materially increase the regulatory burden and cost of compliance. In assessing the impact of transition risks on our clients, we consider aspects such as the cost of direct and indirect emissions, investments in capital expenditures (capex) and income.\n\nTo direct our efforts to the economic sectors that are most impacted by climate change, we have built a methodology that helps us prioritize certain physical and transition risks and the impact of such risks in our customers' financial statements (for purposes of assessing credit risk). This methodology is based on the guidelines provided by UNEP-FI, allowing us to evaluate both risks in an consolidated way in line with the best international practices.\n\nFor  physical  risks,  climate  threats  are  analyzed  using  the  representative  concentration  pathways  proposed  by  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) where scenarios are used to project different climate threats and evaluate the loss of value of operating assets and/or production losses due to the materialization of any of these threats.\n\nThe infrastructure of our buildings and transactional channels (branches, ATMs and correspondents) has been analyzed to assess  their  physical  threats,  which  assessment  covers  the  stages  of  identification,  measurement  and  management  of physical  risks.  In  addition,  insurance  coverage  for  these  risks  has  been  analyzed  and  operational  risks  and  business continuity processes have been put in place to define controls and strategies.  By understanding the joint vulnerability of our facilities to these climate threats, we strengthen our ability to implement mitigation and adaptation strategies that preserve Bancolombia's operational continuity. The result of this assessment highlights the most critical locations.\n\nDisclosure of climate change risks is extremely important in our effort to be transparent with our stakeholders. For this reason, Bancolombia adopted the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) commitments in 2019 to",

The Bank has established a corporate policy  for  its  loan  portfolio  related  to  sectors  with  a  high  impact  on  climate,  such  as  coal  extraction  and  coal  power generation.  The  policy  includes  qualitative  risk  identification  and  risk  mitigation  measures.  Some  of  the  mitigation measures include:\n\n- \u00b7 Permanent social networks and mass media monitoring to identify alerts that may damage the trust of any of the Bank's stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 A narrative which focuses on the Bank's purpose and its ESG strategy, used to guide commercial teams in its relationship  with  different  stakeholders  and  the  advice  they  provide  to  affected  clients  through  the  transition process for the next 10 years.\n- \u00b7 Conversations with opinion leaders, editors, and journalists from the mass media, so that they understand the positive impacts on the environment and economy that will be obtained from the Bank's transition strategy.\n- \u00b7 A methodology to identify and measure the ESG risks to which the organization is exposed, and which takes into account that ESG risk management requires a wide degree of implementation within the entity as most of the risks are transversal, with presence in all areas of the organization.\n\nEcoefficiency: With  our  operational  ecoefficiency  program,  we  seek  to  reduce  the  direct  impact  to  the  environment associated with the consumption of natural resources required for our operations through the implementation of strategies to reduce our water, energy, paper, and business travel consumption and to reduce waste generation.\n\nDuring 2023, we strengthened the circular economy strategy and achieved the following results:\n\n- 1. Elimination of plastic  cups  in  buildings  and  replacement with  compostable  cups  in  the  areas  where  they  are required  and  in  the  branches,  with  a  campaign  of  culture  and  awareness  of  responsible  consumption  among employees.\n- 2. Partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which allows us to mobilize and promote the transition to the circular economy in Colombia and the countries where we have a presence. We are the first company in Latin America to become a partner of the Foundation, which also has a presence in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nWe have set long-term goals to align our actions and performance with global standards such as the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). We have defined climate change-related targets for scopes 1 and 2, i.e. for our direct operations. We are committed to reducing our emissions by 73% by 2024 compared to our 2019 emissions. This goal was established in accordance with the SBTi (Science Base Target Initiative) methodologies.\n\n## Social Dimension\n\nWe promote financial inclusion, gender equality, and investment in initiatives that reduce social gaps and improve the communities' wellness in the countries where we operate.\n\nSince 2013, by declaring our Human Rights Policy, we made public our commitment to \"respect, promote and remediate human rights\" in compliance with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the ILO standards, and the laws of the countries where we operate.

Through the Support Line, which is part of this system, in 2023, we provided psychological first aid to more than 1,156 employees.\n\nWe have also implemented programs related to care economics and responsible co-parenting. We launched the Creando V\u00ednculos (Creating Bonds) initiative to encourage and support equal participation of both parents in caregiving tasks. Through this program, 76 employees were able to benefit from extended leave and the option to work from home to spend more time with their newborns.\n\n## Talent Attraction and Engagement:\n\nWe have processes designed to attract Talent with the skills, abilities, and attitudes required to achieve our Purpose. One of  our  goals  is  to  ensure  the  professional  development  of  our  employees  through  an  equitable  vacancy procedure.  In Colombia, 52.5% of our vacancies are filled through internal selection processes.\n\nOur recruitment indicator average at the corporate level shows a natural process of talent renewal and allows us to attract new employees with innovative knowledge and new proposals. The Bank's total and voluntary turnover rates for 2023 were 8.83% and 4.41%, respectively, representing a better performance than 2022, when they were 11.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Various events and initiatives were carried out to strengthen our brand and position ourselves as one of the Best Companies to work for in the countries where we operate. These initiatives were also focused on retaining employees with Key knowledge and, in turn, attracting new professionals in strategic areas, such as technology, cybersecurity, design, analytics, and artificial intelligence.\n\n## B Movement, our Culture Strategy:\n\n2023 marks the third year since implementing our current culture strategy, which defines the traits and behaviors that 'identify us and the way we act', as well as the actions that are not tolerated within the organization. These values shape how we relate and make decisions at Bancolombia, emphasizing the importance of building close relationships based on trust, diversity, inclusion, equity, and collaboration, driving our consistent and transparent actions.",

For this reason, managing it is our priority to enhance team performance and thus avoid increasing our turnover rate.\n\nThroughout 2023, we have made a substantial investment in developing our employees through various programs tailored to the strategic needs of the business and best practices. The aim is to contribute to the evolution of our employees, assisting them in reaching their best potential.\n\nWe define different mechanisms that seek the democratization of knowledge, facilitating the evolution of profiles and their enrichment through a structured, intentional, and comprehensive offer of content (Learning Schools, training maps, digital strategies, and scholarships) so employees manage to develop their learning behaviors according to the skills needed for today and the future.\n\nIn 2023, we invested more than 1,451,375 hours in training our employees, which resulted in an estimated value of more than USD 5,907,712.84, which included the following initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 We invested around USD 305,560 in developing our Talent Pool. With this, we aim to anticipate future needs and  challenges  by  comprehensively  preparing  the  talents  who  will  take  on  leadership  roles  within  the organization.\n- \u00b7 In Colombia, we have six Learning Schools oriented towards reskilling and upskilling, where more than 9,000 employees were trained. In the reskilling schools, 60% of the participants moved forward within their career paths, and 49 employees chose to continue their training in one of the three Learning Specialized Paths in Data Science, Cybersecurity, or Software Development. In other geographies, eight Learning Schools allowed us to train more than 2,200 employees.\n- \u00b7 88.1%  of  our  leaders  acquired  new  knowledge  and  strengthened  their  skills  in  our  Leadership  Institute Certification.\n\nKey material factors in the social dimension related to our clients and the community include:\n\n- \u00b7 Through our financial inclusion initiatives, we provide free financial services for people to access savings and credit in order to become financially empowered and improve their quality of life.\n- \u00b7 Our inclusion platforms such as ,  Bancolombia A la mano ,  have brought us closer to people of different ages, socioeconomic levels and geographic regions, as deposits are managed at no cost and 100% digitally. In 2023, App Bancolombia A la Mano had more than 6.35 million users, 41.197 clients accessed credit for the first time and more than COP 74 billion in resources mobilized.\n- \u00b7 In Bancolombia we believe that development is only sustainable if it is also inclusive and generates well-being for all people, without distinction. Therefore, during 2023 we consolidated a diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) strategy in which we have been working on for more than 5 years with the aim of contributing to a world with fewer labels, in which each person can freely identify and promote their life project, without limits imposed by stereotypes.\n\nThis strategy that we created in 2022 led by a DEI team mobilizes all the necessary resources and capacities inside and outside the organization. Some of our achievements in 2023 are:\n\n- \u00b7 We received the Aequales certification, a recognition that only few other Colombian companies have received, which highlights the DEI Community that was created with our suppliers and allies to exchange knowledge and good practices on DEI topics. More than 300 business leaders in the country connected in 3 Community events,",

During  2023  we  were  also  part  of  the  Germina  Project,  together  with  Comfama,  USAID, Agricapital,  ImpactHub  and  MET  Community,  to  provide  loans  to  more  than  400  rural  entrepreneurs  and microentrepreneurs in Antioquia.\n\nWe continue to form alliances with national and international entities to further advance our strategy.  The key to achieving these results has been having committed leadership. In 2023 our CEO, Juan Carlos Mora Uribe, received from the She Is Foundation special recognition as business leader allied with gender equality and the empowerment of women.\n\nThrough the Bancolombia Foundation in 2023, we advanced in our objectives of being a laboratory of social innovation and a platform for impact connections between the capabilities of the Bancolombia Group, the ecosystem, and our local and international allies, to develop an impact management that contributes to the transformation of the Colombian countryside.\n\n## Education for productive insertion\n\nIn 2023, through our partnership with universities and our scholarship programs, we supported young people living in rural areas and facilitated their access to post-secondary education, providing them with mentoring and complementary training in financial education and employability, so that they can strengthen their skills in a comprehensive manner.\n\n## Financial Education\n\nFinancial Education has been one of the fundamental pillars of Fundaci\u00f3n Bancolombia's Education strategy since the start of the Cuentas sin Cuento program in 2018. By 2023, the program was consolidated in the rural sector of Colombia.\n\n## Corporate Volunteering\n\nThe impact talent program is a strategy to strengthen capacities in rural areas by leveraging the talent of the Group.\n\n## Business Strengthening and Territorial Preparation\n\nWe  strengthen  businesses  that  contribute  to  the  sustainability,  well-being  and  competitiveness  of  the  rural  areas  of Colombia by connecting with allies for a territorial impact in Colombia.\n\n## Impact investment\n\nThe focus of our impact investment management is environmental and social aspects in rural areas, which is carried out through  different  instruments  such  as  capital  investments  and  monitoring  of  resolution  of  business  challenges.  We currently have an impact investment fund that has investments in businesses with impact in rural areas for different sectors (fintech, rural tourism, agribusiness, technology, renewable energies, among others).",

        "page_content": "## Governance and Economic Dimension\n\nOur corporate strategy of principles and policies enables us to integrate ESG criteria into our business model and act sustainably. This strategy is established by the Board of Directors, serving as the body responsible for defining the strategy and long-term objectives of the company. Either directly or through its Committees, the Board oversees compliance with our sustainability strategy, supervision of the measures undertaken to mitigate climate change risk, adoption of principles for responsible investment and education of employees to make them aware of these principles and implementation of policies designed to ensure compliance with applicable law in the countries where we operate.\n\nWithin the ESG governance model, issues such as goals, strategy and sustainability actions were escalated to the Audit Committee, Risk Committee and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nAdditionally,  the  senior  management  committee  serves  as  the  Bank's  sustainability  committee  (the  'Sustainability Committee').    The  Sustainability  Committee  analyzes  the  business  opportunities,  risks  and  challenges  related  to sustainability  and  discusses  the  progress  of  our  ESG  agenda,  in  alignment  with  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related Financial Disclosure.\n\nThe Bank has a sustainability division that coordinates and drives the ESG agenda following our corporate strategy and policies. This division is led by a senior manager who sits on the Sustainability Committee.\n\nRegarding the diversity of the Board of Directors, Bancolombia seeks to promote a mix of experience, knowledge, and innovative and challenging visions, in accordance with the economic, social, and business environment. Bancolombia aims for  diversity  in  the  composition  of  its  Board  of  Directors,  particularly  in  gender  and  nationality.  Currently,  women represent 29% of our Board of Directors (2 out of 7 board members) and 29% are non-Colombian directors (2 out of 7 members). The directors' profiles can be consulted in Item 6.A. - 'Directors and Senior Management'.\n\nFor the appointment of members to the Board of Directors,  Bancolombia has determined that candidates must have a profile  that  includes  not  only  a  business  management  background,  but  also  a  commitment  to  the  development  of  a sustainable business, which is an aspect shareholders should consider before making an appointment. Accordingly, it is important for the Board to have a member that has sufficient knowledge and expertise in ESG matters. In the case of Bancolombia, Arturo Condo Tamayo, has been the Board member leading the Sustainability and Cybersecurity issues since 2016.\n\nThe corporate strategy of the Group aims to prepare us to handle challenges of and ensure that the objectives we have are successful in countries where we have a presence. This strategy includes: (i) maintaining our financial strength by growing responsibly,  (ii)  achieving  the  loyalty  and  preference  of  our  customers,  (iii)  developing  a  culture  and  talent  for competitiveness and (iv) achieving the well-being for everyone.\n\nIn  line  with  corporate  governance  principles,  Bancolombia  has  a  Code  of  Ethics  and  Conduct  that  reflects  our organizational culture based on ethical principles. This Code sets forth six cultural traits that employees must comply with and  put  into  practice  whenever  we  engage  with  one  another  and  with  stakeholders.  As  part  of  our  strategy  to  raise awareness about this Code, there is the mandatory training plan for Bancolombia's employees that includes an annual assessment of our Code of Ethics and Conduct guidelines. In addition, as part of the strategy, we are raising awareness among our commercial and administrative teams so that they increasingly incorporate the guidelines of our Code of Ethics and  Conduct.  Throughout  the  year,  we  also  disseminate  different  pieces  of  communication  discussing  the  specific guidelines of our Code of Ethics and Conduct.\n\nIn addition to the Good Governance Code and the Code of Ethics and Conduct, we have established the following policies to promote ethical behavior; Anti-Fraud Policy on Asset Misappropriation, Anti-Fraud Policy on Financial Reporting, Anti-Fraud Policy on Anti-Corruption, Policy of Zero Tolerance to Fraud and Policy on Contributions to Democracy and Political Activity. We also have the Integrity and Compliance Manual, which contains the framework for the Anti-Fraud Program. These documents are available to the whole organization, and some of them are published on our corporate web site for our stakeholders and the general public at:",

        "page_content": "https://www.grupobancolombia.com/corporate/corporate-governance/code-ethics\n\nAs a mechanism to support the promotion of our culture, we have different reporting channels for our employees and different stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, suppliers, allies and competitors, among others, to report any fact or suspected violation of the Code of Ethics and Conduct or related policies.  We also have a phone line called the 'Ethics  Line'  ( L\u00ednea  \u00c9tica ),  which  guarantees  the  confidentiality  of  employees  and  other  stakeholders  to  report, anonymously if the wish to, potential fraud, ethics violations and related issues. In addition we have a Whistleblower Protection policy.\n\nWe also have a point  of  contact  through  which  we  provide  ongoing  support  and  advice  to  all  employees  on  ethical dilemmas that may arise in their work, as well as on the interpretation of our Code of Ethics and Conduct.\n\nWe aim to generate greater ethical reasoning through the construction and dissemination of decision trees to assist ethical dilemmas, experiential learning for the contextualization of employees with risk scenarios aimed at their day-to-day work, and ongoing consulting support and training to commercial and administrative teams.\n\nIn addition, we have a Corporate Ethics Committee which aims to provide guidelines on ethics, conduct and integrity. The Committee also sets forth the necessary mechanisms to implement decisions under the highest internal standards of ethical conduct. The Corporate Ethics Committee is supported by local ethics committees, in each of the countries where we operate.\n\nWe  also  know  that  declaring  ourselves  a  customer-centric  organization  comes  with  considerable  challenges.  We incorporate  into  the  customer  experience  quality  measurement  an  understanding  of  our  customers'  willingness  to recommend us to others, using the net promoter score (NPS) methodology as the main indicator in the group of metrics that  allow  us  to  evaluate  the  organization's  overall  performance  in  this  regard.  The  use  of  this  indicator  allows  us  to understand not only the satisfaction of our customers, but also their loyalty to the brand. This metric is measured on a standard scale of 0 to 10, where customers who rate 0-6 are classified as Detractors, those who rate 7-8 are classified as Neutral and those who rate 9-10 are Promoters. Our NPS was 73.72 and 72.94 for the years 2023 and 2022 respectively.\n\nConcerning the economic dimension, we are integrating ESG aspects into our business strategy, including Retail Banking, Wealth Management, Corporate Banking, Asset Management and Project Finance. We know that ESG has an important role  in  addressing  sustainability  challenges  by  facilitating  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  and  stimulating sustainable development. To that end, we have set a goal to finance COP 500 trillion before 2030 through credit and other financial services. This goal to incorporate ESG variables extends to all our business segments and includes processes of due diligence, engagement, knowledge of clients and finance through innovative products for sustainable solutions.\n\nSome of the ESG aspects we have included in our business strategy include:\n\n- \u00b7 We developed the Sustainability credit line, which is a special financing line designed to support our customers in the development of projects that promote clean technologies, gender equality, renewable energies, efficient use of energy, clean fuels, and reduction of waste, emissions, and discharges, among other ESG-related uses of funds.\n- \u00b7 We also have been implementing a sustainable funding strategy. To date, we have issued six green or ESG-themed bonds for gross proceeds of USD 716 million that we have used to finance initiatives related to, among others, clean energy, sustainable construction, and cleaner production.\n\nRegarding our approach to risks, we have adopted the Equator Principles and the Performance Standards of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation - IFC, as standards for the identification, evaluation and management of environmental and social risks and impacts implicit in the operations and projects we finance.\n\nFinally, during this year, the Group made progress in ESG risk management by creating a corporate policy that standardizes the management of these risks in all the geographies where we have a presence. This policy aims to establish the guidelines and criteria for the identification, evaluation and management of environmental, social and governance risks associated with our operations and activities.

It also includes the evaluation of guarantees and assets received in payment. This chapter determines the minimum viability conditions for the execution of the process, which are specified through the local circulars of each bank in the Group.\n- 2. Controversial Issues in Business: Establishes the activities and projects in which the Group declares its nonparticipation. During this year, the following activities were additionally excluded: oil and gas extraction using non-conventional methods, such as fracking, liquefied natural gas, deep-water resources, tar sands, oil in the Arctic and in the Amazon.\n- 3. Industries sensitive to Climate Change: This chapter establishes the financing conditions for clients in sectors intensive in GHG emissions and the commercial support models for clients located in sectors in climate transition. During 2023, evaluations of these industries were extended to investment areas.\n\nWith the update of this circular, the scope of the roles and responsibilities of the commercial, sustainability and risks areas was reinforced. Additionally, work is being done on the implementation of indicators that facilitate the monitoring of compliance. Likewise, the automation of the Environmental and Social Risk Assessment process was completed, which allowed an increase in the coverage of these evaluations in the credit study.\n\n## C.

Volume and rate variances have been calculated based on movements in average balances over the period and changes in nominal interest rates on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities. Net changes attributable to changes in both volume and interest rate have been allocated to the change due to changes in volume.\n\n|                                                               |

This increase is due to: (i) an increase of 4.80% in the allowance for loan losses as a result of increased default in the loan portfolio and a less favorable economic outlook; and (ii) a decrease in the loan portfolio mainly due to the restatement of the Dollar loans into Colombian pesos due to a lower exchange rate at December 31, 2023 compared with December 31, 2022 and a slow disbursement dynamic of the consumer portfolio compared to the previous year. For further information about the change of the allowance for credit losses from 2023 to 2022, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Loans and Advances to Costumers, Net' in 'Allowance for loans losses' and 'Impact of movements in the value of the portfolio and loss allowance by Stage' section and Note 'Risk Management' in 'Credit Risk' section.\n\n## E.4 SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE\n\n## Ratio of charge-offs to average outstanding loans\n\nThe ratio of charge-offs to average outstanding loans for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\n\n|                                                   | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                   | 2023                      | 2022                      |\n| Ratio of charge-offs to average outstanding loans | 2.56  %                   | 2.54  %                   |\n| Commercial                                        | 0.69 %                    | 1.35 %                    |\n| Consumer                                          | 9.15 %                    | 7.03 %                    |\n| Mortgage                                          | 0.35 %                    | 1.04 %                    |\n| Financial Leases                                  | 1.01 %                    | 0.66 %                    |\n| Small Business Loan                               | 6.61 %                    | 8.38 %                    |\n\nThe increase in the charge-offs ratio  is  mainly  due  to  higher  default  in  the  personal  portfolio  loans,  which  default  is associated with certain macroeconomic factors such as high levels of inflation, interest rates and economic slowdown.\n\n## E.5 DEPOSITS\n\n## Uninsured deposits\n\nAn uninsured deposit is any deposit that does not have a mechanism to protect and secure the depositor's resources (either natural or legal person) in the event of insolvency or settlement of any financial institution.\n\nThe amount of uninsured deposits for 2023 and 2022 is COP 164,601,948 and COP 194,759,108, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Economic Activity\n\nColombia's real GDP growth in 2023 was 0.6%. So, 2023 was a period of notable weakening of the Colombian economy's dynamics, following a period of high GDP (7.3% in 2022). This sharp decline in GDP growth has been part of a cycle in which the Central Bank significantly raised the policy interest rate to address inflationary pressures. Consequently, the high interest rates began to strain household and business budgets, reducing both consumption and investment capacity, while public investment budget execution also remained low.\n\nThe  behavior  of  key  GDP  components  in  2023  compared  to  2022,  in  constant-prices  figures,  was  as  follows:  fixed investment declined 8.9%, total consumption grew 1.1%, imports declined 14.7%, and exports increased 3.1%.\n\nThe sectors that showed the most dynamic growth in 2023 were the financial and insurance activities (showing an annual growth of 7.9%), the artistic, entertainment and recreation activities and other service activities (7.0%), and the public administration, defense, health, and education macro-sector (3.9%).\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Colombian Central Bank's benchmark interest rate stood at 13%, after a 125 percentage point increase over the first half of the year and a 25 percentage point cut in December 2023.\n\nDespite the initial cut in interest rates, the monetary policy is currently highly contractionary. The Central Bank has a significant margin to continue the interest rate cuts without abandoning the contractionary stance of the policy, which will allow inflation to continue to get closer to the target.\n\n## Inflation\n\n2023 year-end inflation stood at 9.28%, lower than the 13.12% recorded in 2022. The sectors driving inflation in 2023 were transport (15.42% increase), restaurants and hotels services (13.22% increase), and alcoholic beverages and tobacco (11.95% increase). On the contrary, the prices of information and communication services (0.12% increase), food and nonalcoholic beverages (5.00% increase), and clothing and footwear (5.23% increase) increased the least.\n\nIn the second half of 2023, annual inflation maintained a consistent but slow downward  trend, a behavior expected to persist during 2024, reaffirming the possibility of the policy interest rates continuing to decline, albeit at a slow pace.\n\n## Exchange Rate\n\nThe Colombian peso appreciated 20.54% against the USD during 2023, with the USD/COP closing at COP3,822.05, compared to a depreciation of 20.82% in 2022, when the USD/COP closed at COP4,810.20. Thus, 2023 was a year of recovery  for  the  COP  after  the  setbacks  experienced  in  2022.  Various  signals  of  institutional  strength,  coupled  with favorable  economic  outcomes  such  as  a  reduction  in  the  current  account  deficit  and  the  beginning  of  the  inflation normalization process, are the main factors behind the strengthening of the currency.\n\n## Outlook\n\nProspects for the Colombian economy, the financial sector in general, and for Bancolombia in particular, are expected to depend on these factors:",

the discussion of these changes may be found in the Bank's Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC.\n\n## Summary\n\nDuring the past year, Bancolombia maintained its strong competitive position and broad range of financial services amid a challenging economic environment in the different geographies where the group operates. 2023 was a year of global economic slowdown, high levels of inflation, weak domestic demand, and credit contraction. High-interest rates notably impacted clients' borrowing capacity within the financial system, deteriorating asset quality ratios and discouraging new originations across all segments.\n\nMoreover, following a sharp depreciation in 2022, the Colombian Peso had a strong rebound in 2023, closing at COP 3,822.05 per USD, a 20.54% appreciation.\n\nNet income attributable to equity holders of Bancolombia totaled COP 6,117 billion (COP 6.420 per share, both common and preferred shares, and USD 6.72 per ADR) in 2023, which represents a decrease of 9.83% as compared to the COP 6,783 billion of net income attributable to equity holders of Bancolombia for the fiscal year 2022.\n\nBancolombia' s average return on stockholders' equity for 2023 was 16.14%, down from 19.80% in 2022.\n\nThe net interest and valuation income margin increased in 2023 and stood at 6.99% for the year, up from 6.80% in 2022.",

        "page_content": "Credit impairment charges, totaled COP 7,462 billion for 2023, up 96.79% from COP 3,792 billion in 2022. Due to less favorable credit conditions for clients, such growth on an annual basis is largely explained by the performance of the retail portfolio in Colombia which had a significant increase in 2022. Thus, the banking industry at a broader level experienced a considerable decline in credit quality, to a greater extent, during the first half of 2023. During the second half of 2023, provision expenses for the group decreased as new originations denoted a better payment behavior.\n\nLoans and advances to customers and financial institutions decreased by 5.92% during the year. This result is strongly correlated  with  the  sharp  appreciation  of  the  Colombian  peso  against  the  U.S.  dollar  and  the  restatement  of  foreign subsidiaries balances. When excluding the exchange rate effect, growth would have been 1.51% annually.\n\nFurthermore, lower credit demand related to high interest rates, as well as the tightening of the Bank's origination policies, led  to  decreasing  disbursements  during  the  year.  Unlike  previous  years  when  the  consumer  portfolio  had  sustained a growing trend, by 2023 its balance contracted due to changes in risk appetite for this segment during this credit cycle. Home lending grew in all geographies, while commercial loans gained share within the portfolio mix due to the higher balance in Colombia. The total loan book in COP grew 4.21% and the portfolio in USD decreased 22.95% during the year (-3.03% when calculated in USD).\n\nAllowance for loans and lease losses represented 6.02% of total loans and 120.04% of 30-day past-due loans (excluding accrued interest) at the end of 2023 compared with 5.47% of total loans and 168.73% of 30-day past-due loans (excluding accrued interest) at the end of 2022. The Bank expects that these allowances will provide adequate coverage for expected credit losses.\n\nCapital adequacy was 13.40% (Tier 1 ratio of 11.42%), higher than the 12.79% (Tier 1 ratio of 10.37%) reported at the end of 2022, largely explained by the low growth of the loan portfolio and the appreciation of the COP versus the USD, thus reducing the balance of risk weighted assets and a lower deduction of goodwill.\n\nDeposits by customers decreased 1.22% during 2023, while the ratio of net loans to deposits was 95.9% at the end of 2023, down from 101.4% at the end of 2022, given that loans contracted at a higher rate than deposits.\n\n## Net interest margin and valuation income on financial instruments before impairment on loans and financial leases and off-balance sheet credit instruments.\n\nInterest income, which is the sum of interest on loans, financial leases, overnight funds and interest and valuation income from investment securities was COP 37,046 billion, up 38.25% from 26,796 billion in 2022, driven mainly by changes in price as per the higher market rates at which the loan book reprices rather than by changes in volume. This is because the largest share of the loan portfolio is at variable rate and therefore assets tend to reprice fast upon interest rate hikes.\n\nHowever, the lower pace of growth of interest income compared to the previous year is due to the 5.92% loan book contraction, which in turn has a threefold explanation: first, a weaker credit demand in all segments provided the high interest rates; second, lower risk appetite given the increase on loan delinquencies, and third, the sharp COP appreciation during the period that reduced the volume of loans and the interest income contribution of the USD portfolio on the consolidated book.\n\nAs a matter of fact, consumer loans, which provide the higher risk adjusted returns, posted the largest drop with an 8.38% year over year contraction as per the Bank's lower risk appetite, dragging overall income generation.\n\nAs a result, the weighted average nominal interest rate on loans and financial leases was 13.4% up from 10.2%, in 2022.\n\nIn turn, interest expense was COP 16,668 billion, up 97.43% year over year, mainly driven by the growth in time deposits that outpaced the growth of all other sources of deposits as depositors sought higher yields. This caused the interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities to increase to 5.9% up from 3.2%, recorded in 2022.",

        "page_content": "Interest on debt instruments using the effective interest method totaled COP 1,029 billion in 2023, up 74.83% from 2022, mainly due to higher market rates. Conversely, total valuation on financial instruments was COP 579 billion, a drop of 57.53% compared to 2022, attributable to the higher market rates at which the portfolio was discounted.\n\nNet interest income and valuation for 2023 was COP 20,378 billion, a 11.02% increase from COP 18,354 billion in 2022. This represents a net interest and valuation income margin from continuing operations of 6.99%, increasing almost 20 basis points from 6.80% recorded in 2022. Despite the contraction in the loan book and the increase in interest expense on deposits as per higher market rates, income generation grew, albeit at a slower pace compared to 2022, mainly due to changes in prices in loans and financial leases, overnight funds and interest from investment securities held in the portfolio.",

The main source of fee income during the year was credit and debit cards, which resulted from acquiring (credit and debit card) businesses, and revenues from merchant discount rates from different card issuers. Income for this division grew 10.46% year over year as a result of an increasing volume of transactions and interbank exchange fees generated by a higher amount of national and international purchases, both through POS and electronic payments.\n\nBanking services had a significant contribution to the increase in commissions largely due to the operation of Bancolombia S.A., associated, among other factors, with higher revenues from digital banking.\n\nBancassurance added to the good performance during the last year with dynamic activities in insurance policy renewals, in addition to higher income from the distribution of new voluntary and mandatory insurances. Finally, payments fees also represented  an  annual  increase  primarily  as  a  result  of  higher  demand  for  services  such  as  invoice  collection  from individual clients.\n\nFee expenses totaled COP 3,097 billion in 2023, up 19.58% compared to COP 2,590 billion in 2022. Such increase is mainly due to higher costs of data processing for banking services and, higher royalties on credit and debit card affiliated",

        "page_content": "networks due to increasing transactional volumes. Furthermore, sales outsourcing services and third-party collections also drove fee expenses growth. Finally, banking agents also contributed to higher expenses as a result of the increased number of transactions processed and new merchants enrolled.\n\n## Other Operating Income\n\nIn 2023, total other operating income was COP 3,980 billion, 93.80% higher than the COP 2,053 billion in 2022. The increase, was due to currency hedging balances which resulted in a positive net effect in a period of high volatility, in respect of foreign exchange.\n\nRevenues from operating leases totaled COP 1,771 billion in 2023, an increase of 29.97% compared to 2022. The better performance was driven by incremental demand in customer financial lease agreements at Bancolombia S.A. and customer rental contracts of vehicles at Renting Colombia and higher income in property rentals.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nThe following table summarizes the principal components of the Bank's operating expenses for the last two fiscal years:\n\n|                                           | For the years ended December 31,   | Growth                           | Growth             |                    |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                           | 2023                               | 2022  2023-2022                  |                    |                    |\n|                                           | In millions of COP                 | In millions of COP               | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| Operating expenses                        |                                    |                                  |                    |                    |\n| Salaries and employee benefits            | 5,350,234                          | 4,417,656    932,578   21.11 %   |                    |                    |\n| Other administrative and general expenses | 5,033,944                          | 4,559,900    474,044   10.40 %   |                    |                    |\n| Taxes other than income tax               | 1,433,148                          | 929,512    503,636   54.18 %     |                    |                    |\n| Impairment, depreciation and amortization | 1,124,859                          | 980,575    144,284   14.71 %     |                    |                    |\n| Total operating expenses                  | 12,942,185                         | 10,887,643   2,054,542   18.87 % |                    |                    |\n\nThe following table summarizes the principal components of the Bank's operating expenses for the fiscal years ended:\n\n|                                           | For the years ended December 31,   | Growth                         |                    |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                           | 2022                               | 2021  2022-2021                |                    |\n|                                           | In millions of COP                 | In millions of COP             | In millions of COP |\n| Operating expenses                        |                                    |                                |                    |\n| Salaries and employee benefits            | 4,417,656                          | 3,782,596    635,060  16.79 %  |                    |\n| Other administrative and general expenses | 4,559,900                          | 3,740,506    819,394  21.91 %  |                    |\n| Taxes other than income tax               | 929,512                            | 719,593    209,919  29.17 %    |                    |\n| Impairment, depreciation and amortization | 980,575                            | 920,558    60,017   6.52 %     |                    |\n| Total operating expenses                  | 10,887,643                         | 9,163,253   1,724,390  18.82 % |                    |\n\nIn 2023, operating expenses totaled COP 12,942 billion, up 18.87% as compared to COP 10,888 billion in 2022.\n\nSalaries and employee benefits (excluding bonuses) totaled COP 4,410 billion in 2023, up 22.70% as compared to 2022. The result is largely due to annual salary increases, as well as updates on actuarial valuations on certain employees' benefits resulting  in  higher  expenses  for  the  period.  On  the  other  hand,  bonuses  increased  by  14.18%  annually  under  the performance-based model that rewards employee contributions towards company profitability.\n\nOther administrative and general expenses totaled COP 5,034 billion in 2023, up 10.40% as compared to 2022. This is mostly due to: (i) an increase in the vehicle rental division that caused higher expenses associated with asset impairment and  maintenance  and  (ii)  continued  expansion  of  digital  transformation  projects.  Taxes  other  than  income  tax  had  a significant increase after changes in the fiscal reform approved in 2022.\n\nImpairments, depreciation, and amortization totaled COP 1,125 billion in 2023, up 14.71% as compared to 2022. This increase is primarily due to the increase in higher operating leases and consequently higher asset depreciation.",

        "page_content": "As a result of the changes in expenses and revenues, the cost to income ratio of Bancolombia for 2023 was 45.33%, up from 44.58% in 2022.\n\n## Provision Charges and Credit Quality\n\nFor  the  year  2023,  total  credit  impairment  charges,  net  totaled  COP  7,462  billion  (or  2.8%  of  average  loans),  which represents an increase of 96.79% as compared to COP 3,792 billion (or 1.6% of average loans) in 2022.\n\nMacroeconomic factors such as high inflation, high interest rates and the economic slowdown influenced the deterioration of the portfolio in the different geographies where the bank operates. The significant increase in the cost of credit for 2023 was mostly explained by loans running past due in consumer and, to a large extent in personal loans in particular.\n\nNet loan charge-offs totaled COP 6,720 billion in 2023 up 9.01% from the 6,165 billion in 2022.\n\nThe incremental volume of charge-offs was explained by a higher amount of loans reaching delinquency ratios for whose recovery  probabilities  were  very  low.  In  2023,  important  improvements  were  made  in  the  collection  processes  and restructuring alternatives that have prevented further deterioration on overdue payment obligations from clients with high deterioration rates. Net charge-offs have two important features: first, they reduce the balance of the loan portfolio, and second, they help reduce the amount of past due loans.\n\nPast-due loans amounted to COP 13,700 billion as of December 31, 2023, up 43.04% as compared to COP 9,578 billion as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe past-due loan ratio (loans overdue more than 30 days divided by total loans) was 5.39% as of December 31, 2023, up from 3.55% as of December 31, 2022. Despite the implementation of effective measures to recover overdue loans and the increasing  volume  of  charge-offs  carried  out  during  the  year,  the  increase  in  the  delinquency  ratios  reflects  the  high deterioration experienced during 2023, mainly in Colombia, associated with the factors described above.\n\n## Income Tax Expenses\n\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year 2023 totaled COP 1,933 billion, 29.68% lower than COP 2,748 billion in 2022. The effective tax rate in 2023 was 23.72%.\n\nThe explanation for this lower effective tax rate is twofold; first, it is related to tax benefits in Colombia, related to the mortgage portfolio for social housing and investments in productive fixed assets, and second, the higher contribution of foreign  subsidiaries  with  lower  statutory  tax  rates  to  the  consolidated  results  also  added  to  a  resulting  lower  tax. Furthermore, the tax benefits of foreign operations are associated with exempt income from returns on securities issued by the Governments of Guatemala, El Salvador and Panama.\n\nFor further details please see Note 12 of Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RESULTS BY SEGMENT\n\nThe Bank manages its business through 9 main operating segments: Banking Colombia, Banking El Salvador, Banking Panama, Banking Guatemala, Trust, Investment Banking, Brokerage, International Banking and All Other.\n\nThe segment information in this Annual Report reflects the reporting structure in place at the reporting date in accordance with the segment information in Note 3.

6,679 billion in 2022, due to the reasons described below.\n\nTotal interest and valuation increased by 41.02% to COP 29,230 billion, mainly due to interest income growth on loans and financial leases operations of 47.25% resulting from growth in the loan portfolio which grew at 2.09% and the Central Bank's reference rate hikes during the year that impacted margins because of the asset-sensitive nature of the Bank's balance sheet. This increase was mainly reflected in interest income from commercial, consumer and mortgage loans.\n\nTotal interest expenses increased by 112.59% to COP 13,465 billion from COP 6,334 billion, due to an increase in time deposits  in  line  with  the  Central  Bank's  reference  rate  hike  in  2022.  Net  interest  margin  and  valuation  of  financial instruments reflected an increase of 9.53% to COP 15,765 billion.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net increased by 118.08% to COP 6,480 billion from COP 2,972 billion. This increase was mainly due to credit deterioration in the consumer portfolio, and a less favorable economic outlook, including lower economic growth and higher interest rates throughout the year.\n\nTotal fees and commission net, increased by 5.58% to COP 2,729 billion, mainly driven by better performance in bank acceptances and guarantees which increased by 24.09%, banking services by 23.41%, Bancassurance by 13.46%, credit and debit cards by 9.71%, and payments-collections by 11.52% (digital channels). Such increases were partially offset by fees and commission expenses that increased by 20.16% when compared to the previous year.",

levels on the FX market in line with the uncertainty related to political risk and macroeconomic variables worldwide.\n\nDividends and net profits from capital investments increased to COP 18 billion from a loss of COP (8) billion in 2022, mainly due to bargain purchase gains in autonomous trusts, offset by lower income from dividends and from the equity method of associated companies and joint ventures, as a result of macroeconomic conditions that generated lower profits.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 21.51% to COP 8,766 billion from COP 7,214 billion, largely due to an increase in administrative  and  general  expenses,  in  particular  non-income  taxes,  as  well  as  an  increase  in  salaries  and  employee benefits.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Colombia grew by 2,94% during the year, mainly due to an increase in Cash and balances at the central bank and by loan book growth, and in particular due to commercial and mortgage portfolio performance.\n\nFinally,  liabilities  attributable  to  Banking  Colombia  grew  by  4,30%  during  2023,  driven  by  an  increase  in  deposits, particularly time deposits.\n\n## Banking El Salvador:\n\n|

Likewise, interest expenses grew mainly due to loans with financial institutions and time deposits.\n\nMoreover, the loan book in COP decreased by 18.97% because of the effect of revaluation of the peso against the dollar and increased 1.98% in USD mainly driven by the consumer portfolio which grew 6.20% when expressed in USD. On the other hand, deposits grew by 1.75% mainly driven by time deposits and saving accounts. Furthermore, the Bank increased investment in bonds to strengthen the liability structure.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net increased by 50.85% to COP 155 billion from COP 103 billion in 2022, primarily due to growth in the consumer portfolio.\n\nTotal fees and commissions, net increased by 6.21% to COP 291 billion despite fees and commission expenses growing by 10.79% due to higher transactional fees charged in banking services.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 7.19% to COP 800 billion, primarily caused by increases in salaries and employee benefits.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking El Salvador decreased by 19.06% during the year, mainly driven by the appreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD dollars.\n\n## Banking Panama:\n\n|

The loan book decreased by 2.02% in USD mainly driven by the reduction in the commercial portfolio balance.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net decreased by 50.37% to COP 270 billion compared to COP 545 billion in 2022. This variation is due to lower provision charges and higher recoveries of charged-off loans.\n\nTotal fees and commission, net increased by 15.83% to COP 274 billion, mainly driven by higher income generated by merchant acquiring services, ATM fees and Bancassurance in spite of an increase in banking services expenses.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 12.14% due to increases in salaries, bonuses, and administrative expenses.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Panama decreased by 22.32% during the year, mainly driven by the appreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD.\n\n## Banking Guatemala :\n\n|

Banking segment increased 103.60% to COP 895 billion from COP 440 billion in 2022 due to the reasons described below.\n\nThe financial statements expressed in Colombian pesos are affected by the  depreciation of the COP against the USD, which reached 20.5% during the last year. Nevertheless, total interest and valuation increased in terms of COP by 117.04%, reaching COP 1,112 billion from COP 512 billion in 2022. This was mainly attributable to the rise in interest income from corporate client loans, interbank funds, and investments in debt securities.\n\nThe total charge for credit impairment recovery, net, decreased by 83.36% to COP (4) billion from COP (25) billion in 2022, primarily due to a lower volume of provision reversals resulting from a reduced loan portfolio balance and lower asset quality.\n\nTotal fees and commissions, net increased by 6.44%, to COP 36 billion, mainly due to a higher volume of transactions as a  result  of  the  increase  in  the  number  of  clients  in  recent  years.  Commissions  expenses  increased  due  to  a  rise  in professional correspondent fees with other entities within the group.\n\nTotal  operating  expenses  increased  by  13.39%  to  COP  93  billion,  due  to  investments  in  digital  transformation  and automation of operational capabilities.",

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## B.1        LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING\n\n## Liquid Assets\n\nOne of the main guidelines of the Bank is to maintain a solid liquidity position, therefore, the ALCO Committee, has established a minimum level of liquid assets, based on the funding needs of each subsidiary, to ensure, as far as possible, that  it  will  always  have  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  its  liabilities  when  they  are  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed conditions, without incurring big losses or risking damage to the Bank's reputation.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Bank seeks the optimum level of liquid assets to assure not only the proper operation under normal conditions but also to operate under stress market scenarios. During 2023, the Bank maintained a solid liquidity position, with high liquidity levels during the second half of the year.\n\nThe following table shows the composition of the liquid assets in the last two years:\n\n| Liquid Assets  (1)             |            | December 31, 2023  December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|\n| High quality Liquid Assets *   |            |                                        |\n| Cash                           | 25,273,317 | 26,299,990                             |\n| High quality liquid securities | 19,951,771 | 17,739,501                             |\n| Other Liquid Assets            |            |                                        |\n| Other securities **            | 5,455,735  | 4,019,688                              |\n| Total Liquid Assets            | 50,680,823 | 48,059,179                             |\n\n* High-quality liquid assets: cash and shares that are eligible to be reportable or repo operations, in addition to those liquid assets that the Central Bank receives for its monetary expansion and contraction operations described in paragraph 3.1.1 of the Foreign Regulatory Circular DODM-142 of the Bank of the Republic.\n\n** Other Securities: Securities issued by financial and corporate entities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, liquid assets showed a growth of COP 2,621 billion, mainly due to the increase in high-quality liquid securities. This change is a consequence of higher deposits and excess of liquidity, which has been managed through the treasury portfolio with purchases of liquid securities.\n\nThe Bank measures liquid assets on a daily basis and compares this result to an objective target set by the Risk Committee. Under this rule, daily liquid assets must be equal to or higher than such target. In the event the limit is not reached, there is a five-day period to increase liquidity levels.\n\nCash is important to guarantee branch and ATM operations. The Bank's expansion across the Colombian territory requires considerable levels of cash; however, cash levels are daily monitored in order to minimize opportunity costs. Additionally, cash is considered in the mandatory bank reserve established by the Central Bank.\n\nSecurities that comprise liquid assets are reviewed by the ALCO considering the Bank's liquidity objective. Even though available for sale and held to maturity debt securities cannot be sold, they can be pledged as collateral in repurchase agreements. Some of them are mandatory investments that can be posted to the Central Bank as collateral.\n\nSFC requires financial entities to have liquid assets greater than the contractual liquidity cumulative one-month gap. This contractual gap reflects the maturity of the current positions of assets and liabilities and does not reflect projections of",

The maturity of the loan portfolio for this purpose is affected by the historical default indicator and the maturity of deposits is modeled according to the regulation.\n\nThe Bank's management believes that the current level of liquidity is adequate and will seek to maintain its solid deposit base and the access to alternative sources of funding such as borrowings from domestic and international development and commercial banks, repurchase agreements, bond issuances, overnight funds and Central Bank funds, considering market conditions, interest rates and the desired maturity profile of liabilities.\n\n## Funding Structure\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank's liabilities reached COP 303,879 billion, a 2.86% decrease compared to December 31, 2022. Liabilities denominated in COP increased by 10.46%, and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars decreased by 20.64%. These changes are principally the result of the increase in COP denominated time deposits, offset by a decline in COP denominated checking and saving accounts, USD denominated borrowings from other financial institutions and USD debt securities in issue. However, although USD denominated liabilities decreased by 20.64%, this change was mainly affected by the appreciation of the USD/COP exchange rate (20.54% in 2023).\n\n|                     | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,        |\n|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n|                     | 2023  2022           | 2023  2022                |\n| Total funding       |                      |                           |\n| Peso-denominated    |                      | 197,575,174   178,861,272 |\n| Dollar-denominated. |                      | 106,303,906   133,955,910 |\n| Total Liabilities   |                      |                           |\n|                     |                      | 303,879,080   312,817,182 |\n\nIn 2023, the Bank's deposits reached COP 247,941 billion at year-end, a decrease of COP 3,051 billion, or 1.22% compared to  2022.  COP  denominated  deposits  increased  by  9.18%,  explained  mainly  by  the  rise  in  time  deposits,  while  USD denominated deposits decreased by 17.25% as a result of the reduction in saving accounts and the effect of the exchange rate variations. The ratio of deposits to total assets was 72.3%, increasing by 116 basis points compared to 2022.\n\n|                | As of December 31,        | As of December 31,   |\n|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|\n|                | 2023                      | 2022                 |\n|                | In millions of COP        | In millions of COP   |\n| Total Deposits | 247,941,180   250,992,323 |                      |\n\nThe following table sets forth checking accounts, savings accounts and time deposits as a percentage of the Bank's total liabilities for the years 2023 and 2022:\n\n|                                 | 2023    2022   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| Checking accounts               | 11.6 %  12.9 % |\n| Time deposits                   | 32.5 %  27.9 % |\n| Saving accounts                 | 35.8 %  37.8 % |\n| Other deposits                  | 1.7 %   1.5 %  |\n| Percentage of Total Liabilities | 81.6 %  80.1 % |\n\nThe Bank's principal sources of funding are deposits, which are mainly composed of checking accounts, time deposits and savings accounts. During 2023, time deposits played an important role in the financing structure of the balance sheet. High level inflation led the Central Bank to maintain a contractionary monetary policy, resulting in lower demand for liquidity, loans, and encouraging investors to reallocate their portfolios towards securities with higher yields. As a result, cost of funds was negatively affected due to high interest rates. Furthermore, the increase in time deposits was offset by the decrease in demand deposits.\n\nDeposits as a percentage of the Bank's total liabilities in 2023 were 81.6%, increasing from 80.1% of total liabilities at year-end 2022.",

This change is primarily explained by the decrease in net loans and advances to customers, that fell from COP 254,444 billion in 2022 to COP 237,728 billion in 2023, which was lower compared with the variation in deposits (the decrease was COP 7,095 billion reaching an amount of COP 263,589 billion in 2023).\n\n|                       | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                       | 2023                 | 2022                 |\n| Net Loans to Deposits |                      | 90.19 %   94.00 %    |\n\nThe Bank also funds its operations with borrowings from financial institutions. Nevertheless, the main source of financing during 2023 was time deposits, as interest rates tended to remain high and demand for liquidity was lower. Additionally, Bancolombia's time deposits and borrowings from financial institutions are linked to different market rates/indexes like the IBR, (a short-term benchmark interest rate of Colombian money market liquidity that reflects the price at which banks are willing to lend or borrow funds from financial market), DTF, IPC1, LIBOR and SOFR.\n\nIn addition, compliance with the Net Stable Funding Ratio in 2023, the increase in inflation, high interest rates and local and international political uncertainty generated additional pressure on the cost of financing operations in the short and long term.\n\n## Debt instruments in issue\n\nIn 2023, Bancolombia issued USD 50 million aggregate of notes, while Bancolombia Panam\u00e1, Bancolombia Puerto Rico and Banistmo issued notes in amounts of USD 41.9 million, USD 69.6 million and USD 122.2 million, respectively. Nevertheless, a USD 468 million senior bond prepayment was executed during 2023, and so the carrying amount of debt securities in issue decreased by COP 4,912 billion.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total outstanding aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Bank was COP 14,663 billion.\n\nThe following table shows the Bank's debt securities in issue maturity profile:\n\n|                          | 2024               | 2025               | 2026               | 2027                                     | 2028               | 2029 and  thereafter   | Total                 |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                          | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP                       | In millions of COP | In millions of COP     | In millions of COP    |\n| Debt securities in issue |                    |                    |                    | 3,368,076  2,424,364  675,502  5,019,584 | 0                  |                        | 3,176,050  14,663,576 |\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

The increase in loans and advances to customers and financial institutions was COP 10,554 billion, compared with COP 37,593 billion and COP 24,057 billion in 2022 and 2021 respectively.  Interest paid generated a use of cash of COP 15,978 billion in 2023, COP 7,508 billion in 2022 and COP 4,410 billion in 2021. The net change in value of investment securities recognized at fair value through profit and losses was negative by COP 1,988 billion in 2023, compared with 2022 where the net change in value was positive by COP 6,321 billion.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nIn 2023, the Bank purchased debt securities at amortized cost of COP 3,629 billion, COP 4,915 billion in 2022 and COP 3,722 billion in 2021. The proceeds from maturities of debt securities at amortized cost provided COP 4,738 billion in 2023, COP 4,260 in 2022 and COP 2,984 billion in 2021.\n\nInvesting activities related to debt instruments at fair value through OCI provided net cash of COP 1,415 billion during 2023 and COP 235 billion during 2022. Investing activities related to equity securities and interests in associates and joint ventures used net cash of COP 106 billion during 2023, while in 2022 it used COP 56 billion; and investing activities related to purchases and sales of premises and equipment and investment properties used net cash of COP 2,226 billion, compared with COP 3,117 billion used during 2022, and COP 1,632 billion in 2021.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nProceeds from borrowings from other financial institutions provided COP 9,855 billion in 2023, COP 14,374 billion in 2022 and COP 4,182 billion in 2021. The placement of debt securities in issue provided COP 1,781 billion in 2023, COP 2,138 in 2022 and COP 1,387 in 2021. The repayment of borrowings used COP 9,921 billion in 2023, compared with COP 5,874 used in 2022 and COP 8,447 used in 2021; and the payments of debt securities in issue used COP 3,928 billion during 2023, COP 6,699 billion during 2022 and COP 1,871 billion during 2021. Cash was also used to pay dividends to stockholders in the amount of COP 3,298 billion, while in 2022 and 2021 this amount was COP 2,310 billion and COP 467 billion, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing provided cash of COP 304 billion, compared with the COP 579 billion used in 2022 and the COP 1,457 billion in 2021.\n\n## Capital Adequacy\n\nThe Bank and its subsidiaries comply with the capital adequacy requirements in their respective countries of operation.\n\nStockholders' equity attributable to the owners of Bancolombia amounted to COP 38,090 billion on December 31, 2023, down 2.56% from COP 39,089 billion on December 31, 2022. This decrease is mainly explained by the appreciation of the COP versus the USD and the lower net income generation during the year.",

        "page_content": "The Bank monitors treasury division activities through policies regarding the management of liquidity, market, legal, credit and operational risks. Such policies are monitored by the Vice-President of Risk Management. With the aim to control market and liquidity risks,  the  Bank  sets  limits  intended  to  keep  its  exposure  levels  and  losses  within  certain  ranges determined by the Bank's Board of Directors. The Bank's investment policies do not include restrictions regarding the maturity of the securities held in the portfolio, except for those related to the liquidity portfolio and over the counter ('OTC') derivatives transactions held by Bancolombia and Banistmo.\n\nBefore taking any additional position, the Bank's treasury division also verifies, with respect to investments in domestic and  in  foreign  currencies,  the  availability  of  funds  for  investment  and  each  investment's  suitability  with  the  Bank's liquidity structure.\n\nAs mentioned in Item 11. 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk', the market risk stated in the treasury  book  is  measured  with  value  at  risk  (VaR)  metrics,  and  the  position  limits  are  based  on  the  results  of  these methodologies. The Bank has defined VaR limits that follow a hierarchical structure, which avoids the concentration of market risk in certain groups of assets and also takes advantage of portfolio diversification. In addition to VaR limits, the Bank uses stop loss signals, except for GFA, to inform senior management when accumulated losses are close to certain pre-defined thresholds in the trading book. Moreover, for the options portfolio in Bancolombia, the Bank has set limits based on the sensitivity of the portfolio to the underlying volatility, underlying currency and interest rates.\n\nAs  part  of  its  operations,  the  Bank  holds  cash  and  cash  equivalents  primarily  in  Colombian  pesos,  U.S.  dollars  and Guatemalan quetzals. These positions, as well as any other currency position, are determined by the treasury division in connection with the Bank's currency risk assessment and  management. Specifically, the Bank's exposure to FX risk primarily arises from changes in the USD/COP exchange rate. The exposure to currency risk is managed by the Bank's Treasury Division. The Bank estimates VaR metrics to limit the exposure to foreign currency risk of its balance sheet in Bancolombia, Valores Bancolombia, Banco Agr\u00edcola, Banistmo and BAM. These limits are supervised daily by the Bank's Market Risk Management Office. The Bank's Treasury Division manages a derivative portfolio in Bancolombia and Banistmo, which includes forward in FX with the purpose, among others, of hedging its overall currency exposure.\n\nThe Colombian Chief Treasury Officer ('CTO'), centralizes all the reports from the Treasury Directors in the subsidiaries in all geographies, in which they are responsible for FX, investment and risk taking.\n\nThere  are  several  communications  channels  between  the  Treasury  divisions  and  the  CTO,  which  are:  Investment Committee; the participants in this meeting, which is held monthly, are: CTO, Proprietary Trading Director, Market Risk Director, Treasury Directors from each Bank, and the Head of each desk in Colombia (Fixed Income, FX and Derivatives). This committee reviews the investment strategy portfolios,  profit and loss figures, VaR levels, Benchmark portfolios, based on the framework and risk appetite, defined by the Board of Directors.\n\nPerformance is measured against the 'Benchmark' approved for each treasury, which includes a target position for each asset and limits for every product and market, in which the treasury operation can invest. There is a continuous follow up of the portfolios in the investment committee, which runs monthly.\n\n## B.3       COMMITMENT FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\n\nSee Item 4. 'Information on the Company - A. History and Development of the Company - Capital Acquisitions and Divestitures'.\n\n## C.

        "page_content": "The Bank, through its Research, Development and Innovation Unit, is certified as a Highly Innovative Company by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Colombia.\n\n## D.       TREND INFORMATION\n\nAs a result of the restrictive financial conditions, 2023 was a year of deceleration for the economies in which Bancolombia operates. Revenues on a consolidated basis have been impacted during the last year mainly due to the deterioration of the credit cycle. Net interest and valuation income in 2023 decreased 11.31%. Even though net interest margin grew on the back of higher average interest rates, worsening conditions on asset quality implied higher provisioning expenses and were the primary factor to explain a lower net income to shareholders. The evolution of the loan portfolio and the recovery on the credit cycle will be key drivers of the Bank's performance going forward. The following is a brief discussion of recent trends in the company and the economy.\n\n## Loan Volume Performance\n\nGross loans and financial leases (i.e., before allowance for loans and financial lease losses) topped COP 253,952 billion decreasing 5.92% year over year. Appreciation of the Colombian Peso against the US dollar was 20.54%, explaining the contraction in the balance considering that 30.54% of total loans are denominated in foreign currency. When excluding the FX effect, the balance would have increased 0.99%.\n\nCompared to 2022, all the geographies (in which Bancolombia is present) posted a very low annual increase in its portfolio or even a contraction in the case of Banistmo, following a lower risk appetite by the Bank and a weakening demand from clients. When converted to local currency, consumer loans shrank 8.38%, commercial loans 5.63%, mortgages 3.00% and microlending 13.80%.\n\nLoans in Bancolombia S.A. expanded only 1.11% during 2023, contracting in real terms. The slowdown when compared to 2022 is a result of a tighter origination policy in view of increasing concerns on asset quality and the deterioration of clients' payment capacity. The retail loan book presented the sharpest variation decreasing 4.76%, consistent with a shift in preapproved loan disbursement policies. The Colombian economy experienced a significant deceleration during the year, as high inflation rates -caused by the resurgence of repressed consumption during the pandemic-, were followed by contractionary monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nLoans  in  Banco  Agricola  grew  1.98%  in  dollar  terms  during  2023.  Consumer  and  commercial  loans  had  a  similar performance growing at a slower pace when compared to the previous year, although keeping its market share in the country. The economy in El Salvador has moderated its pace of growth during the last year despite its resilience to the current context of global deceleration. It is expected that in coming months growth will further slow down due to the still high inflation, decreasing volume of remittances, and the lower expansion of trading partners.\n\nBanistmo's loan book was down 2.02% in an annual basis when measured in dollars. Panama was the most impacted nation by the pandemic in Central America, and the recovery is still visible with high growth rates during the last 3 years. In 2023, retail and construction activities were key drivers for the economy. The credit portfolio performance in Banistmo has been impacted by the increasingly competitive environment of the banking industry with narrowing yields. The Bank has prioritized the improvement of its margins, identifying the best risk profile segments. Commercial loans expansion should reactivate in 2024 as companies anticipate interest rate reductions to engage in higher levels of debt.\n\nBanco Agromercantil was up 2.29% in its credit portfolio with mixed dynamics segment by segment. As in 2022, the consumer and mortgages presented the highest growth while commercial decreased. The Bank has continued a strategy to reorder its portfolio mix in which retail has gained share within the total balance. The economy in Guatemala posted a dynamic activity in the first half of 2023, remittances have been an important driver of household spending. In the second half of the year, there has been a slowdown to a large extent due to the political uncertainty and recent social unrest.\n\nForeign-denominated loans decreased 3.03% during 2023. The loan portfolio in the international banking operation of Bancolombia Panama, Puerto Rico, the USD denominated loans in Colombia, and the operation of Banistmo essentially provided  the  contraction  of  the  dollar  denominated  portfolio  on  a  consolidated  basis.  A  better  context  in  the  global",

        "page_content": "economy, lower interest rates and a stronger internal demand should boost credit growth at a faster pace in 2024 at a general level both in local and foreign currency for the Bank.\n\n## Net Interest Margin and Valuation\n\nMost of the Bank's loan book has a variable rate and the re-pricing pace of our assets tends to be faster than that of the Bank's liabilities.\n\nThe annualized net interest margin in a consolidated basis was 6.99% for 2023, increasing when compared to the ratio of 6.80% reported in 2022.\n\nInterest income went up due to a better performance of the lending business. Like a year before, the financial margin with clients climbed progressively as reference rates continued its upward trend and remained high during the year, as the Colombian Central Bank implemented its contractionary monetary policy since 2021 that concluded by the end of 2023. Bancolombia has experienced a steady expansion in interest income during this cycle despite the slow dynamic of loan originations in the last twelve months. Even though the Bank has redistributed its credit portfolio share in the last few years with a greater weight of consumer within the total balance that has contributed a higher margin, in 2023 this segment contracted as a conservative approach, reducing its risk appetite in the midst of a deterioration credit cycle.\n\nAs with reference rates hikes, the interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities grew for the year ended December 31, 2023. It is worth noting that the magnitude of growth on interest expenses was much lower than the increase of reference rates due to the low sensitivity of a large portion of the Banks' liabilities.\n\nA continuous shift in the funding mix remained during the last year, as in 2022, as customers have demanded greater yields in an environment of high interest rates. Time deposits accounted for 32.5% of total liabilities in 2023, up from a share of 27.9% the year before. Following a better liquidity position and a still low loan growth in 2024, a stabilization in high interest-bearing deposit taking is expected. Customer deposits account for 81.6% of the Bank's liabilities, offering a costcompetitive and stable source of funding.\n\n## Cost of credit\n\nFor the year 2023, the cost of credit was 2.84% of average loans, increasing when compared to the 1.56% posted in 2022. This increase was largely explained by the deterioration of the credit cycle, driving the formation of new past-due loans in all segments, however, to a larger extent in the consumer portfolio. The operation in Colombia represented the highest provisioning expenses on a consolidated basis. 2024 should be a transition year towards better asset quality metrics as financial conditions are expected to improve with a positive impact on cost of risk for the Bank. Bancolombia maintains a strong balance sheet supported by an adequate level of loan loss reserves, reporting a coverage ratio to PDLs (overdue 30 days) of 120.0% as of December 2023.\n\n## E.        CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Bank's management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\n\nThe material accounting policies, including the policies which include critical accounting estimates and judgements, are described  in Note  2.E.  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  Material  accounting  policies,  Use  of  estimates  and judgments.\n\nThe  accounting  policies  listed  below  involve  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty  and  could  have  a  material  impact  on  the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk impairment: The most significant judgements relate to the selection and calibration of the probability of  default,  loss  given  default  and  exposure  at  default  models,  as  well  as  the  selection  of  model  inputs  and",

        "page_content": "economic forecasts and the likelihood of these economic scenarios. For the collective estimate of expected credit losses, assumptions and judgements include the definition of a significant increase in credit risk, the definition of  default,  forecasts  collateral  values,  loan  maturities  and  macroeconomic  forecasts  of  variables  such  as unemployment, GDP and interest rates. In addition, individual expected credit loss models take into account assumptions about how a customer's financial performance and future cash flows may be affected, the customer's expected future operational and business activity, the ability to generate sufficient cash to pay debt obligations, trends and regulatory changes in the industry in which the customer operates, changes in the value of collateral, the weighting of scenarios used and other internal and external factors. There is a high degree of uncertainty involved in making estimates using assumptions that are highly subjective and sensitive to risk factors. As of December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, a total of COP 7,461,479, COP 3,721,353 and COP 2,521,178, respectively, of credit impairment charges on loans, advances and financial leases, net were recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The significant difference between the credit impairment charges on loans, advances and financial leases as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is due to the impacts of a less favorable economic outlook with lower economic growth and high inflation and interest rate trends. For further information about the change of the allowance for credit losses from 2023 to 2022, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Loans and Advances to Costumers, Net', 'Impact of movements in the value of the portfolio and loss allowance by Stage' section and Note Risk Management in 'Credit Risk' section.\n\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2023, there has been an improvement in the methodology used to calculate credit risk impairment, as described below:\n\n- -A methodology change was made in the selection of the recovery of customers in default, which better reflects the client's payment behavior.\n- -New rating models were developed to improve the risk classification of customers in the individual (in Colombia and Panama) and corporate (in Colombia) portfolios.\n- -Improvements have been made to the threshold model to identify a significant increase in risk from the point  of  origin,  which  allows  for  greater  accuracy  in  classifying  customers  into  stage  2  (financial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since their initial recognition, but do not have objective evidence of impairment) with a high probability of default.\n- -An additional allowance adjustment (overlay) has been created for portfolios with recent delinquencies above the historical average.\n\nThe effect of the above is the creation of an allowance of COP 11,071 as of December 31, 2023. For further information, see Note 2.E.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment testing of cash generating units ('CGU'), including goodwill: The identification of cash-generating units, the allocation of goodwill based on expectations as to which of the Bank's business segments will benefit from the business acquisition, the estimation of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31,2022, a total  of  COP  7,818,125  and  COP  9,836,661,  respectively,  of  goodwill  were  recorded  on  the  Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. See Note 2.E.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- \u00b7 Recognition  of  digital  assets:  Determining  the  appropriate  accounting  treatment  for  the  Bank's  digital  asset holdings and for the custody of digital assets  held  by  customers  involves  significant  judgement,  as  there  is currently  no  specific  definitive  guidance  in  IFRS  or  alternative  accounting  frameworks to  account  for  these transactions. See Note 2.E.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- \u00b7 Deferred tax and uncertainty over income tax treatments: Due to the changing conditions of the political, social and economic environment, the constant changes in tax legislation and the constant changes in tax principles and interpretations  by  tax  authorities,  the  determination  of  the  tax  bases  of  deferred  tax  items  involves  difficult",

See  Note  2.E.4  and  10  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Provisions  and  contingent  liabilities:  Significant  judgement  is  required  in  determining  whether  a  present obligation exists and in estimating the probability, timing and amount of any outflows, including the assumption of the discount rate where the timing of the outflow is greater than 12 months. As of December 31, 2023 and December  31,  2022,  COP  401,111  and  COP  417,242,  respectively,  of  provisions  were  recorded  on  the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. See Note 2.E.5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- \u00b7 Fair value of assets and liabilities: A variety of valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities, some of which involve significant unobservable inputs and are subject to significant uncertainty based on assumptions that would be used in the market to determine the price for assets or liabilities.  As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, a total of COP 31,459,076 and COP 30,091,231, respectively, of assets and COP 6,710,364 and COP 4,737,454, respectively, were recorded in respect of liabilities that have been measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. See Note 2.E.6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- \u00b7 Measurement of employee benefits:  The  measurement of post-employment and  long-term  employee benefit obligations involves a number of inputs and is dependent on a number of assumptions about future events, such as  discount rate,  inflation  rate,  pension  payments  and  deferred  pensions,  compensation and mortality.  As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, COP 882,954 and COP 765,371, respectively, of liabilities relating to  post-employment  benefit  and  long-term  benefit  plans  were  recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Statement  of Financial Position.

See Note 2.E.8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- \u00b7 Leases: The measurement of the right-of-use asset and of the lease liabilities requires a series of judgments, among which are the determination of the term of the lease and the rate used in discounting the cash flows. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, a total of COP 1,634,045 and COP 1,827,108, respectively, of right-of-use assets and COP 1,773,610 and COP 1,900,268, respectively, of lease liabilities were recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. See Note 2.E.9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties of the items above, the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if assumptions and conditions change.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were no changes in the significant estimates and judgments made by management in applying the Bank's accounting policies as compared to those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, except for the methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses and the recognition of digital assets discussed above.",

Approximately 30.0% of employees are part of an enterprise trade union called Sintrabancol, 13.0% are members of a sector trade union called UNEB, 3.7% belong to another sector trade union called Sintraenfi, and approximately 2.0% belong to other unions. The companies with active union membership are Bancolombia S.A., Fiduciaria Bancolombia, Valores Bancolombia, Banca de Inversi\u00f3n Bancolombia and Transportempo S.A.S en Liquidaci\u00f3n.\n\nIn line with our Social Dialogue Model, Bancolombia entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement with Uneb and Sintrabancol in October 2023, which became effective on November 1, 2023, and is set to expire on October 31, 2026. This agreement applies to approximately 12,000 of the Bank's employees regardless of whether they are members of a union or not and it extends to operating personnel hired by the subsidiaries Banca de Inversi\u00f3n Bancolombia, Valores Bancolombia and Fiduciaria Bancolombia. The ACEB and ANESFICOFP unions also submitted a list of petitions to Bancolombia on October 11, and October 12, 2023, respectively, but did not reach an agreement in the stage of direct settlement. However, the terms of the agreement reached with UNEB and Sintrabancol also apply to the members of the ACEB, ANESFICOFP and other unions. With the execution of such agreement, the Bank, UNEB, and Sintrabancol continue to work on the consolidation of our Social Dialogue Model based on mutual trust and respect. The most important economic aspects of the agreement are:\n\n- 1. A wage-increase of 14.5% during the first year, an increase for the second year equal to the variation in the Colombian consumer price index ('IPC'), as certified by the Colombian Statistical Bureau ('DANE') for the period between November 2023 and October 2024, plus 2.3 basis points and an increase for the third year equal to the variation in the IPC, as certified by DANE for the period between November 2024 and October 2025, plus 2.5 basis points.\n\n## 2.

Ratification of 'the right to disconnect' during rest periods, recognizing the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between work and personal time.\n- c. Formal commitment to co-parenting and equal participation of both parents in care responsibilities.\n- d. Renewal of our zero-tolerance policy toward any conduct that violates dignity.\n\nDuring 2023, the Bank employed an average of 175 employees per month through temporary personnel service companies.\n\nBancolombia and its consolidated subsidiaries offer benefits to its employees and their families. These benefits in 2023 included loans, saving programs, insurance, psychological support, and financial advice, among many more activities for personal development, with an investment of more than USD 346 million, covering nearly 100% of the workforce.\n\n## E.                   SHARE OWNERSHIP\n\nThe following directors and members of senior management owned common shares in Bancolombia as of December 31, 2023: Gonzalo Alberto P\u00e9rez Rojas and Juan David Escobar Franco (directors).\n\nNone of the directors and members of senior management owned preferred shares in Bancolombia as of December 31, 2023.\n\nNone of the directors and members of senior management's shareholdings, individually or in the aggregate, exceed 1% of Bancolombia's outstanding common shares, preferred shares or a combination of both classes of shares.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, there are no stock options to acquire any of Bancolombia's outstanding common shares or preferred shares or share-based payment to any employee.\n\n## F. DISCLOSURE  OF  A  REGISTRAN'S  ACTION  TO  RECOVER  ERRONEOUSLY  AWARDED COMPENSATION\n\nPursuant to Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (Erroneously Awarded Compensation), each listed issuer that does not qualify for an exemption set forth in such rule was required to adopt a recovery policy by December 1, 2023.  Complying with such Rule, the Board of Directors of Bancolombia approved the implementation of a Recovery Policy (or 'Clawback Policy') on November 20, 2023.\n\nBancolombia  was  not  required  to  prepare  an  accounting  restatement  that  required  recovery  of  erroneously  awarded compensation pursuant to its compensation recovery policy, neither was an outstanding balance as of the end of year 2023 of erroneously awarded compensation to be recovered from the application of the policy to a prior restatement.",

MARKETS\n\nThe Colombian Securities Exchange is the principal non-U.S. trading market for the preferred shares and the sole market for the common shares. As of December 31, 2023, the market capitalization for Bancolombia's preferred shares based on the  closing  price  in  the  Colombian  Securities  Exchange  was  COP  13,528  billion  (Bancolombia's  total  market capitalization, which includes the common and preferred shares, was COP 30,450 billion or USD 7.97 billion as of the same date).\n\nThere are no official market makers or independent specialists on the Colombian Securities Exchange to ensure market liquidity and, therefore, orders to buy or sell in excess of corresponding orders to sell or buy will not be executed. The aggregate equity market capitalization of the Colombian Securities Exchange, as of December 31, 2023, was COP 307,443 billion (USD 80,439 billion), with 76 companies listed as of that date.\n\nOn December 14th, 2023, Bancolombia announced that the Colombian Securities Exchange (BVC) authorized a liquidity program in Colombia for its ordinary and preferred shares, under a contract with Credicorp Capital Colombia executed on December 1st, 2023, with an initial term of one year from its execution. This program seeks to increase the number of transactions involving Bancolombia's shares through purchase and sale orders entered by Credicorp Capital Colombia in the stock market, enabling price formation.

SHARE CAPITAL\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## B.                 MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\n\nSet forth below is certain information concerning the Bank's capital stock and a brief summary of certain significant provisions of the Bank's bylaws and Colombian corporate law. This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the Bank's bylaws (an English translation of which is attached as Exhibit 1 to this Annual Report) and to Colombian corporate law.\n\n## Bancolombia's Corporate Purpose\n\nPursuant to Article 4 of its bylaws, Bancolombia's corporate purpose consists of all kinds of banking operations, business, acts and services. Subject to applicable law, Bancolombia may carry out all the activities and investments authorized to banks. Bancolombia is also authorized to participate in the capital stock of other companies, subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nAs of the date of filing of this Annual Report, Bancolombia's board of directors is composed of seven directors, elected for a two-year term, with no alternate directors. For additional information regarding Bancolombia's current directors please see Item 6.A, 'Directors and Senior Management'.\n\nAfter being designated, all of the members of the Board of Directors need an authorization from the Superintendency of Finance. The Superintendency of Finance assesses whether the director has an adequate profile for the position according to the requirements under Colombian Law.\n\nAccording to Decree 3923 of 2006, the election of independent directors must be in a separate ballot from the ballot to elect the rest of directors, unless the reaching of the minimum number of independent directors required by law or by the by-laws is assured, or when there is only one list that includes the minimum number of required independent directors. According to Law 964 of 2005, 25% of the members of the board of directors shall be independent. An 'independent director' is a director who is NOT: (i) an employee or director of the issuer or any of its parent or subsidiary companies, including all those persons acting in said capacity during the year immediately preceding that in which they were appointed, except in the case of an independent member of the board of directors being re-elected; (ii) shareholders, who either directly or by virtue of an agreement direct, guide or control the majority of the entity's voting rights or who determine the majority composition of the administration, the board of directors or other corporate bodies of this same entity; (iii) a partner or employee of any association or firm that provides advisory or consultancy services to the issuer or to companies who belong to the same economic group to which the issuer in question belongs, in the event that income obtained from such services represent for said association or firm twenty percent (20%) or more of its total operating income; (iv) an employee or  director  of  a  foundation,  association  or  institution  that  receives  significant  donations  from  the  issuer.  The  term 'significant donations' is quantified as being twenty percent (20%) or more of the total amount of donations received by the respective institution; (v) an administrator of any entity on whose board of directors a legal representative of the issuer participates; and (vi) any person who receives from the issuer any kind of remuneration different from fees as a member of the board of directors, of the audit committee or any other committee set up by the board of directors.\n\nThe Good Governance Code, aiming to strengthen the independence of the board, establishes the following criteria to qualify a director as non-independent:",

Under that system: (i) each holder of common shares is entitled at the annual general shareholders' meeting to nominate for election one or more directors; (ii) each nomination of one or more directors constitutes a group for the purposes of the election; (iii) each group of nominees must be listed in the order of preference for nominees in that group to be elected; (iv) once all groups have been nominated, holders of common shares may cast one vote for each common share held in favor of a particular group of nominees. Votes may not be cast for particular nominees in a group; they may be cast only for the entire group; (v) the total number of votes casted in the election is divided by the number of directors to be elected. The resulting quotient is the quota of votes necessary to elect particular directors. For each time that the number of votes cast for a group of nominees is divisible by the quota of votes, one nominee from that group is elected, in the order of the list of that group; and (vi) when no group has enough remaining votes to satisfy the quota of votes necessary to elect a director, any remaining board seat or seats are filled by electing the highest remaining nominee from the group with the highest number of remaining votes cast until all available seats have been filled.",

If the director is a shareholder, his or her vote shall be excluded from the respective decision  process.  In  any  case,  the  general  shareholders  meeting  could  only  grant  its  authorization  if  the  act  does  not adversely affect Bancolombia's interests. In the general annual shareholders meeting the shareholders are responsible for determining, the compensation of the members of the board of directors.\n\nPursuant to the by-laws of Bancolombia, the board of directors has the power to authorize the execution of any agreement, within the corporate purpose of Bancolombia, and to adopt the necessary measures in order for the Bank to accomplish its purpose, except for agreements that, by law, can only be authorized at the Shareholders' Meeting. Furthermore, the board of directors must authorize certain transactions such as the issuance of Bank's bonds or common shares up to the total amount of authorized capital stock.\n\nWith  respect  to  the  appointment  of  directors  of  the  other  companies  of  the  Group,  on  March  17,  2023,  the  Good Governance Code was amended in order to clarify that Bancolombia's President, with the support of the Corporate Vice Presidents, will be responsible for appointing the nominees as members of the Board of Directors of the companies that are part of the Group, without requiring the  previous approval of the Board of Directors of Bancolombia.\n\n## Description of Share Rights, Preferences and Restrictions\n\nBancolombia's bylaws provide for an authorized capital stock of COP 700 billion divided into 1,400,000,000 shares of a par value of COP 500 each, which must belong to one of the following classes: (i) common shares, (ii) privileged shares; and (iii) shares with preferred dividend and no voting rights ('preferred shares').

These general meetings may be ordinary meetings or extraordinary meetings.\n\nOrdinary general shareholder's meetings occur at least once a year but no later than three months after the end of the prior fiscal year, for the following purposes: (i) to consider the approval of Bancolombia's annual report, including the financial statements for the preceding fiscal year; (ii) to review the annual report prepared by the external auditor; (iii) to determine the compensation for the members of the board of directors, and the external auditor (the external auditor compensation is determined every two years) (iv) to elect, every two years, the members of the board of directors, the external auditor and the Financial Consumer Representative ('defensor del consumidor financiero'). The Financial Consumer Representative's primary duty is to solve the individual complaints submitted by clients and users and serve as their spokesman; and (v) to determine the dividend policy and the allocation of profits, if any, of the preceding fiscal year, as well as any retained earnings from previous fiscal years.\n\nExtraordinary general shareholders' meetings may take place when duly called for a specified purpose or purposes, or, without prior notice, when holders representing all outstanding shares entitled to vote on the issues presented are present at the meeting.\n\nQuorum for both ordinary  and  extraordinary  general  shareholders'  meetings  to  be  convened  at  first  call  requires  the presence of two or more shareholders representing at least half plus one of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the relevant meeting.

Notice of ordinary meetings and extraordinary meetings convened to approve fiscal year-end financial statements, the reduction of the outstanding capital, the merger, spin-off or sale of more than 25% of the assets, liabilities and contracts, and the election of Board Members, must be published in one newspaper of wide circulation at Bancolombia's principal place of business at least 15 business days prior to such meeting.

Under  these  circumstances,  Bancolombia  will  be obligated to comply in a timely manner.\n\n## Preferred Shares\n\nThe holders of preferred shares are not entitled to receive notice of, attend to or vote at any general shareholders' meeting except as described below.\n\nThe holders of preferred shares will be entitled to vote on the basis of one vote per share at any shareholders' meeting, whenever a shareholder's vote is required on the following matters, in addition to those indicated above: (i) when voting the anticipated dissolution, merger or transformation of the corporation or change of its corporate purpose. (ii) when the preferred dividend has not been fully paid during two consecutive annual terms. In this event, holders of such shares shall retain their voting rights until the corresponding dividends have been fully paid to them. (iii) if at the end of a fiscal period, the Bank's profits are not enough to pay the minimum dividend and the Superintendency of Finance, by its own decision or upon petition of holders of at least ten percent (10%) of preferred shares, determines that benefits were concealed or shareholders were misled with regard to benefits received from the Bank by the Bank's directors or officers decreasing the profits to be distributed, the Superintendency of Finance may resolve that holders of preferred shares should participate with  speaking  and  voting  rights  at  the  general  shareholders'  meeting,  in  the  terms  established  by  law.  (iv)  when  the registration of shares at the Colombian Securities Exchange or at the Superintendency of Finance, is suspended or canceled.

        "page_content": "## Dividends Common Shares\n\nOnce the unconsolidated Financial Statements are approved by the general shareholders meeting, the appropriation for the payment of taxes of the corresponding taxable year has been made, and the transfers to the reserves have been performed, then they can determine the allocation of distributable profits, if any, of the preceding year.\n\nUnder  the  Colombian  Commercial  Code,  a  company  must  distribute  at  least  50%  of  its  annual  net  profits  to  all shareholders, payable in cash, or as determined by the shareholders, within a period of one year following the date on which the shareholders determine the dividends. If the total amount segregated in all reserves of a company exceeds its outstanding capital, this percentage is increased to 70%. The minimum common stock dividend requirement of 50% or 70%, as the case may be, may be waived by a favorable vote of the holders of 78% of a company's common stock present at the meeting.\n\nUnder Colombian law and Bancolombia's bylaws annual net profits are to be applied as follows: (i) first, an amount equivalent  to  10%  of  net  profits  is  segregated  to  build  a  legal  reserve  until  that  reserve  is  equal  to  at  least  50%  of Bancolombia's paid-in capital; (ii) second, payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares; and (iii) third, allocation  of  the  net  profits  is  determined  by  the  holders  of  a  majority  of  the  common  shares  entitled  to  vote  on  the recommendation of the board of directors and the President and may, subject to further reserves required by the by-laws, be distributed as dividends. Under the Bank's bylaws, the dividends payable to the holders of common shares  cannot exceed the dividends payable to holders of the preferred shares. Bancolombia's bylaws requires the Bank to maintain a reserve fund equal to 50% of paid-in capital. All common shares that are fully paid in and outstanding at the time a dividend or other distribution is declared are entitled to share equally in that dividend or other distribution. Common shares that are only partially-paid participate in a dividend or distribution in the same proportion as the shares that have been fully paid in at the time of the dividend or distribution.\n\nThe general shareholders' meeting may allocate a portion of the profits to welfare, education or civic services, or to support economic organizations of the Bank's employees.\n\n## Preferred Shares\n\nHolders of preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends based on the net profits of the preceding fiscal year, after deducting losses affecting the capital and once the amount that shall be legally set apart for the legal reserve has been deducted, but before creating or accruing for any other reserve, of a non-cumulative minimum preferred dividend equal to one percent (1%) yearly of the subscription price of the preferred share, provided this dividend is higher than the dividend assigned to common shares. If this is not the case, the dividend shall be increased to an amount that is equal to the per share dividend on the common shares. The dividend received by holders of common shares may not be higher than the dividend assigned to preferred shares.\n\nPayment of the preferred dividend shall be made at the time and in the manner established in the general shareholders' meeting and with the priority indicated by Colombian law.\n\nIn the event that the holders of preferred shares have not received the minimum dividend for a period in excess of two consecutive fiscal years, they will acquire certain voting rights. See Item 10. 'Aditional Information - B. Memorandum and  Articles  of  Association  -  Description  of  Share  Rights,  Preferences  and  Restrictions  -  Voting  Rights  -  Preferred Shares'.\n\n## General Considerations Relating to Dividends\n\nIn the general shareholders' meeting, shareholders will determine the effective date, the system and the place for payment of dividends, including payment in installments.\n\nDividends declared on the common shares and the preferred shares will be payable to the record holders of those shares, as  they  are  recorded  on  Bancolombia's  stock  registry,  on  the  appropriate  record  dates  as  determined  in  the  general shareholders' meeting.",

        "page_content": "Any dividend in shares payable by Bancolombia will be paid in common shares to the holders of common shares and in preferred shares to the holders of preferred shares. Nonetheless, Shareholders at the general shareholders' meeting may authorize the payment in common shares to all shareholders.\n\nAny dividend in shares requires the approval of 80% or more of the shares present at a shareholders' meeting, which will include 80% or more of the outstanding preferred shares. In the event that such voting majority is not obtained, shareholders may individually elect to receive a stock dividend or a cash dividend.\n\n## Liquidation Rights\n\nBancolombia will be dissolved if certain events take place, including the following: (i) its term of existence, as stated in the by-laws, expires without being extended by the shareholders prior to its expiration date; (ii) when, according to the financial statements, there is no realistic alternative to liquidating the entity or ceasing operations, (iii) by decision at the general shareholders' meeting; and (iv) in certain other events expressly provided by law and in the by-laws.\n\nUpon dissolution, a liquidator must be appointed by the general shareholders' meeting to wind up its affairs. In addition, the Superintendency of Finance has the power to take over the operations and assets of a bank and proceed to its liquidation under certain circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the 'Estatuto Org\u00e1nico del Sistema Financiero', Decree 663 of 1993. For more information see Item 4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8. Supervision and Regulation - Bankruptcy Considerations'.\n\n## Preemptive Rights and Other Anti-Dilution Provisions\n\nUnder the Bank's bylaws, the holders of common shares determine in their meeting the amount of authorized capital stock, and the board of directors has the power to (a) order the issuance and regulate the terms of subscription of common shares up to the total amount of authorized capital stock and (b) regulate the issuance of shares with rights to a preferential dividend but without the right to vote, when expressly delegated at the general shareholders' meeting. The issuance of preferred shares must always be first approved at the general shareholders' meeting, which shall determine the nature and extent of any privileges, according to the bylaws and Colombian law.\n\nThe Bank's bylaws and Colombian law require that, whenever the Bank issues new shares of any outstanding class, it must offer the holders of each class of shares the right to purchase a number of shares of such class sufficient to maintain their existing percentage ownership of the aggregate capital stock of the Bank. These rights are called preemptive rights. See Item 3. 'Key Information - D. Risk Factors - Preemptive rights may not be available to holders of American Depositary Receipts ('ADRs') evidencing ADSs'.\n\nShareholders at a general meeting of shareholders may suspend preemptive rights with respect to a particular capital increase by a favorable vote of at least 70% of the shares represented at the meeting. Preemptive rights must be exercised within the period stated in the share placement terms of the increase, which cannot be shorter than 15 business days following the publication of the notice of the public offer of that capital increase. From the date of the notice of the share placement terms, preemptive rights may be transferred separately from the corresponding shares.\n\nThe  Superintendency  of  Finance  will  authorize  decreases  in  the  outstanding  capital  stock  decided  by  the  holders  of common shares only if: (i) Bancolombia has no liabilities; (ii) Bancolombia's creditors consent in writing; or (iii) the outstanding capital stock remaining after the reduction represents at least twice the amount of Bancolombia's liabilities.\n\n## Limits on Purchases and Sales of Capital Stock by Related Parties\n\nPursuant to the Colombian Commerce Code, the members of the Bank's board of directors and certain of the Bank's principal executive officers may not, directly or indirectly, buy or sell shares of the Bank's capital stock while they hold their  positions,  except  when  dealing  with  nonspeculative  operations  and  in  that  case  they  need  to  obtain  the  prior authorization  of  the  board  of  directors  passed  with  the  vote  of  two-thirds  of  its  members  (excluding,  in  the  case  of transactions by a director, such director's vote) or when deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the Bank with the authorization of the Shareholders Meeting the affirmative vote of the ordinary majority foreseen in the bylaws, excluding",

Any transfer of shares equal to or greater than 5% of the Bank's capital stock or any person acquiring a percentage of shares that would make him the beneficial owner of 5% or more of the Bank's capital stock, is a material event, and therefore, must be disclosed to the Superintendency of Finance.\n\n## Changes in the Capital of the Company\n\nThere are no conditions in the Bank's by-laws governing changes in the Bank's capital stock that are more stringent than those required under Colombian law.\n\n## C.                 MATERIAL CONTRACTS\n\nBancolombia has not entered into any contract, other than those entered in the ordinary course of business or that are not considered to be material, to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party, for the two years immediately preceding the date of this Annual Report.\n\n## D.                 EXCHANGE CONTROLS\n\nThe Colombian Foreign Exchange Regime allows Colombian residents to acquire in the exchange market the currencies required to carry out their operations. For such purpose, the Colombian Foreign Exchange establishes certain procedures that must be followed in order to carry out foreign exchange operations, which are known as 'channeling of currencies', through the exchange market. This channeling must be carried out through an Intermediary of the Exchange Market (such as  commercial Banks in Colombia), or through compensation accounts (bank accounts abroad opened by Colombian Residents registered before the Central Bank). Therefore, there are no limitations regarding the import or export of capital, including the availability of cash and cash equivalents for use by the Group. Nevertheless, these operations must be carried out following the applicable procedures.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Statute, Law 9 of 1991, outlines the Colombian foreign exchange regime which relates to matters such  as  imports  and  exports  of  goods,  foreign  indebtedness,  and  guarantees  in  foreign  currencies,  among  others. Additionally, Decree 1068 of 2015 and Decree 119 of 2017, as amended, sets forth an International Investments Regime which provides for rules applicable to foreign residents who invest in the Colombian securities markets and undertake other types of investments, prescribes registration before the Central Bank of certain foreign exchange transactions, and",

Both, the Foreign Exchange Statute and the International Investments Regime are regulated by External Resolution No. 1 of 2018 and External Regulating Circular DCIP-83, both as amended, of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank.\n\nUnder Colombian law and the Bank's bylaws, foreign investors receive the same treatment as Colombian citizens with respect to ownership and the voting rights of ADSs and preferred shares, as well as the remittance abroad of dividends, or any other type of proceedings derived from any type of securities investments duly registered before the Colombian Central Bank. For a detailed discussion of ownership restrictions see Item 4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8. Supervision and Regulation - Ownership and Management Restrictions'.\n\n## E.                 TAXATION\n\n## Colombian Taxation\n\n## ADRs do not have the same tax treatment as other equity investments in Colombia.\n\nAlthough ADRs represent Bancolombia's preferred shares, they are held through a foreign capital fund in Colombia, subject to a specific tax regulatory regime. Accordingly, the applicable law in Colombia to equity investments, particularly those relating to dividends and profits from sales, are not applicable to ADRs, including the Bank's ADRs.\n\nUnder Section 18-1 of the Colombian Tax Code, modified by Law 2010 of 2019, dividends were subject to a dividend tax, as follows:\n\n## Foreign Portfolio investment\n\nTo determine the income tax concerning the profits earned from the foreign portfolio investments, regardless of the method or vehicle used to invest by the investor, the following rules shall apply:\n\n- i. Dividends subject to CIT at the corporate level are  taxed at 10%.\n- ii. Dividends that did not pay CIT at the corporate level are subject to the equalization tax at 25% upon distribution, plus a 20% dividend tax on top of it.\n- iii. The tax is to by collected via withholding tax on the accrual or cash basis.\n\n## Tax residence for Individuals\n\nFor  Colombian  tax  purposes,  an  individual  is  considered  a  tax  resident  if  the  individual  meets  any  of  the  following requirements:\n\n- -He or she remains in Colombia (continuously or not) for an aggregate period of 183 calendar days or more, including entry and departure days from the country, within a period of 365 consecutive calendar days. If that requirement is met by considering the days spent in Colombia over two successive fiscal years, the individual would be viewed as a tax resident as of the second fiscal year\n- -Individuals  who  work  for  the  Colombian  Foreign  Services  in  other  countries  under  the  Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations and their income and capital gains are exempt from taxation in the country they serve.\n\nIf the individual is a Colombian citizen and falls within any of the following scenarios:\n\n- a) The spouse or dependents are tax residents in Colombia\n- b) 50% or more of their income is a Colombian-sourced income.",

Companies incorporated in Colombia under Colombian Laws qualify as National Companies and are taxed on their worldwide income. For Colombian tax purposes, a non-resident entity that is effectively managed in Colombia would be considered as a Colombian entity (effective place of management).\n\n## Preferred shares\n\nPreferred shares will have the same treatment as financial liabilities for the issuer's tax purposes. The treatment will be the same as financial assets for the holder. This treatment will not apply to listed shares that do not comply with the rest of the requirements established by Section 33-3 of the Colombian Tax Code.\n\n## Other Tax Considerations\n\nAs of the date of this report, there is not a Double Taxation Treaty between Colombia and the United States.\n\n## United States Federal Income Taxation Considerations\n\nThis section describes the material United States federal income tax consequences generally applicable to a U.S. holder (as defined below) of owning preferred shares or ADSs. It applies to you only if you hold your preferred shares or ADSs as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes. This discussion addresses only United States federal income taxation  and  does  not  discuss  all  of  the  tax  consequences  that  may  be  relevant  to  you  in  light  of  your  individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including:\n\n- \u00b7 A dealer in securities,\n- \u00b7 A bank,\n- \u00b7 A trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings,\n- \u00b7 A tax-exempt organization,\n- \u00b7 A life insurance company,\n- \u00b7 A person that actually or constructively owns 10.00% or more of the combined voting power of the Bank's voting stock or of the total value of the Bank's stock,\n- \u00b7 A person that holds preferred shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction for United States federal income tax purposes,",

These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. There is currently no comprehensive income tax treaty between the United States and Colombia. In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nIf an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the preferred shares or ADSs, the United States federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding the preferred shares or ADSs should consult its tax advisor with regard to the United States federal income tax treatment of an investment in the preferred shares or ADSs.\n\nYou are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of preferred shares or ADSs and you are:\n\n- \u00b7 A citizen or resident of the United States,\n- \u00b7 A domestic corporation (or an entity treated as a domestic corporation),\n- \u00b7 An estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source, or\n- \u00b7 a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more United States persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\nIn general, and taking into account the earlier assumptions, for United States federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing ADSs, you will be treated as the owner of the preferred shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of preferred shares for ADRs, and ADRs for preferred shares generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax.\n\nThe tax treatment of your preferred shares or ADSs will depend in part on whether or not we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes. Except as discussed below under 'PFIC Rules', this discussion assumes that we are not classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes.\n\nYou should consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state and local and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of preferred shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\n\n## Taxation of Distributions\n\nUnder the United States federal income tax laws, the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes), other than certain prorata distribution of the Bank's preferred shares, including the amount of any Colombian tax withheld, will be treated as a dividend that is subject to United States federal income taxation. If you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, dividends paid to you that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided that you hold the preferred shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date (or, if the dividend is attributable to a period or periods aggregating over 366 days, provided that you hold the preferred shares or ADSs for more than 90 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date) and meet other holding period requirements. Dividends we pay with respect to the ADSs generally will be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. The Bank believes that its ADSs, which are listed on the NYSE, are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States; however, there can be no assurance",

        "page_content": "that the Bank's ADSs will continue to be readily tradable on an established securities market. Because the preferred shares are not listed on any United States securities market, it is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to the preferred shares will also be qualified dividend income. If dividends we pay with respect to the Bank's preferred shares are not qualified dividend income, then the U.S. dollar amount of such dividends received by a U.S. holder (including dividends received by a non-corporate U.S. holder) will be subject to taxation at ordinary income tax rates.\n\nYou must include any Colombian tax withheld from the dividend payment in this gross amount even though you do not in fact receive it. The dividend is taxable to you when you, in the case of preferred shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs,  receive  the  dividend,  actually  or  constructively.  The  dividend  will  not  be  eligible  for  the  dividends-received deduction  generally  allowed  to  United  States  corporations  in  respect  of  dividends  received  from  other  United  States corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income will be the U.S. dollar value of the Colombian Peso payments made, determined at the spot Colombian Peso / U.S. dollar rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the dividend is distributed to the date you (or the Depositary on your behalf) convert the payment into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in the preferred shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not expect to calculate earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to generally treat distributions with respect to preferred shares or ADSs as dividends.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the Colombian tax withheld and paid over to Colombia will be creditable or deductible against your United States federal income tax liability. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to preferential rates. To the extent a refund of the tax withheld is available to you under Colombian law, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against your United States federal income tax liability. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances.\n\nFor  foreign  tax  credit  purposes,  dividends  will  generally  be  income  from  sources  outside  the  United  States  and  will generally be 'passive' income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you.\n\nThe rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.\n\n## Taxation of Capital Gains\n\nIf you sell or otherwise dispose of your preferred shares or ADSs, you will recognize capital gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount that you realize and your tax basis, determined in U.S. dollars, in your preferred shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the property is held for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\n## PFIC Rules\n\nWe believe that we are not currently classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes, and we do not expect to  become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. In addition, our current position that we do not expect to be a PFIC is based on our position that we qualify for a special rule that treats income recognized by a bank in the active conduct of a banking business as active income for PFIC purposes (the 'active bank exception'). It is possible, however, that we may not satisfy the requirements of the active bank exception in the current or a future taxable year, or that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service may issue guidance in the future under which we would not satisfy the requirements of the active bank exception. In such a case, our interest income would be treated as passive income for PFIC purposes and we would therefore be",

If a foreign corporation owns at least 25% by value of the stock of another corporation, the foreign corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation, and as receiving directly its proportionate share of the other corporation's income.\n\nIf we are treated as a PFIC, you will generally be subject to special rules with respect to:\n\n- \u00b7 any gain you realize on the sale or other disposition of your preferred shares or ADSs and\n- \u00b7 any excess distribution that we make to you (generally, any distributions to you during a single taxable year, other than the taxable year in which your holding period in the preferred shares or ADSs begins, that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by you in respect of the preferred shares or ADSs during the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, your holding period for the preferred shares or ADSs that preceded the taxable year in which you receive the distribution).\n\nUnder these rules:\n\n- \u00b7 the gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over your holding period for the preferred shares or ADSs,\n- \u00b7 the amount allocated to the taxable year in which you realized the gain or excess distribution or to prior years before the first year in which we were a PFIC with respect to you will be taxed as ordinary income,\n- \u00b7 the amount allocated to each other prior year will be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year, and\n- \u00b7 the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such year.\n\nSpecial rules apply for calculating the amount of the foreign tax credit with respect to excess distributions by a PFIC.\n\nUnless you make certain elections, your preferred shares or ADSs will generally be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during your holding period in your preferred shares or ADSs, even if we are not currently a PFIC.\n\nIn addition, notwithstanding any election you make with regard to the preferred shares or ADSs, dividends that you receive from us will not constitute qualified dividend income to you if we are a PFIC (or are treated as a PFIC with respect to you) either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year. Dividends that you receive that do not constitute qualified dividend income are not eligible for taxation at the preferential rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Instead, you must include the gross amount of any such dividend paid by us out of our accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) in your gross income, and it will be subject to tax at rates applicable to ordinary income.\n\nIf you own preferred shares or ADSs during any year that we are a PFIC with respect to you, you may be required to file IRS Form 8621.",

'Specified foreign financial assets' may include financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are held for investment and not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-United States persons (including the preferred shares and ADSs), (ii) financial instruments and contracts that have non-United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign entities.  You  are  urged  to  consult  your  tax  advisors  regarding  the  application  of  this  reporting  requirement  to  your ownership of the preferred shares or ADSs.\n\n## FATCA Withholding\n\nUnder FATCA, a 30% withholding tax will be imposed on certain payments to certain non-U.S. financial institutions that fail to comply with information reporting requirements or certification requirements in respect of their direct and indirect United States shareholders and/or United States accountholders. To avoid becoming subject to the 30% withholding tax on payments to  them,  we  and  other  non-U.S.  financial  institutions  may  be  required  to  report  information  to  the  IRS regarding the holders of preferred shares or ADSs and to withhold on a portion of payments under the preferred shares or ADSs to certain holders that fail to comply with the relevant information reporting requirements (or hold preferred shares or  ADSs  directly  or  indirectly  through  certain  non-compliant  intermediaries).  However,  under  proposed  Treasury regulations, such withholding will not apply to payments made before the date that is two years after the date on which final  regulations  defining  the  term  'foreign  passthru  payment'  are  enacted.  The  rules  for  the  implementation  of  this legislation have not yet been fully finalized, so it is impossible to determine at this time what impact, if any, this legislation will have on holders of the preferred shares and ADSs.\n\nFATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, the intergovernmental agreement between the United States and Colombia and official guidance, which are subject to change, and the provisions described above may be implemented in a materially different form.

Market risk represents the potential loss due to adverse changes in market prices of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and other risk factors, such as sovereign risk.\n\nBancolombia's risk management strategy, called the Integrated Risk Management Strategy, is based on principles set by international bodies and by Colombian regulations, and is guided by Bancolombia's corporate strategy. The main objective of the Integrated Risk Management Strategy is to identify measure, coordinate, monitor, report and propose policies for market and liquidity risks of the Bank, which in turn serve to facilitate the efficient administration of Bancolombia's assets and  liabilities.  Bancolombia's  board  of  directors  and  senior  management  have  formalized  the  policies,  procedures, strategies and rules of action for market risk administration in its 'Market Risk Manual'. This manual defines the roles and responsibilities within each subdivision of the Bank and their interaction to ensure adequate market risk administration.\n\nThe Bank's Market Risks Management Office is responsible for: (a) identifying, measuring, monitoring, analyzing and controlling the market risk inherent in the Bank's businesses, (b) analyzing the Bank's exposure under stress scenarios and confirming compliance with Bancolombia's risk management policies, (c) analyzing the methodologies design by the official  price  vendor  for  valuation  of  the  market  value  securities  and  financial  instruments,  (d)  reporting  to  senior management and the board of directors any violation of Bancolombia's risk management policies, (e) reporting to the senior management on a daily basis the levels of market risk associated with the trading instruments recorded in its treasury book (the 'Treasury Book'), and (f) proposing policies to the board of directors and to senior management that ensure the maintenance of predetermined risk levels. The Bank has also implemented an approval process for new products across each of its subdivisions. This process is designed to ensure that every subdivision is prepared to incorporate the new product into their procedures, that every risk is considered before the product is incorporated and that approval is obtained from the board of directors before the new product can be sold.\n\nThe Bank's assets include both trading and non-trading instruments. Trading instruments are recorded in the Treasury Book and include fixed income securities, foreign exchange (FX) and bond futures, and over-the-counter plain vanilla and exotic derivatives. Trading in derivatives includes forward contracts on foreign currency operations, forward contracts on fixed income securities, plain vanilla options on foreign currency, Asian options on U.S. dollar/COP, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Non-trading instruments are recorded in the Bank's banking book (the 'Banking Book'), which includes primarily loans, time deposits, checking accounts and savings accounts.\n\nThe Bank uses a value at risk ('VaR') calculation to limit its exposure to the market risk of its Treasury Book. The board of directors is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR based on its assessment of the appropriate level of risk for Bancolombia. The Propietary Trading Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR by type of investment. These limits are supervised daily by the Market Risk Management Office.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet items denominated in different currencies, either as a result of trading or in the normal course of business. Our principal foreign currency exposure is the U.S. dollar, which is managed by Treasury Division and monitored by measuring positions, VaR and daily results.\n\nFor managing the interest rate risk from banking activities, the Bank analyzes the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities, and the impact of interest rate shocks on the change of economic value of equity and net interest income. In addition, the foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the Banking Book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## Trading Instruments Market Risk Measurement\n\nThe Bank currently measures the Treasury Book exposure to market risk (including over-the-counter derivatives positions) as well as the currency risk exposure of the Banking Book, which is provided to the Treasury Division, using a VaR methodology established in accordance with 'Chapter XXXI of the Basic Accounting Circular', issued by the SFC.\n\nThe  VaR  methodology  established  by  'Chapter  XXXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular'  is  based  on  the  model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee of 2005, which",

In addition, the methodology aggregates all risks by the use of correlations, through an allocation system based on defined zones and bands, affected by given sensitivity factors.\n\nThe total market risk for the Bank is calculated by the arithmetical aggregation of the VaR calculated for each subsidiary. The aggregated VaR is reflected in the Bank's Capital Adequacy (Solvency) ratio, in accordance with Decree 2555 of 2010.\n\nFor purposes of VaR calculations, a risk exposure category is any market variable that is able to cause potential changes in the portfolio value. Taking into account a given risk exposure, the VaR model assesses the maximum loss not exceeded at a specified confidence level over a given period of time. The fluctuations in the portfolio's VaR depend on volatility, modified duration and positions changes relating to the different instruments that are subject to market risk.\n\nThe relevant risk exposure categories for which VaR is computed by Bancolombia according to the 'Chapter XXXI, appendix VI of the Basic Accounting Circular' are: (i) interest rate risks relating to local currency, foreign currency and UVR; (ii) currency risk; (iii) stock price risk; (iv) fund risk and (v) credit default swaps.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk (Treasury Book)\n\nThe interest rate risk is the probability of decrease in the market value of the position due to fluctuations in market interest rates. Bancolombia calculates the interest rate risk for positions in local currency, foreign currency and UVR separately, in  accordance  with  Chapter  XXXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular  issued  by  the  Superintendency  of  Finance.  The calculation of the interest rate risk begins with determining the net position in each instrument and estimating its sensitivity, which is calculated by multiplying its net present value ('NPV') by its 'modified duration' and by the interest rate's estimated fluctuation (as defined by the Superintendency of Finance). The interest rate's fluctuations are established by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia according to historical market performance, as shown in the following table:\n\nFigure 1.

within its corresponding band. A net sensitivity is then calculated for each band, by determining the difference between the sum of all long-positions and the sum of all short-positions. Then a net position is calculated for each zone (which consists of a series of bands) determined by the Superintendency of Finance. The final step is to make adjustments within each band, across bands and within each zone, which results in a final number that is the interest rate risk VaR by currency. Each adjustment is performed following the guidelines established by the Superintendency of Finance.",

Sensitivity Factor for Currency Risks, Equity Risks and Fund Risks\n\n| Currency             | Sensitivity Factor   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|\n| USD                  | 12.49 %              |\n| Euro                 | 11.00 %              |\n| Other currencies     | 13.02 %              |\n| Equity and Fund Risk | 14.70 %              |\n\nThe currency risk VaR increased from COP 78 billion as of December 31, 2022 to COP 333 billion as of December 31, 2023 due to the increase in the position in United States Dollars in Bancolombia' s portfolio. Between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, the average currency risk VaR was COP 186 billion, the maximum COP 374 billion and the minimum COP 51 billion.  Current  currency  risk  primary  arises  from  the  USD  exposure  of  Bancolombia  in  foreign exchange derivatives.\n\nThe equity risk VaR increased from COP 85 billion as of December 31, 2022 to COP 342 billion as of December 31, 2023 driven primarily by the market risk factor reassign of the fund Colombia Inmobiliario investments. Between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, the average equity VaR was COP 332 billion, the maximum COP 348 billion and the minimum COP 312 billion.\n\nThe fund risk, which arises from investment in mutual funds, decreased from COP 388 billion as of December 31, 2022 to COP 16 billion as of December 31, 2023 driven primarily by the market risk factor reassign of the fund Colombia Inmobiliario investments. Between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, the average fund risk VaR was COP 23 billion, the maximum COP 28 billion and the minimum COP 16 billion.\n\n## Total Market Risk VaR\n\nThe total market risk VaR is calculated as the algebraic sum of the interest rate risk, the currency risk, the stock price risk, fund risk and the credit default swaps risk which are calculated as the algebraic sum of Bancolombia and  each of its subsidiaries' exposure to these risks. Currently, Bancolombia does not present exposure to credit default swaps risk.\n\nThe total market risk VaR, increased 22.9%, going from COP 892 billion in December 31, 2022 to COP 1,096 billion as of December 31, 2023, and due mainly to increase in the currency and equity risks mentioned above.\n\n## Assumptions and Limitations of VaR Models:\n\nAlthough VaR models represent a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as predictive of future results. The Bank may incur in losses that could be materially in excess of the",

Changes in interest rates affect Bancolombia's earnings as a result of timing differences on the repricing of the assets and liabilities. The Bank manages the interest rate risk arising from banking activities in non-trading instruments by analyzing the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities. The foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the Banking Book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## Interest Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nThe Bank has performed a sensitivity analysis of market risk sensitive instruments estimating the impact on the net interest income of each position in the Banking Book, using a repricing model and assuming positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points (bps).\n\nThe table 1 provides information about Bancolombia's interest rate sensitivity for the statement of financial position items comprising the Banking Book:\n\nThe  chart  below  provides  information  about  Bancolombia's  interest  rate  risk  sensitivity  in  local  currency  (COP)  at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\n| Interest Rate Risk                      | Interest Rate Risk   | Interest Rate Risk    |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                         | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,    |\n|                                         | 2023                 | 2022                  |\n|                                         | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP    |\n| Assets sensitivity 100 bps              |                      | 1,152,782   1,060,949 |\n| Liabilities sensitivity 100 bps         | 595,749              | 545,911               |\n| Net interest income sensitivity 100 bps | 557,033              | 515,038               |\n\nThe  chart  below  provides  information  about  Bancolombia's  interest  rate  risk  sensitivity  in  local  currency  (COP)  at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:",

A negative sensitivity denotes a higher sensitivity of liabilities than of assets and implies that a rise in interest rates will negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. In the event of a decrease in interest rates, the impacts on net interest income would be opposite to those described above.\n\n## Total Exposure\n\nNet interest income sensitivity in local currency for the banking book instruments, entered for other than trading purposes with positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points was COP 557,033. The variation in the sensitivity of the net interest margin between December 2022 and December 2023 is a result of the increase in the floating loans partially offset by the increase in the fixed rate time deposits.\n\nOn the other hand, the sensitivity to the net interest margin in foreign currency, assuming parallel shifts of 100 basis points, presented a decrease between December 2023 and December 31, 2022, as a result of the reduction in fixed rate loans and the increase in fixed rate time deposits.\n\n## Assumptions and Limitations\n\nNet interest income sensitivity analysis is based on the repricing model and is based on the following key assumptions: (a) does  not  consider  prepayments,  new  operations,  defaults,  etc.,  (b)  the  fixed  rate  instruments  sensitivity,  includes  the amounts with maturity lower than one year and assumes these will be disbursed at market interest rates and (c) changes in interest rate occur immediately and parallel in the yield curves from assets and liabilities for different maturities.\n\n## Structural Equity Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nBancolombia's investment banking affiliate, in its role of financial corporation, has, directly and through its affiliated companies, structural equity investments. These positions are maintained mostly in Industrial and financial sectors. The market value of those investments decreased by 27.4% during the year, from COP 57 billion as of December 31, 2022 to COP 41 billion as of December 31, 2023, mainly as a result of the reduction in the market value of the investments in Enka Shares.\n\nThe structural equity positions are exposed to market risk. Sensitivity calculations are made for those positions:\n\n|              | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|              | 2023                 | 2022                 |\n|              | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Market Value | 41,096               | 56,607               |\n| Delta        | 14.70 %   14.70  %   |                      |\n| Sensitivity  | 6,041                | 8,321                |\n\nA negative impact of 14.7%, applied to the market value, produces a decrease of COP 6 billion in the structural equity investments market value, from COP 41 billion to COP 35 billion.",

When calculating these deadlines, neither the day on which the summons is issued nor the day of the meeting will be counted.\n\nThe agenda shall be included in the summons.\n\nPARAGRAPH: For meetings at which year-end balance sheets, increases in authorized capital, reductions in subscribed capital, spin-offs, mergers, or the assignment of assets, liabilities and contracts representing more than twenty-five percent (25%) of their total value are to be examined, or where members are to be elected to the Board of Directors, these points will be included in the agenda and in the summons.\n\nFor these proposals, the Directors will prepare a report on the reasons for the proposal, which will be made available to shareholders at least fifteen (15) business days before the date set for the meeting.\n\nIn the event of spin-offs, mergers and transformations, the notice shall expressly indicate that shareholders may exercise their right of withdrawal.'\n\n- \u00b7 Changes to Article 41 (Extraordinary sessions) is a regulatory update aligned with the provisions of Article 6 of Law 2069 of 2020, which provides that with the request of a plural number of shareholders representing no less than ten percent (10%) of the subscribed shares, a extraordinary meeting can be summoned.\n\nThe new article is as follows:\n\n' Article 41. Extraordinary sessions . Extraordinary meetings shall be held when required by the Bank's unforeseen or urgent needs, and will be summoned by the Board of Directors, the CEO or the Auditor, either on their own initiative or when applicable regulations do not provide differently regarding the legitimation to request a summon, at the request of a plural number of shareholders representing no less than ten percent (10%) of the subscribed shares.\n\nAt the sessions called under this article the Shareholders' Meeting may not deal with matters other than those indicated on the agenda included with the summons, except by a decision made by the number of shareholders required by law and once the agenda has been exhausted.\n\nThe shareholders' request must be made in writing and clearly indicate the purpose of the summons.",

Elections and voting. Elections and voting by the General Shareholder's Meeting will observe the following rules:\n- 1. Votes may be written and private, or oral and public, but not secret.\n- 2. The Assembly may not make appointments by acclamation.\n- 3.  If  substitute  proposals are  submitted  regarding the items on the agenda, the original proposal of the managers or shareholders presented first in time will be voted on first and then the substitute proposals, in the order in which they were made. When one proposal receives enough votes for its approval, the remaining proposals shall not be put to the vote.\n- 4. Election of the Statutory Auditor and its alternate will require an absolute majority of all shares represented and may be performed simultaneously with the appointment of members of the Board of Directors.\n- 5. When electing members of the Board of Directors, the Shareholders' Meeting must consider the criteria for selection, independence and disqualifications and incompatibilities provided for by law, these Bylaws, and those contained in the Bank's Code of Good Governance, which will be shared regarding each candidate prior to voting. The election of a Board member that does not meet selection or independence criteria or is subject to disqualification or incompatibility will surpass the limits of the social contract.\n\nElections of independent directors shall be held by a separate vote from that of the other Board Members, unless it is ensured that the minimum number of independent members required by law or bylaws will be achieved, or, where only one slate is submitted, that slate includes the minimum number of independent members required by laws of bylaws. Likewise, when setting the compensation for the directors, the Meeting shall consider the number and capacities of its members, their responsibilities and the time required, in such a way that such compensation adequately provides for the contribution the Bank expects from its directors.\n\n- 6. To guarantee the right of all shareholders to examine the proposals of the candidates to the Board of Directors received by  management  in  advance  of  the  General  Meeting  and  to  comply  with  the  prior  review  by  the  Good  Governance Committee,  shareholders  interested  in  submitting  slates  for  the  election  of  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  in compliance with the principles of corporate governance, must submit: (i) candidates to the Board of Directors within five (5)  business  days of  the  summons  to  the  session  of  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting.  The  proposal  must  include a communication signed by the candidates indicating that they meet the criteria of independence and that they are not subject to any disqualifications or incompatibilities; and (ii) slates made up of candidates previously submitted under the former item, at least five (5) business days prior to the date of the  General Shareholders' Meeting. Slates that do not comply with the above requirements and terms will not be put to a vote. Candidates and slates must be submitted in writing, through the offices of the CEO or Secretary General or through the Investor Relations Office. The Good Governance Committee  shall  evaluate  the  suitability,  disqualifications,  incompatibilities,  and  compliance  with  independence requirements for the candidates submitted by shareholders and publish the results of its evaluation at least six (6) business days prior to the date of the Shareholders' Meeting.",

This shall be determined by dividing the total number of votes validly cast by the number of persons to be elected. The count will begin with the slate that received the largest number of votes and in descending order. From each slate, as many names as the quotient in the number of votes cast by it will be declared elected, and if there are any places that remain to be filled, these will correspond to the highest residuals, counting them in the same descending order. Blank ballots will only be counted to determine the electoral quotient. If, at the time of the count, a person on one slate has already been elected because he or she appears on a previous slate, the person that comes next in the order of placement shall be chosen.\n- 8. In the event of a tie in the residuals, in elections performed as provided for in the above rule, the position will be decided by drawing lots.\n- 9. When the name of a candidate is repeated one or more times on the same slate, it will be understood that its name only appears on the first line of the slate they were included on. The other lines where they appear shall be understood to be occupied by the candidate immediately following them on the same slate.\n- 10. If any slate contains a greater number of names than it should contain, the first names in the placement and up to the proper number shall be counted. If the number of names is less, the existing number of names will be counted .\n- 11. When the Shareholders' Meeting declares that the members of the Board of Directors have been legally elected, it shall number them in their order of appointment and election on the single slate or the several slates that, according to the number of votes received, have managed to have their candidates elected. It will thus decide, according to the order of the count, the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh directors.\n- 12.

As a result, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information  required  to  be  disclosed  in  the  reports  the  Bank  files  and  submits  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations of the SEC and  to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\n\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Bank's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe Bank's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:",

Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework version). On this assessment, management concluded that the Bank's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by PwC  Contadores  y  Auditores  S.A.S.  located  in  Colombia  with  PCAOB  ID  6466,  an  independent  registered  public accounting firm, which report is included on page F-5 of this annual report.\n\nIn addition, there were no changes in Bank's internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected or is reasonable likely to materially affect the bank's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## ITEM 16       RESERVED\n\n## A.                  AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT\n\nThe board of directors of Bancolombia appointed Silvina Vatnick as the audit committee financial expert in accordance with SEC rules and regulations.\n\nThe Bank's audit committee financial expert, along with the other members of the Bank's Audit Committee, is considered to be independent according to applicable NYSE criteria.\n\nMrs. Vatnick has served as the Bank's audit committee financial expert since May 2021, in replacement of Mrs. Sylvia Escovar. There is no business relationship between her and the Bank, except for standard personal banking services. Further, there is no fee arrangement between Mrs. Vatnick and the Bank, except in connection with her capacity as a member of the Bank's board of directors and as a member of the Audit and the Risk Committee. Mrs. Vatnick is considered an independent director under Colombian law and the Bank's Good Governance Code, as well as under NYSE's director independence standards. The Audit Committee and the financial expert also have an independent advisor, who provides advice on financial reporting and auditing matters.

The Spanish versions of these codes will prevail for all legal purposes.\n\nThe last update of the Good Governance Code was in March 2023.\n\nThe Code of Ethics was updated on February 20, 2024, with the approval of the Board of Directors. The main updates made are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Inclusion  of  an  ethical  framework  for  analytic  systems  and  Artificial  Intelligence,  based  on  OCDE recommendations.\n- \u00b7 Improvement of language related to diversity, equity and inclusion parameters.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion of new standards to manage non-financial products and services.\n- \u00b7 Behavior standards for digital environments and workspaces.\n- \u00b7 Update of certain defined terms regarding the management of personal data and information.\n\nThe Bank also has a phone line called the 'ethics line' ('l\u00ednea \u00e9tica') which is available for anonymous reporting of any evidence of improper conduct.\n\nUnder the NYSE's Corporate Governance Standards, Bancolombia, as a listed foreign private issuer, must disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by U.S. companies under NYSE listing standards, as follows: Independence of Directors, Non-Executive Director Meetings, Committees of the Board of Directors and Stockholders' Approval of Dividends.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nBancolombia, as a listed company that qualifies as a foreign private issuer under the NYSE listing standards in accordance with the NYSE corporate governance rules, is permitted to follow home-country practice in some circumstances in lieu of the provisions of the corporate governance rules contained in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual that are applicable to U.S. companies. The Bank follows corporate governance practices applicable to Colombian companies and those described in the Bank's Good Governance Code, which in turn follows Colombian corporate governance rules. An English translation of the Good Governance Code is available at Bancolombia's website at www.grupobancolombia.com. The Spanish prevails for all legal purposes.\n\nIn Colombia, a series of laws and regulations set forth corporate governance requirements. External Circular 029 of 2014, issued by the SFC, contains the corporate governance standards to be followed by companies issuing securities.\n\nAdditionally, Law 964 of 2005 established mandatory corporate governance requirements for all issuers whose securities are publicly traded in the Colombian market, and Decree 2555 of 2010, the External Circulars 031 of 2021 and 012 of 2022 regulate the information disclosure requirements, including relevant and periodical information for the Colombian securities issuers. Bancolombia's corporate governance standards comply with these legal requirements and Bancolombia has implemented additional corporate governance measures pursuant to regional recommendations including the OECD White  Paper  on  Corporate  Governance  for  Latin  America  and  the  Andean  Development  Corporation's  (CAF)  Good Governance Code.\n\nThe  following  is  a  summary  of  the  significant  differences  between  the  corporate  governance  practices  followed  by Bancolombia and those applicable to domestic issuers under the NYSE listing standards.\n\n- \u00b7 Independence of Directors. Under NYSE corporate governance rules, a majority of a U.S. company's board of directors must be composed of independent directors. Regarding Colombian legislation, Law 964 of 2005 requires that at least 25% of the members of the Bank's board of directors are independent directors, and Decree 3923 of 2006  regulates  their  election.  Additionally,  Colombian  law  requires  that  all  directors  exercise  independent judgment  under  all  circumstances.  Bancolombia's  Good  Governance  Code  includes  a  provision  stating  that directors shall exercise independent judgment and requires that at least 5 of the 7 directors must be independent.",

'Additional Information. B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Board of Directors'.\n\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Director Meetings. Pursuant to the NYSE listing standards, non-executive directors of U.S. listed companies must meet on a regular basis without management present. There is no prohibition under Colombian regulations  for  officers  to  be  members  of  the  board  of  directors;  however,  it  is  customary  for  Colombian companies to maintain separation between the directors and management. Bancolombia's board of directors does not include any management members; however, the CEO attends the monthly meetings of the Bank's board of directors, and members of senior management may attend the meetings of the board of directors and committees to guarantee an adequate flow of information between employees, management and directors; in both cases, the CEO and members of senior management are not allowed to vote. In accordance with Law 964 of 2005 and the Bank's by-laws, no executive officer can be elected as chairman of the Bank's board of directors.\n- \u00b7 Committees of the Board of Directors. Under NYSE listing standards, all U.S. companies listed on the NYSE must have an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating/corporate governance committee and all members of such committees must be independent. In each case, the independence of directors must be established pursuant to highly detailed rules enacted by the NYSE and, in the case of the audit committee, the NYSE  and  the  SEC.  The  Bank's  board  of  directors  has  a  Designation,  Compensation  and  Development Committee, a Corporate Governance Committee, a Risk Committee and an Audit Committee, each of which is composed  exclusively  of  directors  (Audit  Committee  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  are  composed exclusively of independent directors, whereas the other committees have both independent and non-independent directors).

        "page_content": "## Processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats\n\nThe Bank has a robust set of cybersecurity policies, procedures and key controls designed with the objective of ensuring the organization is well managed, with effective controls over cybersecurity threats. This includes defined cybersecurity responsibilities  for  employees  and  third  party  service  providers,  as  well  as  procedures  for  preventing,  detecting  and mitigating incidents.\n\nThe  Bank  has  established  an  Information  Security  Management  System  (ISMS)  to  prevent,  detect  and  mitigate cybersecurity threats. The ISMS  is composed of policies, standards and controls, baselines, manuals, methodologies, and governance frameworks such as: ISO/IEC 27001, CSF NIST, COBIT 2019 and a maturity model (based on CMMI, ITIL and ISO/IEC 15504 criteria) which is annually updated and available to employees on the Bank's  intranet. In addition, the    Bank    also  relies  on  other  technical  frameworks  such  as  CIS  for  infrastructure  issues  and  OWASp  for  secure development, APIS security and others.\n\nThe information security and cybersecurity policies aim to set forth guidelines that employees and third party service providers must follow in order to mitigate the risks to which information, people, processes, technology and physical infrastructure  are  exposed,  which  could  result  in  losses  to  the  Bank  through  internal  or  external  attacks,  affecting information assets or other essential components of the Bank's operations.\n\nThe Bank has a process to identify, evaluate and manage the material risks of cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity threats are considered within the overall risk management cycle. Once a cybersecurity incident occurs, escalation procedures are put in place to allow for tactical and strategic decisions to be made.\n\nThe Bank invested more than US$50 million in cybersecurity related activities including the enhancement of cybersecurity processes, controls, insurance coverage and human resources capabilities in 2023.\n\nIn order to attempt to reduce our exposure to attacks, the frequency of vulnerability scans in the Bank's technological infrastructure was increased from three to four scans per year. The Bank also worked on the creation of new baselines for the configuration of operating systems and databases, as well as the protection of exposed Internet sites with application firewalls.\n\nIn addition, we engage consultants who carry out cybersecurity assessments taking into account international standards. We  also  entered  into  a  Security  Operation  Center  agreement,  which  incorporated  advanced  monitoring  and  threat intelligence technology to improve the detection and reaction capabilities of the Bank.\n\nThe Bank has also continued its efforts to identify and assess cybersecurity threats associated with its use of third party service providers by: (i) identifying and classifying of the information that the Bank shares with its most critical third party service providers, (ii) conducting a security evaluation of third party service providers, (iii) security scorecards of their public websites, certifications that endorse their respective management, and (iv) requesting reports from external auditors on the operational effectiveness of the controls of key third party service providers. In 2023, there was a 195% increase in the number of third party service providers that were evaluated for cybersecurity risk as compared to 2022.\n\nIn 2023, a series of awareness and training activities were carried out for all our employees and a large number of third party service providers, including seven cybersecurity exercises covering items such as phishing, ransomware and business email  compromise    with  100%  employee  coverage.  Additionally,  a  mandatory  annual  cybersecurity  and  information security virtual courses was taken by the  employees and a virtual training site was created on the intranet for all employees. This site is called Campus de Ciberseguridad\u00a8 (Cybersecurity Campus) and has three learning paths with different levels of content.\n\nTo date, no risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Group, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, the Bank also recognizes the reality of the ever-evolving cyber risk landscape faced by industries and businesses across the world. Depending on their source and nature, cyber incidents could in the future materially affect the Group and its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.",

The advisor attends, when invited,   meetings of the Board of Directors and of relevant  committees and provides his  independent advice and recommendations.\n\nThe Board has two committees that are involved in overseeing cybersecurity risk:\n\n- -The Audit Committee is comprised of three independent Board members, one of whom is the President of the committee and the cyber expert of the Board. The committee evaluates the initiatives aimed at preventing cybersecurity risks, monitors cybersecurity management, is informed about  cybersecurity incidents and reviews the Information Security and Cybersecurity Policies before submission  to the Board for approval on an annual basis. The external cybersecurity and information technology advisor is an invitee of the Committee when cybersecurity matters are  on the agenda for discussion.\n- -The Risk Committee is comprised of three members of the Board and oversees the methodology, procedures and tools for preventing, detecting and mitigating  cybersecurity risks.

The Bank President and Risk Vice-President are permanent invitees.\n\n## Management's  role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks\n\nManagement is responsible for identifying, considering and assessing cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures and maintaining cybersecurity programs.\n\nThe CISO, who reports to the Vice-President of Customer and Employee Services and dedicated personnel on his team are certified and experienced information systems security professionals and information security managers.\n\nThe Bank's President and the Corporate Vice-Presidents receive monthly reports on cybersecurity threats with information such  as  metrics  on  monthly  expected  loss  compliance,  fraud  management,  availability  of  cybersecurity  components, relevant topics like new initiatives, controls, integrations and alerts.\n\nTwo management committees are involved in managing cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe Corporate Cybersecurity Committee approves and promotes cybersecurity and information security policies, strategies and  projects,  monitors    compliance  with  the  strategic  plan  and  prioritizes  initiatives  and  budget  use,  and  monitors significant changes in cyber risks, disseminates and supports the security of information within the organization. The committee  meets  every  three  months,  and  its  members  are  the  Bank's    Vice-Presidents  of  Customer  and  Employee Services,  of  Human  Resources,  and  of  Risk;  and  the  Vice-Presidents  of  Services  of  Bancolombia,  Banistmo,  Banco Agr\u00edcola, Banco Agromercantil and Nequi. The meeting is conducted by the  CISO, as a permanent invitee and although the  Committee's  responsibilities  are  similar  to  those  of  the  Cybersecurity  and  Information  Security  Committee,  the decisions taken at this level have a regional scope with an impact on the other companies in the Group, with specific initiatives for each bank.",

A.\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Bancolombia S.A. and its subsidiaries (the 'Bank') as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). We also have audited the Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with  International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Bank maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Bank's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and on the Bank's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Bank in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Allowance for loans, advances and lease losses\n\nAs described in Notes 2 (section D.4.1.2.1 and E.1), 6 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on evaluations of the loan portfolio utilizing objective and subjective criteria. As of December 31, 2023, the allowance for loan losses was COP$16,223,103 million on total loans of COP$253,951,647 million. As disclosed by management, expected credit losses are calculated using both individual and collective models and methodologies. These are based on significant assumptions and judgements that consider historical credit data, the current situation of the borrower and reasonable and proper forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters such as the probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation (when the loan is classified as stage 2), loss given default, and exposure at default. These models also incorporate a prospective approach that includes assumptions of future macroeconomic\n\nPwC Contadores y Auditores S.A.S., Calle 7 Sur No. 42-70, Torre 2, Piso 11, Edificio Forum, Medell\u00edn, Colombia.\n\nTel: (60-4) 6040606, www.pwc.com/co\n\n\u00a9 2023 PricewaterhouseCoopers.

This evaluation will consider the debt profile of each debtor, the fair value of guarantees granted, information on credit behavior and the expected future cash flows from the client.\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Bank's allowance for loans, advances and lease losses is a critical audit matter are, (i) the significant judgment used by management in determining the expected credit losses, in particular the assumptions used in determining: probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that includes assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios. In addition, for loans individually assessed in Stage 3 analysis of the debt profile of each debtor, information on the credit behavior,  the future cash flows expected from the client and the fair value of guarantees granted, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to these significant assumptions, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming the overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Bank's allowance for loans, advances and leasing losses estimation process, which included controls over the data, models and assumptions used in the estimation process. These procedures also included, among others: testing management's process for estimating the allowance for loan, advances and lease losses by (i) evaluating the appropriateness of  the models utilized for the estimation of the expected loss parameters and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions, such as default at 12 months and lifetime, loss given default and exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios, and evaluating the adjustments, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the estimate and the mathematical accuracy of the impairment calculation for the credit portfolios; and (iii) evaluating individual credit files to determine the reasonableness of management's estimation of the future cash flows expected from the client and the fair value of guarantees granted, estimated by management in the impairment for the credit portfolios. The procedures included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the models utilized by management, methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the credit loss estimates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessment\n\nAs described in Notes 2 (section D.13) and 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank's consolidated goodwill balance was COP$7.818.125 million as of December 31, 2023. The Bank evaluates at the end of each period whether there is any indication that on a stand-alone basis non-financial assets and cash-generating units are impaired. If some indication of impairment does exist, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of the assets and the loss by impairment, the impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Regardless of whether impairment indicators exist, impairment of goodwill is assessed annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. The recoverable amount of non-financial assets or cash-generating units is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, where fair value is determined by Management by reference to market value, if available, by pricing models, or with the assistance of a valuation specialist. While value in use requires Management to make significant assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flow for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; and assess the appropriate discount rate and growth rate.\n\nPwC Contadores y Auditores S.A.S., Calle 7 Sur No. 42-70, Torre 2, Piso 11, Edificio Forum, Medell\u00edn, Colombia.\n\nTel: (60-4) 6040606, www.pwc.com/co\n\n\u00a9 2023 PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Therefore,  the  estimates  and  assumptions  are  constantly reviewed. Any revision is recognized in the same period if it affects the reviewed period; or in the reviewed period and future periods if it affects all the current and future periods.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements under going concern basis\n\nManagement has assessed the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern and confirms that the Bank has adequate liquidity and solvency to continue operating the business for the foreseeable future, which is at least, but is not limited to, 12 months from the end of the reporting period. Based on the Bank's liquidity position at the date of authorization of the consolidated  financial  statements,  Management  maintains  a  reasonable  expectation  that  it  has  adequate  liquidity  and solvency to continue in operation for at least the next 12 months and that the going concern basis of accounting remains appropriate.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to the reported carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities and expenses that might otherwise be required if the going concern basis were not correct.\n\nAssets and liabilities are measured at cost or amortized cost, except for some financial assets and liabilities and investment properties that are measured at fair value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise those classified as assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, debt instruments and equity securities measured at fair value through  other  comprehensive  income  ('OCI')  and  derivative  instruments.  Likewise,  the  carrying  value  of  assets  and liabilities recognized as a fair value hedge are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Almost all investments in associates and joint ventures are measured using the equity method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are stated in Colombian pesos ('COP') and figures are stated in millions or billions (when indicated), except earnings per share, diluted earnings per share and the exchange rate, which are stated in units of Colombian pesos, while other currencies (dollars, euro, pounds, etc.) are stated in thousands.\n\nThe Parent Company's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with 'Normas de Contabilidad e Informaci\u00f3n Financiera' ('NCIF') applicable to separate financial statements, are those that serve as the basis for the distribution of dividends and other appropriations by the shareholders.\n\nThe separate financial statements are those presented by the Parent Company in which the entity recognizes and measures the impairment of credit risk through allowances for loans losses, the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments (such as debt securities and equity instruments) and the recognition of provisions for foreclosed assets, in accordance with the accounting required by the SFC, which differ in certain accounting principles from IFRS that are used in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 2. Revised presentation of Statement of Cash Flow\n\nIn preparing the consolidated statement of cash flow as of December 31, 2023, the Company identified an error in the classification of the amount relating to the exchange difference of operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, that was included in the line 'Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents'. The Company has made adjustments to the prior periods amounts presented in these financial statements accordingly. The Management evaluated the error in the classification and determined that the related impacts were not material.\n\nThe revisions to the  consolidated  statement  of  cash  flow as  of  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  are  summarized  in  the following table:\n\n|                                                                                    | December 31, 2022   (As previously reported)   | Adjustments        | December 31, 2022  (As revised)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                                                                    | In millions of COP                             | In millions of COP | In millions of COP                |\n| Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by  operating activities: |                                                |                    |                                   |\n| Effect of exchange rate changes                                                    | -                                              | (224,788)          | (224,788)                         |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities                                          | 6,564,226                                      | (224,788)          | 6,339,438                         |\n| Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents                       | 3,552,285                                      | 224,788            | 3,777,073                         |\n| Increase (Decrease) in cash and cash equivalents                                   | 2,763,160                                      | (224,788)          | 2,538,372                         |",

Revenues  and  expenses  are  not  offset  unless  such  treatment  is permitted or required by an accounting standard or interpretation and described in the Bank's policies.\n\nThe consolidated statement of comprehensive income presents net income and items of OCI classified by nature and grouped into those that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and those that will be reclassified when specific conditions are met.

Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Financiamiento.

For further information, see Note 1. Reporting entity.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the accounting principles in the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Bank's accounting policies, in order to prepare consolidated financial statements using uniform accounting policies.\n\nAll intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Bank are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling  interests  in  controlled  entities  are  presented  in  profit  or  loss  and  equity  separately  from  the  Parent Company's shareholders equity and profit or loss.

Non-controlling interest\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately within the Bank's equity. Similarly, net income and other comprehensive income are also attributed to non-controlling interest and equity holders of the Parent Company. In a business combination, the amount of non-controlling interest may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquirer's identifiable net assets. The option for recognition is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\n\nAny purchase or sale of shares in subsidiaries that does not imply a loss or gain of control is directly recognized in equity.",

Significant non-controlling interest\n\n## FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Bank increased its participation in the FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia by 30.51% to have greater control over the governance and strategy decisions making in this investment. The participation in this private  equity  fund  amounted  to  80.47%  as  of  December  31,  2022.  With  this  transaction,  FCP  Fondo  Inmobiliario Colombia is no longer considered a significant non-controlling interest for the Bank and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with IFRS 10, changes in the parent's ownership interest in the subsidiary are considered as equity transactions.\n\nDuring 2023, returns were not delivered to the non-controlling interest. During 2022, returns were delivered to the noncontrolling  interest  in  quarterly  installments  due  to  the  nature  of  its  business,  which  mainly  comprises  a  long-  term investment in real estate which is considered a low-risk portfolio.

        "page_content": "## 1. Functional currency, transactions and balances in foreign currency\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the Bank's consolidated financial statements is the Colombian peso. Therefore, all balances and transactions denominated in currencies other than the Colombian peso are considered as foreign currency, which are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end are generally recognized in net income. They are deferred in equity (other comprehensive income) if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured at cost are held at the exchange rate at the transaction date, while those which are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in net income, any exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognized in net income.\n\nThe Bank translated the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries a functional currency as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that consolidated statement of financial position;\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses for  each  statement  of  income  and  statement  of  comprehensive  income  is  translated  at average exchange rates for the period; and\n- \u00b7 All  resulting  of  such  translations  are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  in  the  caption  'Translation adjustment'.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is sold, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to net income, as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing exchange rate.\n\nThe table below sets forth the exchange rate used by the Bank and its subsidiaries to convert consolidated statement of financial position accounts and transactions in U.S. dollar into Colombian pesos:\n\n|                                      | December 31, 2023  December 31, 2022  December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2023  December 31, 2022  December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2023  December 31, 2022  December 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Year-end exchange rate               | 3,822.05                                                  | 4,810.20                                                  | 3,981.16                                                  |\n| Average rate for the period ended at | 4,330.14                                                  | 4,257.12                                                  | 3,747.24                                                  |\n\n## 2.

Amounts  related  to  such  investments  previously  recognized  in  other comprehensive income that must be recycled through net income are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income, as if such investment had been sold. When the associate had other comprehensive income, which was not reclassified to profit or loss, the amounts were reclassified within equity to 'Retained earnings' once the investment was sold.\n\nOn March 1, 2022, the Bank completed the acquisition  of  the  PA  FAI  Calle  77  Trust,  which  constituted  a  business combination. For further details of this transaction, see Note 9.3. Business combination.\n\n## 4. Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\n## 4.1. Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Bank becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way purchases and sales, which are those purchases and sales of financial assets that require the delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the  marketplace.  The  Bank  uses  settlement  date  accounting  for  regular  way  contracts  when  recording  financial  asset transactions.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Bank measures financial assets at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets.  Transaction  costs  of  financial  assets  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value  with  changes  in  profit  or  loss  are recognized as expenses in the income statement. After initial recognition, for financial assets measured at amortized cost and investments in debt securities subsequently measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, an allowance for expected credit losses ('ECL') is recognized.",

Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nThe Bank classifies its financial assets considering the business model and the characteristics of contractual cash flows (cash flows that consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding at specified dates - 'SPPI') in accordance with the following categories of subsequent measurement:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortized cost ,  measured at cost using the effective interest rate method, excluding future credit losses, and considering transaction costs and premiums granted, less commissions and discounts received that are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate.\n- \u00b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI') , measured using fair value, variations in the fair value  of  the  investment  are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income,  except  for  impairment  losses  or recoveries,  interest  income,  and  gains  or  losses  on  foreign  exchange,  which  are  recognized  in  the  income statement.\n- \u00b7 Fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  ('FVTPL') ,  measured  using  fair  value,  variations  in  the  fair  value  are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe classification based on the business model reflects how the Bank manages financial assets and how it determines whether cash flows from the asset will come from obtaining contractual cash flows, selling the instrument, or both. If the objective is to obtain contractual cash flows, the assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost; if the objective is to obtain contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, the assets are subsequently measured at FVOCI.  A financial asset shall be measured at FVTPL unless it is measured at amortized cost or at FVTORI.\n\nThe  Bank  measures  equity  instruments  at  FVTPL.  Likewise,  the  Bank  has  made  an  irrevocable  choice  to  present subsequent  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  some  equity  instrument  investments  that  are  not  held  for  trading  in  other comprehensive income; dividends from such investments are recognized in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established.\n\nAccumulated gains or losses in other comprehensive income at the time of derecognition of a financial asset are reclassified from equity to the income statement, except for investments in equity instruments for which the Bank has made the irrevocable choice to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income; for these, reclassification is made to the \"retained earnings\" line.\n\n## 4.1.2. Impairment  of  financial  assets  at  amortized  cost  or  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income 'FVTOCI'\n\n## 4.1.2.1. Impairment of loan portfolio and financial leasing transactions\n\nExpected credit losses are calculated using both individual and collective models and methodologies. These are based on significant  assumptions  and  judgements  that  consider  historical  credit  data,  the  current  situation  of  the  borrower  and reasonable  and  proper  forecasts  of  future  economic  conditions.  Collective  models  include  parameters  such  as  the probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation (when the loan is classified as stage 2), loss given default, and exposure at default. These models also incorporate a prospective approach that  includes  assumptions  of  future  macroeconomic  conditions  in  plausible  future  scenarios.  In  addition,  for  loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate significant defaulted loans. This evaluation will consider the debt profile of each debtor, the fair value of guarantees granted, information on credit behavior and the expected future cash flows from the client.\n\nAt the end of each period, the Bank assesses the impairment model based on the expected loss of a financial asset or a group of them, measured at amortized cost. The impairment loss will be measured from 'day 1' after its initial recognition. The model is structured in three stages in which the financial asset can be categorized, from its initial recognition. This categorization  considers  the  degree  of  credit  risk,  and  the  circumstances  that  produce  a  significant  increase  in  it,  as described below:",

This calculation takes into account both current and future conditions, the behavior of the portfolio and various associated macroeconomic conditions.\n\n- \u00b7 For stage 1, a 12-month ECL is calculated. This represents the expected credit losses that could occur from default events within 12 months after the reporting date.\n- \u00b7 For stage 2 and 3, a Lifetime ECL is calculated. This represents the expected credit losses that could occur from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument.\n\n## Significant increase in risk\n\nTo determine whether an asset has experienced a significant increase in risk since its initial recognition, and is therefore classified as Stage 2, the Bank performs an assessment of both quantitative and qualitative factors and reviews. For each portfolio, the Bank reviews the rebuttable presumption of more than 30 days overdue in payment. The Bank determines whether the credit risk of financial instruments has increased significantly since their initial recognition as follows:\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\n- \u00b7 Clients who are 90 or more days past due.\n- \u00b7 Lifetime  PD assessment: The  Bank  has  determined  that  the  most  suitable  quantitative  way  to  establish  the significant increase in credit risk is by comparing the residual lifetime PD at the initial recognition and the current lifetime PD. To measure this difference, two thresholds are defined:\n- \u25aa Absolute threshold: This is the absolute difference between the current lifetime PD and the residual lifetime PD at initial recognition. A positive absolute variation beyond this threshold indicates an increase in the instrument's risk.\n- \u25aa Relative threshold: This  is  a  percentage  variation between  the value of the current lifetime PD and the residual lifetime PD at initial recognition. A positive percentage variation beyond this threshold indicates an increase in the instrument's risk.\n\nIf the PD comparison surpasses one threshold but not the other, it is not considered a significant increase in the instrument's risk.\n\nIf the instrument does not exceed the threshold, other qualitative criteria are assessed. These can identify a significant increase in credit risk even when the obligation is nearing expiration. The criteria are as follows:\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\n- \u00b7 Assets restructured due to risk, where the client is experiencing financial difficulties, are classified in stage 2, until the instrument is canceled, cured, or transferred to stage 3 because it meets the definition of default.\n- \u00b7 Customers who are no longer in default (stage 3) remain in stage 2 for a period of 12 months.\n- \u00b7 Clients on the watch list with a medium risk level.\n- \u00b7 The Bank also reviews every six months to see if there are collective criteria for the migration of a group of clients to stage 2. For example, if a significant change has occurred from the commencement of a specific product or geographic  region,  or  the  occurrence  of  industry  events,  regulatory  changes,  market  changes  or  any  other significant event impacting the generation of future cash flow of the customer's operation.",

It also reviews the rebuttable presumption of more than 90 days overdue in payment for each portfolio.\n\nThe Bank applies the following criteria to ascertain if there is a breach:\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\n- \u00b7 Clients with an active portfolio and who have at least one instrument written off in the modality.\n- \u00b7 Clients who are 90 or more days past due.\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\n- \u00b7 Clients in special states of restructuring, business reorganization or insolvency agreements.\n- \u00b7 Clients on the watchlist a high-risk level.\n- \u00b7 The Bank also aligns all products of the same client to stage 3 when at least one of its obligations is in default.\n\n## Refutable presumption of default beyond 90 days\n\nThe Bank has conducted a review of the default presumption after 90 days past due for each portfolio. Historical evidence indicates a high probability of loss at 90 days. However, this presumption has been refuted for Banistmo's mortgage portfolio. The rationale for this refutation is the historical evidence that demonstrates the default typically occurs at 120 days.\n\n## Collective methodology for measuring expected credit losses\n\nThe collective quantification of expected credit losses is conducted based on the stage classification, the homogeneous groups defined within each portfolio type and the client's risk level.\n\nHomogeneous groups are segmented by client type; for individuals, they are grouped by product, and for companies, they are grouped by industry segments defined by the client's sales level.\n\nLikewise, the risk level is assigned by customer type. For individuals, the risk is assessed using a behavioral scoring model for consumer products and a separate scoring model for housing products. The purpose of these models is to rank customers according  to  risk,  allowing  for  more  effective  monitoring.  The  rating  is  based  on  historical  behavior,  transactional information, and customer product information. The consumer portfolio rating system is evaluated using various advanced statistical  methodologies.  These  models  allow  the  inclusion  of  a  greater  number  of  variables  related  to  the  customer, providing a more precise rating that aligns with the risk level.\n\nFor companies, risk levels are assessed using an internal rating model that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative variables as financial indicators. Clients are ranked on a scale from 1 to 19. This process also takes into account regional qualification programs, local market factors, and the client's market knowledge.\n\nIn Colombia, for SME and Corporate portfolio, the risk level is estimated based on models that allow assigning an internal rating to a client considering their economic sector and in accordance with multiple variables. These include: financial information, transactional data, sectoral data, qualitative variables, and behavior. These models aim to achieve greater assertiveness  in  classifying  the  risk  level  of  the  Bank's  clients,  greater  discrimination  and  precision,  the  use  of  non-",

These methodologies play a fundamental role in the evaluation and monitoring of credit risk.\n\nTo estimate the expected credit losses ('ECL') under the collective methodology, the following formula is used:\n\n## ECL = Probability of Default * Loss Given Default * Exposure at Default\n\nThe factors are estimated using statistical models developed from internal historical information of the entity and then adjusted with forward-looking information as described below:\n\n- \u00b7 Probability  of  Default  ('PD'): Estimated  probability  of  occurrence  of  a  default  of  an  instrument.  IFRS  9 proposes the specification of this parameter and its application according to the classification of stages 1, 2 and 3.\n- o PD  12  months:  The  estimated  probability  of  occurrence  of  a  default  in  the  next  12  months  of  the instrument's  life  as  of  the  date  of  analysis.  The  Bank  defines  the  use  of  PD  12  months  for  current portfolio that does not present a significant increase in credit risk or any impairment evidence (portfolio classified in stage 1). To estimate the probability of default for 12 months, the Bank uses traditional techniques such as logistic regression, modeling the behavior of the portfolio by level of risk for each of the segments.\n- o Lifetime  PD:  The  estimated  probability  of  occurrence  of  a  default  over  the  remaining  life  of  an instrument, being dependent on the conditions of the product and the level of risk. The Bank defines the use of lifetime PD for portfolio with a significant increase in credit risk (portfolio classified in stage 2). The Bank estimates this factor using survival models which propose a statistical analysis to quantify the survival rate of a portfolio for a given period. One of the advantages of the methodology is the inclusion of prepaid models.\n- o PD stage  3:  The  customers  evaluated  by  the  collective  methodology  in  stage  3  have  an  associated probability of default of 100.00%.\n- \u00b7 Loss Given Default ('LGD'): The severity of Loss Given Default is the percentage of exposure that the entity ultimately expects to lose in the event of a default in a financial instrument. The general formulation for the calculation of the LGD is equal to (1 - Recovery Percentage), where the recovery percentage refers to the sum of the flows received from the transaction discounted at the rate for the client on the date of analysis on the total of the exposure at the time of default, including contractual debt sales and other recovery strategy. For secured products,  this  is  primarily  based  on  collateral  type  and  projected  collateral  values,  the  use  of  appraisals  to determine the value of the collateral and time to repossession and recovery costs observed.\n- \u00b7 Exposure at Default ('EAD'): The exposed value of the asset valued at amortized cost (includes the balance of capital, interest and accounts receivable), this is based on the contractual repayments owed by the borrower over a 12 month or lifetime basis.\n\nFor revolving products and those with available borrowing that is likely to be used in its entirety, the Exposure at Default ('EAD') estimate considers the use of the CCF (credit conversion factor), in order to find a relationship corresponding to the used and unused component of the instrument. To estimate the expected credit losses ('ECL'), a component of probability of becoming loan is included.\n\nTo estimate the lifetime expected credit loss, the exposed balance is projected annually, considering the discount of contractual payments agreed with the client for each year. Cash flows are discounted at the effective interest rate or an approximation of it.",

        "page_content": "## Forward-looking information incorporated in the ECL models\n\nTo incorporate the prospective information to the factors defined for the estimation of the expected loss, the Bank uses methodologies  that  correlate  the  historical  behavior  of  the  portfolio  with  certain  economic  variables.  The  Bank  uses projections based on three macro scenarios (base, pessimistic and optimistic); each scenario has a plausible probability of occurrence to evaluate the best estimate of the expected loss under possible future economic conditions.\n\nTo make the projections, the Corporate Economic Research team has defined a process for the generation of estimates under two perspectives: thematic and analytical.\n\n- \u00b7 Thematic Perspective: In the first instance, a series of external variables are defined, which are those whose values are established at a global level and in whose definition the idiosyncratic dynamics of the analyzed country have no incidence. As these are issues whose detailed study is beyond the scope of the Corporate Economic Research team, the Bank uses as reference the estimates made by external analysts.\n- \u00b7 Analytical Perspective: This consists in the compilation of the historical information for the most important economic and financial variables of the country. The information bases are compiled from official sources, which mostly correspond to official authorities, such as the Superintendency or Central Bank of each country. The Bank estimates forecasts based on time series models widely used in econometrics.\n\nAs a result, projections are obtained for the economic variables of interest, which are formulated monthly in a time horizon that includes the current year and five subsequent years. After five years, given the technical difficulties and the high uncertainty, the projection of the economic variables for the total remaining useful life of each instrument corresponds to the value of the last projection.\n\nThe Bank considers that a five year projection horizon continues to be reasonable and that maintaining the fifth-year estimate  for  subsequent  periods  is  a  good  approximation.  This  is  based  on  the  natural  behavior  of  any  statistical  or econometric exercise of variable projection, in which the series tend towards a reversion to the mean or, in this case, to the  long-term  trend  or  equilibrium  level.  Then,  in  subsequent  periods  they  remain  there  once  the  macroeconomic projections reach that steady state and only the materialization of a shock (unpredictable, so it is not possible to project when it will happen) would cause a deviation.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that in a period of 5 years, the macroeconomic variables projection would already be at a level very close to their equilibrium, since historically the maximum periods of consecutive deviation above or below the longterm trend (more or less 0.25 standard deviations of the variable) of the economic cycle (from the series of annual economic growth in the period 1972-2023) has been precisely a period of 5 years.\n\n## Economic scenario weightings\n\nTo incorporate  not  only  a  perspective,  but  also  to  recognize  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  short  and  medium-term economic context that the country will experience, the projection work incorporates three scenarios: base, optimistic and pessimistic.\n\nIt  is  intended  that  each  perspective  contain  reasonable  expectations  and  that  each  has  a  relevant  level  of  probability associated with it. The scenarios are weighted as follows:\n\n|             | Optimistic   | Optimistic   | Base    | Base    | Pessimistic   | Pessimistic   |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|\n| Country     | 2023         | 2022         | 2023    | 2022    | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Colombia    | 15.00 %      | 15.00 %      | 50.00 % | 45.00 % | 35.00 %       | 40.00 %       |\n| Panama      | 20.00 %      | 15.00 %      | 50.00 % | 55.00 % | 30.00 %       | 30.00 %       |\n| El Salvador | 20.00 %      | 15.00 %      | 55.00 % | 55.00 % | 25.00 %       | 30.00 %       |\n| Guatemala   | 20.00 %      | 15.00 %      | 55.00 % | 55.00 % | 25.00 %       | 30.00 %       |",

|\n\n## Special methodologies applied in stage 3\n\n## Collateral methodology\n\nFor defaulted loans (stage 3), when it is determined that the fundamental source of collection is a mortgage guarantee or a leased asset, the amount of the loss is estimated as the balance owed minus the weighted net present value of the market value of the collateral, estimated through appraisals with an age no longer than one year, minus the costs of obtaining, maintaining and selling the collateral, and affected by several macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence that result in a weighted expected loss.\n\n## Individual methodology\n\nThe Bank will individually evaluate defaulted loans (stage 3) greater than COP 20,000 or USD 5 for foreign subsidiaries, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, the guarantees granted and information on the credit behavior of the client and of the sector. Significant financial assets are considered in default when, based on current or past information and events, it is probable that the entity will not be able to recover all the amounts described in the original contract, including the interest  and  commissions agreed to in the contract. When a significant financial asset has been identified as being in default, the amount of the loss is measured as the balance due minus the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence.\n\nCustomers classified as individual methodology will be evaluated at least twice a year and, additionally, each time a relevant event occurs that reflects in significant changes in their level of risk and that leads to a change in the scenarios previously analyzed. The relevant events can be:\n\n- \u00b7 Significant changes in the value of the guarantee,\n- \u00b7 Expected or adverse changes in the business,\n- \u00b7 Potentially shocking regulatory changes for the business,",

The expected NPV calculation with a cash flow approach includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial projections of the client.\n- \u00b7 Debt simulator.\n- \u00b7 Expected NPV calculation.\n\nApproach via guarantee recovery: This refers to the \"Gone concern\", that is, it is assumed that the payment of the obligation will be given through the execution of guarantees, liquidation of assets, the execution of personal guarantees and adjudication of assets through judicial processes.

        "page_content": "## 4.1.3.2. Modifications\n\nIn modifications for commercial or market reasons, an assessment is made as to whether the modification is substantial; that is, whether the changes in the terms of the contract differ substantially from the original contract, based on the analysis of qualitative variables (inclusion of returns based on profit sharing, guarantees, other collateral, or credit enhancements that significantly affect the credit risk profile associated with the loan, changes in currency and/or obligor) and, in some cases, a quantitative assessment. When the modifications result in derecognition, the renegotiated contract is a new loan, subject to the classification and measurement requirements established by IFRS 9.\n\nSimilarly, the costs and commissions associated with the financial asset are derecognized. Modifications that do not result in derecognition are understood as non-substantial modifications, the carrying amount will be recalculated as the present value  of  the  modified  contractual  cash  flows  discounted  at  the  original  interest  rate,  recognizing  the  effect  of  the modification in the margin net interest in the statement consolidated of income. Likewise, costs and commissions are adjusted and amortized over the remaining life of the modified asset.\n\nContractual modifications of financial assets may be carried out due to restructurings and/or renegotiations for credit risk due to the borrower's financial difficulties are evaluated as a non-substantial modification and therefore does not lead to derecognition. When a financial asset is restructured, the difference between the original contractual cash flow and the new cash flow of the restructured asset discounted at the original effective interest rate is recognized as a gain or loss in the statement consolidated of income as 'Interest income on loan and financial leases', the costs and fees are deferred and will be amortized by the remaining life of the modified asset.\n\n## 4.1.3.3. Written-Off loan portfolio\n\nLoans are written off when the Bank concludes there is no realistic expectation of recovery of the loans and receivables balances from a client or third party, i.e., there is no possibility of recovery due to the debtor's lack of ability or willingness to pay or in the absence of open guarantees granted by the debtor. In general, this characteristic will be fulfilled when the following delinquency conditions are present:\n\n|                     |                                     | Length of delinquency (days)      | Length of delinquency (days)        | Length of delinquency (days)      | Length of delinquency (days)   |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Type                | Collateral                          | Grupo Agromercantil  Holding S.A. | Banistmo S.A.                       | Banco Agr\u00edcola S.A.               | Bancolombia  S.A.              |\n| Commercial          | Without collateral  With collateral | N/A (1)                           | 360                                 | 180  360                          | 360                            |\n| Consumer            | Without collateral  With collateral | 180  540 for vehicles  collateral | 180  1,080 for mortgage  collateral | 180  720 for mortgage  collateral | 180                            |\n| Small Business Loan | Without collateral  With collateral | N/A (1)                           | 180  1,080 for mortgage  collateral | 180                               | 180                            |\n| Mortgage            | With collateral                     | 1,440                             | 1,080                               | 720                               | N/A (1)                        |\n\nAmong the reasons underlying a loan's non-recoverability are the estimated recovery time of the obligation, the probable recovery percentage given the existence or lack of collateral and the inability to locate the client. When default conditions are  present,  it  is  initially  necessary  to  evaluate  whether  the  collateral  that  supports  the  loan  generates  a  reasonable expectation of recovery; if so, the necessary steps are taken to realize on the collateral prior to writing-off the loan. In cases where the collateral net fair value indicates that there are no reasonable expectations of recovery, loans are written-off in the consolidated financial statements.",

Derecognition of Financial Liabilities\n\nThe Bank derecognizes a financial liability from the consolidated statement of financial position when it is extinguished; that is, when the contractual obligation has been paid or settled or has expired.\n\n## Debt Exchange\n\nThe Bank assesses whether instruments subject to debt exchange are substantially different from each other, considering qualitative aspects such as currencies, maturities, interest rates, subordination terms, regulatory framework, among others, and quantitative aspects, in which the present value of discounted cash flows under the conditions of the new instruments (including any net commission paid minus any commission received) using the original effective interest rate to calculate the discount differs by at least 10 percent from the present value of discounted cash flows remaining from the original financial liability.\n\nWhen it is concluded that the instruments subject to debt exchange are not substantially different (based on the analysis of qualitative  variables  such  as  currency  or  issuance  market  changes,  and  in  some  cases  a  quantitative  evaluation),  the transaction is recognized as a modification of debt, and in this case, the amortized cost of the modified liability is adjusted to the present value of estimated contractual cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate of the financial instrument, and the gain or loss is recognized immediately in the income statement. Incremental costs and commissions adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortized over the remaining life of the modified liability, following its subsequent measurement at amortized cost. In debt exchanges that are considered substantially different, derecognition is recognized in the income statement, and a new financial liability is recognized.\n\n## 4.3. Day one profit adjustment\n\nIn situations where the fair value of a financial asset acquired or financial liability assumed at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, the Bank shall recognize a gain or loss directly in the consolidated statement of income if the fair value is supported by Level 1 inputs or is based on a valuation technique that uses only observable market data. In all other circumstances, the Bank defers the Day one gain or loss and recognizes it in the consolidated statement of income over the course of the transaction period.\n\n## 4.4. Compound instruments\n\nThe  Bank  recognizes  compound  financial  instruments  that  contain  both  liability  and  equity  components  separately. Therefore, for initial measurement, the liability component is the fair value of a similar liability which doesn't have an equity component (determined by discounting future cash flows using the market rate at the date of the issuance). The difference between the fair value of the liability component and the fair value of the compound financial instrument,",

After  initial  recognition,  the  liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition. The liability component corresponds to the preferred dividend related to 1% of the subscription price, which is the payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares for each period. For further information, see Note 22. Share capital.\n\n## 4.5. Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nThe Bank issues financial guarantees and loan commitments. Loan commitments are those agreements under which the Bank has an irrevocable obligation to grant the loan. The financial guarantee contracts issued by the Bank are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due to accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nBoth financial  guarantee  contracts  and  loan  commitments are  initially  recognized  as  liabilities  at  fair  value,  which  is normally the fee received, adjusted for the directly attributable transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, liabilities are measured at the higher of the provision amount measured according to IFRS 9, and the amount initially recognized, less the accumulated amortization recognized according to IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nIncome derived from guarantees is recognized as 'commission income' in the consolidated statement of income over the term of the contract, in accordance with the method and frequency of commission's payments.\n\n## 4.6. Derivatives financial instruments\n\nA financial derivative is an instrument whose value changes in response to changes in a variable or index, such as an interest rate, exchange rate, the price of a financial instrument, a credit rating or a credit index. This instrument requires no initial payment or is lower in comparison to other financial instruments with a similar response to changes in market conditions and is generally settled at a future date.\n\nThe Bank recognizes its derivative financial instruments at fair value, based on the prices and valuation methodologies provided by the official pricing service provider (Precia); this includes counterparty credit-risk adjustments applied to derivatives when the Bank's position is a derivative asset, and the Bank's credit risk when the position is a liability on a derivative. For further information, see Note 30. Fair value of assets and liabilities, section d. Credit valuation adjustment. Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value through profit or loss unless such derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. In those cases, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives, which are not in hedging relationships, are recognized in the consolidated statement of income under the \"valuation on financial instruments\" item, and gains and losses from the valuation of foreign exchange derivatives are included in the \"Other Operating Income\" item.\n\n## 4.7. Hedge accounting\n\nThe  Bank  designates  and  documents  hedge  accounting  at  inception  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  IFRS  9 Financial Instruments. When the hedging relationship is considered to be highly effective, the changes in value of the hedging derivative are accounted for according to their classification, as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of net investment in foreign operations, as set out in the paragraph below.\n\nThe Bank assesses at the inception of the hedge and on a monthly basis during the life of the instrument, whether the hedge used in the transaction is expected to be aligned with the hedge effectiveness requirement (prospective effectiveness):\n\n- \u00b7 Economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\n- \u00b7 The effect of credit risk does not predominate over the value of the economic relationship.\n- \u00b7 Designated hedge ratio is consistent with risk management strategy.",

Consequently, the item no longer complies with the hedge accounting conditions or the hedging relationship no longer complies with the risk management objective.\n\nBefore the establishment of hedge accounting, the Bank documents the relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments, as well as its risk management objectives and hedging strategies, which are approved by the Risk Management Committee as the body designated by the Board of Directors.\n\nHedge relationships are classified and accounted for in the following ways:\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair  value  hedges  are  designated  to  protect  against  the  exposure  to  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  recognized  assets  or liabilities or unrecognized firm commitments.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments in fair value hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as interest and valuation on financial instruments. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is included as part of the carrying value of the hedged item, and it is also recognized in the aforementioned item of the consolidated statement of income.\n\nFor fair value hedges that are related to items accounted for at amortized cost, the adjustments to the carrying value are amortized through the consolidated statement of income during the remaining term until their expiry. The amortization of the effective interest rate shall begin as long as there is an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.\n\nIf the hedged item is derecognized, the non-amortized fair value is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nFor the items hedged at amortized cost, the difference between the carrying value of the item hedged at the termination of the hedge and the nominal value are amortized using the effective rate method during the time beyond the original terms of the hedge.\n\nWhen an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flows hedges are used mainly to manage the exposure to variability related to the cash flow attributable to a specific risk  associated  with  an  asset  or  liability  recognized on  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position or  to  a  highly probable forecast transaction.\n\nThe portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in other comprehensive  income.  The  ineffective  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging  instrument  is  recognized  in  the consolidated statement of income.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, without replacement or rollover into another hedging instrument, or if the hedging designation no longer meets the criteria provided for the hedge effectiveness requirements after any subsequent rebalancing adjustment, any accumulated gain or loss previously recognized in OCI remains in OCI, until the planned operation or the firm commitment affects the result.",

The hedge accounting requires that the Bank accounts for the gain or loss derived from the foreign exchange differences related to the debt securities that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income, as is the currency translation adjustment of the Banistmo operation into the presentation currency as required by IAS 21 Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates as detailed in 1. Functional currency, transactions and balances in foreign currency.\n\n## 5. Investments in associates and joint arrangements\n\n## 5.1. Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not have control or joint control to make those policies decisions.\n\nA joint venture is an entity that the Bank controls jointly with other participants, where the parties maintain a contractual agreement that establishes joint control over the relevant activities of the entity (which only exists when decisions about those activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control) and the parties have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement.\n\nThe Bank's investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and their results, assets and liabilities are subsequently included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.\n\nWhen an investment in an associate or joint venture is held by, or is held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organization, or a mutual fund, unit trust or similar entities, and such investment is measured at fair value through profit or loss in that entity, the Bank may elect to measure investments in those associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. This election is applied on an investment-by-investment basis.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the excess of the acquisition cost of the associate or joint venture shares exceeding the Bank's share of the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognized as goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of the investment and it is not amortized. Any excess of the Bank's share of the net fair value of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the Bank's share of the associate or joint venture's profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets. Impairment losses are recognized in accordance with the policy for impairment of assets, cash-generating units and goodwill (see section 12. Impairment of assets, cash-generating units and goodwill, of this note).\n\nIf the Bank's share of losses of an associate or joint venture exceeds the Bank's interest in that associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Bank's net investment in the associate or joint venture), the Bank discontinues recognition its share of further losses. Additional, losses are recognized only to the extent that the Bank has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nWhen the equity method is applicable, adjustments are considered in order to adopt uniform accounting policies of the associate or joint venture with the Bank.

Gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Bank and its associate or joint venture are recognized in the Bank's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the unrelated investor's interest  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture.  The  equity  method  is  applied  from  the  acquisition  date  until  the  significant influence or joint control over the entity is lost. When the significant influence on the associate or the joint venture is lost, the  Bank  measures and recognizes any residual investment that remains at its fair value.  The difference  between  the associate or joint venture carrying value (taking into account the relevant items of other comprehensive income), the fair value of the retained residual investment and any proceeds from disposing of a partial interest in the associate or joint venture, is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. The currency translation adjustments recognized in equity are reclassified to net income at the moment of disposal.\n\nThe unrealized gain or loss of an associate or joint venture is presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, net of tax. Changes in the investment's participation that arise from changes in other comprehensive income of an associate or joint venture are recognized directly in the investor's statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe dividends received from the associate or joint venture reduce the investment carrying value.\n\nFor further information, please see Note 8. Investments in associates and joint ventures.\n\n## 5.2. Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\nThe Bank recognizes and measures assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses in relation to its interest in joint operations in accordance with the applicable IFRS for the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\n\nWhen the Bank acquires an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in IFRS 3, or when an existing business is contributed to the joint operation on its formation by one of the parties that participate in the joint operation, the Bank will apply all of the principles of IFRS 3. In this case, the Bank recognizes goodwill in the event that consideration transferred exceeds the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\n\nWhen the Bank transacts with a joint operation in which the Parent Company or its subsidiaries is a joint operator (such as a sale or contribution of assets), the Bank is considered to be conducting the transaction with the other parties to the joint operation, and gains and losses resulting from the transactions are recognized in the Bank's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of other parties' interests in the joint operation.\n\n## 6. Leases\n\n## 6.1. The Bank as lessee\n\nThe Bank assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at the inception of the contract and recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The Bank elected to apply the recognition exemptions for short-term leases (leases of 12 months or less and without a purchase option) and leases where the underlying asset is of low value. Lease payments related to these exemptions will be recognized as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nBoth the right-of-use asset and the lease liability are measured at the present value of the lease payments that have not been paid at that date. Lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. In addition, the rightof-use asset includes: 1) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, 2) lease payments or costs incurred by the lessee made before or after the commencement date, less lease incentives received, and 3) an estimate of the costs",

The Bank measures the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made, and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any new expectation or lease modifications. Each lease payment has been allocated between the liability and interest expenses. The accrued interest on the lease liability for each period over the lease term will be the amount that produces a constant periodic rate of interest (incremental borrowing rate) on the remaining balance of the liability.\n\n## 6.2. The Bank as lessor\n\nThe lease agreements entered into by the Bank are classified at the initial recognition as financial or operating leases.\n\nA lease is classified as a finance lease when substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset are transferred to the lessee and are recognized at a value equal to the net investment in the lease, corresponding to the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable and any unguaranteed residual value, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. Otherwise, it is classified as an operating lease, recognizing and measuring the assets under the principles of property and equipment or investment property, in which case income and depreciation of property and equipment are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the asset. Contingent lease payments are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are received.\n\nIf during the lease term, the lessor and the lessee decide to modify the initial conditions, and the agreed changes result in a different classification, then the modified agreement will be considered a new lease with new clauses that will lead to the classification of a financial or operating lease, as appropriate.\n\nThe Bank uses the following indicia of transfer of risk and rewards incidental to ownership to the asset; if one of them is met, lease is classified as a finance lease:\n\n- \u00b7 The agreement indicates that the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be equal to or less than 10% of the fair value of the asset, upon termination of the lease.\n- \u00b7 The term of the lease covers most of the economic life of the asset, even when the lease does not transfer the ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the end of the lease term, i.e., when the minimum lease term represents 75% or more of the economic life of the leased asset.\n- \u00b7 At the inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least 90% of the fair value of the leased asset.\n- \u00b7 The leased assets are of such a specialized nature that only the lessee has the possibility of using them without making significant modifications.\n\n## 7. Premises and equipment and depreciation\n\nPremises and equipment include tangible items that are held for use, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and are expected to be used for more than one period.\n\nItems of premises and equipment are expressed at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, in order to derecognize the depreciable amount of premises and equipment over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The depreciable amount is the cost of an asset less its residual value. The estimated useful lives for each asset group are:",

When there is a significant change, the depreciation and the charge to the consolidated statement of income are adjusted based on the new estimation.\n\nThe Bank assesses at the end of each year whether there is any indication of external or internal reduction in the asset's recoverable value. If there is any indication of impairment, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of the assets and then recognizes the impairment loss in the consolidated statement of income. For further information, see section 12. Impairment of non-financial assets, cash-generating units and goodwill in this note.\n\nMaintenance expenses of the premises and equipment are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred and are registered in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other administrative and general expenses'.\n\nGains and losses in sales of premises and equipment are registered in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating income'.\n\n## 8. Investment properties\n\nThe investment properties are measured initially at cost, including the transaction costs. The carrying value includes the cost of replacement or substitution of a part of an investment property at the time the cost is incurred, if the cost meets the recognition criteria; and it excludes the daily maintenance costs of the investment property which are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other administrative and general expenses'.\n\nAfter the initial recognition, the investment properties are measured at fair value which reflects the market conditions at the consolidated statement of financial position date and are valued by Management with the support of external experts using valuation techniques based on comparable prices, direct capitalization, discounted cash flows and replacement cost. The gains and losses that arise from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating income'.\n\nTransfers of an asset to or from the investment properties are only made when there is a change in its use. For a transfer from an investment property to premises and equipment, the cost taken into account for its subsequent accounting is the fair value at the time of the change in use. If a premise and equipment becomes an investment property, it will be accounted for at its fair value.\n\n## 9. Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  are  identifiable,  non-monetary  assets  without  physical  appearance,  separately  acquired  or  internally generated by the Bank that are measured initially at cost and subsequently at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment loss. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition.\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives (ranging from 1 to 10 years) are amortized using the straight-line method over their  estimated  useful  lives  and  assessed  at  the  end  of  the  period  for  impairment.  The  amortization  period  and  the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at least annually. The expected changes in the  useful  life  or  in  the  pattern  of  consumption  of  the future  economic  benefits  of  the asset  are  recognized  when  the amortization period or method has changed, as appropriate, and they are treated as changes in the accounting estimates. The amortization expense of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.",

Goodwill  and  intangible  assets,  net).  Intangibles  of indefinite useful life include Goodwill.\n\nWhen intangible assets with finite useful life are written-off, the expected future economic benefits period is reduced to increase the amount of amortization, resulting in the derecognition of the intangible asset in a shorter period than initially estimated.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization but are periodically tested to identify any impairment, either individually  or  at  the  cash-generating  unit  level.  The  assessment  of  the  indefinite  life  is  reviewed annually to determine if it continues being supportable. In the event that the assessment was not valid, the change from indefinite  useful  life  to  finite  useful  life  is  recognized  prospectively.  Intangible  assets  with  an  indefinite  useful  life correspond to goodwill.\n\n## 9.1. Internally generated intangible assets\n\nThe costs of internally generated intangible assets are recognized as intangible assets if they have been  incurred in the development stage and meet the recognition criteria; if so, such assets are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses (see section 12. Impairment of non-financial assets, cash-generating units and goodwill in this note). Other expenditures are recorded as expenses in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nAmortization of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. Intangible assets are amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  and  assessed  at  the  end  of  the  period  for impairment.\n\n## 10. Inventories\n\nInventories of assets or returned property are those assets arising from an early termination of a finance or operating lease or those on which the lease has been terminated, and they are expected to be sold in the normal course of business, which are controlled by the Bank and are expected to obtain future economic benefit.\n\nThe inventory of returned property is recognized as an asset from the date on which the Bank assumes the risks and benefits thereof. Assets arising from operating leases are initially measured at cost, which is the carrying amount less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Assets returned property financial leasing operations are recognized at the lower of their book value plus sanitation costs and its net realizable value. When the book value is greater than the net realizable value, an adjustment is recognized under the caption \"Provision for impairment of loan portfolio and financial leasing operations, net\" in the consolidated income statement.\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value (\"NRV\") is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. The cost of inventories is assigned by using specific identification of their individual costs.\n\nThe Bank revises the NRV of its inventories at least annually, or when market conditions so require; the adjustment of the decrease  in  value  is  recognized  directly  in  income.  Adjustments  to  the  NRV  are  recognized  under  the  caption \"Amortization, depreciation and impairment\" in the consolidated statement of income, up to the value initially recognized.\n\n## 10.1 .   Digital assets\n\nThe Bank chooses as an accounting policy to recognize digital assets held to be sold in the normal course of its operations as inventories. Digital assets are measured at fair value less costs of sale. If there is no active market, the fair value of the digital asset will be zero given the low probability of its realization.\n\nChanges in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the period in which such changes occur.",

The Bank safeguards these assets and/or keys and is required to protect them from loss, theft, or other misuse.\n\nThe  Bank  recognizes  customer's  digital  assets  initially  and  subsequently  at  fair  value.  At  the  same  time,  the  Bank recognizes the obligation to safeguard the customer's digital asset as a liability. The liability should be measured at the same amount as the corresponding asset at fair value.\n\nAny loss, theft or other misuse that impacts the measurement of customer cryptoassets is recognized in profit or loss in the period in which it occurs.\n\n## 12. Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nThe Bank classifies non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use. These assets are measured at the lower of their carrying value and their  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  they  are  not  depreciated  nor  amortized  from  the  date  of  their  classification. Additionally, if any indications of impairment exist, impairment losses are recognized for the difference between the carrying and the fair value less costs to sell as 'Impairment, depreciation and amortization' in the consolidated statement of income.

In the Bank, the assets held under this classification correspond to foreclosed assets. If the sale of the asset does not take place within the planned period, the assets are reclassified to \"Other assets, net\" in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and represents  a  separate  major  line  of  business  or  a  geographical  area  of  operations,  is  part  of  a  single  coordinated  and individual plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of a discontinued operation are presented separately from those of continuing operations in the consolidated statement of income on a comparative basis.\n\n## 13. Impairment of non-financial assets and cash-generating units and goodwill\n\nThe Bank evaluates at the end of each period whether there is any indication that on a stand-alone basis non-financial assets  and  cash-generating  units  are  impaired.  If  some  indication  of  impairment  does  exist,  the  Bank  estimates  the recoverable amount of the assets and the loss by impairment, the impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the  carrying  amount  of  the  cash  generating  unit  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount.  Regardless  of  whether  impairment indicators exist, impairment of goodwill is assessed annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.\n\nThe recoverable amount of non-financial assets or cash-generating units is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, where fair value is determined by Management by reference to market value, if available, by pricing models, or with the assistance of a valuation specialist. While value in use requires Management to make  significant assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flow for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; and assess the appropriate discount rate and growth rate.",

Except  for  impairment  loss  recognized  for  goodwill, impairment losses are subject to reversal, the increased carrying amount of an asset other than goodwill attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\n\n## 14. Other assets\n\nThe Bank presents as other assets, among other things, (a) the expenses paid in advance incurred in the development of its business, in order to receive future services, which are amortized during the period in which services are received or the costs or expenses are recorded and (b) foreclosed assets that do not comply with the requirements to be recognized as assets held for sale and where there are no plans to use them in the supply of services or for administrative purposes.\n\nForeclosed assets are  initially  recognized  at  the  lower  of  net  amount  of  the  charged-off  financial  assets  to  which  the foreclosed assets relate and net realizable value of the foreclosed asset (the net realizable value will be the estimated selling price of the asset or its awarding value, less the estimated costs necessary to carry out its sale), pending obtaining a plan for  its  commercialization.  If  net  amount  of  the  charged-off  financial  assets  is  greater  than  net  realizable  value  of  the foreclosed asset, an adjustment for impairment of credit risk of the financial asset is recorded in the results for the period.\n\nThere is evidence of impairment when these group of assets remain in the consolidated statement of financial position for a period of time exceeding one year from the reception date, without buyer having been found, despite the Bank's ongoing efforts to sell them (even adjusting the selling price).\n\nForeclosed assets are subsequently assessed to determine whether an impairment lost must be recognized. In the case of events that arise that are beyond the control of the Bank and that make remote the realization of these assets, they are identified as \"non-tradable', and a complete impairment is carried out.\n\n## 15. Derecognition of non-financial assets\n\nThe Bank's non-financial assets are derecognized either on disposal or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected. The difference between the value obtained on disposal and the carrying amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## 16. Employee benefits\n\n## 16.1. Short term benefits\n\nThe Bank grants to its employees short-term benefits such as bonuses based on added value to clients and the Bank's results, salaries, accrued performance costs and social security that are expected to be wholly settled within 12 months. Expenses related to these benefits are recognized over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate. For further information, see Note 19. Employee benefit plans.\n\n## 16.2. Other long-term employee benefits\n\nThe Bank grants to its employees seniority bonuses as long-term employee benefits whose payment is not expected within the 12 months following the end of the annual period in which the employees have rendered their services. The cost of long-term employee benefits is allocated across the period from the time the employee was hired by the Bank and the expected date of obtaining the benefit. These benefits are projected up to the date of payment and are discounted through the projected unit credit method.",

Pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\n## -Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Bank makes monthly contributions to pension funds, due to legal requirements and it has no legal obligation to pay further contributions.\n\nThe  Bank  recognizes  contributions  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  once  the  contribution  is  accrued.  Any contributions unpaid at the consolidated statement of financial position date are included as a liability.\n\n## -Defined benefit plans\n\nThese are post-employment benefit plans in which the Bank has the legal or constructive obligation to take responsibility for the payments of benefits that have been agreed, for example, severance obligation, retirement pension premium plan and senior management pension plan premium and pension plan. The Bank makes an actuarial valuation based on the projected unit credit method and a risk-free rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money in each  country  (interest  rate  of  treasury  bonds  ['TES'],  representative  of  the  nation's  public  debt),  related  to  the characteristics and the benefit flows weighted average, to discount such obligation.\n\n## 17. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the obligation's value can be made.\n\nThe corresponding expense for any provision is presented in the consolidated statement of income, net of all expected reimbursement. The increase in the provision due to the time value of money is recognized as a financial expense.\n\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position, correspond mainly to:\n\n## I. Judicial proceedings\n\nJudicial provisions refer to pending legal proceedings on employment matters, ordinary lawsuits, class actions suit, civil actions within criminal prosecutions and executive proceedings against the Bank.\n\n## II. Onerous contracts\n\nFor the Bank, an onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceeds the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\n\n## III. Loan commitments\n\nIn order to meet the needs of its customers, the Bank issues loan commitments, letters of credit and bank guarantees. Loan commitments are those approved irrevocable loans, in which, despite having acquired a commitment to grant them, due to the contract or agreement or for any other reason they are still pending disbursement.\n\n## IV. Financial guarantees\n\nThe Bank issues bank guarantees on behalf of its customers. A bank guarantee represents an  irrevocable commitment pursuant  to  which  the  Bank  will  cover,  up  to  the  maximum  amount  guaranteed,  a  breach  of  the  client's  contractual obligations  to  third  parties  for  a  certain  period  of  time.

Revenue recognition\n\nThe Bank recognizes revenue from ordinary activities, which represent the transfer of goods or services committed with customers  in  exchange  for  an  amount  that  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  entity  expects  to  be  entitled.  For performance obligations where none of the conditions for revenue recognition over time are met, the Bank satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time, at which the customer obtains control of the promised services.\n\nRevenue  is  measured  based  on  the  consideration  specified  in  the  contract  with  the  customer,  and  excludes  amounts received on behalf of third parties when the Bank is an agent. The Bank recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer. Revenue is presented net of reimbursements and discounts and after eliminating intergroup sales. The Bank evaluates its revenue categories based on specific criteria to determine whether it acts as principal or agent. Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Bank and it is possible to reliably measure the related revenues and costs.\n\nWhen the Bank fulfills a performance obligation through the delivery of promised goods or services to customer, it creates a contractual asset for the consideration amount obtained with the performance. The Bank recognizes the contractual assets as current assets, as they are expected to be realized within the normal operating cycle.\n\nThe  costs  of  contracts  eligible  for  capitalization  as  incremental  costs  when  obtaining  a  contract  are  recognized  as  a contractual asset. Contractual costs are capitalized when incurred if the Bank expects to recover those costs. Contractual costs constitute non-current assets to the extent that the Bank expects to receive the economic benefits of those assets in a period greater than twelve months. The contractual costs are amortized systematically and consistently with the transfer of the services to the customer once the corresponding revenue has been recognized. The capitalized contractual costs are impaired if the customer withdraws or if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projection of the discounted cash flows that are related to the contract.\n\nInterest  income  comprises  income  of  financial  assets  at  amortized  cost  or  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method, the computation takes into account all the contractual conditions of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes incremental fees and commissions (for example, certain loan commitment fees) or expenses that are directly attributed to the instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate, without taking account future credit losses.\n\nValuation income relates to debt securities at fair value, where gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Interest and valuation on financial instruments'.\n\nFees and services commissions are recognized as the right to consideration is obtained through the exchange of goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer. Therefore, the Bank recognizes some fees as revenue over time, such as income from commissions and asset management, custody and other administration and advisory commissions. While other fees are recognized as revenue at a point in time of completion of the underlying transaction, like commissions arising from the negotiation or participation in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party, such as the acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses. In addition, the Bank maintains a credit card loyalty program to  provide  incentives  to  its  customers.  The  program  allows  customers  to  purchase  goods  and  services,  based  on  the exchange of awards points, which are awarded based on purchases using the Bank's credit cards and the fulfillment of certain  conditions  established  in  such  program.  The  redemption  of  points  for  prizes  is  carried  out  by  a  third  party. Therefore, the expenses of the Bank's commitments with its clients arising from this program are recognized as a lower value  of  the  fees  and  commission  income,  considering  the  total  number  of  points  that  can  be  redeemed  over  the accumulated prizes and the probability of redemptions.\n\nDividend revenue of investments that are not associates or joint ventures are recognized when the right to payment of the Bank is established, which is generally when the shareholders declare the dividend. These are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Dividends and net income on equity investments'.",

The current tax is the income tax payable with respect to the profit for the fiscal year, which arises in profit or other comprehensive income. A provision is made for current tax considering the tax bases and tax rates enacted in each of the jurisdictions where the Bank is located, at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Bank recognizes, when appropriate, deferred tax assets and liabilities by estimating the future tax effects attributable to differences between book values of assets, liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rate that, in accordance with the valid tax laws in each country where the Bank has operations, must be applied in the year in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The future effects of changes in tax laws or tax rates are recognized in the deferred taxes as from the date of publication of the law providing for such changes.\n\nTax bases for deferred tax must be calculated by factoring in the definition of IAS 12 Income tax and the  value of the assets and liabilities that will be realized or settled in the future according to the valid tax laws of each of the countries where the Bank has operations.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities due to deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiary and associated entities  or  shares  in  joint  ventures,  are  recognized,  except  when  the  Bank  is  able  to  control  the  period  in  which  the deductible  temporary  difference  is  reverted,  and  it  is  likely  that  the  temporary  difference  will  not  be  reverted  in  the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets, identified with temporary differences, are only recognized if it is considered likely that the Bank will have sufficient taxable income in the future that allows it to be recovered based on the stand-alone entity expected cash flow forecast for the next three years.\n\nTax credit from fiscal losses and surplus amounts from the presumptive income on the net income are recognized as a deferred asset, provided that it is likely that the Bank will generate future net income to allow their offset.\n\nThe deferred tax is recorded as debit or credit according to the result of each of the companies that form the Bank, and for the purpose of disclosure on the consolidated statement of financial position it is disclosed as net.\n\nThe deferred income tax expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of income under the heading 'Income tax', except when referring to amounts directly recognized in OCI (Other Comprehensive Income).\n\nRegulatory changes in tax laws and in tax rates are recognized in the consolidated statement of income under the heading 'Income Tax' in the period when such rule becomes enforceable. Interest and fines are recognized in the consolidated statement of income under the other administrative and general expenses or in the caption \"Income tax\" of the consolidated income statement, when applicable.\n\nThe Bank periodically assesses the tax positions adopted in tax returns, and, according to the results of the tax audits conducted by the tax authorities, determines possible tax outcomes provided it has a present obligation and it is more likely than not that the Bank will have to dispose of the economic resources to cancel the obligation, and the Bank can make an accurate estimate of the amount of the obligation.\n\nFor further information about deferred tax considerations derived from the last Colombian tax reform (Law 2277 of 2022), see Note 12. Income tax.\n\n## Transfer pricing policy\n\nThe  Bank  has  as  a  general  policy  that  each  of  its  companies  be  responsible  for  their  income,  costs  and  expenses independently.

These operations are documented and reported to the tax Administration according to the last evaluation date corresponding to the previous year.\n\n## E. Use of estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  requires  Bank's  Management  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\n\nThe  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis. Revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgments or changes in assumptions are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if assumptions and conditions change.\n\nThe significant accounting estimates that the Bank uses in preparing its consolidated financial statements are detailed below:\n\n## 1. Credit risk impairment\n\nAs disclosed by Management and described in section D. Material Accounting Policies, paragraph 4.1.2. Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 'FVTOCI', expected credit losses are calculated using individual and collective models and methodologies based on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current borrower situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the prospective approach that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios. In addition, for loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, the fair value of guarantees granted, information on credit behavior and the future cash flows expected from the client.\n\nThe estimation of impairment charges is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of this line item, the sensitivity  of  the  charges  to  changes  in  assumptions  about  future  events  (behavior  of  the  expected  macroeconomic variables), weighting of macroeconomic scenarios and other somewhat subjective judgments that are incorporated in the individual credit loss models.\n\nSome relevant assumptions must be made to operate the mathematical models behind the expected credit loss assessment. Assumptions are constructed from historical data to consider whether a customer has a significant increase in risk or is in default; these are reviewed by expert panels. Other assumptions such as future economic conditions, the simulation of reasonable  future  economic  scenarios  and  the  likelihood  of  those  scenarios  have  a  high  impact  on  lifetime  default probability models. These scenarios are determined and leveraged by the Direction of Economic Research.\n\nThe main factors considered in collective estimations of credit losses are the definition of significant increase in credit risk, definition of default, collateral values, loan maturity and macroeconomic forecast of variables such as unemployment, GDP, interest  rates,  among  others.  It  is  also  important  to  consider  any  other  variable  that  could  influence  a  client's willingness to pay.",

        "page_content": "In addition, individual credit loss models consider assumptions on how the financial performance and future cash flow of a  client  could  be  affected,  the  client's  expected  future  operational  and  commercial  activity,  the  capacity  to  generate sufficient  cash  to  pay  debt  obligations  and  trends  and  regulatory  changes  in  the  economic  sector  in  which  the  client operates, changes in the collateral value, weighting of the scenarios used, as well as other internal or external factors. For further information, see Note 6. Loans and advances to customers, net and Risk management.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the assessment of three following factors, it is  possible  that  the  outcomes  in  the  next  financial  year  could  differ  from  the  expectations  on  which  Management's estimates are based:\n\n- \u00b7 Exposure  at  default: The  exposed  balance  of  assets  to  the  current  capital  balance,  interest,  and  receivable accounts.  In  the  case  of  products  whose  nature  is  revolving  and  that  have  an  available  borrowing  that  is susceptible to be used in its entirety according to loan contracts subscribed with clients, this parameter includes an estimation of the use of those products after the client's default.\n- \u00b7 Probability of default ('PD'): This is the probability that the debtor fails to fulfill their obligations of capital and/or interest payment over a period of 12 months. This is linked to the rating/scoring of each debtor/operation.\n- \u00b7 Loss given default ('LGD'): This is defined as the economic impairment that the entity would incur in the event of any instance of default. This depends mainly upon the characteristics of the debtor and upon the valuation of guarantees or collateral associated with the operation.\n\nImpairment loss models and methodologies, and the related assumptions, are assessed by the Bank's Chief Risk Officer ('CRO') on a regular basis, using robust validation procedures in order to assure a reasonable coverage of effective losses. This process enables Management to periodically determine whether assumptions and models used to measure credit risk impairment should be adjusted to achieve more precise estimations. Internal controls, data governance standards and approval processes, have been implemented by the Bank to make estimations more accurate. As of December 31, 2023, there has been an improvement in the methodology used to calculate impairment, as shown below:\n\n- \u00b7 LGD: A methodological change has been made to the selection of the defaulting client's recovery, which more closely reflects the client's payment behavior.\n- \u00b7 New rating models have been developed to improve the risk classification of customers in the individual (in Colombia and Panama) and corporate (in Colombia) portfolios.\n- \u00b7 Enhancements have been made to the threshold model to identify a significant increase in risk from the point of origin, which allows for greater accuracy in classifying customers into stage 2 with a high probability of default.\n- \u00b7 The probability  of  default  ('PD')  models  currently  incorporate  data  through  February  2020  (pre-pandemic). When performing analyses to incorporate new information, difficulties are encountered in modeling and obtaining good precision and discrimination metrics due to the irregular behavior of the variables included in the estimates. These variables include macroeconomic factors such as the country's low economic growth, high interest rates, and high unemployment, in addition to the behavior of default rates. These rates represent recoveries that are not real but have been given by the provision of financial relief and then a high level of default as a result of the economic situation that has had a negative impact on the credit portfolio. Therefore, the Bank's Management has decided not  to  incorporate  recent  data  into  the  PD  models.  However,  an  overlay  has  been  created  for  those portfolios that have recent payment delinquencies above the historical average.\n\nThe net effect of the above is the constitution of provisions of COP 11,071 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## 2. Impairment testing of cash generating units ('CGU'), including goodwill\n\nThe Bank tests goodwill recognized upon business combinations for impairment at least annually. The impairment test for goodwill  involves  estimates  and  significant  judgments,  including  the  identification  of  cash  generating  units  and  the allocation of goodwill based on the expectations of which operating segments of the Bank will benefit from the acquisition. The fair value of the acquired companies is sensitive to changes in the valuation models' assumptions. Adverse changes in  any  of  the  factors  underlying  these  assumptions  could  lead  the  Bank  to  record  a  goodwill  impairment  charge. Management believes that  the  assumptions  and  estimates  used  are  reasonable  and  supportable  in  the  existing  market environment and commensurate with the risk profile of the assets valued.

Recognition of digital assets\n\nCurrently,  there  is  no  specific  definitive  guidance  in  IFRS  or  alternative  accounting  frameworks  to  account  for  the recognition of digital assets held by the Bank, as well as the custody of digital assets held for customers, so management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment.\n\nThe Bank has considered that it acts in the quality of a commodity trader, as defined in IAS 2, Inventories, by characterizing certain of its holdings as inventories, or more specifically, digital assets. The business model for digital assets will be to sell  them in the near future and generate a profit from fluctuations in price or dealer margin. So, inventories held by commodity broker-dealers are measured at fair value less costs to sale. When such inventories are measured on that basis, changes in value are recognized in profit or loss in the period.\n\nWith respect  to  the  custody  of  digital  assets  held  by  customers,  the  Bank  recognizes  a  liability  for  the  obligation  to safeguard user's assets and recognizes an associated asset for the cryptographic assets safeguarded. Both the liability and the asset must be measured initially and subsequently at the fair value of the crypto assets being safeguarded.\n\nIn the event that the IASB issues final guidance, the Bank may be required to modify its accounting policies, which could have a significant effect on the Bank's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 4. Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on deductible or levied temporary differences originating between tax and accounting bases, taking into account the tax rules applicable in each country where the Bank has operations. Due to the changing conditions of the political, social and economic environment, the constant amendments to tax legislation and the permanent changes in the tax principles and changes in interpretations by tax authorities determining the tax bases for the deferred tax items involves difficult judgments including estimates of future gains, offsets or tax deductions. Accordingly, the determination of the deferred tax is considered a critical accounting policy.\n\nFor more information relating to the nature of deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized by the Bank, please see Note 12. Income tax.\n\n## 5. Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Bank is subject to contingent liabilities, including those arising from judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings, tax and other claims arising from the conduct of the Bank's business activities. These contingencies are evaluated based on Management's best estimates and provisions are established for legal and other claims by assessing the likelihood of the  loss  actually  occurring  as  probable,  possible  or  remote.  Contingences  are  provisioned  and  recorded  when  all  the information  available  indicates  that  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be required  to  settle  the  obligation  before  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  date  and  the  amounts  may  be reasonably estimated. The Bank engages internal and external experts in assessing probability and in estimating timing, nature and amount of outflows that may result from past events.\n\nProvisions are determined by Management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  which  estimate  is  discounted  using  a  risk-free  rate  which  reflects  current  market assessments of the time value of money in each country, which for Colombia is the interest rate on treasury bonds 'TES'.\n\nThroughout the life of a contingency, the Bank may learn of additional information that can affect assessments regarding probability or the estimates of amounts involved; changes in these assessments can lead to changes in recorded provisions.\n\nThe Bank considers the estimates used to determine the provisions for contingent liabilities critical estimates because the probability of their occurrence and the amounts that the Bank may be required to pay are based on the Bank's judgment",

For further information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and their carrying amounts, see Note 21. Provisions and contingent liabilities.\n\n## 6. Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\nThe fair value of the Bank's assets and liabilities is determined at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position. The Bank's fair value measurement process considers the characteristics of the asset or liability in the same way that market participants would take them into account when pricing the asset or liability  at the measurement date; the estimate takes into account inputs from valuation techniques used to measure fair value.\n\nTo increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the Bank specifies different levels of inputs that may be used to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if there are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions.\n\nLevel 2: Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2 if in the absence of a market price for a specific financial instrument, its fair value is estimated using models whose input data are observable for recent transactions of identical or similar instruments.\n\nLevel 3: Assets and liabilities are classified as level 3 if unobservable input data were used in the measurement of fair value that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of these assets or liabilities. The fair value of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.\n\nTransfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. All transfers between the aforementioned levels are assumed to occur at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe measurement of the fair value of financial instruments generally involves a higher degree of complexity and requires the application of judgments especially when the models use unobservable inputs (level 3) based on the assumptions that would be used in the market to determine the price for assets or liabilities. Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.\n\nWhen developing fair value measurements, the Bank maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Additionally, the Bank uses third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internally developed prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. For further details regarding carrying amount and sensitivity disclosures, please see Note 30. Fair value of assets and liabilities.\n\n## 7. Measurement of employee benefits\n\nThe measurement of post-employment benefit obligations and long-term employee benefits takes into account a range of inputs and it is dependent upon a series of assumptions of future events. The projected unit credit method is used to determine the present value of the obligation for the defined benefits and its associated cost. Future measurements of obligations  may  differ  to  those  presented  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  among  others,  due  to  changes  in economic  and  demographic  assumptions  and  significant  events.  The  actuarial  valuation  methodology  of  the  postemployment  and  long-term  benefit  plans  include  typified  discount  rates  by  each  benefit  plan,  with  the  objective  of",

Employee benefit plans.\n\n## 8. Transaction price determination\n\nWith respect to contracts with the Bank's customers, for the determination of the transaction price, the Bank allocates to each one of the performance obligations under the contract the price which represents the value expected to be received in respect of each such performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. Such price is determined based on the cost of each service, related tax and associated risks to the operation and inherent to the transaction, plus the margin expected to be received for the services, considering in each case the market price for the service, the conditions agreed with the customer and the customer's segment. The Bank has fixed and variable prices considering the characteristics of each service, future events, discounts, returns and other variables that may influence the selling price. No significant financing components are factored in the determination of the selling price. For further information, see Note 25. Operating income.\n\n## 9. Leases\n\nThe measurement of the right-of-use asset and of the lease liabilities requires a series of judgments, among which are the determination of the term of the lease and the rate used in discounting the cash flows. The term of the lease is defined according to the historical information of the contracts and the period over which an asset is expected to be economically usable, which involves a high degree of uncertainty due to the use of relevant information about past events. In the Bank's case, the weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate was used to discount the cash flows associated with the leasing contracts. The Bank performs analysis taking into account the currency, lease term, economic environment and class  of  underlying  assets,  as  to  determine  the  weighted  average  lessee's  incremental  borrowing  rate.  For  further information, see Note 7. Leases.\n\n## 10. Uncertainty over income tax treatments\n\nIn the process of determining the current and deferred tax for periods subject to review by the tax authority, the applicable rules have been applied and interpretations have been made to take positions, on which different interpretations could arise from those made by the entity. Due to the complexity of the tax system, the continuous modifications of the fiscal rules, the accounting changes with implications in the tax bases and in general the legal instability of the country, at any time the tax authority could have different criteria from the Bank. Therefore, a dispute or inspection by the tax authority on a specific tax treatment may affect the deferred or current tax asset or liability bank's accounting, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12.\n\nManagement and its advisors believe that their decisions concerning the estimates and judgments made in each fiscal period are in accordance with those required by the current tax regulations, and therefore have not considered it necessary to recognize any additional provisions to those indicated in Note 12. Income tax.\n\n## F. Recently issued accounting pronouncements\n\n## a) Accounting pronouncements applicable in 2023\n\nAmendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Definition of Accounting Estimates: In  February  2021,  the  Board  issued  Definition  of  Accounting  Estimates,  which  amended  IAS  8.  The amendments introduced the definition of accounting estimates in paragraph 5 and included other amendments to IAS 8 to help entities distinguish changes in accounting estimates from changes in accounting policies.\n\nThe amendment to IAS 8 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and early application is permitted.",

Disclosure  of  Accounting  Policies: In  February  2021  the  Board  amended  IAS  1  and  IFRS  Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, to replace the term \"significant\" with \"material\", to require an entity to disclose its material accounting policy information rather than its significant accounting policies. Therefore, accounting policy information may be considered material when that information is considered together with other information in a complete set of financial statements. In the Board's view, accounting policy information is expected to be material if its disclosure was needed for primary users to understand information provided about material transactions, other events or conditions in the financial statements. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and early application is permitted.\n\nThe Bank applied this amendment for the annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures beginning on or after January 1, 2023. For further information, see section D. Material Accounting Policies in this note.\n\nAmendments  to  IAS  12  Income  Taxes.  Deferred  Tax  related  to  Assets  and  Liabilities  arising  from  a  Single Transaction: In  May  2021,  the  Board  issued  Deferred  Tax  related  to  Assets  and  Liabilities  arising  from  a  Single Transaction.  The  amendments  narrowed  the  scope  of  the  recognition  exemption  in  paragraphs  15  and  24  of  IAS  12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nThis amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and early application is permitted.\n\nThis  amendment  was  assessed  by  Management  without  evidencing  an  impact  on  the  Bank's  consolidated  financial statements and disclosures because no exemptions are currently applied for the recognition of deferred taxes arising from a single transaction.\n\nAmendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes - International Tax Reform-Pillar Two Model Rules: In May 2023, the IASB amended IAS 12 Income Taxes to give companies temporary relief from accounting for deferred taxes arising from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's ('OECD') international tax reform.\n\nThe OECD published the Pillar Two model rules in December 2021 to ensure that large multinational companies would be subject to a minimum 15.00% tax rate. More than 135 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90.00% of global GDP have agreed to the Pillar Two model rules.\n\n## The amendments introduce:\n\n- -A temporary exception-to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from jurisdictions implementing the global tax rules. This will help to ensure consistency in the financial statements while easing into the implementation of the rules; and\n- -Targeted disclosure requirements-to help investors better understand a company's exposure to income taxes arising from the reform, particularly before legislation implementing the rules is in effect.\n\nCompanies can benefit from the temporary exception immediately but are required to provide the disclosures for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nThis amendment has been assessed by Management with no evidence of an impact on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures, due the OECD's Pillar Two model rules has not yet been implemented in Colombia and in the countries in which the Bank has a presence.\n\nNew Standard IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 : IFRS 17, issued in May 2017 to replace IFRS 4 Insurance  Contracts, applies  to  insurance  contracts,  including  reinsurance  contracts,  issued  by  an  entity  with",

The amendments also deferred the application date of IFRS 17 to 1 January 2023.\n\nFurther  amendments  made  in  December  2021  added  a  transition  option  that  permits  an  entity  to  apply  an  optional classification overlay in the comparative period(s) presented on initial application of IFRS 17. The classification overlay applies to all financial assets, including those held in respect of activities not connected to contracts within the scope of IFRS 17. It allows those assets to be classified in the comparative period(s) in a way that aligns with how the entity expects those  assets  to  be  classified  on  initial  application  of  IFRS  9.  The  classification  can  be  applied  on  an  instrument-byinstrument basis.\n\nThis standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and early application is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 9 Financial Instruments before the date of initial application of IFRS 17.\n\nThe Bank applied this amendment for the annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures beginning on or after January 1, 2023. For further information, see Note 32. Impacts on application of new standards.\n\n## b) Recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable in future periods\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 to clarify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. More specifically:\n\n- - The amendments specify that the conditions which exist at the end of the reporting period of an obligation are those which will be used to determine if a right to defer settlement of a liability exists.\n- - Management expectations about events after the balance sheet date, for example on whether a covenant will be breached, or whether early settlement will take place, are not relevant.\n- - The amendments clarify the situations that are considered settlement of a liability.\n\nAdditionally, on October 30, 2022, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 1 to improve the disclosures an entity provides when its right to defer settlement of a liability for at least twelve months is subject to compliance with covenants, and how this impacts the classification of that liability as current or non-current.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 1 are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The amendments must be applied retrospectively, in accordance with IAS 8. Early application is permitted.\n\nManagement concluded that this amendment has no impact on the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, because the Bank presents the consolidated statement of financial position ordered by liquidity, according to the business nature.\n\nAmendments to IFRS 16 Leases- Lease liability in a sale and leaseback : In September 2022, the Board amended IFRS 16 to add subsequent measurement requirements for sale and leaseback transactions that meet the requirements of IFRS 15 to be accounted as a sale. The amendments require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a subsequent lease such that it does not recognize any amount of gain or loss that relates to the right-of-use that it retains.\n\nThis amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and early application is permitted.\n\nThis amendment has been assessed by Management with no evidence of an impact on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures, due the new requirements are in line with what the Bank has applied and disclosed.",

However, the fair value of the financial asset or liability at the time of initial recognition may be different from the transaction price, because the fair value includes variables in its valuation technique that include market information, such as interest rate yield curves, currencies rates, indicators, default factors among others. When the  values  are  not  equal,  the  asset  or  liability  must  be  measured  at  fair  value  and  the  difference  between  the transaction price and the fair value must be recognized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 If fair value is evidenced by Level 1 inputs or is based on a valuation technique that uses only observable market data,  the  Group  must  recognize  the  difference  as  a  gain  or  loss  on  initial  recognition  directly  in  the  income statement.\n- \u00b7 In all other circumstances, the entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and is recognized in the income statement over the life of the transaction.\n\nThe table below presents the unrecognised gains or (losses) for derivatives trading at the initial moment, due to use of valuation techniques for which not all inputs were observable market data:\n\nAs of December 31, 2023\n\n|                              | Forward            | Swaps    Options    | Total                                       |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| In millions of COP           | In millions of COP | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP                          |\n| Balance at January 1, 2023   | 61,724    16,580   | 39,714              | 118,018                                     |\n| New trades                   |                    |                     | 1,159,069   (26,905)   195,456    1,327,620 |\n| Amortization                 | (1,176,173)        |                     | 4,166   (148,299)   (1,320,306)             |\n| Sale or transfer             | (8,331)            | (7,471)    (23,803) | (39,605)                                    |\n| Balance at December 31, 2023 | 36,289   (13,630)  | 63,068              | 85,727                                      |",

Hedged effectiveness is measured on a before income tax.\n\nGains  or  losses  on  the  conversion  of  Banistmo's  financial  statements  are  recognized  in  Consolidated  Statements  of Comprehensive Income. Consequently, the exchange difference related to the conversion of debt securities issued and financing with Correspondent banks is recognized directly in OCI, as a result of the revaluation of the peso against the dollar, the adjustment recognized in Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income amounted to COP 1,948,833, COP (1,833,087) and COP (1,207,052), for the years ended at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nFor further information see note 17. Borrowings from other financial institusions, note 18. Debt instruments in issue and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Offsetting of derivatives\n\nThe  Bank  enters  into  International  Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association  (ISDA)  master  netting  agreements  or  similar agreements with substantially all of the Bank's derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, and depending on the Bank's intention, these master netting agreements give the Bank, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to  liquidate  securities  and  cash  equivalents  held  as  collateral  and  to  offset  receivables  and  payables  with  the  same counterparty.",

The decrease in the portfolio at this stage is mainly due to the restatement of the dollar loans into colombian pesos due to a lower in the market representative rate and a slow disbursement dynamic of the consumer portfolio compared to the previous period. The increase in the loss allowance is due to the impact of a less favorable economic outlook, where there is lower economic growth and a high trend of interest rates throughout the year.\n\n## Stage 2 (Lifetime expected credit losses)\n\nThe exposure in Stage 2 decreased by COP 2,613,778 and the loss allowance decreased by COP 608,427. The decrease in exposure is due to the migration of loans with delinquency over 90 days to Stage 3, and the level of new overdue portfolio being lower than the previous period. The decrease of loss allowance is in accordance with the decrease in exposure.\n\n## Stage 3 (Lifetime expected credit losses)\n\nThe exposure in Stage 3 increased by COP 1,038,853, and the loss allowance increased by COP 531,779. The variation in exposure and loss allowance in this Stage is mainly due to clients of the consumer portfolio reaching a delinquency height over 90 days and the impairment of significant clients from the construction sector.\n\nThe following explains the significant changes in the loans and the allowance for loan losses by category during the periods ended on December 31, 2023 and 2022 as a result of applying the expected credit loss model according to IFRS 9:\n\n## As of December 31, 2023\n\n## Commercial\n\n|                                                    | Stage1                                                        | Stage1              | Stage2              | Stage2             | Stage3               | Stage3                                                   | Total                                                           | Total                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                    | Gross  carrying                                               |                     | Gross               |                    | Gross                | Allowance   carrying   Allowance   carrying    Allowance | Gross  carrying                                                 | Allowance               |\n| In millions of COP                                 | In millions of COP                                            | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP                                       | In millions of COP                                              | In millions of COP      |\n| Balance at January 1, 2023                         | 126,530,862                                                   | (665,259)           | 8,062,435           | (751,728)          | 8,944,556            | (5,853,318)                                              | 143,537,853                                                     | (7,270,305)             |\n| Transfers of financial instruments:                | (1,248,210)                                                   | (73,788)            | (565,802)           |                    | 157,677    1,814,012 | (83,889)                                                 | -

The growth of the portfolio at this stage is mainly due to newly granted loans and clients demonstrating good payment behavior postpandemic, returning to Stage 1. The increase in the loss allowance is primarily due to a more unfavorable macroeconomic expectation where the provision is impacted by lower economic growth and a trend of high interest rates.",

The decrease in exposure is mainly explained by specific loan migrations from Stage 2 to Stage 1 of clients in the agro-industrial sector for a value of COP 658,486, customers transitioning out of medium risk monitoring due to exhibiting improved credit  performance,  and  clients  who  conclude  their  financial  relief  due  to  COVID-19  and  exhibit  favorable  payment behavior, transitioning to Stage 1. The loss allowance decrease is mainly due to the migration of clients between stages and the movement of the loss allowance from debtors ending their financial relief.\n\n## Stage 3 (Lifetime expected credit losses)\n\nThe exposure at default in stage 3 decreased by COP 1,426,253 and the loss allowance decreased by COP 627,111. The variation in exposure is mainly due to a higher level of write-offs (going off balance sheet) and clients leaving AEC (Special Client Administration Watchlist) level 3 due to better sector performance. The decrease of loss allowance is in accordance with the decrease in exposure.\n\n## As of December 31, 2022\n\n## Commercial\n\n|                                                                                                                                                             | Stage1                                                                                                  | Stage1             | Stage2                                         | Stage2             | Stage3                            | Stage3                                       | Total                    | Total                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                             | Gross  carrying                                                                                         | Allowance          | Gross                                          |                    | Gross                             | carrying   Allowance   carrying    Allowance | Gross  carrying          | Allowance                                                                                              |\n| In millions of COP                                                                                                                                          | In millions of COP                                                                                      | In millions of COP | In millions of COP                             | In millions of COP | In millions of COP                | In millions of COP                           | In millions of COP       | In millions of COP                                                                                     |\n| Balance at January 1, 2022                                                                                                                                  | 97,000,580                                                                                              | (745,898)          | 8,335,781                                      | (917,747)          | 9,575,482                         | (6,149,378)                                  | 114,911,843              | (7,813,023)                                                                                            |\n| Transfers of financial instruments:                                                                                                                         | (1,000,903)                                                                                             | (55,842)           | 164,928     (58,355)                           |                    | 835,975                           | 114,197                                      | -

        "page_content": "## Risk management associated with leases\n\nThe Bank, acting as a lessor of operating leases, has a comprehensive asset management model for those assets classified as property, plant and equipment. This model includes an impairment test that evaluates indicators that impact the assets, which is carried out annually. The test evaluates both external indicators (economic, environmental, and legal), and internal ones (insurance, maintenance and used market sales). Likewise, the calculation of residuals was updated to reflect the effect of the new macroeconomic conditions. Moreover, the Bank performs a detailed review process at the time of return of the asset by the lessees in order to guarantee their operating conditions. Additionally, the Bank employs experts apart from the sales team, who constantly monitor the conditions of the second-hand market, and carry out back-testing in order to determine the consistency of the residual value model, and periodically review the results together with key managers. All the above is complemented by agreements with suppliers, which allow the exchange of information, knowledge and, in some cases, the structuring of residual risk mitigation mechanisms.\n\nIn order to manage the risks associated with the assets, the Bank also employs an insurance department, and engages an international broker and insurance companies. They all serve as support to design and define the strategies for the different types of protection that cover the lessor's risks, assets and customers.\n\nAdditionally, in Renting Colombia's vehicle rental business, assets are managed with the goal of preserving commercial value through necessary maintenance, which avoids deterioration beyond that generated by regular use. Service indicators with suppliers are periodically reviewed in order to ensure their quality and compliance with the expected levels. Safe mobility strategies are also defined based on the permanent analysis of the road safety indicators. These strategies aim at ensuring the status and useful life of the asset.\n\n## 7.2. Lessee\n\nThe Bank has entered into lease agreements as a lessee. These arrangements involve offices, branches and administrative offices as well as certain Computer equipment. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the rollforward of right-of-use assets was as follows:",

FAI CALLE 77\n\nOn June 4, 2021, Bancolombia S.A. entered into an agreement with CCLA Colombia S.A.S. for the conditional assignment of the fiduciary rights of the Trust named P.A. FAI Calle 77, which owns the Nomad 77 Building located in the city of Bogot\u00e1  (Colombia),  which  is  the  first  project  built  for  Multifamily  rental  housing  in  Colombia.    Bancolombia  S.A. concluded that it has control over the P.A. FAI Calle 77 given that it has exposures, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement in the investee and also has the ability to use its power to affect returns from the rental housing activity, through its participation in executive committees, and has the capacity to direct the activity that most significantly affects returns of all business - namely, approval rights over the disposal of the real estate projects.\n\nThe transaction was completed on March 1, 2022, upon Bancolombia S.A. obtaining the registration that qualifies it as a lessor of real estate for urban housing from the 'Secretar\u00eda de Habitat' of Bogota. This registration was the condition to which the transfer of the fiduciary rights were subject. The Bank also obtained control of the P.A. FAI Calle 77 Trust on March 1, 2022, and has an equity interest of 98.00%. This acquisition reflects the Bank's objective to evolve its value proposition based on the current needs of the market, seeking to provide a differential service in rental housing.\n\nThe consideration paid by Bancolombia S.A. was COP 56,968, which consisted of a cash advance of COP 29,025 on June 9, 2021 and settlement of an active financial leasing operation with the sellers for COP 27,943.\n\nThe acquisition of the P.A. FAI Calle 77 Trust was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of IFRS 3. The purchase price was assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired, based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.\n\nThe Bank opted to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree of 2.00% at fair value, which amounted to COP 1,166 at the date of acquisition.",

FAI Calle 77 Trust resulted in the recognition of a gain from a bargain purchase of COP 2,433, which was recognized in 'Dividends and net income on equity investments' line item of the Consolidated Statement of Income. The amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of the non-controlling interest therein, due to the fact that the price was agreed 9 months before the efective transfer of control of the business, reflecting a valuation of the assets.\n\n## Acquisition-related cost\n\nIn connection with the acquisition, the Bank incurred costs which are recorded in the \"Other administrative and general expenses\" line item of the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## WOMPI S.A.S. (before 'Vlipco S.A.S.')\n\nOn November 10, 2021, Bancolombia S.A. entered into a stock purchase agreement, pursuant to which Bancolombia S.A. agreed to purchase an additional 47.37% stake in the capital stock of the Colombian company, Wompi S.A.S. Wompi S.A.S. provides technology services to financial companies and qualifies as a business as defined in IFRS 3.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the Bank owned 91,838 shares of Wompi S.A.S. that represented 47.40% of the total capital stock of the company, classified as an investment in joint venture.\n\nThe  transaction  was  completed  on  November  30,  2021,  upon  receipt  of  required  regulatory  approvals  from  the Superintendencia of Industry and Commerce, and as a result Bancolombia S.A. obtained control of Wompi S.A.S. The consideration paid by Bancolombia S.A. was COP 9,474, in cash.\n\nThe acquisition of Wompi S.A.S. in stages was accounted for under the acquisition method, in accordance with IFRS 3. Accordingly, the Bank has remeasured its previously held equity interest in Wompi S.A.S. at its acquisition-date fair value and recognized the resulting gain or loss and equity method adjustment.",

The reports made by the external consulting company contain the description of the valuation methodologies used, and key assumptions such as: discount rates, calculation of applied  expenses  and  income  approach,  among  others.  The  fair  value  of  the  investment  properties  is  based  on  the comparative  market  approach,  which  reflects  the  prices  of  recent  transactions  with  similar  characteristics.  Upon determining the fair value of these investment properties, the greater and best use of these investment properties is their present use.

The most significant measures this norm are outlined below:\n\nThe Corporate Income Tax rate (CIT) continues at 35%; however, the surcharge applicable to financial entities from 2023 to 2027 increased by 5%.  This surcharge is applicable when the financial entities have a taxable income equal to, or higher than 120.000 tax units (UVT).\n\nCertain non-taxable incomes, special deductions, exempt incomes, and tax credits will be limited to 3% of the taxpayer's net income before deductions.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2023 onwards, Industry and Trade Tax (ITT) will not be creditable against the Corporate Income Tax. Therefore, ITT only will be eligible as a deduction.\n\nA minimum effective tax rate of 15% was introduced for Colombian corporations. This rate must be calculated by dividing the due tax (with certain adjustments) over the book profits (with certain adjustments).\n\nProfits derived from the sale of shares listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange will be treated as non-taxable income if: i) a single shareholder owns them, and ii) they are not more than 3% of the total outstanding shares listed by the entity in the taxable year.\n\nThe distribution of profits in shares will be taxable for CIT matters.\n\nPayments falling into the following categories i) social club memberships, ii) personal payments to shareholders and their relatives, and iii) labor expenses of home support personnel, among others, will not be deductible for CIT purposes.\n\nDonations to research, technological developments, and innovation will not be deductible.\n\nDividend tax rate increases as follows:\n\n| Dividend tax           | Rate             |\n|------------------------|------------------|\n| Foreign entities       | From 10% to 20%  |\n| Colombian corporations | From 7,5% to 10% |\n\nCapital gains tax increases from 10% to 15%.\n\nA temporary reduction in penalties and interest of 60% will be applied upon the fulfillment of certain requirements\n\nThe tax determination will be made through electronic invoicing when the taxpayer has not filed their income tax returns.\n\nPenalty for not sending information to the Tax Office is reduced to 7500 tax units (UVT).\n\nIn-kind payments made by an entity to third parties for the acquisition of goods or provision of services will be deemed as taxable  income  for  the  entity's  employees,  their  spouses,  their  relatives,  and  any  other  person  with  the  title  of  the beneficiary of the payment.\n\n## Other Countries:\n\nThe income tax rate in the other countries where the Group has a presence amounts to 25% in Guatemala and Panama and 30% in El Salvador.",

In the case of Colombian companies, dividends will be subject to the application of Articles 48 and 49 of the Tax Statute and consequently will be subject to withholding at source at the established rates, in accordance with the tax characteristics of each shareholder.\n\n## 12.8.2   Dividends received from Subsidiary Companies\n\nConsidering the historical tax status of the dividends received by the Bank from its affiliates and national subsidiaries, it is  expected that in the future dividends will be received on the basis of non-income tax.  They will not be subject to withholding tax, taking into account that the Bank, its affiliates and national subsidiaries belong to the same business group.\n\n## 12.9      Tax contingent liabilities and assets\n\nIn  the  determination  of  the  effective  current  and  deferred  taxes  subject  to  review  by  the  tax  authority,  the  relevant regulations have been applied in accordance with the interpretations made by the Group Bancolombia.\n\nIn Colombia due to the complexity of the tax system, ongoing amendments to the tax regulations, accounting changes with implications on tax bases and in general the legal instability of the country, the tax authority may at any time have different criteria than that of the Bank. Consequently, a dispute or inspection by the tax authority on a tax treatment may affect the Bank accounting of assets or liabilities for deferred or current taxes, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12. However, based on the criteria established in the interpretation of IFRIC 23, the  Bank did not recognize uncertain tax positions in its financial statements.",

The rate used to discount the obligation of the defined benefit plan to reflect the duration of the labor liabilities as of December 2023 corresponds to the yield of sovereign bonds of each country where the plan is established, either Colombia, Panama, Guatemala and El Salvador, as applicable, since the market transactions of these countries involving corporate bonds of high quality have no high levels of activity. The assumption of the rate of inflation is based on the long term projection of the Central Bank of Colombia, Panama, Guatemala and El Salvador.\n\nThe nature of the risks related to the obligations aforementioned are summarized below:\n\n| Investment risk     | The present value of the obligation for the defined benefits  plan  is  calculated  using  a  discount  rate  determined  with  reference to high quality sovereign yields of each country.

An  increase  in  the  life  expectancy  of  the  participants will increase the plan obligation             |\n| Salary risk         | The present value of the obligation of the benefit plan is  calculated  with  reference  to  the  future  salaries  of  the  participants. As such, an increase in the participants' wages  will increase the obligation of the plan                                                                           |",

(in reorganization) and Inversiones Davanic S.A.S.\n\nOn November 3, 2022, Bancolombia was informed of a lawsuit in which the plaintiff contends that a loan agreement is in place  between  the  parties,  rather  than  a  lease.  The  plaintiffs  also  requested  that  the  purchase  and  sale  agreement  be rescinded on the basis that the price of the property was lower than its fair price.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek COP 65,000. The likelihood of recovering this amount is considered to be remote because the parties always intended to celebrate a lease and not a different type of contract. On December 7, 2022, Bancolombia issued an answer to the lawsuit. As of December 31, 2023, the proceeding is pending a response to the lawsuit from the other defendant. Bancolombia has not recorded a provision for this matter.\n\n## Constitutional Public Interest Action - Carlos Julio Aguilar and other\n\nIn this proceeding, a constitutional public interest action was filed, in which the plaintiffs allege that due to the restructuring of  Departamento  del  Valle's  financial  obligations  and  its  Performance  Plan,  the  collective  rights  of  the  public administration  and  the  public  funds  of  the  Departamento  del  Valle  were  breached.  According  to  the  Bank's  defense arguments, the agreement was made in accordance with the law.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the procedure is pending a first instance judgment. The contingency is deemed to be possible. Bancolombia has not recorded a provision for this matter.\n\n## Contralor\u00eda Departamental de Cundinamarca v. GEHS, Bancolombia and other natural persons\n\nThe development of the Water Treatment Plant PTAR Ch\u00eda I Delicias Sur from Municipio de Ch\u00eda, Colombia, was outlined in a lease agreement signed on September 28, 2015. The price agreed was COP 19,000. The object of the agreement was the financing of the Project, as well as the optimization, design, and construction of the Water Treatment Plant PTAR Ch\u00eda I Delicias Sur.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, Bancolombia had anticipated certain payments to the Supplier of the Project. The Municipio de Ch\u00eda's Mayor Office, has claimed that irregularities have been found during the execution of the Project. Because of these allegations, the Contralor\u00eda de Cundinamarca began a proceeding of Fiscal Responsibility against GEHS Global Environment and Health Solutions de Colombia (Supplier), Guillermo Varela Romero, Rafael Antonio Ballesteros G\u00f3mez, Lu\u00eds Alejandro Prieto Gonz\u00e1lez (Municipio de Ch\u00eda's former Mayor and employees of the municipal administration), and Bancolombia S.A., on the basis of the alleged loss.\n\nBancolombia  has  alleged  in  its  defense,  among  other  arguments,  that  the  Bank  fully  complied  with  its  contractual obligations and that it is not responsible for the loss of the Municipality's resources.\n\nOn November 3, 2023, the Contralor\u00eda de Cundinamarca at first instance held responsible five individuals, including Bancolombia, for an amount of COP 7,649. Bancolombia filed a motion for reconsideration, and alternatively, an appeal against the decision. These proceedings are pending resolution.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, taking into account these recent developments and further analysis, Bancolombia considers the contingency as possible, therefore has established a provision of COP 7,149. This amount corresponds to the judgment amount, deducting the value to be assumed by the insurance companies involved in the proceeding.\n\n## Remediation Plan for Santa Elena's property\n\nIn 1987, Bancolombia (formerly Bank of Colombia) received a property located in Municipio de Cartagena, Colombia from the National Federation of Algodoneros. After the settlement was signed, soil contamination from pesticides and herbicides was found on the property. Bancolombia initiated a civil responsibility judicial procedure against the Federation",

On November 13, 2015, the final judgment was issued, and it was decided that the National Federation of Algodoneros was liable for environmental damages and that Bancolombia was not.\n\nDespite not being liable for environmental damages, Bancolombia is subject to decontamination requirements with respect to  the  property.  Bancolombia  has  carried  out over  the  years  various  activities  aimed  at  containing  the  environmental impact, as well as the social management of the communities neighboring the lot. These activities include, among others, the  confinement  of  contaminating  material,  installation  of  monitoring  wells,  and  execution  of  plans  to  reduce contamination levels.\n\nCurrently, these plans have the approval of the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales de Colombia (ANLA) and their execution is divided into 3 stages: Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3. Bancolombia appealed the administrative act issued by the ANLA on the basis of technical issues for the execution of Stage 3, and it is pending resolution.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Bancolombia is progressing in the activities outlined in the plans to reduce contamination levels approved by ANLA, which include the monitoring of soils and waters in the area (Stage 1), monitoring of floors and walls in the warehouses (Stage 2), social management plan with the communities in the influence area of the remediation plan, emergency plan, hazardous waste management plan and biotic environment protection plan.\n\nIt is expected to complete the execution of the plans within 36 months, this timeframe may be adjusted based on new analyses or requirements from the authorities. As of December 31, 2023, Bancolombia has established a provision of COP 74,770 for the accomplishment of the remaining activities.\n\n## Fredy Alberto Lara Borja\n\nOn December 13, 2023, Bancolombia was notified of a lawsuit filed by a former employee of the liquidated company Aluminio  Reynolds  Santo  Domingo  S.A,  seeking  the  absolute  nullity  of  the  purchase  agreement  between  Leasing Bancolombia and Bancolombia S.A. for two properties signed in 2011. Leasing Bancolombia acquired those properties through a purchase agreement with the company Armarcas E.U, which had received them as a payment from Sociedad Aluminio Reynolds Santo Domingo S.A. The plaintiff requested that the properties be returned to Aluminios Reynolds Santo Domingo's estate so they can be used as payment of the labor liabilities of the company. The value of the claim is COP 103,943.\n\nBancolombia filed an appeal against the court's order admitting the lawsuit arguing, among other reasons, non-compliance of legal requirements and lack of jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2023, it is pending resolution. The contingency is deemed to be remote. Bancolombia has not recorded a provision for this matter.\n\n## FIDUCIARIA BANCOLOMBIA\n\n## Quinta Sur S.A.S.\n\nIn March 2022, Fiduciaria Bancolombia was notified of a lawsuit filed by Quinta Sur S.A.S. (in liquidation). According to the lawsuit, Quinta Sur seeks to be indemnified for damages as a result of the failure to transfer the resources to the plaintiff for the beginning of a housing construction project, under the terms agreed in the trust agreement.\n\nFiduciaria Bancolombia alleges that it has complied with the law and the contract, arguing that the property on which the housing project was to be constructed did not fulfill the contractual requirements. The plaintiff seeks COP 128,000.\n\nOn  August  24,  2023,  a  favorable  judgment  was  issued  for  Fiduciaria  Bancolombia.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  the proceeding  is  pending  the  resolution  of  the  appeal  filed  by  the  plaintiff.  The  contingency  is  deemed  to  be  possible. Fiduciaria Bancolombia has not recorded provision for this matter.",

Constructora Tymsa alleges that the signatures and fingerprints in the public instrument of purchase, sale and in the mortgage in favor of Banistmo are false.\n\nThe plaintiff seeks USD 10,000, in addition to interests, costs and expenses. Banistmo and Banistmo Investment allege they are not liable for any intentional or negligent conduct in relation to the alleged fraudulent sale of the property.

In 2017, Ms. Perscky, who had an authorized signature, ordered the cancelation of a fixed term deposit from Five Star and instructed that those funds be transferred to 3 accounts that belonged to persons related to her (for example, her children). Mr. Barbero contacted Banistmo and tried to reverse the instructions, however as it was not possible, Mr. Barbero filed criminal complaints against Ms. Perscky.\n\nBanistmo has complied with banking law and has handled the information's confidentiality according to the law and the contract.  The  plaintiffs  seek  compensation  for  material  and  moral  damages,  alleging  that  Banistmo  breached confidentiality and banking secret in detriment of the plaintiffs.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the evidentiary stage is pending.

This payment was received as a partial payment of 2 apartments located in Panam\u00e1 City.\n\nThe Credit Card Securities and Fraud Prevention department of the HSBC bank detected an irregular activity by Promotora Terramar on June 3, 2008, when a monitoring alert was activated due to the high number of cards with the same BIN and bank.  Therefore,  pursuant  to  the  Business  Establishments  Affiliate  Agreement,  HSBC  held  funds  from  Promotora Terramar's accounts. Nevertheless, after further investigations the money was refunded.\n\nOn October 2013, the plaintiffs filed a claim for compensation of the material and moral damages caused, which according to their valuation, amounts to USD 5,252,000. Banistmo alleges it has complied with the contractual terms outlined in the Affiliate Agreement and the statute of limitations deadline has lapsed, among other defenses.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, commencement of the evidentiary stage is pending.

The price that the Bank determines for each performance obligation is done by defining the cost of each service, related tax and associated risks to the operation and inherent to the transaction plus the margin expected to be received in each one of the services, taking as references the market prices and conditions, as well as the segmentation of the customer.\n\nIn the transactions evaluated in the contracts, changes in the price of the transaction are not identified.\n\n## Contract assets with customers\n\nThe Bank receives payments from customers based on the provision of the service, in accordance to that established in the contracts. When the Bank incurs costs for providing the service prior to the invoicing, and if these are directly related with a contract, they improve the resources of the entity and are expected to recuperate, these costs correspond to a contract asset. Currently, the Group does not have assets related to contracts with customers.\n\nAs a  practical  expedient,  the  Bank  recognizes  the  incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  as  an  expense  when  the amortization period of the asset is one year or less.\n\n## Contract liabilities with customers\n\nThe contract liabilities constitute the obligation of the Bank to transfer the services to a customer, for which the Group has received a payment on the part of the final customer or if the amount is due before the execution of the contract. They also include deferred income related to services that shall be delivered or provided in the future, which will be invoiced to the customer in advance, but which are still not due.",

In accordance with IFRS the financial instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability being measured take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. Level 2 generally includes: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 : Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair  value  requires  significant  management  judgment  or  estimation.  This  category  generally  includes  certain  retained residual interests in securitizations, asset-backed securities (ABS) and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts where independent pricing information was not able to be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.",

Debt instruments\n\nThe Bank assigns prices to those debt investments, using the prices provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia) and assigns the appropriate level according to the procedure described above. For securities not traded or overthe-counter such as certain bonds issued by other financial institutions, the Bank generally determines fair value utilizing internal valuation and standard techniques. These techniques include determination of expected future cash flows which are discounted using curves of the applicable currencies and the Colombian consumer price index (interest rate in this case), modified by the credit risk and liquidity risk. The interest rate is generally computed using observable market data and reference yield curves derived from quoted interest in appropriate time bandings, which match the timings of the cash flows and maturities of the instruments.\n\n## b. Equity securities and other financial instruments\n\nThe Bank performs the market price valuation of its investments in variable income using the prices provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia) and classifies those investments according to the procedure described above (Hierarchy of fair value section). Likewise, the fair value of unlisted equity securities and other financial instruments is based  on  an  assessment  of  each  individual  investment  using  methodologies  that  include  publicly-traded  comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, and  if  necessary  considered,  are  subject  to  appropriate  discounts  for  lack  of  liquidity  or  marketability.  Interests  in investment  funds,  trusts  and  collective  portfolios  are  valued  using  the  investment  unit  value  determined  by  the  fund management company. For investment funds where the underlying assets are investment properties, the investment unit value depends on the investment properties value, determined as described below in 'i. Investment property'.\n\n## c. Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Bank holds positions in standardized derivatives, such as futures over local stocks, and over the market representative rate.  These  instruments  are  evaluated  according  to  the  information  provided  by  Precia,  which  perfectly  matches  the information provided by the Central Counterparty Clearing House - CCP.\n\nAdditionally, the Bank holds positions in Over The Counter (OTC) derivatives, which in the absence of prices, are valued using the inputs and methodologies provided by the pricing services provider, which have the no objection of the SFC.\n\nThe key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, the spot price of the underlying volatility, credit curves and correlation of such inputs.",

        "page_content": "## d. Credit valuation adjustment\n\nThe Bank measures the effects of the credit risk of its counterparties and its own creditworthiness in determining fair value of the swap, option and forward derivatives.\n\nCounterparty credit-risk adjustments are applied to derivatives when the Bank's position is a derivative asset and the Bank's credit risk is incorporated when the position is a derivative liability. The Bank attempts to mitigate credit risk to third parties which are international banks by entering into master netting agreements. The agreements allow to offset or bring net amounts that are liabilities, derivates from transactions carried out by the different agreements. Master netting agreements take different forms and may allow payments to be made under a variety of other master agreements or other negotiation agreements between the same parties; some may have a monthly basis and others only apply at the time the agreements are terminated.\n\nWhen assessing the impact of credit exposure, only the net counterparty exposure is considered at risk, due to the offsetting of certain same-counterparty positions and the application of cash and other collateral.\n\nThe Bank generally calculates the asset's credit risk adjustment for derivatives transacted with international financial institutions by incorporating indicative credit related pricing that is generally observable in the market (Credit Default Swaps,  'CDS').  The  credit-risk  adjustment  for  derivatives  transacted  with  non-public  counterparties  is  calculated  by incorporating unobservable credit data derived from internal credit qualifications to the financial institutions and corporate companies located in Colombia. The Bank also considers its own creditworthiness when determining the fair value of an instrument, including OTC derivative instruments if the Bank believes market participants would take that into account when  transacting  the  respective  instrument.  The  approach  to  measuring  the  impact  of  the  Bank's  credit  risk  on  an instrument transacted with international financial institutions is done using the asset swap curve calculated for subordinated bonds  issued  by  the  Bank  in  foreign  currency.  For  derivatives  transacted  with  local  financial  institutions,  the  Bank calculates the credit risk adjustment by incorporating credit risk data provided by rating agencies and released in the Colombian financial market.\n\n## e. Impaired loans measured at fair value\n\nThe Bank measured certain impaired loans based on the fair value of the associated collateral less costs to sell. The fair values were determined as follows using external and internal valuation techniques or third party experts, depending on the type of underlying asset.\n\nFor vehicles under leasing arrangements, the Bank uses an internal valuation model based on price curves for each type of vehicle. Such curves show the expected price of the vehicle at different points in time based on the initial price and projection  of  economic  variables  such  as  inflation,  devaluation  and  customs.  The  prices  modelled  in  the  curves  are compared  every  six  months  with  market  information  for  the  same  or  similar  vehicles  and  in  the  case  of  significant deviation; the curve is adjusted to reflect the market conditions.\n\nOther vehicles are measured using matrix pricing from a third party. This matrix is used by most of the market participants and is updated monthly. The matrix is developed from values provided by several price providers for identical or similar vehicles and considers brand, characteristics of the vehicles, and manufacturing date among other variables to determine the prices.\n\nFor real estate assets, a third-party qualified appraiser is used. The methodologies vary depending on the date of the last appraisal available for the property (the appraisal is estimated based on either of three approaches: cost, sales comparison and income approach, and is required every three years). When the property has been valued in the last 12 months and the market  conditions  have  not  shown  significant  changes,  the  most  recent  valuation  is  considered  the  fair  value  of  the property.\n\nFor all other cases (for example, appraisals older than 12 months) the value of the property is updated by adjusting the value in the last appraisal for weighted factors such as location, type and characteristics of the property, size, structural conditions and the expected sales prices, among others. The factors are determined based on current market information",

The factors are determined based on current market information gathered from several external real estate specialists.\n\n## f. Assets held for sale measured at fair value less cost of sale\n\nThe Bank measures certain impaired foreclosed assets and premises and equipment held for sale based on fair value less costs to sell. The fair values were determined using external and internal valuation techniques, depending on the type of underlying asset. Those assets are comprised mainly of real estate properties for which the appraisal is conducted by experts considering factors such as the location, type and characteristics of the property, size, physical conditions and expected selling costs, among others. Likewise, in some cases the fair value is estimated considering comparable prices or promises of sale and offering prices from auctions process.\n\n## g. Mortgage-backed securities ('TIPS') and Asset-Backed securities\n\nThe Bank invests in asset-backed securities for which underlying assets are mortgages and earnings under contracts issued by  financial  institutions  and  corporations,  respectively.  The  Bank  does  not  have  a  significant  exposure  to  sub-prime securities. The asset-backed securities are denominated in local market TIPS and are classified as fair value through profit or loss. These asset-backed securities have different maturities and are generally classified by credit ratings.\n\nTIPS are part of the Bank portfolio and its fair value is measured with published price by the official pricing services provider. These securities are leveled by margin and are assigned level 2 or 3 based on the Precia information.\n\nResidual TIPS have their fair value measured using the discounted flow method, taking into account the amortization tables of the Titularizadora Colombiana, the betas in COP and UVR of Precia (used to construct the curves) and the margins; when they are residual TIPS of subordinated issues, a liquidity premium is applied. These securities are assigned level 3.\n\n## h. Investments in associates measured at fair value\n\nThe Bank recognizes its investments in P.A Viva Malls and P.A Distrito Vera as an associate at fair value. The estimated amount is provided by the fund manager as the variation of the units according to the units owned by the FCP Fondo Inmobiliario  Colombia.  The  associate's  assets  are  comprised  of  investment  properties  which  are  measured  using  the following techniques: comparable prices, discounted cash flows, replacement cost and direct capitalization. For further information about techniques methodologies and inputs used by the external party see 'Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements'.\n\n## i. Investment property\n\nThe Bank's investment property is valued by external experts, who use valuation techniques based on comparable prices, direct capitalization, discounted cash flows and replacement costs.\n\n## Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\n\nThe following table presents for each of the fair-value hierarchy levels the Bank's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022:",

        "page_content": "## Short-term financial instruments\n\nShort-term financial instruments are valued at their carrying amounts included in the consolidated statement of financial position, which are reasonable estimates of fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity of the instruments. This approach was used for cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable, customers' acceptances, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest payable and bank acceptances outstanding.\n\n## Deposits from customers\n\nThe fair value of time deposits was estimated based on the discounted value of cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Fair value of deposits with no contractual maturities represents the amount payable on demand as of the statement of financial position date.\n\n## Interbank deposits and repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowings\n\nShort-term interbank borrowings and repurchase agreements have been valued at their carrying amounts because of their relatively short-term nature. Long-term and domestic development bank borrowings have also been valued at their carrying amount because they bear interest at variable rates.\n\n## Borrowings from other financial institutions\n\nThe fair value of borrowings from other financial institutions were determined using discounted cash flow models. The cash flows projection of capital and interest was made according to the contractual terms, considering capital amortization and interest bearing. Subsequently, the cash flows were discounted using reference curves formed by the weighted average of the Bank's deposit rates.\n\n## Debt instruments in issue\n\nThe fair value of debt instruments in issue, comprised of bonds issued by Bancolombia S.A. and its subsidiaries, was estimated substantially based on quoted market prices. The fair value of certain bonds which do not have a public trading market, were determined based on the discounted value of cash flows using the rates currently offered for bonds of similar remaining maturities and the Bank's creditworthiness.\n\n## Preferred shares\n\nIn the valuation of the liability component of preferred shares related to the minimum dividend of 1% of the subscription price, the Bank uses the Gordon Model to price the obligation, taking into account its own credit risk, which is measured using  the  market  spread  based  on  observable  inputs  such  as  quoted  prices  of  sovereign  debt.  The  Gordon  Model  is commonly used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock based on a future series of dividends that are estimated by the Bank and growth at a constant rate considering the Bank's own perspectives of the payout ratio.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nEstimating the fair value of loans and advances to customers is considered an area of considerable uncertainty as there is no observable market. The loan portfolio is stratified into tranches and loans segments suchs as commercial, consumer, small business loans, mortgage and leasing. The fair value of loans and advances to customers and financial institutions is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, considering each credit's principal and interest projected cash flows to the prepayment date. The projected cash flows are discounted using reference curves according to the type of loan and its maturity date.\n\n## Items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\n\nThe Bank measures assets held for sale based on fair value less costs to sell. This category includes certain foreclosed assets and investments in associates held for sale. The fair values were determined using external and internal valuation",

Changing one or more of the inputs to the valuation models to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would change the fair values and therefore a valuation adjustment would be recognized in profit or loss. Favorable and unfavorable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable input as described in the table below.\n\nThe following table sets forth information about significant unobservable inputs related to the Bank's material categories of  level  3  financial  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  sensitivity  of  these  fair  values  to  reasonably  possible  alternative assumptions.",

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nApproval of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on XXX   X, 2024.\n\n## NOTE 32. IMPACTS ON APPLICATION OF NEW STANDARDS\n\n## a. Accounting pronouncements applicable in 2023\n\nIFRS 17, issued in May 2017 to replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, applies to insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, issued by an entity with specified exceptions; reinsurance contracts held by an entity; and investment contracts with discretionary participation features issued by an entity that issues insurance contracts. An insurance contract is defined as 'a contract under which one party (the issuer) accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder' (IFRS 17).\n\nThe standard requires that estimates be remeasured in each reporting period. In the statement of financial position, contracts are measured using the following core components:\n\n- \u00b7 Discounted probability-weighted cash flows,\n- \u00b7 An explicit risk adjustment, and\n- \u00b7 A Contractual Service Margin ('CSM') representing the unearned profit of the contract which is recognised as revenue over the coverage period.",

        "page_content": "IFRS 17 requires an entity to recognise profit from a group of insurance contracts over the period the entity provides services, and as the entity is released from risk. If a group of contracts is or becomes loss-making, the entity is required to recognise the loss immediately.\n\nThe portfolio of insurance contracts are detailed below:\n\n| General Insurance                |\n|----------------------------------|\n| Direct Insurance  Life Insurance |\n| Accident and Health              |\n| General Insurance                |\n| Reinsurance  Life Insurance      |\n| Accident and Health              |\n\nFor the measurement of direct insurance and reinsurance portfolios, the Bank adopted the Premium Allocation Approach ('PAA'). Additionally, it considered:\n\n- a) Opting to defer cash flows for the acquisition of insurance for direct insurance and reinsurance portfolios. This process involves allocating to groups of related insurance contracts, which are amortized over the coverage period of the respective group.\n- b) Determining that the Bank's direct insurance and reinsurance portfolios do not need to adjust the carrying amount of the Liability for Remaining Coverage ('LRC') to reflect the time value of money and the financial effect, as premiums were measured under the PAA approach.\n- c) In cases where it is expected that direct insurance and reinsurance portfolios will pay claims over a period exceeding 12 months, the Bank will adjust the carrying amount of the Liability for Incurred Claims ('LIC') to reflect the time value of money. Otherwise, no adjustment to the carrying amount is required.\n- d) Recognize  in  the  income  statement  the  financial  income  and  expenses  arising  from  direct  insurance  and reinsurance contracts, as well as the effect on the liability for incurred claims due to changes in discount rates.\n- On January 1, 2023, the Bank adopted IFRS 17. This involved the identification, recognition, and measurement of each group of insurance contracts and cash flows for the acquisition of insurance, and derecognized amounts that would not exist if this standard had always been applied. The resulting net difference was recognized in equity.\n\nThe effects on the consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2023, are presented below:\n\n| Concept                           | December 31, 2022   | Adoption adjustment   | January 1, 2023    |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| In millions of COP                | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP    | In millions of COP |\n| Insurance contracts asset (1)     | 68,991              | 22,383                | 91,374             |\n| Insurance contracts liability (2) | 124,598             | 21,679                | 146,277            |\n| Retained earnings                 | -                   | 704                   | 704                |\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Bank's comprehensive risk management is developed in compliance with current regulations and internal standards as defined by the Board of Directors, in relation to market, credit/ counterparty, liquidity and interest rate of the banking book, operational  ,  business  continuity,  technological  and  cybersecurity  risk,  country  risk,  Risk  Appetite  Framework (MAR) and stress tests applicable.

This definition includes, but is not limited to, sovereign risk (SR) and transfer risk (TR) associated with such factors.\n\nThe framework has guidelines, processes and methodologies that evaluate periodically the country risk to which it is exposed in its  Equity  Investments,  such  as  equity  investments,  those  that  are  executed  in  jurisdictions  different  from Colombia that could have a high economic materiality, individually or aggregated by country, and whose purpose is to remain in the country.\n\nCountry risk management includes different stages to identificate, measure, control and monitor the risk to which the entity is being exposed. For this management, the business plan, type of operations, their materiality, current and future vocation, as well as the characteristics of the country in which the investment is made. Additionally, it is supported by methodologies and processes used in the management of country risk, developed by the Vice President of Risk and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe definition of investment appetite takes into account the assessment of country risk as defined in the SIAR and must ensure compliance with solvency and liquidity indicators, seeking to be consistent with the strength and financial health of the entity.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  there  were  no  alerts  on  any  investments,  nor  were  any  adjustments  made  for  deterioration  in investments that could affect or deteriorate the Bank's financial strength.\n\n## a.     Credit Risk Management - Loans and Advances\n\nManagement of credit risk is carried out through all the credit life cycle. These estages are defined in the following way:\n\n- \u00b7 Origination: Knowing the borrower, payment capacity analysis, payment behavior and credit approval and structure.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring: Knowing the borrower's situation during the life of the credit.\n- \u00b7 Recovery: Collection management during the different stages of the same credit.",

        "page_content": "In order to support the credit origination processes, the Bank develops models, methodologies and analytic techniques based on statistical information or criteria from experts, which differentiate the risk levels of potential borrowers in order to support the decision-making process.\n\nIn 2023, the dynamics of the Bank's portfolio were affected by the global economic slowdown and high inflation rates in all the regions where the Bank is present.This, in addition to the uncertainty in the political and social environment and the  appreciation  of  the  peso  against  the  dollar,  which  mainly  affected  Colombia,  had  a  significant  impact  on  the performance of the portfolio, leaving significant impairments as a result, in particular in the individual portfolios of natural persons., both consumer and mortgage. This led to early interventions in the origination, monitoring and collection policies of portfolios with greater deterioration, with the aim of improving the risk profile of new business, resulting in a reduction in  payouts.  about  that,  proactive  credit  risk  management  was  maintained  through  the  monitoring  and  follow-up  of customers and portfolios, the evaluation of the conditions and specific requirements of each one, as well as the development of methods, tools and models to optimize collection..\n\nMonitoring and reviewing the credit portfolio continues to be a key factor in identifying and applying strategies at different stages of the credit cycle, which has generated the development of new processes and models with traditional, alternative and sectorial information, allowing the management of customers in a timely manner, through local and transversal tools in the countries where the Bank is present, behavioral models and early warning systems, which allow the identification of possible deviations in the projection of portfolio composition.\n\nRisk  management  during  the  credit  life  cycle  is  developed  through  the  fulfillment  of  the  policies,  procedures  and methodologies stipulated in the 'Comprehensive Risk Management System (SIAR)', )', which include the general criteria for  evaluating,  measuring,  assuming,  monitoring,  controlling  and  hedging  credit  risk.  In  addition,  Management  has developed  process  and  methodology  manuals  that  specify  the  policies  and  procedures  for  the  different  products  and segments served by the organization in accordance with the strategy approved by the Board of Directors for monitoring and controlling such risk.\n\nThe Credit Risk Administration System also contains general criteria to evaluate, classify, measure and mitigate credit risk.  In  addition,  the  credit  risk  department  has  developed  methodologies  and  manuals  that  specify  the  policies  and procedures for different products and segments managed by the Bank.\n\nTo maintain credit quality and manage the risk arising from its lending activities, the Bank has established general loan policies, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit exposure limits: Contains guidelines with regards to the establishment of credit exposure limits. This is set as a result of legal requirements and according to the Bank's internal guidelines.\n- \u00b7 Origination policies: These policies aim to acquire ample and sufficient knowledge of the characteristics of potential borrowers and to select them properly. The risk level of the individual and legal entities is determined using rating and scoring models which define cut-off points that are applied in the process of issuing credit. These models use information such as the credit history of the borrower, sociodemographic particularities, the type of business the borrower engages in, the borrower's ability to repay the loan, and information received from the credit risk bureaus. In  addition,  sectorial  and  macroeconomic  behavior  is  taken  into  account.  Loan  applications,  depending  on  their amount and risk level, are presented for approval at the level of management authority required.\n- \u00b7 Collaterals policies: For the purpose of mitigating risk associated with non-fulfillment of obligations agreed upon by the borrower, the Bank has established policies for the valuation of collateral received as well as for the determination of the maximum loan amount that can be granted against the value of the collateral.\n- \u00b7 Allowance policies: The objective of this policy is to fulfill legal requirements and the Bank's business policies. In addition, this policy is meant to provide the guidelines to analyze the client's status and take the necessary actions in order to mitigate credit risk to which the Bank is exposed.

These procedures include a continuous process  of  classification  and  reassessment  of  credit  operations  and  they  maintain  consistency  with  the  policies implemented for granting loans.\n- \u00b7 Portfolio recovery policies: Through these policies, the Bank aims to establish those mechanisms that allow it to anticipate the action to be taken in the event of possible delays and minimize the impact resulting from non-fulfillment of payment or delays by the borrower. Additionally, the aspects established in this policy delimit what the Bank has defined as collection management and that make it possible to obtain information to improve the origination policies and  the  allowances  for  loans  and  advances  and  lease  losses  models.  The  established  actions  are  combined  with strategies to adjust to the economy, market and costumer conditions, allowing the Bank to offer alternatives tailored to each case, such as payment deals, foreclosed assets, cession agreements, modifications, restructuring, and so on.\n\nThe Risk Corporate Vice Presidency is in charge of defining and documenting the specific characteristics of the models, methodologies and analytics techniques, as well as the parameters, variables and the cut-off points that are applied in the process of issuing credit, according to market and product conditions, as well as the appetite framework approved by the board of directors. Those models, methodologies and analytic techniques can incorporate different kinds of variables such as social demographic, qualitative issues, internal and external behavior, product parameters, etc. In addition, as defined for regulatory basis, Risk Corporate Vice Presidency performs back testing to these models and methodologies in order to evaluate their effectiveness, reporting their results to the board of directors.\n\nThe Risk Corporate Vice Presidency establishes through internal guidelines the scoring or cut-off points required in the different process of issuing credit. In the same way, this Vice Presidency can adjust parameters to give a different score considering relevant qualitative and quantitative information, such as customer's sector, financial indicators, historical payment behavior, etc. Moreover, on a monthly basis, large part of the  portfolio is rated considering the established internal models for the purpose of evaluating the credit risk of each borrower and constitutes the required allowance for loans and advances and lease losses.\n\nIn addition to the evaluation and qualification of the portfolio, the monthly allowance for loans and advances and lease losses serves to measure the present condition of the portfolio and the methodologies used for its calculation serve as a tool to evaluate risk, be it in a collective or individual manner. Collective evaluation of the portfolio applies the following parameters for measuring risk: probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). For further details please see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies, section 7.4.5 Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost.\n\nAn individual's risk evaluation is made in respect of consumers classified in stage 3 with significant exposure and corporate clients classified in stage 2 who were previously in stage 3. The analysis is based on the projection of the individual client cash flow, parameters such as recovery rates estimated by models that include financial, behavioral information, collaterals and qualitative variables, which serve as elements to measure risk and define allowances for loans, advances and lease losses for each borrower.\n\nPeriodically backtesting must be performed on the allowances for loans and advances and lease losses models for the purpose of maintaining suitable hedge levels in accordance with the Bank's risk appetite.\n\nThe Bank is continuously monitoring the concentration of risk groups, as well as carrying out a daily control of the exposure to different economic groups, evaluating the legal limits of indebtedness in order to fulfill the norms established about the concentration limits.\n\nThe  Bank  performs  international  references  determined  by  the  rankings  of  external  risks  that  allow  the  analysis  of concentration levels in different geographic areas.

Credit Quality Analysis - Loans and Financial Leases\n\n## Rating System for Credit Risk Management\n\nThe principal aim of this rating system is to determine the risk profile of the borrower, which is obtained through a rating.\n\nThe rating for corporate loans is assigned principally based on the analysis of the interrelation of both qualitative and quantitative elements that can affect the fulfillment of the financial commitments acquired by a borrower. Information from financial  statements,  profit  and  loss  statements,  historical  payment  behavior both  with  the  Bank  and  with  other entities, and qualitative information on variables that are not explicit in the financial statements are taken into account, as well as client transactional information such as alternative variables.

The  30-day  past  due  loan  ratio (consolidated)  reaching  at  5.39%  in  December  2023  compared  to  3.55%  in  December  2022,  associated  with macroeconomic effects that affect both natural person and legal entity, such as high levels of inflation, interest rates and slowdown in most sectors.  During  the period,  different  strategies  were  developed  throughout  the  credit  cycle,  which allowed the implementation of anticipated and coherent actions to the reality of customers and their environment, in order to limit the deterioration and place them in better risk profiles.\n\n- \u00b7 Commercial loans and financial leases amounted to COP  161,964 billion, which represented a decrease of  5.6% compared to 2022. The 30-day past due loan ratio was 3.50% compared to 2.39% as of December 2022.\n- \u00b7 Consumer loans amounted to COP 54,592 billion, which represented a decrease of 8.4% compared to 2022. The 30day past due loan ratio was 9.48% compared to 5.82% as of December 2022.\n- \u00b7 Mortgage loans  totaled to COP 36,250 billion, which represented a decrease of 3.0% compared to 2022. The 30-day past due loan ratio was 7.52% compared to 4.95% as of December 2022.\n- \u00b7 Small Business loans ended at COP 1,145 billion, which represented a decrease of 13.8% with respect to 2022. The 30-day past due loan ratio was 12.17% compared to 11.48% as of December 2022.\n\nIn order to monitor credit risk associated with clients, the Bank has established regular meetings conducted by the AEC Committee to identify events that can lead to a reduction in borrowers' ability to pay. Generally, clients with good credit behavior could be included in the watch list in case of detecting any event that can lead to future financial difficulties to repay their loans; for instance, internal factors such as the economic activity and sector, financial weakness, impacts of macroeconomic conditions, changes in corporate governance and other situations that could affect clients' business. The amount and allowance of clients included in the described watch list, as of December 31, 2023 and December 2022 is shown below:\n\n## December 2023:\n\n| Watch List december 31, 2023  In millions of COP   | Watch List december 31, 2023  In millions of COP   | Watch List december 31, 2023  In millions of COP   | Watch List december 31, 2023  In millions of COP   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk Level                                         | Amount                                             | %                                                  | Allowance                                          |\n| Level 1 - Low Risk                                 | 14,358,838                                         | 1.02 %                                             | 146,014                                            |\n| Level 2 - Medium Risk                              | 4,744,341                                          | 7.38 %                                             | 349,972                                            |\n| Level 3 - High Risk                                | 2,886,649                                          |                                                    | 53.31 %  1,538,882                                 |\n| Level 4 - High Risk                                | 5,239,356                                          |                                                    | 73.24 %  3,837,196                                 |\n| Total                                              | 27,229,184                                         |                                                    | 21.57 %  5,872,064                                 |",

Collateral is considered in the determination of the allowance for loans and advances and lease losses when it complies with the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 Its fair value was established according to technical and objective criteria.\n- \u00b7 The Bank is granted a preference to obtain the payment of the obligation, becoming an effective legal mechanism over it.\n- \u00b7 Its performance is reasonably possible.\n\nThe Bank has defined the criteria for collateral enforceability, which are established according to the classification of the loan portfolio. In addition, the Bank has set guidelines to value collateral and the frequency of such valuations, as well as those guidelines related to the legalization, registry and maintenance of the collateral. Likewise, the Bank has defined the criteria for insurability, custody and the necessary procedures for their cancellation.\n\nThe update of the fair value of mortgages and vehicles collaterals for the loan portfolio is made at least once a year. The methodology used to estimate the fair value of the properties is applied by external and independent entities. Updating the fair value of the vehicles is done through guides and valid values commonly used as reference to set the value of a vehicle. The fair value of real state and vehicles are classified in levels 2 and 3 depending on the observability and significance of the inputs used in the valuation techniques according to the hierarchy established by IFRS 13.\n\nTo determine the suitability of appraiser's selection, there are internal guidelines to be fulfilled related to independence, professional certification, reputation and experience. In a similar way, to validate the appraisal's suitability, the bank has defined guidelines based on current regulations which are related to methodologies, report quality and commercial value.",

The carrying amount of such financial assets is COP 206,871 as at December 31, 2022 and COP 204,268 as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Foreclosed assets and other credit mitigants\n\nAssets received in lieu of payment (foreclosed assets) are recognized on the statement of financial position when current possession of the asset takes place.\n\nForeclosed assets such as immovable and movable property, equity securities and other financial assets, are received based on a commercial valuation, and their net realizable value is given by a specialized team.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank entered into non-cash operating and investing activities related to restructured loans and returned properties that were transferred to assets held for sale and inventories amounting to COP 1,361,465 and COP 889,752, respectively.\n\nThe Bank classifies foreclosed assets after acknowledgment of the exchange operation according to the intention of use, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-current assets held for sale.\n- \u00b7 Other marketable assets.\n- \u00b7 Other non-marketable assets.\n- \u00b7 Inventories.\n\nCollateral classified as non-current assets held for sale are those expected to be sold in the following 12 months. When there are market restrictions that do not allow their realization in less than 12 months and this period is extended, retroactive depreciation must be charged to results and the asset value will be reduced by the depreciation value.\n\nForeclosed assets classified as non-current assets held for sale are those expected to be sold in the following 12 months. The non-current assets held for sale that cease to comply with the guidelines of immediately sell, must be classified as 'Other marketable assets' and if it's necessary, their book value would be adjusted.",

Credit Risk Management - Other Financial Instruments:\n\nEach one of the positions that make up the portfolio complies with the policies and limits that seek to diminish credit risk exposure. Those policies are, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Term Limits: The  Credit  Committee  evaluates  and  reviews  the  result  of  the  authorized  model  for  the  different counterparties according to quantitative and qualitative variables, allowing it to establish the maximum term to which the Bank wishes to have exposure..\n- \u00b7 Credit Limits: Approved limits under the model and with authorization from the Credit Committee, as well as the exposure, are monitored in line or batch, in such a way as to mitigate the occurrence of excesses and, in the event that there is a need for them, applies to the current attribution system..\n- \u00b7 Counterparty Limits: These limits, derived from the credit limits or from allocation models and are verified by the Front Office prior to the close of operations.\n- \u00b7 Master Agreement: These bilateral agreements describe the handling of operations between the counterparties in accordance with good international practices and that limit the legal and financial risk under the occurrence of events of default (failure to pay or delivery). Mitigation mechanisms, procedures to be carried out in the case of these events of default, special conditions by type of operation and that are applied to OTC derivatives, Repos and other securities financing transactions, are all agreed upon.\n- \u00b7 Margin Agreements: For OTC derivatives operations and other securities financing transactions, agreements that regulate the administration of guarantees, haircuts, adjustment periods, minimum transfer amounts, etc., and that limit risk for a period of time (one day, one week, etc.), are established for counterparties involved in the operation.\n- \u00b7 Counterparty Alerts: There are financial, qualitative and market indicators that allow the Bank to establish damages to the credit quality of an issuer or counterparty.\n\n## f.     Credit Quality Analysis - investment financial instruments:\n\nIn order to evaluate the credit quality of a counterparty or issuer (to determine a risk level or profile), the Bank relies on two rating systems: an external one and an internal one, both of which allow to identify a degree of risk differentiated by segment and country and to apply the policies that have been established for issuers or counterparties with different levels of risk, in order to limit the impact on liquidity and/or the income statement of the Bank.\n\nExternal credit rating system is  divided  by  the  type  of  rating  applied  to  each  instrument  or  issuer;  in  this  way  the geographic location, the term and the type of instrument allow the assignment of a rating according to the methodology that each examining agency uses.\n\nInternal credit rating system: the 'ratings or risk profiles' scale is created with a range of levels that go from low risk to  high  risk  (this  can  be  reported  in  numerical  or  alphanumerical  scales),  where  the  rating  model  is  sustained  by  the implementation  and  analysis  of  qualitative  and  quantitative  variables  at  sector  level,  which  according  to  the  relative analysis of each variable, determine credit quality; in this way the internal credit rating system aims to establish adequate margin in decision-making regarding the management of financial instruments.",

This company acts on behalf of Bancolombia for making international margin calls and providing a better management of the collateral.\n\nCollateral adjustments for margin agreements: the adjustments will be determined by the criteria applied by both the external and internal regulations in effect, and at the same time, mitigation standards are maintained so that the operation fulfills the liquidity and solidity criteria for settlement. Among the main characteristics by product or market, we have:\n\n- -With respect to the derivative operations, these are carried out daily, with threshold levels of zero for the majority of counterparties, which reduces the exposure to a term that does not exceed 10 days, according to Basel.\n- -For buy-sell backs, repos and other securities financing transactions, daily monitoring is done in order to establish the need to adjust the collateral in such a way that these are applied in as little time as possible, according to the contracts or market conditions.",

        "page_content": "In the International fixed income international market, there was a change in the monetary expansion posture with an increase in the interest rate by the Federal Reserve from 4.05% in December 2022 to 5.50% in July 2023, which was maintained until December 2023, an CPI control measure that closed at 3.4% for the US. The changes in monetary policy, the global economic recession and the resurgence of geopolitical tensions, deepen the risks of devaluation in some markets or the opportunities for appreciation in others.\n\nThe Colombian stock market closed December 2023 with an annual devaluation of (-7.07%), explained by several factors, among which are the uncertainty due to political tensions corresponding to the pension, health and energy reforms, in addition to the increase in the prices of products and the behavior of supply, which further drive the country's inflation rate upwards, with which, risks could materialize for the companies in this market until these effects are contained.\n\nThe international market closed by December with annual appreciation in the S&P 500 of (+24.23%) and in the Euro Stoxx 50 with annual appreciation of (+19.19%), however, fears of a possible economic recession continue, which as a consequence will affect the financial indicators of the companies in these markets, added to the volatility caused by the increase in military conflicts worldwide.\n\nNegotiation of the different derivative products as of 2023 increased vs 2022 due to increase in the negotiation of interest rate futures (+24.7%) and currency futures (+12.8%) as a consequence of a higher uncertainty regarding the behavior of the monetary policy rate and the behavior of the exchange rate. The USD/COP closed December at COP 3,822.05 with an annual appreciation of (+20.54%) for the Colombian peso.\n\nConcerning of a possible economic recession due to current global inflationary landscape, along with the rise in interest rates and geopolitical tensions, it is possible that records in these macroeconomic variables will be reached, influencing further devaluation of securities in the short and medium term; however, the central banks' measures are expected  to contain these macroeconomic effects that continue to negatively impact the markets.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk refers to the risk of losses in the Bank's treasury book due to changes in equity prices, interest rates, foreignexchange rates and other indicators whose values are set in a public market. It also refers to the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income and equity economic value of equity as a result of a change in market interest rates.\n\nMarket risk stems from the following activities at the Bank:\n\n- a) Trading: includes purchase - sale and positioning mainly in fixed income securities, equities, currencies and derivatives, as well as the financial services provided to customers, such as brokerage. Trading instruments are recorded  in  the  treasury  book  and  are  managed  by  the  Treasury  Division  which  is  also  responsible  for  the aggregated management of exchange rate exposures arising from the banking book and treasury book.\n- Market risk can also arise from the crypto market fluctuations that affect our crypto assets portafolio held in reserve to facilitate our clients activitivies of Wenia, our digital asset company in Bermudas, which is the only company in Grupo Bancolombia authorized to take this kind of assets, according to our internal policies.\n- b)    Balance sheet management: refers to the assets and liabilities management, due to mismatches in maturities and  repricing  of  them.  The  Assets  Liability  Management  Division  is  responsible  for  the  balance  sheet management, preserving the stability  of  the  financial  margin  and  the  economic  value  of  equity,  maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and solvency. Non-trading instruments are recorded in the Bank's banking book (the 'Banking Book'), which includes primarily loans, time deposits, checking accounts and savings accounts.\n\nIn the Bank, the market risks are identified, measured, monitored, controlled and reported in order to support the decisionmaking process for their mitigation, and to create greater shareholder value added.\n\nThe guidelines, policies and methodologies for market risks management are approved by the Board of Directors, thus guaranteeing the congruence and consistency in the risk appetite among subsidiaries. Each country has a local Market and",

        "page_content": "Liquidity  Risk  Management  Office  that  applies  at  an  individual  level  the  principles  of  the  Bank's  Market  Risks Management Strategy. The Board of Directors and senior management have formalized the policies, procedures, strategies and  rules  of  action  for  market  risk  administration  in  its  'Market  Risk  Manual'.  This  manual  defines  the  roles  and responsibilities within each subdivision of the Bank and their interaction to ensure adequate market risk administration.\n\nThe Bank's Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office, responsible for monitoring and permanently controlling compliance with the limits established, is set up with clear independence from the trading and businesses units, ensuring enforcement authority. This independent control function is complemented by regular reviews conducted by the Internal Audit.\n\nThe Bank's Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office is responsible for: (a) identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling the market risk inherent in the Bank's businesses: (b) the Bank's exposure under stress scenarios and confirming compliance with the Bank's risk management policies: (c) designing the methodologies for valuation of the market value of certain securities and financial instruments: (d) reporting to senior management and the Board of Directors any violation of the Bank's risk management policies: (e) reporting to the senior management on a daily basis the levels of market risk associated with the trading instruments recorded in its treasury book, and (f) proposing policies to the Board of  Directors  and  to  senior  management  that  ensure  the  maintenance  of predetermined risk  levels.  The  Bank  has  also implemented an approval process for new products across each of its subdivisions. This process is designed to ensure that each subdivision is prepared to incorporate the new product into its procedures, that every risk is considered before the product is incorporated and that approval is obtained from the Board of Directors before the new product can be sold.\n\nMarket  risks  arising  from  trading  instruments  are  measured  at  the  Bank  using  two  different  Value  at  Risk  (VaR) methodologies: the standard methodology required by the SFC, and the internal methodology of historical simulation. The standard  methodology  is  established  by  'Chapter  XXXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular',  based  on  the  model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee, and is reflected in  the  Bank's  Capital  Adequacy  (Solvency)  ratio.  The  internal  methodology of  weighted  historical  simulation  uses  a confidence level of 99%, a holding period of 10 days, and a time frame of one year or at least 250 days from the reference date of the VaR calculation is used, for digital assets the internal methodology uses a holding period of 3 days and a time frame of 4 years, using a multivariate GARCH family model. The standard methodology is used to report the market risk exposure to the Financial Superintendency and is also used to measure the capital requirements for the Bank, therefore the analysis below is based on information obtained from this model.\n\nThe Bank's VaR limits structure for trading activities, is sufficiently granular to conduct an effective control of the various types of market risk factors on which an exposure is held. It ensures that the market risk is not concentrated in certain asset classes and maximizes the portfolio diversification effect. These limits are defined by companies, products or by risk takers. The majority of the limits are based on the maximum VaR values to which a certain portfolio can be exposed, nevertheless, loss triggers, stop loss and sensitivity warning levels are also set, especially in the derivatives portfolios. The limits are approved by the Board of Directors, and set based on factors such as tolerance for losses, capital resources and market's complexity and volatility. They are monitored daily, and their excesses or violations are reported to the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee.\n\nIn  order  to  capture  the  tail  risks,  the  Expected  Shortfall  is  estimated,  with  a  confidence  interval  of  97.5%,  which corresponds to the expected value of the losses that are greater than or equal to the VaR.Additional measurements such as stress tests are performed, to identify extreme unusual situations that could cause severe losses. Stress simulations include historical events and hypothetical scenarios. Back testing or model validation techniques through comparison of predicted and actual loss level are applied on a regular basis to analyze and contrast the accuracy of the VaR calculation methodology in order to confirm its reliability, and make adjustments to the models if necessary.\n\nWithin the control and monitoring processes of market risks, reports are elaborated on a daily and monthly basis. They include an analysis of the most relevant risk measures and allow for monitoring the exposure levels to market risks and to the legal and internal limits established for each one of the levels of the Bank. These reports are taken as an input for the decision-making process in the different Committees and management of the Bank.",

        "page_content": "For management and control of the market risks of activities other than trading, the Bank uses a comprehensive approach, with a short-term vision, measuring the sensitivity of the net interest margin over a one-year horizon, and a long-term vision, estimating the impact on the economic value of equity through different scenarios. Additionally, triggers are defined for  monitoring and controling exposure to the interest rate risk of the banking book positions, which are periodically reported to Senior Management..\n\nThe market risk management of the positions in the banking book is carried out in a decentralized and independent manner in each of the banking entities of the Bank, by the Asset and Liability Management areas, in the Finance Department.\n\n## Market Risk Management\n\nThe following section describes the market risks to which the Bank is exposed and the tools and methodologies used to measure these risks as of December 31, 2023. The Bank faces market risk as a consequence of its lending, trading and investments businesses.\n\nThe Bank uses VaR calculation to limit its exposure to the market risk of its Treasury Book. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR based on its assessment of the appropriate level of risk for Bancolombia. The Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR for each company and the Propietary Trading Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR by type of investment. These limits are supervised on a daily basis by the Market Risk Management Office.\n\nFor managing the interest rate risk from banking activities, the Bank analyzes the interest rate mismatches between its interest  earning  assets  and  its  interest  bearing  liabilities  and  estimates  the  impact  on  the  net  interest  income  and  the economic value of equity. In addition, the foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the banking book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## a.     Measurement of market risk of trading instruments\n\nThe Bank currently measures the treasury book exposure to market risk (including OTC derivatives positions) as well as the currency risk exposure of the banking book, which is provided to the Treasury Division, using a VaR methodology established in accordance with 'Chapter XXXI of the Basic Accounting Circular', issued by the SFC.\n\nThe  VaR  methodology  established  by  'Chapter  XXXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular'  is  based  on  the  model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee, which focuses on the treasury book and excludes investments classified as amortized cost which are not being given as collateral and any other investment that comprises the banking book, such as non-trading positions excluding the currency the risk position stemming from investment in affiliated but not consolidated entities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the methodology aggregates all risks by the use of correlations, through an allocation system based on defined zones and bands, affected by given sensitivity factors.\n\nThe total market risk for the Bank is calculated by the arithmetical aggregation of the VaR calculated for each subsidiary. The aggregated VaR is reflected in the Bank's Capital Adequacy (Solvency) ratio, in accordance with Decree 2555 de 2010.\n\nFor purposes of VaR calculations, a risk exposure category is any market variable that is able to influence potential changes in the portfolio value. Taking into account a given risk exposure, the VaR model assesses the maximum loss not exceeded, over a given period of time. The fluctuations in the portfolio's VaR depend on volatility, modified duration and positions changes relating to the different instruments that are subject to market risk.\n\nThe relevant risk exposure categories for which VaR is computed by the Bank according to 'Chapter XXXI, Appendix VI of the Basic Accounting Circular' are: (i) interest rate risks relating to local currency, foreign currency and UVR; (ii) currency risk; (iii) stock price risk; (iv) fund risk. and (v) credit default swaps risk.",

The Bank calculates the interest rate risk for positions in local currency, foreign currency and UVR separately; in accordance with Chapter XXXI of the Basic Accounting Circular issued by the SFC.\n\nIn the first instance, the interest rate risk exposure is determined by the sensitivity calculation for the net position of each instrument. This sensitivity is calculated as the net present value (NPV) of each instrument, its corresponding modified duration and the estimated variation of interest rates. The possible variations in the interest rates are established by the SFC according to the historical behavior of these variables in the markets, and they are a function of the duration and currency, as seen in the following table:\n\n|        |      | Modified Duration   | Modified Duration   | Changes in Interest Rates (bps)   | Changes in Interest Rates (bps)   | Changes in Interest Rates (bps)   |\n|--------|------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Zone   | Band | Lower Limit         | Upper Limit         | Legal Currency                    | UVR                               | Foreign Currency                  |\n| Zone 1 | 1    | 0                   | 0.08                | 274                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 1 | 2    | 0.08                | 0.25                | 268                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 1 | 3    | 0.25                | 0.5                 | 259                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n|        | 4    | 0.5                 | 1                   | 233                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 2 | 5    | 1                   | 1.9                 | 222                               | 250                               | 90                                |\n| Zone 2 | 6    | 1.9                 | 2.8                 | 222                               | 250                               | 80                                |\n| Zone 2 | 7    | 2.8                 | 3.6                 | 211                               | 220                               | 75                                |\n|        | 8    | 3.6                 | 4.3                 | 211                               | 220                               | 75                                |\n|        | 9    | 4.3                 | 5.7                 | 172                               | 200                               | 70                                |\n|        | 10   | 5.7                 | 7.3                 | 162                               | 170                               | 65                                |\n| Zone 3 | 11   | 7.3                 | 9.3                 | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n|        | 12   | 9.3                 | 10.6                | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n|        | 13   | 10.6                | 12                  | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n|        | 14   | 12                  | 20                  | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n|        | 15   | 20                  |                     | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n\nOnce the sensitivity factor is calculated for each position, the modified duration is then used to classify each position within its corresponding band. A net sensitivity is then calculated for each band, by determining the difference between the sum of all long-positions and the sum of all short-positions. Then a net position is calculated for each zone (which consists of a series of bands) determined by the SFC. The final step is to make adjustments within each band, across bands and within each zone, which results in a final number that is the interest rate risk VaR by currency. Each adjustment is performed following the guidelines established by the SFC.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to interest risk primarily arises from investments in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES).\n\n## \u00b7 Currency (Treasury and Banking Book), Equity (Treasury Book) and Fund (Treasury Book) Risk\n\nThe VaR model uses a sensitivity factor to calculate the probability of loss due to fluctuations in the price of stocks, funds and currencies in which the Bank maintains a position. As previously indicated, the methodology used in these financial statements to measure such risk consists of computing VaR, which is derived by multiplying the position by the maximum probable variation in the price of such positions ('\u2206p'). The ('\u2206p') is determined by the SFC, as shown in the following table:\n\n| Currency             | Sensitivity Factor   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|\n| United States Dollar | 12.49 %              |\n| Euro                 | 11.00 %              |\n| Other currencies     | 13.02 %              |\n| Equity and Fund Risk | 14.70 %              |",

Currently, the Bank not present exposure to credit default swaps risk.\n\nThe total market risk VaR had a  22.9% increase, from COP 891,569 in December 31, 2022 to COP 1,096,000 as of December 31, 2023. This increase was highlighted by the currency risk VaR, driven by an increase in exposure to the US Dollar  for  Bancolombia's  book.  The  interest  rate  risk  arise  as  a  result  of  the  increase  in  the  position  in  Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES). The equity risk VaR registered a higer risk level and the fund risk VaR registered a lower risk level driven by the detailed risk analysis of the Fund Colombia Inmobiliario that generated a reassign of the market risk factors exposure. This change does not imply an impact on the Bank's exposure as the sensitivity factors are the same.\n\nThe following table presents the total change in market risk and other risk factors.\n\n| December 2023                  | December 2023      | December 2023      | December 2023      | December 2023      |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| In millions of COP             | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| Factor                         | December 31        | Average            | Maximum            | Minimum            |\n| Interest Rate Risk VaR         | 405,467            | 418,472            | 542,464            | 383,914            |\n| Foreign Exchange Rate Risk VaR | 332,662            | 185,624            | 374,407            | 51,410             |\n| Equity Risk VaR                | 342,024            | 332,443            | 347,539            | 312,136            |\n| Fund Risk VaR                  | 15,847             | 23,292             | 27,923             | 15,847             |\n| Total Value at Risk            | 1,096,000          | 959,831            |                    |                    |\n\n| December 2022                  | December 2022      | December 2022      | December 2022      | December 2022      |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| In millions of COP             | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| Factor                         | December 31        | Average            | Maximum            | Minimum            |\n| Interest Rate Risk VaR         | 340,107            | 381,094            | 410,605            | 340,107            |\n| Foreign Exchange Rate Risk VaR | 78,165             | 118,620            | 201,927            | 78,165             |\n| Equity Risk VaR                | 85,345             | 98,401             | 105,263            | 85,345             |\n| Fund Risk VaR                  | 387,952            | 294,468            | 387,952            | 225,401            |\n| Total Value at Risk            | 891,569            | 892,583            |                    |                    |\n\n## \u00b7 Assumptions and Limitations of VaR Models\n\nAlthough VaR models represent a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as predictive of future results. The Bank may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by the Bank's VaR models. A VaR model does not calculate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the reasonable judgment of the Bank's risk management personnel.\n\n## \u00b7 The Bank's results could adversely affected with high inflation rate\n\nHigh level of inflation increases interest rates and reduces the market value of the Bank's debt instruments and increases the market risk in general. Inflation also impacts the real interest rate. When the inflation rate is higher than the nominal interest rate, negative real interest rates discourage saving and the greater variability increases uncertainty and risk, not only in the loan market but also in the stock market.",

Non-trading instruments market risk measurement\n\nThe banking book's relevant risk exposure is interest rate risk, which is the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income or in the economic value of equity as a result of a change in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the Bank's earnings because of timing differences on the repricing of the assets and liabilities. The Bank manages the interest rate risk arising from banking activities in non-trading instruments by analyzing the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities, and estimates the impact on the net interest income and  the  economic  value  of  equity.  The  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  exposures  arising  from  the  banking  book  are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## \u00b7 Interest Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nThe Bank has performed a sensitivity analysis of market risk sensitive instruments estimating the impact on the net interest income of each position in the Banking Book, using a repricing model and assuming positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points (bps).\n\nThe table 1 provides information about Bancolombia's interest rate sensitivity for the statement of financial position items comprising the Banking Book.\n\nThe  chart  below  provides  information  about  Bancolombia's  interest  rate  risk  sensitivity  in  local  currency  (COP)  at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\nTable 1.

A negative sensitivity denotes a higher sensitivity of liabilities than of assets and implies that a rise in interest rates will negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. In the event of a decrease in interest rates, the impacts on net interest income would be opposite to those described above.\n\n## Total Exposure:\n\nThe net interest income sensitivity in local currency for the banking book instruments, entered for other than trading purposes with positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points was COP 557,033. The variation in the sensitivity of the net interest margin between December 2022 and December 2023 is  due to the increase in the floating loans compensated by the increase in the fixed time deposits.",

These positions are maintained mostly in the industrial and financial sectors. The market value of those investments decreased by 27.4% during the year, from COP 56,607 million as of December 31, 2022 to COP 41,096 million as of December 31, 2023, mainly, as a result of the reduction in the market value of the investments in Enka Shares.\n\nThe structural equity positions are exposed to market risk. Sensitivity calculations are made for those positions:\n\n|             |         | December 31, 2023    December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------|---------|------------------------------------------|\n| Fair Value  | 41,096  | 56,607                                   |\n| Delta       | 14.70 % | 14.70 %                                  |\n| Sensitivity | 6,041   | 8,321                                    |\n\nA negative impact of 14.7%, applied to the market value, produces a decrease of COP 6 billion in the structural equity investments market value, from COP 41 billion to COP 35 billion.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the inability of a financial firm to meet its debt obligations without incurring unacceptably large losses. Thus, funding liquidity risk is the risk that a firm will not be able to meet its current and future cash flow and collateral  needs,  both  expected  and  unexpected,  without  materially  affecting  its  daily  operations  or  overall  financial condition. The Bank is sensitive to funding liquidity risk since debt maturity transformation is one of its key business areas.\n\nAt the Bank, liquidity prevails over any objective of growth or revenue. Managing liquidity has always been a fundamental pillar of its business strategy, together with capital, in supporting its statement of financial position.\n\nThe Bank's liquidity management model promotes the autonomy of subsidiaries, which must be self-sufficient in their structural funding. Each subsidiary is responsible for meeting the liquidity needs of its current and future activity, within a framework of management coordination at the Bank level. The metrics used to control liquidity risk are developed based on common and homogeneous concepts, but analysis and adaptation are made by each subsidiary.\n\nIn line with best governance practices, the Bank has established a clear division of function between executing liquidity management, responsibility of the Asset and Liability Division, and their monitoring and control, responsibility of the Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office.\n\nThe different  authorities  of  senior  management  define  the  policies  and  guidelines  for  managing  liquidity  risk.  These authorities are the Board of Directors, the Risk Committee, and senior management of the Parent Company, which set the risk appetite and define the financial strategy. The ALCO committees (Asset and liability committee) define the objective positioning of liquidity and the strategies that ensure the funding needs derived from businesses. The ALM division (Asset",

All of the above activities are verified and evaluated by the Internal Audit.\n\nThe measures to control liquidity risk include maintaining a portfolio of highly liquid assets, and the definition of triggers and liquidity limits, which enable evaluating the level of exposure of each one of the entities in a proactive way.\n\nThe methodologies used to control liquidity risk include the liquidity gaps and stress scenarios. The liquidity gaps measure the mismatches of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet position's cash flows, separately for local currency and foreign currency. Regulatory metrics are also applied, in which the contractual maturities are used; and internal models in which the cash flows are adjusted by different ratios, to reflect a more accurate behaviour.\n\nPeriodically, a validation of the policies, limits, processes, methodologies and tools to evaluate liquidity risk exposure is performed, in order to establish its pertinence and functionality, and to carry out the necessary adjustments. The Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office elaborate reports daily, weekly and monthly basis in order to monitor the exposure levels and the limits and triggers set up, and to support the decision-making process.\n\nEach subsidiary has its own liquidity contingency plan, which is tested annually. These contingency plans procure the optimization of different funding sources, including obtaining additional funding from the Parent Company.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Bank's Board of Directors sets the strategy for managing liquidity risk and delegates responsibility for oversight of the implementation of this policy to ALCO committee that approves the Bank's liquidity policies and procedures. The Treasury Division manages the Bank's liquidity position on a day-to-day basis and reviews daily reports covering the liquidity position. A summary report, including any exceptions and remedial action taken, is submitted regularly to Risk Committee and ALCO committees.\n\n## a.     Liquidity risk exposure:\n\nIn order to estimate liquidity risk, the Bank measures a liquidity coverage ratio to ensure holding liquid assets sufficient to cover potential net cash outflows over 30 days. This indicator allows the Bank to meet liquidity coverage for the next month. The liquidity coverage ratio is presented as follows:\n\n| Liquidity Coverage Ratio       |            | December 31, 2023    December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Net cash outflows into 30 days | 13,752,496 | 18,227,019                               |\n| Liquid Assets                  | 50,680,823 | 48,059,179                               |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio **    | 368.52 %   | 263.67 %                                 |\n\n## b.     Liquid Assets\n\nOne of the main guidelines of the Bank is to maintain a solid liquidity position, therefore, the ALCO Committee, has established a minimum level of liquid assets, based on the funding needs of each subsidiary, to ensure, as far as possible, that  it  will  always  have  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  its  liabilities  when  they  are  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Bank's reputation.",

In addition, the transition process to an alternative reference rate could impact the Bank's business, financial condition or result of operations, as a result of:\n\n- \u00b7 An adverse impact in pricing, liquidity, value, return and trading for a broad array of financial products, loans and derivatives that are included in the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Extensive changes to internal processes and documentation that contain references to LIBOR or use formulas that depend on LIBOR.",

In turn, as an organization, we will continue to focus during 2024 on the transition process of operations that are indexed to LIBOR.\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe Capital Management function oversees Shareholders' equity and Bancolombia's capital structure, aiming for value generation through businesses related to financial activities and investments.\n\nThe goal is to have the enough capital to cover unexpected losses, and develope the business plan. To do so, the Capital and Corporate Investments area oversees Bancolombia's capital ratios and uses several mechanisms to optimize such ratios according to forecasted business conditions.\n\nThe monitoring of corporate investments and shareholders' equity, as well as different components of assets and associated risks, is executed for internal and external purposes. The results are presented to the Board of Directors and some support committees to make sure that all risks are properly managed and within risks appetite, guidelines, and regulation.\n\nBancolombia's management has the goal of maintaining the balance between an adequate capital allocation and value generation for shareholders. This way, business opportunities can be financed with internal funding or capital markets resources.\n\nBancolombia's lending and deposit-taking activities are supervisor by the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia, and that implies complying with Decree 1477 of 2018.\n\nThis decree standardized the definitions of regulatory capital according to Basel III standards. It also updated the risk adjusted capital consumption of assets and added capital buffers. New capital measures will be implemented from the current 4.5% basic solvency level and the 9% total solvency level.\n\nAdditionally, Bancolombia conducts stress test to estimate how the bank's balance sheet, results and ratios during adverse scenarios. None of the stress test runs implies reaching solvency ratios below regulatory levels and therefore, we consider that capital levels are optimal at the end of 2023.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2024, after the complete implementation of the new capital standards, a minimum basic capital of 6% and a total capital ratio of 11.5% will be required, according to the following formulas::\n\n\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c  = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f 1 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc34+ 100 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 + 100 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc43\n\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f 1 + \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f 1 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc34+ 100 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 + 100 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc43 \u2265 6%\n\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc34+ 100 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc40 + 100 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc43 \u2265 11.5%\n\n9 9 \u2265 4.5% 9 9 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 9 9",
