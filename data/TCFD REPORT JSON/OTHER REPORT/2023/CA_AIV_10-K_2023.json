        "page_content": "## EXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nApartment  Investment  and  Management  Company  (\"Aimco\"  or  \"the  Company\"),  a  Maryland  corporation,  is  a  selfadministered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. On December 15, 2020, Aimco completed the separation of  its  businesses  (the  \"Separation\"),  creating  two,  separate  and  distinct,  publicly  traded  companies,  Aimco  and  Apartment Income REIT Corp. ('AIR') (Aimco and AIR together, as they existed prior to the Separation, \"Aimco Predecessor\"). Events noted in this filing as occurring before December 15, 2020, were those entered into by Aimco Predecessor.\n\nAimco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the general partner and directly is the special limited partner of Aimco OP L.P.  (\"Aimco Operating Partnership\"). As of December 31, 2023, Aimco owned 92.4% of the legal interest in the common partnership units  of Aimco Operating Partnership and 94.8% of the economic interest in Aimco Operating Partnership. The remaining 7.6% legal interest is owned by limited partners. The common partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership are referred to as \"OP Units\". As the sole general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, Aimco has exclusive control of Aimco Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nAimco Operating Partnership holds all of Aimco's assets and manages the daily operations of Aimco's business. Pursuant to the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement , Aimco is required to contribute to Aimco Operating Partnership all proceeds from the offerings of its securities. In exchange for the contribution of such proceeds, Aimco receives additional interests in Aimco Operating Partnership with similar terms (e.g., if Aimco contributes proceeds of a stock offering, Aimco receives partnership units with terms substantially similar to the stock issued by Aimco).\n\nThis filing combines the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, of Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership. Where it is important to distinguish between the two entities, we refer to them specifically. Otherwise, references to 'we,' 'us,' or 'our' mean, collectively, Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated entities.\n\nWe believe combining the periodic reports of Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 We present our business as a whole, in the same manner our management views and operates the business;\n- \u00b7 We eliminate  duplicative  disclosure  and  provide  a  more  streamlined  and  readable  presentation  because  a  substantial portion of the disclosures apply to both Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership; and\n- \u00b7 We save time and cost through the preparation of a single combined report rather than two separate reports.\n\nWe operate Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership as one enterprise; the management of Aimco directs the management and operations of Aimco Operating Partnership; and Aimco OP GP, LLC, Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner, is managed by Aimco.\n\nWe believe it is important to understand the few differences between Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership in the context of how Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. Aimco has no assets or liabilities other than its investment in Aimco Operating Partnership. Also, Aimco is a corporation that issues publicly traded equity from time to time, whereas Aimco Operating Partnership is a partnership that has no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from stock offerings by Aimco, which are contributed to Aimco Operating Partnership in exchange for additional limited partnership interests (of a similar type and in an amount equal to the shares of stock sold in the offering), Aimco Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by its business. These sources include Aimco Operating Partnership's working capital, net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities,  borrowings  under  its  revolving  credit  facility,  the  issuance  of  debt  and  equity securities, including additional partnership units, and proceeds received from the sale of real estate.\n\nEquity, partners' capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of Aimco and those of Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership held by entities other than Aimco are classified within partners' capital in Aimco Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Aimco's consolidated financial statements.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Aimco  and  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  this  report  provides: separate consolidated financial statements for Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership; a single set of consolidated notes to such  financial  statements  that  includes  separate  discussions  of  each  entity's  stockholders'  equity  or  partners'  capital,  and earnings per share or earnings per unit, as applicable; and a combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes discrete information related to each entity, where appropriate.",

Certain information included in this Annual Report contains or may contain information that is forwardlooking,  within  the  meaning  of  the  federal  securities  laws.  Forward-looking  statements  include  all  statements  that  are  not historical statements of fact and those regarding our intent, belief, or expectations. Words such as 'anticipate(s),' 'expect(s),' 'intend(s),' 'plan(s),' 'believe(s),' 'may,' 'will,' 'would,' 'could,' 'should,' 'seek(s)' and similar expressions, or the negative  of  these  terms,  are  intended  to  identify  such  forward-looking  statements.  The  forward-looking  statements  in  this Annual Report include, without limitation, statements regarding: our future plans and goals, including our pipeline investments and projects, our plans to eliminate certain near term debt maturities, our estimated value creation and potential, our timing, scheduling and budgeting, projections regarding lease growth, our plans to form joint ventures, our plans for new acquisitions or  dispositions,  our  strategic  partnerships  and  value  added  therefrom,  the  potential  for  adverse  economic  and  geopolitical conditions, which negatively impact our operations, including on our ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental  rate  and  property  operating  results;  the  effect  of  acquisitions,  dispositions,  developments,  and  redevelopments;  our ability to meet budgeted costs and timelines, and achieve budgeted rental rates related to our development and redevelopment investments; expectations regarding sales of our apartment communities and the use of proceeds thereof; the availability and cost of corporate debt; and our ability to comply with debt covenants, including financial coverage ratios.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on management's judgment as of this date, which is subject to risks and uncertainties  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  our  expectations,  including,  but  not  limited  to: geopolitical events which may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, and other macro-economic conditions, including,  among other things, rising interest rates and inflation, which heightens the impact of the other risks and factors described herein; real estate and operating risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in  the  markets in which we operate and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions, including the pace of job growth and the level of unemployment; the amount, location and quality of competitive new housing supply; the timing and effects of acquisitions, dispositions, developments and redevelopments; expectations regarding sales of apartment communities and the use of proceeds thereof; insurance risks, including the cost of insurance, and natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes; supply chain disruptions, particularly with respect to raw materials such as lumber, steel, and concrete; financing risks, including the availability and cost of financing; the risk that cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; the risk that earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants, including financial coverage ratios; legal and regulatory risks, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; the terms of laws and governmental regulations that affect us and interpretations of those laws and regulations; and possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of apartment communities presently owned by us.\n\nIn addition, our current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code') and depends on our ability to  meet  the  various  requirements  imposed  by  the  Code  through  actual  operating  results,  distribution  levels  and  diversity  of stock ownership.\n\nReaders should carefully review our financial statements and the notes thereto, as well as Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report and subsequent documents we file from time to time with the SEC. These risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\nAs used herein and except as the context otherwise requires, 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' refer to Apartment Investment and Management Company (which we refer to as Aimco), Aimco OP L.P. (which we refer to as Aimco Operating Partnership) and their consolidated subsidiaries, collectively.\n\nCertain financial and operating measures found herein and used by management are not defined under accounting principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  ('GAAP').  These  measures  are  defined  and  reconciled  to  the  most comparable GAAP measures under the Non-GAAP Measures heading.",

Aimco conducts all of its business and owns all of its assets through Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nOn December 15, 2020, we completed the Separation, creating two separate and distinct, publicly traded companies, Aimco and AIR.\n\nPlease refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion regarding our business segments.\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nOur mission is to make real estate investments, primarily focused on the multifamily sector within targeted U.S. markets, where outcomes are enhanced through our human capital and substantial value is created for investors, teammates, and the communities in which we operate.\n\nOur value proposition includes our:\n\n- \u00b7 Platform, consisting of a cohesive, talented, and tenured team with diverse real estate industry experience combined with a disciplined and proven investment process;\n- \u00b7 Diversified portfolio, consisting of $0.6 billion of in-process value-add investments, a pipeline of 13 million square feet of potential future development, a national portfolio of stabilized multifamily real estate and limited indirect and passive investments; and\n- \u00b7 Capital redeployment plan which includes the prudent recycling of capital, reallocating our equity to higher returning investments, and return of capital to stockholders when appropriate.\n\nOur  primary  goal  is  outsized  risk-adjusted  returns  and  accelerating  growth  for  our  stockholders.  We  are  focused  on providing  superior  total-return  performance  to  stockholders,  primarily  through  capital  appreciation  driven  by  accretive investment and active portfolio management over multi-year periods. We do not presently intend to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend, but may periodically pay dividends for REIT tax purposes or to return a portion of profits to stockholders.\n\nOur financial objectives are to create value and produce superior, asset level, risk-adjusted returns on equity as measured by the  investment  period  Internal  Rate  of  Return  ('IRR')  and  the  project-level  Multiple  on  Invested  Capital  ('MOIC').  We measure broader performance based on Net Asset value ('NAV') growth over time.\n\nOur capital allocation strategy was designed to leverage our investment platform and optimize risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders.\n\nWe target a balanced allocation, which includes investments in 'Value Add' and 'Opportunistic' multifamily real estate, primarily located in Southeast Florida, the Washington, D.C. Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range, plus investment in a geographically diversified portfolio of 'Core' and 'Core-Plus' apartment communities.\n\nIn addition, we currently hold select alternative assets, consisting primarily of indirect, real estate related debt and equity investments. We have reduced our allocation to these investments and plan to continue to significantly reduce our allocation over time.\n\nWe have policies in place that support our stated strategy, guide our investment allocations, and manage risk, including to hold at all times a sizeable portion of our net equity in stabilized cash-flowing assets and to require cash or committed credit necessary for completion of development and redevelopment projects prior to their commencement.\n\n## PART I",

        "page_content": "Given our stated strategy, it is expected that at any point in time the value-creation process will be ongoing at various of our investments. Over time, we expect our enterprise to produce superior returns on equity on a risk-adjusted basis and it is our plan to do so by:\n\n- \u00b7 Benefiting from a national platform while leveraging local and regional expertise\n\nWe have corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado and Washington, D.C. Our investment platform is managed by experienced professionals based in three regions, where we will focus our new investment activity: Southeast Florida, the Washington, D.C. Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range. By regionalizing this platform, we are able to leverage the  in-depth  local  market  knowledge  of  each  regional  leader,  creating  a  comparative  advantage  when  sourcing, evaluating, and executing investment opportunities.\n\n- \u00b7 Managing and investing in value-add and opportunistic real estate\n\nOur  dedicated  team  will  source  and  execute  development  and  redevelopment  projects,  and  various  other  direct investment strategies. Our development and redevelopment portfolio currently includes projects in construction and lease-up. In addition, our team has secured significant, high-quality, future development opportunities, including total potential of 13 million square feet, located in high-growth markets. Generally, we seek direct investment opportunities in locations where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined and where we have a comparative advantage over others in the market. From time to time, we may choose to monetize certain pipeline assets prior to vertical construction in an effort to maximize value and risk adjusted returns. In any time period, the amount of our capital that is allocated to development activities may vary based on market conditions and other factors.\n\n## \u00b7 Owning a portfolio of stabilized core and core plus real estate\n\nOur entire portfolio of operating properties includes 26 apartment communities (22 consolidated properties and four unconsolidated properties) with average rents in line with local market averages (generally defined as B class). We also own one commercial office building that is part of an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building. The target composition  of  our  stabilized  portfolio  will  continue  to  include  primarily  B  multifamily  assets,  spread  across geographically diversified markets, with a bias toward long established residential neighborhoods that rank highly in regard  to  schools,  employment  fundamentals  and  state  and  regional  governance.  Core-Plus  opportunities  offer  the opportunity for incremental capital investment while maintaining stabilized cashflow to accelerate income growth and improve asset values.\n\n- \u00b7 Managing and continuing to reduce our allocation to alternative investments, over time\n\nWe currently hold select alternative investments, the majority of which originated with Aimco Predecessor and, over time,  plan  to  significantly  reduce  capital  allocated  to  these  investments.  Our  current  allocation  to  alternative investments  includes:  our  mezzanine  loan  to  the  Parkmerced  partnership,  which  owns  3,165  apartment  homes  and future development rights in San Francisco, California, and our passive equity investments in IQHQ, Inc. ('IQHQ'), a privately-held life sciences real estate development company, and in property technology funds consisting of entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry.\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining sufficient liquidity and utilizing safe financial leverage\n\nWe will guard our liquidity at all times by maintaining sufficient cash and committed credit.\n\nFrom time-to-time, we will allocate capital to financial assets designed to mitigate risks. Existing examples include our use of interest rate caps to provide protection against increases in interest rates on in-place loans.\n\nWe expect to capitalize our activities through a combination of non-recourse property debt, construction loans, thirdparty equity, and the recycling of our equity, including retained earnings. We plan to limit the use of recourse leverage, with a strong preference towards non-recourse property-level debt to limit risk to our enterprise. When warranted, we plan  to  seek  equity  capital  from  joint  venture  partners  to  improve  our  cost  of  capital,  further  leverage  our  equity, reduce exposure to a single investment and, in certain cases, for strategic benefits.",

        "page_content": "## Competition\n\nThere are many developers, managers, and owners of apartment real estate and underdeveloped land, as well as REITs, private  real  estate  companies,  and  investors,  that  compete  with  us  in  acquiring,  developing,  obtaining  financing  for,  and disposing  of  apartment  communities.  This  competition  affects  our  ability  to  realize  our  real  estate  development  and transactional objectives.\n\nIn  addition,  our  apartment  communities  compete  for  residents  with  other  housing  alternatives,  including  other  rental apartments and condominiums, and single-family homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and  single-family  homes  for  sale.  Competitive  residential  housing,  as  well  as  household  formation  and  job  creation  in  a particular area, could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates.\n\n## Taxation\n\n## Aimco\n\nAimco has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), commencing with its initial taxable year, and intends to continue to operate in such a manner. The Code imposes various requirements related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income that must be met in order to continue to qualify as a REIT. If Aimco continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it will generally not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is currently distributed  to  stockholders.  This  treatment  substantially  eliminates  the  'double  taxation'  (at  the  corporate  and  stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.\n\nCertain of our operations, or a portion thereof, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a 'TRS'. A TRS is a corporate subsidiary that has elected to be a TRS instead of a REIT and, as such, is subject to United States federal corporate income tax.\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nAimco Operating Partnership is treated as a 'pass-through' entity for United States federal income tax purposes and is not subject to United States federal income taxation. Partners in Aimco Operating Partnership, however, are subject to tax on their allocable  share  of  partnership  income,  gains,  losses,  deductions,  and  credits,  regardless  of  whether  the  partners  receive  any actual  distributions  of  cash  or  other  property  from  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  during  the  taxable  year.  Generally,  the characterization of any particular item is determined by Aimco Operating Partnership rather than at the partner level, and the amount of  a  partner's  allocable  share  of  such  item  is  governed  by  the  terms  of Aimco  Operating  Partnership's  Partnership Agreement. Aimco Operating Partnership is subject to tax in certain states.\n\n## Regulation\n\n## General\n\nApartment  development  is  subject  to  various  laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations,  including  those  concerning  entitlement, building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, and sales, and similar matters apply to or affect the real estate development industry.\n\nApartment communities and their owners are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including those related to real estate broker licensing and regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, activity centers, and other common areas.\n\nChanges in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on communities or increasing the restrictions  on  discharges  or  other  conditions,  as  well  as  changes  in  laws  affecting  development,  construction,  and  safety requirements, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows from operating activities.\n\nIn addition, existing rent control laws, as well as future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws, or other laws and ordinances regulating multifamily housing, may reduce rental revenue or increase operating costs in particular markets.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental\n\nVarious federal, state, and local laws subject real estate owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present. These materials may include lead-based paint, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, and petroleum-based fuels. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such materials. In connection with the ownership of real estate, we could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our real estate, whether currently owned, acquired in the future, or owned in the past. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors .\n\n## Corporate Responsibility\n\nCorporate  responsibility  is  an  important  part  of  our  business.  As  with  all  other  aspects  of  our  business,  our  corporate responsibility program focuses on continuous improvement, to the benefit of our stockholders, our residents, our teammates, our communities, and the environment. We actively discuss these matters with our stockholders and solicit their feedback on our program.\n\n## Environmental, Social, Governance Policies\n\nWe  update  our  Environmental,  Social,  Governance  (\"ESG\")  policies  and  publish  a  Corporate  Responsibility  Report reflecting our ESG priorities and performance on an annual basis.\n\nWe  remain  committed  to  providing  best-in-class  living  environments  that  mitigate  risk  while  reducing  environmental impacts and creating value. Our ESG policies are in place to guide this commitment and are applicable to all new construction, existing assets, and corporate operations. These policies are also taken into consideration when hiring suppliers and procuring materials.\n\n## Human Capital and Culture\n\nWe believe  our  most  valuable  asset  is  our  human  capital,  and  are  committed  to  fostering,  cultivating,  and  preserving  a welcoming and inclusive culture for all teammates. Our success is reliant on the collective sum of individual talents.\n\nWe continuously invest in our teammates and company culture to ensure employee satisfaction, health, and well-being.\n\nWe hire and promote employees based upon their unique experiences, abilities, talents, and drive. This naturally leads to a workforce rich with diverse backgrounds and perspectives, leading to improved outcomes.\n\nWe focus on succession planning and talent development to produce a strong, stable team that is the foundation of our success. We are responsible for and implement succession planning in all leadership positions, both in the short term and the long term.\n\nWe offer benefits and support reinforcing our emphasis on the health and well-being of our teammates, including 16 weeks of paid time for parental leave to new mothers and fathers, a longstanding policy of workplace flexibility for our teammates to attend to personal and family matters during the workweek, office environments focused on natural light and ergonomic office furniture  including  adjustable  height  desks,  access  to  Company-provided  healthy  snacks  and  drinks,  paid  time  annually  to volunteer in local communities, and a bonus structure at all levels of the organization.\n\nWe evaluate team engagement and retention and include those in our goals on which all teammates are compensated. Every teammate is surveyed annually via a third-party confidential survey. The teammate engagement score consists of the average of the responses to the questions that comprise the engagement index, on a scale of 1 to 5, for all teammates who complete the survey during the year. Our overall team engagement score for the 2023 Annual Lifecycle Surveys was 4.74, with a 100% overall response rate, compared to the target score of 4.25.\n\nAs of  December  31,  2023,  we  had  61  full-time  teammates  performing  asset  management,  development  or  transactional services and managing corporate and area functions. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.\n\nIn 2023, we were recognized with Healthiest Employers Awards in South Florida, Washington, D.C., and Denver, ranking #1 in our category for South Florida and #2 in our category for Colorado and Washington, D.C. The Healthiest Employers Awards  honor  companies  with  policies  and  initiatives  promoting  the  health  and  well-being  of  their  employees.  Healthiest Employers takes a holistic view of worksite health, evaluating the extent of leadership team buy-in, including how well they understand the needs of the employee population and how they proactively support well-being.",

The information contained on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nThe risk  factors  noted  in  this  section,  and  other  factors  noted  throughout  this Annual  Report,  describe  certain  risks  and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS\n\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises and dislocations in the financial and credit markets could affect our ability to collect rents and late fees from tenants, and our ability to evict tenants, in addition to having other negative effects on our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions, local, regional, national, or international health crises and dislocations in the credit  markets  could  negatively  impact  our  tenants  and  our  operations.  The  occurrence  of  regional  epidemics  or  a  global pandemic, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. These conditions also may add uncertainty to operations and may cause supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe effects of a health crisis, adverse economic or geopolitical events or dislocation in the financial and credit markets have negatively  impacted  or  would  negatively  impact  our  operations  or  those  of  entities  in  which  we  hold  a  partial  interest, including:\n\n- \u00b7 our ability to collect rents and late fees on a timely basis or at all, without reductions or other concessions;\n- \u00b7 our ability to evict residents for non-payment or for other reasons;\n- \u00b7 our ability to ensure business continuity in the event our continuity of operations plan is not effective or improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption;\n- \u00b7 fluctuations in regional and local economies, local real estate conditions, and rental rates;\n- \u00b7 interruptions in real estate development and redevelopment activities due to supply chain disruptions;\n- \u00b7 our ability to dispose of communities at all or on terms favorable to us; and\n- \u00b7 our ability to complete developments and redevelopments and other construction projects as planned.\n\nGiven the nature of the effects of a potential epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis, it remains challenging to predict the ultimate  impact  of  such  events  on  the  global  economy,  our  residents  and  commercial  tenants,  our  communities,  and  the operations of entities in which we hold an interest (including our economic interest in the partnership owning the 'Parkmerced Apartments').  Such  events,  depending  on  their  nature,  duration,  and  intensity,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our operating results and financial condition. An epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis also may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\n\n## Development, redevelopment, and construction risks could affect our profitability.\n\nDevelopment and redevelopment are subject to numerous risks, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 we  may  be  unable  to  obtain,  or  experience  delays  in  obtaining,  necessary  zoning,  occupancy,  or  other  required governmental  or  third-party  permits  and  authorizations,  which  could  result  in  increased  costs  or  the  delay  or abandonment of opportunities;\n- \u00b7 we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material, labor, or other factors and costs, such as those resulting from litigation, program changes, inflation, interest rate increases or supply chain disruptions;\n- \u00b7 we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of an apartment community on schedule, including as a result of global supply chain disruptions, resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues;",

If market volatility causes economic conditions to remain unpredictable or to trend downwards, we may not achieve our expected returns on properties under development and we could lose some or all of our investments in those properties. In addition, the lead time required to develop, construct, and lease-up a development property may increase, which could adversely impact our projected returns or result in a termination of the development project.\n\nIn addition, we may serve as either the construction manager or the general contractor for our development projects. The construction of real estate projects entails unique risks, including risks that the project will fail to conform to building plans, specifications,  and  timetables.  These  failures  could  be  caused  by  labor  strikes,  weather,  government  regulations,  and  other conditions beyond our control. In addition, we may become liable for injuries and accidents occurring during the construction process that are underinsured.\n\n## Failure to generate sufficient net operating income may adversely affect our liquidity, limit our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures, or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions.\n\nOur ability to fund necessary capital expenditures on our communities and make payments to our investors depends on, among other things, our ability to generate net operating income in excess of required debt payments and our ability to collect on interest and principal payments due to us. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures on our communities, we may not be able to preserve the competitiveness of our communities, which could adversely affect their net operating income and long-term value.\n\nOur net operating income and liquidity may be adversely affected by events or conditions beyond our control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the general economic climate;\n- \u00b7 an inflationary environment in which the costs to operate and maintain our communities increase at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents, which we can only do upon renewal of existing leases or at the inception of new leases;\n- \u00b7 competition from other apartment communities and other housing options;",

In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing affordability. Rising interest rates increase the borrowing costs on new debt and could affect fair value of our investments. In an inflationary environment, our cost of capital, labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline, which can have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.\n\nAlternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our real estate to decline. These, or other factors related to deflation, could have a negative impact on our business or financial results.\n\n## Our  ability  to  continue  to  grow  or  maintain  our  pipeline  of  development  and  redevelopment  opportunities  may  be constrained.\n\nWe source development and redevelopment opportunities through various means, including from our operating portfolio and property acquisitions. We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of properties compatible with our investment strategy. We may be unable to locate properties that will produce returns with a sufficient spread to our cost of capital.  The inability to source opportunities could impede our growth and could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Our properties are geographically concentrated in Florida, Chicago, and in the Northeast region of the United States, which makes  us  more  susceptible  to  regional  and  local  adverse  economic  and  other  conditions  than  if  we  owned  a  more geographically diversified portfolio.\n\nThe majority of our properties are located in Florida, Chicago, and in the Northeast region of the United States. As a result, we  are  particularly  susceptible  to  adverse  economic  or  other  conditions  in  these  markets  (such  as  periods  of  economic slowdown or recession, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases in real estate and  other  taxes,  and  the  cost  of  complying  with  governmental  regulations  or  increased  regulation),  as  well  as  to  natural disasters (including earthquakes, storms, and hurricanes), potentially adverse effects of 'global warming,' and other disruptions that occur in these markets (such as terrorist activity or threats of terrorist activity and other events), any of which may have a greater  impact  on  the  value  of  our  assets  or  on  our  operating  results  than  if  we  owned  a  more  geographically  diversified portfolio.\n\nWe cannot assure you that these markets will grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners, operators,  and  developers  of  multifamily,  retail,  or  office  assets,  or  future  development  assets.  Our  operations  may  also  be affected if competing assets are built in these markets. Moreover, submarkets within our core markets may be dependent upon a limited number of industries. Any adverse economic or other conditions, or any decrease in demand for office, multifamily, or retail assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Our  development  projects  may  subject  us  to  certain  liabilities,  and  we  are  subject  to  risks  associated  with  developing properties in partnership with others.\n\nWe  may  hire  and  supervise  third-party  contractors  to  provide  construction,  engineering,  and  various  other  services  for development projects. Certain of these contracts may be structured such that we are the principal rather than the agent. As a result, we may assume liabilities in the course of the project and be subjected to, or become liable for, claims for construction defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions by third parties we have engaged.",

        "page_content": "Adverse  outcomes  of  disputes  or  litigation  could  negatively  impact  our  business,  results  of  operations,  and  financial condition, particularly if we have not limited the extent of the damages for which we may be liable, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance that we carry. Moreover, our tenants may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because  of  our  role  even  if  we  have  technically  disclaimed  liability  as  a  legal  matter,  in  which  case  we  may  determine  it necessary to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the tenant or customer relationship or to protect our corporate brand. To the extent our tenants are obligated to reimburse us, acting as a principal may also mean that we pay a contractor before we have been reimbursed by our tenants. This exposes us to additional risks of collection in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, or a condominium purchaser default. The reverse can occur as well, where a contractor we have paid files for bankruptcy protection or commits fraud with the funds before completing a project that we have funded in part or in full.\n\nAdditionally, we use partnerships and limited liability companies to develop some of our real estate investments. Acting through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we typically will be the general partner or managing member in these partnerships or limited liability companies. There are, however, instances in which we may not control or even participate in management or day-to-day  operations  of  these  properties.  The  use  of  partnerships  and  limited  liability  companies  involve  special  risks associated with the possibility that:\n\n- \u00b7 a partner or member may have interests or goals inconsistent with ours;\n- \u00b7 a general partner or managing member may take actions contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives with respect to our real estate investments;\n- \u00b7 a  partner  or  member  could  experience  financial  difficulties  that  prevent  it  from  fulfilling  its  financial  or  other responsibilities to the project; or\n- \u00b7 a partner may not fulfill its contractual obligations.\n\nIn the event any of our partners or members file for bankruptcy, we could be precluded from taking certain actions affecting our project without bankruptcy court approval, which could diminish our control over the project even if we were the general partner or managing member. In addition, if the bankruptcy court were to discharge the obligations of our partner or member, it could result in our ultimate liability for the project being greater than originally anticipated.\n\nFurther, disputes between us and a partner may result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent our management from focusing their time and attention on our business.\n\nTo the extent we are a general partner, we may be exposed to unlimited liability, which may exceed our investment or equity in the partnership. If one of our subsidiaries is a general partner of a particular partnership, it may be exposed to the same kind of unlimited liability.\n\n## Development of properties may entail a lengthy, uncertain, and costly entitlement process.\n\nApproval  to  develop  real  property  sometimes  requires  political  support  and  generally  entails  an  extensive  entitlement process  involving  multiple  and  overlapping  regulatory  jurisdictions  and  often  requires  discretionary  action  by  local governments. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. We may incur substantial costs to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. An increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs, or in some cases cause us to determine that the property is not feasible for development. In addition, our competitors and local residents may challenge our efforts to obtain entitlements and permits for the development of properties. The process to comply with these regulations is usually lengthy and costly, may not result in the approvals we seek, and can be expected to materially affect our development activities.\n\n## Government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of the development of our communities, increase our expenses or limit our building of apartments or other activities.\n\nVarious local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning building, health and safety, site and building  design,  environment,  zoning,  sales,  and  similar  matters  apply  to  or  affect  the  real  estate  development  industry.  In addition,  our  ability  to  obtain  or  renew  permits  or  approvals  and  the  continued  effectiveness  of  permits  already  granted  or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state, and local policies, rules and regulations, and their interpretations and application.",

        "page_content": "Municipalities  may  restrict  or  place  moratoriums  on  the  availability  of  utilities,  such  as  water  and  sewer  taps.  If municipalities  in  which  we  operate  take  such  actions,  it  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business  by  causing  delays, increasing our costs, or limiting our ability to operate in those municipalities. These measures may reduce our ability to develop apartment  communities  and  to  build  and  sell  other  real  estate  development  projects  in  the  affected  markets,  including  with respect to land we may already own, and create additional costs and administration requirements, which in turn may harm our future sales, margins, and earnings.\n\nIn addition, there is a variety of legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state, and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct buildings. Such environmental laws may affect, for example, how we manage storm water runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and increase costs of compliance. In addition, it is possible that some form of expanded energy efficiency legislation may be passed by the U.S. Congress or federal agencies and certain state legislatures, which may, despite being phased in over time, significantly increase our costs of building apartment communities and the sale price to our buyers and adversely affect our sales volumes. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law.\n\nEnergy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened  with  expensive  cap  and  trade  and  similar  energy-related  taxes  and  regulations.  Our  noncompliance  with environmental  laws  could  result  in  fines  and  penalties,  obligations  to  remediate,  permit  revocations,  other  sanctions  and reputational harm.\n\nGovernmental regulation affects not only construction activities but also sales activities, mortgage lending activities, and other dealings with consumers. Further, government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews, or investigations of our business practices  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  which  can  cause  us  to  incur  costs  or  create  other disruptions in our business that can be significant. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.\n\n## Competition  could  limit  our  ability  to  lease  apartment  homes,  increase  or  maintain  rents  or  execute  our  development strategy.\n\nOur apartment communities compete for residents with other housing alternatives, including other rental apartments and condominiums,  and,  to  a  lesser  degree,  single-family  homes  that  are  available  for  rent,  as  well  as  new  and  existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing, as well as the lack of household formation and job creation in a particular area, could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates.\n\nIn addition, there are many developers, managers, and owners of apartment real estate and underdeveloped land, as well as REITs, private real estate companies, and investors, that compete with us, some of whom have greater financial resources and market share than us. If our competitors prevent us from realizing our real estate development objectives, our performance may fall short of our expectations and adversely affect our business.\n\n## Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to sell apartment communities or other assets when appropriate.\n\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. REIT tax rules also restrict our ability to sell apartment communities. Thus, we may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other market conditions. Our ability to dispose of apartment communities in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions, including the cost and availability of financing. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change may adversely affect our business.\n\nTo the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the costs of (or making unavailable) insurance on favorable terms, or at all, or requiring us to spend funds  to  repair  and  protect  our  properties  against  such  risks.  Should  the  impact  of  climate  change  be  material  in  nature, including significant property damage to or destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition  or  results  of  operations  may  be  adversely  affected.  In  addition,  changes  in  federal,  state  and  local  legislation  and regulations  based  on  concerns  about  climate  change  could  result  in  increased  capital  expenditures  on  our  properties  (for example,  to  improve  their  energy  efficiency  and/or  resistance  to  inclement  weather)  without  a  corresponding  increase  in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income.\n\n## Potential liability or other expenditures associated with potential environmental contamination may be costly.\n\nVarious federal, state, and local laws subject real estate owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal  or  remediation  of  certain  potentially  hazardous  materials  that  may  be  present  in  the  land  or  buildings.  Potentially hazardous materials may include polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleum-based fuels, lead-based paint, or asbestos, among other materials. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for,  the  presence  of  such  materials.  The  presence  of,  or  the  failure  to  manage  or  remediate  properly,  these  materials  may adversely affect occupancy at such real estate as well as the ability to sell or finance such real estate. In addition, governmental agencies may bring claims for costs associated with investigation and remediation actions, damages to natural resources, and for  potential  fines  or  penalties  in  connection  with  such  damage  or  with  respect  to  the  improper  management  of  hazardous materials.  Moreover,  private  plaintiffs  may  potentially  make  claims  for  investigation  and  remediation  costs  they  incur,  or personal injury, disease, disability, or other infirmities related to the alleged presence of hazardous materials at an apartment community. In addition to potential environmental liabilities or costs associated with our current real estate, we may also be responsible for such liabilities or costs associated with communities we acquire or manage in the future, or real estate we no longer own or operate.\n\n## Rent  control  laws  and  other  regulations  that  limit  our  ability  to  increase  rental  rates  may  negatively  impact  our  rental income and profitability.\n\nState and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental  rates,  which  may  affect  our  rental  income.  Especially  in  times  of  recession  and  economic  slowdown,  rent  control initiatives can acquire significant political support. If rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties, our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected.\n\n## Laws benefiting disabled persons may result in our incurrence of unanticipated expenses.\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ('ADA'), all places intended to be used by the public are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 ('FHAA')  requires  apartment  communities  first  occupied  after  March  13,  1991,  to  comply  with  design  and  construction requirements for disabled access. For those apartment communities receiving federal funds, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 also has requirements regarding disabled access. These and federal, state, and local laws may require structural modifications to our apartment communities or changes in policy/practice or affect renovations of the communities. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying  feature,  which  could  result  in  substantial  capital  expenditures.  Although  we  believe  that  our  apartment communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements, we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with the ADA, the FHAA, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in connection with the ongoing operation or redevelopment of our apartment communities.\n\n## Moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly.\n\nAlthough we are proactively engaged in managing moisture intrusion and preventing the presence of mold at our apartment communities,  it  is  not  unusual  for  periodic  moisture  intrusion  to  cause  mold  in  isolated  locations  within  an  apartment community.  We  have  implemented  policies,  procedures,  and  training,  and  include  a  detailed  moisture  intrusion  and  mold assessment  during  acquisition  due  diligence.  We  believe  these  measures  will  manage  mold  exposure  at  our  apartment communities and will minimize the effects that mold may have on our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate mold conditions. We have only limited insurance coverage for property damage claims arising from the presence of mold and for personal injury claims related to mold exposure.",

        "page_content": "## Although we are insured for certain risks, the cost of insurance, increased claims activity, or losses resulting from casualty events may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are insured for a portion of our real estate assets' exposure to casualty losses resulting from fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and other perils, which insurance is subject to deductibles and self-insurance retention. We recognize casualty losses or gains based on the net book value of the affected asset and the amount of any related insurance proceeds. In many instances,  the  actual  cost  to  repair  or  replace  the  apartment  community  may  exceed  its  net  book  value  and  any  insurance proceeds. We recognize the uninsured portion of losses as casualty losses in the periods in which they are incurred. In addition, we  are  self-insured  for  a  portion  of  our  exposure  to  third-party  claims  related  to  our  workers'  compensation  coverage  and general liability exposure. With respect to our exposure to claims of third parties, we establish reserves at levels that reflect our known and estimated losses. The ultimate cost of losses and the impact of unforeseen events may vary materially from recorded reserves, and variances may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We purchase insurance to reduce our exposure to losses and limit our financial losses on large individual risks. The availability and cost of insurance are determined by market conditions outside our control. No assurance can be made that we will be able to obtain and maintain insurance at the same levels and on the same terms as we do today. If we are not able to obtain or maintain insurance in amounts we consider appropriate for our business, or if the cost of obtaining such insurance increases materially, we may have to retain a larger portion of the potential loss associated with our exposures to risks.\n\n## Natural disasters and severe weather may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather such as hurricanes may result in significant damage to our real estate assets. The extent of our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity  of  the  event  and  the  total  amount  of  exposure  in  the  affected  area.  When  we  have  geographic  concentration  of exposures, a single catastrophe (such as an earthquake) or destructive weather event (such as a hurricane) affecting a region may have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot accurately predict natural disasters or severe weather, or the number and type of such events that will affect us. As a result, our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next. Although we anticipate and plan for losses, there can be no assurance that  our  financial  results  will  not  be  adversely  affected  by  our  exposure  to  losses  arising  from  natural  disasters  or  severe weather in the future that exceed our previous experience and assumptions.\n\n## We depend on our senior management.\n\nOur success and our ability to implement and manage anticipated future growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts of our senior management team, who have extensive market knowledge and relationships, and exercise substantial influence over our operational, financing, acquisition, and disposition activity. Members of our senior management team have national or regional industry reputations that attract business and investment opportunities and assist us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants, and other industry participants. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain similarly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities,  and  weaken  our  relationships  with  lenders,  business  partners,  existing  and  prospective  tenants,  and  industry participants, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\n\n## We  rely  on  our  property  managers  to  manage  our  properties.  If  our  property  managers  fail  to  efficiently  manage  our properties, tenants may not renew their leases, or we may become subject to unforeseen liabilities.\n\nOur properties are managed by third parties. We do not supervise our third-party property managers or their employees on a day-to-day  basis  and  we  cannot  assure  you  that  they  will  manage  such  properties  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  their obligations under our agreements, that they will not be negligent in their performance or engage in any criminal or fraudulent activity,  or  that  they  will  not  otherwise  default  on  their  management  obligations  to  us.  If  any  of  the  foregoing  occurs,  the relationships with our tenants at such properties could be damaged, which may cause the tenants not to renew their leases, and we could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to the properties or to persons at the properties. If we are unable to lease the  properties  or  we  become  subject  to  significant  liabilities  as  a  result  of  our  third-party  property  managers'  management performance, our financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.",

We use these systems to manage our vendor relationships, internal communications, accounting and record-keeping systems, and many other key aspects of our business.  Our  operations  rely  on  the  secure  processing,  storage,  and  transmission  of  confidential,  personal  and  other information  ('Confidential  Information\")  in  our  computer  systems  and  networks,  which  also  depend  on  the  strength  of  our procedures and the effectiveness of our internal controls. We own and manage some of these IT Systems, but also rely on third parties  for  a  range  of  IT  Systems  and  related  products  and  services,  including  but  not  limited  to  cloud  computing  services. Information  security  risks  have  generally  increased  in  recent  years  due  to  the  rise  in  new  technologies  and  the  increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks.\n\nWe face numerous and evolving risks associated with energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures, and evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT Systems. The risk of  a  cyber  incident  has  generally  increased  as  the  number,  intensity  and  sophistication  of  attempted  attacks  have  increased globally,  including  by  computer  hackers,  foreign  governments,  information  service  interruptions  and  cyber  terrorists, opportunistic hackers and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors, such as social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), malfeasance by insiders, human or technological error, and as a result of bugs, misconfigurations or exploited vulnerabilities in software or hardware. Techniques used in cyber incidents evolve frequently, may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world and be difficult to detect and may not be recognized until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, making it impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. Because we make use of third-party suppliers and service providers that support our internal- and external-facing operations, successful cyberattacks that disrupt or result in unauthorized access to third party IT Systems can materially impact our operations and financial results. Aimco predecessor and our thirdparty vendors have been impacted by security incidents in the past and we and our third-party vendors will likely continue to experience security incidents of varying degrees. For example, unauthorized parties, whether within or outside the Company, may disrupt  or  gain  access  to  our  IT  Systems,  or  those  of  third  parties  with  whom  we  do  business,  through  human  error, misfeasance,  fraud,  trickery,  or  other  forms  of  deceit,  including  break-ins,  use  of  stolen  credentials,  social  engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. While we do not believe that past incidents have had a material impact to date, as our reliance on technology increases, so do the risks of a security incident. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nWe may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. There can be no assurance that our security  efforts  and  measures  will  be  fully  implemented,  complied  with  or  effective  or  that  attempted  security  breaches  or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss, or misuse of the Confidential Information, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We also cannot guarantee that any costs and liabilities incurred in relation to an attack or incident will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all.\n\nCompliance with ever evolving federal and state laws relating to the handling of information about individuals involves significant expenditure and resources, and any failure by us or our vendors to comply may result in significant liability, negative publicity, and/or an erosion of trust, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nWe receive, store, handle, transmit, use and otherwise process business information and information related to individuals, including from and about actual and prospective tenants, as well as our employees and service providers. We also depend on a number of third-party vendors in relation to the operation of our business, a number of which we rely on to process personal data  on  our  behalf.  While  we  may  not  be  responsible  for  the  compliance  with  certain  laws,  failure  by  such  third  parties  to comply with those laws could result in harm to our reputation and brand and require us to expend significant resources.\n\nWe and our vendors are subject to a variety of federal and state data privacy laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements, including those that apply generally to the handling of information about individuals, and those that are specific  to  certain  industries,  sectors,  contexts,  or  locations.  These  requirements,  and  their  application,  interpretation  and amendment are constantly evolving and developing.",

For other personal data, including tenant, we rely on our third-party partners to store and process such data. Among other things, the CCPA: requires disclosures to such residents about  the  data  collection,  use  and  disclosure  practices  of  covered  businesses;  provides  such  individuals  expanded  rights  to access,  delete,  and  correct  their  personal  information,  and  opt-out  of  certain  sales  or  transfers  of  personal  information;  and provides such individuals with a private right of action and statutory damages for certain data breaches. The enactment of the CCPA is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other states in the United States, which creates the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. Evolving compliance and operational requirements under the CCPA and the privacy and data security laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate impose significant costs that are likely to increase over  time.  Our  failure,  or  the  failure  of  third-party  partners  we  rely  on  to  process  data,  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and regulations related to privacy and data protection could harm our business or reputation.\n\nAdditionally, we rely on third-party property managers to run background checks on prospective tenants. Those third-party managers are considered 'users' of consumer reports provided by consumer reporting agencies ('CRAs') under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,  as  amended  by  the  Fair  and Accurate  Credit  Transactions Act  (collectively,  'FCRA').  FCRA  regulates  and protects  consumer  information  and,  among  other  things,  imposes  specific  obligations  'users'  of  consumer  reports.  Such obligations  include  notifying  consumers  when  such  reports  are  used  to  make  an  adverse  decision,  and,  in  the  context  of completing employee background checks, providing a notice containing certain disclosures to the consumer and obtaining their consent.  Noncompliance with the FCRA can lead to civil and even criminal penalties, and it permits consumers to bring a private right of action if they are unsatisfied with the dispute resolution process.\n\nFurther,  laws,  regulations,  and  standards  covering  marketing,  advertising,  and  other  activities  conducted  by  telephone, email,  mobile  devices,  and  the  internet  may  be  or  become  applicable  to  our  business,  such  as  the  Telephone  Consumer Protection Act (the 'TCPA'), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the 'CANSPAM Act'), and similar state consumer protection and communication privacy laws, such as California's Invasion of Privacy Act.\n\nThird-party  property  managers  send  short  message  service,  or  SMS,  text  messages  to  tenants.  The  actual  or  perceived improper sending of such text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws such as the TCPA. Numerous class-action suits under federal and state laws have been filed in recent years against  companies  who  conduct  telemarketing  and/or  SMS  texting  programs,  with  many  resulting  in  multi-million-dollar settlements to the plaintiffs. Any future such litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend. In particular, the TCPA imposes significant restrictions on the ability to make telephone calls or send text messages to mobile telephone numbers without the prior consent of the person being contacted.  Federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants may claim that the notices and disclosures we provide, form of consents we obtain or our SMS texting practices are not adequate or violate applicable law. This may in the future result in civil claims against us. Claims that we have violated the TCPA could be costly to litigate, whether or not they have merit, and could expose us to substantial statutory damages or costly settlements.\n\nThird-party property managers send marketing messages via email and are subject to the CAN-SPAM Act. The CAN-SPAM Act imposes certain obligations regarding the content of emails and providing opt-outs (with the corresponding requirement to honor  such  opt-outs  promptly).  While  we  strive  to  ensure  that  all  of  our  marketing  communications  comply  with  the requirements set forth in the CAN-SPAM Act, any violations could result in the FTC seeking civil penalties against us.\n\nMoreover, as our third-party property managers accept debit and credit cards for payment, they are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ('PCI-DSS'), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. PCI-DSS contains  compliance  guidelines  with  regard  to  our  security  surrounding  the  physical  and  electronic  storage,  processing  and transmission of cardholder data. If our third-party property managers or other service providers are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the payment card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with data privacy laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, government agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity and an erosion of trust. If any of these events were to occur, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.",

During the third quarter of 2023, we implemented the first phase, which replaced a legacy system where a significant portion of our transactions were originated,  processed,  or  recorded. The  ERP  system  is  designed  to  accurately  maintain  our  financial  records,  enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of our business.

In  November  2019,  Aimco  Predecessor  made  a  five-year,  $275.0  million mezzanine loan to the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments (the 'Mezzanine Investment'). The loan bears interest at a 10% annual rate, accruing if not paid from property operations. In June 2023, we closed on the sale of a 20% non-controlling participation in the loan for $33.5 million. In connection with the participation sold, the purchaser also made a $4.0 million non-refundable payment for the option to acquire the remaining 80% for an additional $134 million plus our annualized return. The  option  expired  unexercised  in  the  quarter  ended  December  31,  2023.  We  have  recognized  a  $158.0  million  non-cash impairment to reduce the carrying value of loan to zero as of December 31, 2023. While we have impaired and written down the carrying value of the Mezzanine Investment to zero, risks remains that all or a portion of the loan will not be repaid. There can be no assurances that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## There may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR.\n\nThere may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR. The Separation was designed  to  minimize  conflicts  of  interest  between  us  and AIR,  and  the  volume  of  transactions  with AIR  has  significantly decreased since the Separation. While AIR is not a related party, there can be no assurance that such conflicts, or appearance of conflicts, do not exist.\n\nActual, potential, or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor dissatisfaction, settlements with stockholders, litigation or regulatory inquiries or enforcement actions. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential, actual, or perceived conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse impact  on  our  reputation,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business  in  a  number  of  ways,  including  causing  a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us, a decrease in the prices of our equity securities, and a resulting increased risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.",

        "page_content": "## Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\n\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors advocating corporate actions such as  financial  restructuring,  increased  borrowing,  special  dividends,  stock  repurchases,  or  even  sales  of  assets  or  the  entire company. We have been subject to stockholder activism in the past and given our stockholder composition and other factors, it is  possible  our  stockholders  or  future  activist  stockholders  may  attempt  to  effect  such  changes  in  the  future.  Responding  to proxy  contests  and  other  actions  by  such  activist  stockholders  or  others  would  be  costly  and  time-consuming,  disrupt  our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors (the \"Board\") and senior management team from the pursuit of business  strategies,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  Additionally,  perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability, or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential lenders, partners, or others with whom we do business, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING\n\n## Our debt financing could result in foreclosure of our apartment communities, prevent us from making distributions on our equity, or otherwise adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nA significant number of our assets, including apartment communities, land, and construction projects serve as collateral for our  credit  facility,  property  debt  and  construction  loans.  Our  secured  credit  facility  matures  in  December  2024,  prior  to consideration of its one-year extension option. Certain of our subsidiaries have existing secured property-level debt equal to approximately $852.5 million and construction loans of approximately $309.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Over time, we are  likely  to  become  party  to  additional  financing  arrangements,  including  credit  facilities  or  other  bank  debt,  bonds,  and mortgage financing. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur, and we have significant amounts of debt outstanding. Payments of principal and interest may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our communities or pay distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT.\n\nIn connection with such financing activities, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that our indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of then-existing indebtedness. If we fail to make required payments of principal and interest on our non-recourse property debt, our lenders could foreclose on the apartment communities and other collateral securing such debt, which would result in the loss to us of income and asset value.\n\n## Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing and the cost of available financing and could adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing and the cost of such financing depends on the overall condition of the United States credit markets.  During  periods  of  economic  uncertainty,  the  United  States  credit  markets  may  experience  significant  liquidity disruptions, which may cause the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably and make obtaining financing, including, but not limited to non-recourse property debt secured by stabilized properties, construction loans, and corporate borrowings such  as  those  under  our  credit  facilities,  more  difficult.  In  particular,  apartment  borrowers  have  benefited  from  the  historic willingness of the Federal National Mortgage Association ('Fannie Mae'), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ('Freddie Mac'), to make substantial amounts of loans secured by multifamily properties, even in times of economic distress. These two lenders are federally chartered and subject to federal regulation, which is subject to change, making uncertain their prospects and ability to provide liquidity in a future downturn.\n\nIf  our  ability  to  obtain  financing  is  adversely  affected,  we  may  be  unable  to  satisfy  scheduled  maturities  on  existing financings through other sources of liquidity, which could result in a lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt and loss of income and asset value, both of which would adversely affect our liquidity.\n\n## Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and reduce our profitability and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nOur revolving secured credit facility contains a variable interest rate, which may be based, in part, on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). We also have certain non-recourse property debt and construction loans that are based on variable interest  rate  indexes.  An  increase  or  decrease  in  these  variable  interest  rate  indexes  would  likely  increase  or  decrease  our interest expense. An increase in interest expense may affect our profitability.",

These may include covenants that limit our operations or impact our ability to make distributions or other payments unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied, as well as certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants.\n\n## We may increase leverage in executing our development plan, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\n\nWe may decide to  increase  our  leverage  to  execute  our  development  plan.  We  will  consider  a  number  of  factors  when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover  the  expected  debt  service.  Although  our  credit  facility  may  limit  our  ability  to  incur  additional  indebtedness,  our governing documents do not limit the amount of debt we may incur, and we may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness from time to time in the future to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we increase leverage, the risk related to our indebtedness could also increase.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\n## Aimco may fail to qualify as a REIT .\n\nIf  Aimco  fails  to  qualify  as  a  REIT,  Aimco  will  not  be  allowed  a  deduction  for  dividends  paid  to  its  stockholders  in computing its taxable income and will be subject to United States federal income tax at regular corporate rates. This would substantially reduce our funds available for general corporate usage or for distribution to our investors. Unless entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, Aimco also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, Aimco's failure to qualify as a REIT may place us in default under our credit facilities.\n\nWe believe Aimco operates, and has since its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, operated, in a manner that enables it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. However, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Moreover, even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize Aimco's REIT status. Aimco's continued qualification as a REIT will depend on its satisfaction of certain asset, income, investment, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership, and other requirements on a continuing basis. Aimco's ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon the fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we do not obtain independent appraisals.  Aimco's compliance  with  the  REIT  annual  income  and  quarterly  asset  requirements  also  depends  upon  our  ability  to  successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for United States federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the  'IRS'),  will  not  contend  that  Aimco's  interests  in  subsidiaries  or  other  issuers  constitute  a  violation  of  the  REIT requirements. Moreover, future economic, market, legal, tax, or other considerations may cause Aimco to fail to qualify as a REIT, or the Board may determine to revoke its REIT status.\n\n## REIT distribution requirements limit our available cash.\n\nAs  a  REIT,  Aimco  is  subject  to  annual  distribution  requirements.  Aimco  pays  distributions,  including  taxable  stock dividends,  intended  to  enable  it  to  satisfy  its  distribution  requirements.  This  limits  the  amount  of  cash  available  for  other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. Aimco generally must distribute annually at least 90% of its 'real estate  investment  trust  taxable  income,'  which  is  generally  equivalent  to  net  taxable  ordinary  income,  determined  without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, in order to qualify as a REIT. To the extent that Aimco does not distribute all of its net capital gain, or distributes at least 90% but less than 100%, of its \"real estate investment trust taxable income,\" it will be required to pay United States federal corporate income tax on the undistributed amount. We intend  to  make  distributions  to Aimco's  stockholders  to  comply  with  the  requirements  applicable  to  REITs  under  the  Code (which may be all cash or combination of cash and stock satisfying the requirements of applicable law). However, differences in  timing  between  the  recognition  of  taxable  income  and  the  actual  receipt  of  cash  could  require  us  to  sell  apartment communities or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.",

        "page_content": "## Aimco may be subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in certain circumstances.\n\nEven as a REIT, Aimco may be subject to United States federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on its undistributed income, as described above. Aimco could also be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm'slength  transactions  between  us  and  a  taxable  REIT  subsidiary  ('TRS')  and  on  any  net  income  from  sales  of  apartment communities or other property treated as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business. State and local tax laws may not conform to the United States federal income tax treatment, and Aimco may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions in which Aimco transacts business. Any taxes imposed on Aimco would reduce our operating cash flow and net income and could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends and distributions.\n\n## Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\n\nREITs are entitled to a United States federal income tax deduction for dividends paid to their stockholders. Through this dividends  paid  deduction,  a  REIT  may  reduce  or  eliminate  its  entity-level  United  States  federal  income  tax  liability,  which generally results in a lower combined tax liability of the REIT and its stockholders as compared to that of the combined tax liability  of  other  taxable  C-corporations  and  their  stockholders.  Notwithstanding  this  combined  benefit,  as  discussed  below, dividends payable by REITs may result in marginally higher taxes to the stockholder.\n\nC-corporations are generally required to pay a corporate-level United States federal income tax on their income, which will reduce  the  amount  available  for  distribution  to  stockholders.  Dividends  paid  by  a  C-corporation  may  constitute  \"qualified dividends.\" The maximum United States federal tax rate applicable to income from 'qualified dividends' payable to United States  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts,  and  estates  is  currently  20%,  plus  the  3.8%  investment  tax  surcharge. While dividends payable by REITs are generally not eligible for the qualified dividend reduced rates, stockholders that are individuals, trusts, or estates, and meet certain requirements, may generally deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary dividends from REITs. This deduction is available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, and will generally cause the maximum tax rate for ordinary dividends from REITs to be 29.6%, plus the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. The more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts, and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of  REITs,  including Aimco  Common Stock.\n\n## Complying with the REIT requirements may cause Aimco to forgo otherwise attractive business opportunities.\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, Aimco must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts distributed to its stockholders, and the ownership of its stock. As a result of these tests, Aimco may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when Aimco does not have funds readily available  for  distribution,  forgo  otherwise  attractive  investment  opportunities,  liquidate  assets  in  adverse market conditions, or contribute assets to a TRS that is subject to regular corporate federal income tax.\n\n## Changes to United States federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect Aimco and Aimco's stockholders.\n\nThe present  United  States  federal  income  tax  treatment  of  REITs  may  be  modified,  possibly  with  retroactive  effect,  by legislative, judicial, or administrative action at any time, which could affect the United States federal income tax treatment of an investment in Aimco's Common Stock. The United States federal income tax rules dealing with REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, and the United States Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might  affect  Aimco  or  its  stockholders.  Revisions  in  federal  tax  laws  and  interpretations  thereof  could  significantly  and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT and the tax considerations relevant to an investment in Aimco's Common Stock or could cause us to change our investments and commitments.",

        "page_content": "## If the Aimco Operating Partnership were to fail to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Aimco would fail to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that  the Aimco  Operating  Partnership  has  been  organized  and  operated  in  a  manner  that  will  allow  it  to  be treated as a partnership, and not an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Aimco Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including Aimco, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, that partner's share of the Aimco Operating Partnership's income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge the Aimco Operating Partnership's status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Aimco Operating Partnership as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, Aimco would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  would  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Such  REIT  qualification  failure  could  impair  our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could materially adversely affect the value of Aimco's stock and the Aimco Operating Partnership's units. Also, the failure of the Aimco Operating Partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal corporate  income  tax,  which  could  reduce  significantly  the  amount  of  its  cash  available  for  debt service and for distribution to its partners, including Aimco.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO AIMCO OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS\n\n## There are restrictions on the ability to transfer and redeem Aimco Operating Partnership Units, there is no public market for Aimco Operating Partnership Units and holders of Aimco Operating Partnership Units are subject to dilution.\n\nThe Aimco Operating Partnership agreement restricts  the  transferability  of  OP  Units.  Until  the  expiration  of  a  one-year holding  period,  subject  to  certain  exceptions,  investors  may  not  transfer  OP  Units  without  the  consent  of Aimco  Operating Partnership's general partner. Thereafter, investors may transfer such OP Units subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the general partner's right of first refusal. In addition, after the expiration of the one-year holding period, investors have the right, subject to the terms of Aimco Operating Partnership's agreement, to require Aimco Operating Partnership to redeem  all  or  a  portion  of  such  investor's  OP  Units  (in  exchange  for  shares  of  our  Common  Stock  or  cash,  at  the Aimco Operating Partnership's discretion) once per quarter on an exchange date set by Aimco Operating Partnership, provided such investor provides notice at least 45 days prior to the quarterly exchange date. There is no public market for the OP Units. Aimco Operating Partnership has no plans to list any OP Units on a securities exchange. It is unlikely that any person will make a market in the OP Units, or that an active market for the OP Units will develop. If a market for the OP Units develops and the OP Units are considered 'readily tradable' on a 'secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof),' Aimco Operating Partnership  would  be  classified  as  a  publicly  traded  partnership  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes,  which  could  have  a material adverse effect on Aimco Operating Partnership and its unitholders.\n\nIn addition, Aimco Operating Partnership may issue an unlimited number of additional OP Units or other securities for such consideration and on such terms as it may establish, without the approval of the holders of OP Units. Such securities could have priority over the OP Units as to cash flow, distributions, and liquidation proceeds. The effect of any such issuance may be to dilute the interests of holders of OP Units.\n\n## Cash distributions by Aimco Operating Partnership are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with partnership performance.\n\nAimco  Operating  Partnership  does  not  intend  to  make  regular  distributions  to  holders  of  OP  Units  (other  than  what  is required for Aimco to maintain its REIT status). There can be no assurance regarding the amounts of available cash that Aimco Operating  Partnership  will  generate  or  the  portion  that  its  general  partner  will  choose  to  distribute.  The  actual  amounts  of available  cash  will  depend  upon  numerous  factors,  including  profitability  of  operations,  required  principal  and  interest payments  on  its  debt,  the  cost  of  acquisitions  (including  related  debt  service  payments),  its  issuance  of  debt  and  equity securities, fluctuations in working capital, capital expenditures, adjustments in reserves, prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business, and other factors, some of which may be beyond Aimco Operating Partnership's control. Cash distributions depend  primarily  on  cash  flow,  including  from  reserves,  and  not  on  profitability,  which  is  affected  by  non-cash  items. Therefore, cash distributions may be made during periods when our operating partnership records losses and may not be made during  periods  when  it  records  profits.  The Aimco  Operating  Partnership  agreement  gives  the  general  partner  discretion  in establishing reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership's business that will affect the amount of available cash. Aimco Operating  Partnership  may  be  required  to  make  reserves  for  the  future  payment  of  principal  and  interest  under  its  credit facilities and other indebtedness. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership's credit facilities may limit its ability to distribute cash to holders of OP Units. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance regarding actual levels of cash distributions on OP Units, and Aimco Operating Partnership's ability to distribute cash may be limited during the existence of any events of default under any of its debt instruments.",

Unlike the holders of common stock in  a  corporation,  holders  of  OP  Units  have  only  limited  voting  rights  on  matters  affecting  Aimco  Operating  Partnership's business. Such matters relate to certain amendments of the partnership agreement and certain transactions such as the institution of bankruptcy proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors and certain transfers by the general partner of its interest in Aimco Operating Partnership or the admission of a successor general partner. Holders of OP Units have no right to elect the general partner on an annual or other continuing basis, or to remove the general partner. As a result, holders of OP Units have limited influence on matters affecting the operation of Aimco Operating Partnership, and third parties may find it difficult to attempt to gain control over, or influence the activities of, Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nThe limited partners of Aimco Operating Partnership are unable to remove the general partner or to vote in the election of our directors unless they own shares of Aimco. In order to comply with specific REIT tax requirements, Aimco's charter has restrictions on the ownership of its equity securities.

The  directors  and  officers  of  the  general  partner  have  fiduciary  duties  to  manage  the  general  partner  in  a  manner beneficial  to  us,  as  the  sole  stockholder  of  the  general  partner.  At  the  same  time,  as  the  general  partner  of  our  operating partnership,  we  have  fiduciary  duties  to  manage Aimco  Operating  Partnership  in  a  manner  beneficial  to Aimco  Operating Partnership  and  its  limited  partners.  The  duties  of  the  general  partner  of Aimco  Operating  Partnership  to Aimco  Operating Partnership and its partners may therefore come into conflict with the duties of the directors and officers of the general partner to its sole stockholder, Aimco. Such conflicts of interest might arise in the following situations, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 decisions of the general partner with respect to the amount and timing of cash expenditures, borrowings, issuances of additional interests and reserves in any quarter, will affect whether or the extent to which there is available cash to make distributions in a given quarter;\n- \u00b7 whenever  possible,  the  general  partner  seeks  to  limit  Aimco  Operating  Partnership's  liability  under  contractual arrangements  to  all  or  particular  assets  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  other  party  thereto  having  no recourse against the general partner or its assets;\n- \u00b7 any agreements between Aimco Operating Partnership and the general partner and its affiliates will not grant to the holders of OP Units, separate and distinct from Aimco Operating Partnership, the right to enforce the obligations of the general partner and such affiliates in favor of our operating partnership. Therefore, the general partner, in its capacity as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, will be primarily responsible for enforcing such obligations; and\n- \u00b7 under  the  terms  of  the Aimco  Operating  Partnership  agreement,  the  general  partner  is  not  restricted  from  causing Aimco Operating Partnership to pay the general partner or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to Aimco Operating Partnership or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of such entities  on  behalf  of  our  operating  partnership.  Neither  the Aimco  Operating  Partnership  agreement  nor  any  of  the other agreements, contracts, and arrangements between Aimco Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the general partner  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  and  its  affiliates,  on  the  other,  are  or  will  be  the  result  of  arm's-length negotiations.",

The Aimco Operating Partnership agreement expressly authorizes the general partner to enter into, on behalf of Aimco Operating Partnership, a right of first opportunity arrangement and other conflict avoidance agreements with various affiliates of Aimco Operating Partnership and the general partner, on such terms as the  general  partner,  in  its  sole  and  absolute  discretion,  believes  are  advisable.  The  latitude  given  in  the  Aimco  Operating Partnership agreement to the general partner in resolving conflicts of interest may significantly limit the ability of a holder of OP Units to challenge what might otherwise be a breach of fiduciary duty. The general partner believes, however, that such latitude is necessary and appropriate to enable it to serve as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership without undue risk of liability.\n\nThe Aimco Operating Partnership agreement limits the liability of the general partner for actions taken in good faith. Aimco Operating Partnership's partnership agreement expressly limits the liability of the general partner by providing that the general partner, and its officers and directors, will not be liable or accountable in damages to Aimco Operating Partnership, the limited partners, or assignees for errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or omission if the general partner or such director or officer acted in good faith. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership is required to indemnify the general partner, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses, judgments, fines, and other actions incurred by the general partner or such other persons, provided that Aimco Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (i) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law or (ii) for any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement. The provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and the general partner has not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict the fiduciary duties of the general partner that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries may be prohibited from making distributions and other payments.\n\nAll of Aimco Operating Partnership's real estate assets are owned by subsidiaries of our operating partnership. As a result, Aimco  Operating  Partnership  depends  on  distributions  and  payments  from  its  subsidiaries  in  order  to  satisfy  our  financial obligations  and  make  payments  to  our  equity  holders,  as  applicable.  The  ability  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  and  its subsidiaries to make such distributions and other payments depends on their earnings and cash flows and may be subject to statutory or contractual limitations, including covenants in some of our existing and/or future debt agreements. As an equity investor in our subsidiaries, our right to receive assets upon their liquidation or reorganization are effectively subordinated to the claims of their creditors and any holders of preferred equity senior to our equity investments. To the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiaries, our claims may still be subordinate to any security interest in or other lien on their assets and to any of their debt or other obligations that are senior to our claims.\n\n## Limits  on  ownership  of  shares  specified  in  Aimco's  charter  may  result  in  the  loss  of  economic  and  voting  rights  by purchasers that violate those limits.\n\nAimco's charter  limits  ownership  of  Common  Stock  by  any  single  stockholder  (applying  certain  'beneficial  ownership' rules under the federal tax and securities laws) to 8.7% (or up to 12.0% upon a waiver from Aimco's Board) of outstanding shares of Common Stock, or 15% in the case of certain pension trusts, registered investment companies, and certain individuals (or  up  to  20.0%  for  such  pension  trusts  or  registered  investment  companies  upon  a  waiver  from Aimco's  Board). Aimco's charter also limits ownership of Aimco's Common Stock and preferred stock by any single stockholder to 8.7% of the value of the  outstanding  Common  Stock  and  preferred  stock,  or  15%  in  the  case  of  certain  pension  trusts,  registered  investment companies,  and  certain  individuals.  The  charter  also  prohibits  anyone  from  buying  shares  of  Aimco's  capital  stock  if  the purchase would result in Aimco losing its REIT status. This could happen if a transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of Aimco's shares of capital stock or results in five or fewer persons (applying certain attribution rules of the Code) owning  more  than  50%  of  the  value  of  all  of Aimco's  shares  of  capital  stock.  If  anyone  acquires  shares  in  excess  of  the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs:\n\n- \u00b7 the transfer will be considered null and void;\n- \u00b7 we will not reflect the transaction on Aimco's books;",

If the trust transfers any of the shares of capital stock, the affected person will receive the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the then current market price. An individual who acquires shares of capital stock that violate the above rules bears the risk that the individual:\n\n- \u00b7 may lose control over the power to dispose of such shares;\n- \u00b7 may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases;\n- \u00b7 may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases; and\n- \u00b7 may be required to repay to us any dividends received from us as a result of his or her ownership of the shares.\n\n## Aimco's charter may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of Aimco.\n\nThe 8.7% and other ownership limits discussed above may have the effect of delaying or precluding acquisition by a thirdparty  of  control  of  Aimco  without  the  consent  of  Aimco's  Board.  Aimco's  charter  authorizes  its  Board  to  issue  up  to 510,587,500  shares  of  capital  stock,  which  consists  entirely  of  Common  Stock  as  of  December  31,  2023.  Under  Aimco's charter, Aimco's Board has the authority to classify and reclassify any of our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital  stock  with  such  preferences,  conversion  or  other  rights,  voting  power  restrictions,  limitations  as  to  dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemptions as the Board may determine. The authorization and issuance of a new class of  capital  stock  could  have  the  effect  of  delaying  or  preventing  someone  from  taking  control  of  Aimco,  where  there  is  a difference of opinion between Aimco's Board and others as to what is in  Aimco's stockholders' best interests.\n\n## The Maryland General Corporation Law may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of Aimco.\n\nAs a Maryland corporation, Aimco is subject to various Maryland laws that may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, where there is a difference of opinion between our Board and others as to what is in our stockholders' best interests or where our Board does not approve an offer. The Maryland General  Corporation  Law,  specifically  the  Maryland  Business  Combination  Act,  restricts  mergers  and  other  business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of shares of our stock  representing  10%  or  more  of  the  voting  power  without  our  Board's  prior  approval.  Any  such  business  combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power, and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80% of all votes entitled to be cast and 66-2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast, excluding the interested stockholder, or upon payment of a fair price. The Maryland General Corporation Law, specifically the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our capital stock representing 10% or more of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. Additionally, the Maryland General Corporation Law provides, among other things, that the Board has broad discretion  in  adopting  stockholders'  rights  plans  and  has  the  sole  power  to  fix  the  record  date,  time,  and  place  for  special meetings  of  the  stockholders.  To  date,  we  have  not  adopted  a  stockholders'  rights  plan.  In  addition,  the  Maryland  General Corporation Law provides that a corporation that:\n\n- \u00b7 has at least three directors who are not officers or employees of the entity or related to an acquiring person; and\n- \u00b7 has a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may elect in its charter or bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors to be subject to all or part of a special subtitle (which we refer to as the 'Maryland Unsolicited Takeovers Act' or 'MUTA') that provides that:\n- o the corporation will have a classified board of directors;\n- o any director may be removed only for cause and by the vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors generally, even if a lesser proportion is provided in the charter or bylaws;",

As of the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, (i) Aimco is  no  longer  subject  to  any  of  the  provisions  of  MUTA,  and  (ii) Aimco  is  prohibited  from  electing  to  be  subject  to  MUTA without  the  approval  of  its  stockholders.  Additionally,  at  the  2023  annual  meeting  of  stockholders,  Aimco's  Charter  was amended to (i) lower the threshold for stockholders to remove directors to a simple majority of shares outstanding, eliminate the requirement that such removal be for 'cause,' and enable stockholders to fill vacancies on the Board created by stockholder action,  and  (ii)  reduce  to  a  simple  majority  the  stockholder  vote  required  to  amend  the  Charter  and Amended  and  Restated Bylaws.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nWe have  developed  and  implemented  a  cybersecurity  risk  management  program  intended  to  protect  the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information.\n\nWe use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and CIS Critical Security Controls as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage  cybersecurity  risks  relevant  to  our  business.  This  does  not  imply  that  we  meet  any  particular  technical  standards, specifications, or requirements.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated with our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common  methodologies,  reporting  channels  and  governance  processes  that  apply  across  the  enterprise  risk  management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes the following key elements:\n\n- \u00b7 risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n- \u00b7 a  team  comprised  of  IT  personnel  principally  responsible  for  directing  (1)  our  cybersecurity  risk  assessment processes, (2) our security processes, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n- \u00b7 the use of external cybersecurity service providers, where appropriate, to monitor, assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security processes;\n- \u00b7 cybersecurity awareness training of employees with access to our IT systems;\n- \u00b7 a cybersecurity incident response plan and Security Operations Center (SOC) to respond to cybersecurity incidents; and\n- \u00b7 a third-party risk management process for service providers.\n\nThere  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  cybersecurity  risk  management  program,  including  our  controls,  procedures  and processes, will be fully complied with or that our program will be fully effective in protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems, product and network.",

We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized and material, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including  our  operations,  business  strategy,  results  of  operations,  or  financial  condition.  These  and  other  risks  related  to cybersecurity matters are described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors .\n\n## Cybersecurity Governance\n\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as critical to the enterprise and delegates the cybersecurity risk oversight function to the  Audit  Committee.  The  Audit  Committee  oversees  management's  design,  implementation,  and  enforcement  of  our cybersecurity risk management program.\n\nOur  Chief  Information  Officer  (CIO)  reports  to  the  Chief  Administrative  Officer  &  General  Counsel  and  leads  the Company's overall cybersecurity function. Prior to December 31, 2023, the Audit Committee received regular reports from AIR on our cybersecurity risks. Since December 31, 2023, the Audit Committee has begun receiving and will continue to receive regular  reports  from  our  CIO  on  our  cybersecurity  risks,  including  briefings  on  our  cyber  risk  management  program  and cybersecurity incidents. Audit Committee members also receive periodic presentations on cybersecurity topics from our CIO, supported by our internal security staff, or external experts as part of the Board's continuing education on topics that impact public companies.\n\nOur CIO supervises efforts to  prevent,  detect,  mitigate,  and  remediate  cybersecurity  risks  and  incidents  through  various means,  which  include  briefings  from  internal  security  personnel;  threat  intelligence  and  other  information  obtained  from governmental, public or private sources, including external cybersecurity service providers; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.\n\nOur CIO is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our CIO has primary responsibility for leading our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our external cybersecurity service providers. Our CIO has been publicly recognized as a cybersecurity thought leader  by  leading  industry  analysts.  Our  CIO  has  over  24  years  of  technical  leadership  and  industry  experience,  which  is inclusive  of  global  experience  in  managing  and  leading  IT  and  cybersecurity  teams.  Our  cybersecurity  team  holds  industry standard certifications and participates in routine training.\n\n## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nWe own a geographically diversified portfolio of operating properties that produce stable cash flow and serves to balance the  risk  and  highly  variable  cash  flows  associated  with  our  portfolio  of  development  and  redevelopments  and  value-add investments. Our entire portfolio of operating properties includes 26 apartment communities (22 consolidated properties and four unconsolidated properties) located in eight major U.S. markets and with average rents in line with local market averages (generally defined as B class). We also own one commercial office building that is part of a land assemblage with an adjacent apartment  building.  Our  current  development  and  redevelopment  portfolio  consists  of  11  properties,  including  developable land, located primarily in Southeast Florida, the Washington, D.C. Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range.\n\nAdditional  information  about  our  consolidated  real  estate,  including  property  debt,  is  contained  in  'Schedule  III  -  Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation' in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings, incidental to the normal course of business. While the outcome of the legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe there are no legal proceedings pending that would have a material effect upon our financial condition or result of operations.\n\n## ITEM 4.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\n## Aimco\n\nAimco's Common Stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol 'AIV.'\n\nOn February 23, 2024, there were 144,811,666 shares of Common Stock outstanding, held by 934 stockholders of record. The number of holders does not include individuals or entities who beneficially own shares but whose shares are held of record by a broker or clearing agency but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one record holder.\n\n## Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities\n\nFrom time to time, Aimco may issue shares of its  Common Stock in exchange for OP Units, defined under the Aimco Operating Partnership heading below. Such shares are issued based on an exchange ratio of one share for each OP Unit. Aimco may also issue shares of its Common Stock in exchange for limited partnership interests in consolidated real estate partnerships.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, no shares of Common Stock were issued in exchange for OP Units in such transactions. Had any such shares been issued, the issuances would have been effected in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n## Repurchases of Equity Securities\n\nThe following table summarizes Aimco's share repurchases, all of which were part of publicly announced programs:\n\n| Fiscal Period         | Total Number of Shares  Repurchased   | Weighted Average Price  Paid per Share   | Total Number of Shares  Purchased as Part of  Publicly Announced  Plans or Programs   | Maximum Number of  Shares That May Yet Be  Purchased Under Plans  or Programs  (1)   |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| October 1 - 31, 2023  | 577,871                               | $ 6.53                                   | 577,871                                                                               | 21,958,302                                                                           |\n| November 1 - 30, 2023 | 568,846                               | 6.74                                     | 568,846                                                                               | 21,389,456                                                                           |\n| December 1 - 31, 2023 | 271,900                               | 7.20                                     | 271,900                                                                               | 21,117,556                                                                           |\n| Total                 | 1,418,617                             | $ 6.75                                   | 1,418,617                                                                             |                                                                                      |\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nThere  is  no  public  market  for  OP  Units,  and Aimco  Operating  Partnership  has  no  intention  of  listing  OP  Units  on  any securities exchange.

During the three months ended December 31, 2023, no OP Units were redeemed in exchange for shares of Common Stock and 57,127 OP Units were redeemed in exchange for cash at an aggregate weighted average price per unit of $6.51.",

However, for Aimco to repurchase shares of its Common Stock, the Aimco Operating Partnership must make a concurrent repurchase of its OP Units held by Aimco at a price per unit that is equal to the price per share Aimco pays for its Common Stock.\n\n## Dividend and Distribution Payments\n\nAs  a  REIT, Aimco  is  required  to  distribute  annually  to  holders  of  its  Common  Stock  at  least  90.0%  of  its  'real  estate investment  trust  taxable  income,'  which,  as  defined  by  the  Code  and  United  States  Department  of  Treasury  regulations,  is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income. Aimco's Board determines and declares Aimco's dividends. In making a dividend determination, Aimco's Board considers a variety of factors, including REIT distribution requirements; current market conditions; liquidity needs; and other uses of cash, such as deleveraging and accretive investment activities.\n\nStockholders receiving any dividend, whether payable in cash or cash and shares of Aimco Common Stock, will be required to include the full amount of such dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes for the year of such dividend and may be required to pay income taxes  with  respect  to  such  dividend  in  excess  of  the  cash  dividend  received.  With  respect  to  certain  non-United  States stockholders, Aimco may be required to withhold United States tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in Common Stock.\n\nThe Board of Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner determines and declares distributions on OP Units. Aimco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the sole general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2023, Aimco owned 92.4% of the legal interest in the OP Units of Aimco Operating Partnership and 94.8% of the economic interest of Aimco Operating Partnership. Aimco Operating Partnership holds all of our assets and manages the daily operations of our business.  The  distributions  paid  by Aimco  Operating  Partnership  to Aimco  are  used  to  fund  the  dividends  paid  to Aimco's stockholders. Accordingly, the per share dividends Aimco pays to its stockholders generally equal the per unit distributions paid by Aimco Operating Partnership to holders of its OP Units.\n\nOur  revolving  credit  agreement  includes  customary  covenants,  including  a  restriction  on  dividends  and  other  restricted payments, but permits dividends and distributions as may be necessary to maintain Aimco's REIT status.\n\n## Performance Graph\n\nThe following graph compares cumulative total returns for Aimco's Common Stock, the FTSE Nareit Equity Apartments Index, and the Russell 2000. The FTSE Nareit Equity Apartments Index is published by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ('Nareit'), a representative of multifamily real estate investment trusts and publicly traded real estate companies with interests in United States real estate and capital markets. The FTSE Nareit Equity Apartments Index serves as our sector comparison and the Russell 2000 serves as our broad-based market index.\n\nThe indices are weighted for all companies that fit the definitional criteria of the particular index and are calculated to exclude  companies  as  they  are  acquired  and  to  add  companies  to  the  index  calculation  as  they  become  publicly  traded companies. All companies that fit the definitional criteria and existed at the point in time presented are included in the index calculations. The graph assumes the investment of $100 in Aimco Common Stock and in each index on December 31, 2018, and that all dividends paid have been reinvested.

        "page_content": "## Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023\n\nThe results from the execution of our business plan during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, are described below.\n\n## Financial Results and 2023 Highlights\n\n- \u00b7 For the year ended December 31, 2023, net loss attributable to common stockholders per share, on a fully dilutive basis, was a net loss per share of $1.16, compared to net income per share of $0.49 for the same period in 2022, due primarily to lower transaction-related income in 2023.\n- \u00b7 For the year ended December 31, 2023, NOI from our Stabilized Operating Properties was $105.7 million, up 9.3% year-over-year, with average monthly revenue per apartment home increasing by $194 to $2,305.\n- \u00b7 For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  we  delivered  over  350  apartment  homes  at  The  Hamilton  in  Miami, Florida, Upton Place in Washington, D.C., and Oak Shore in Corte Madera, California; and we opened the 106-key Benson Hotel and Faculty Club in Aurora, Colorado.\n- \u00b7 For the year ended December 31, 2023, we monetized $122.7 million of assets, including the sale of a development land parcel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the sale of a 20% stake of our Parkmerced mezzanine investment, and the associated swaption. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the purchaser of that position forfeited their option to acquire the remaining 80% of the Parkmerced mezzanine investment when they failed to make a required interest payment, resulting in the subordination of their earlier investment.\n\n## Operating Property Results\n\nWe own a diversified portfolio of stabilized apartment communities located in eight major U.S. markets with average rents in line with local market averages (generally defined as B class). We also own a commercial office building that is part of an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building.\n\n## Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue for our Operating segment was $149.8 million, up 8.4% year over year, resulting from a $194 increase in  average  monthly  revenue  per  apartment  home  to  $2,305,  partially  offset  by  a  70-basis  point  decrease  in Average Daily Occupancy to 96.7%.\n- \u00b7 Expenses  for  our  Operating  segment  were  $44.1  million,  up  6.4%  year  over  year,  due  primarily  to  higher insurance costs.\n- \u00b7 Net operating income for our Operating segment was $105.7 million, up 9.3% year over year.\n\n## Value Add, Opportunistic and Alternative Investments\n\n## Development and Redevelopment\n\nWe generally seek development and redevelopment opportunities where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly  defined,  and  where  we  have  a  comparative  advantage  over  others  in  the  market. We  will  focus  our  new  investment activity in Southeast Florida, the Washington, D.C. Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range. Our Value Add and Opportunistic investments may also target portfolio acquisitions, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements.\n\nWe currently have four active development and redevelopment projects, located in three U.S. markets, in varying phases of construction  and  lease-up.  These  projects  remain  on  track,  as  measured  by  budget,  lease-up  metrics,  and  current  market valuations. Additionally, we have a pipeline of future value-add opportunities totaling approximately 13 million gross square feet of development in our target markets of Southeast Florida, the Washington, D.C. Metro Area, and Colorado's Front Range. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we invested $274.9 million in development and redevelopment activities compared to $279.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7 In  Bethesda,  Maryland,  construction  continued  on  plan  at  the  first  phase  of  Strathmore  Square,  which  will contain  220  highly  tailored  apartment  homes  with  initial  delivery  on  track  for  the  second  half  of  2024.  This suburban  infill  project  is  located  adjacent  to  the  Grosvenor-Strathmore  Metro  station  and  the  Strathmore Performing Arts Campus, and is 1.5 miles from The National Institutes of Health main campus. Funding for the project is fully secured with Aimco having already funded 100% of its equity commitment.\n- \u00b7 In  Upper  Northwest  Washington,  D.C.,  construction  at  Upton  Place  is  nearing  completion  and  remains  on schedule  and  on  budget. As  of  December  31,  2023,  we  have  delivered  234  apartment  homes,  with  the  first residents at Upton Place having moved into their new homes during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n- \u00b7 In Corte Madera, California, construction is ongoing at Oak Shore where 16 luxury single-family rental homes and  eight  accessory  dwelling  units  are  being  developed.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  initial  homes  had  been delivered and we welcomed our first residents into their new home.\n- \u00b7 In Miami, Florida, construction was completed on The Hamilton, a 276-unit waterfront apartment community redevelopment and the property finished the initial lease-up of apartment homes in the third quarter 2023 at rates well ahead of underwritten rents.\n- \u00b7 In Aurora, Colorado, The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club, a 106-key boutique hotel and event center with 18 thousand square feet of event space, was completed in the second quarter 2023 and is open to guests.\n\n## Alternative Investments\n\nOur  current  alternative  investments  are  primarily  those  investments  originated  by  Aimco  Predecessor  and  include  a mezzanine loan secured by a stabilized multifamily property with an option to participate in future multifamily development, as well as three passive equity investments. Over time, we plan to significantly reduce capital allocated to these investments.\n\n## Updates for our alternative investments include:\n\n- \u00b7 In  2023,  we  monetized  $91.5  million  of  our  Parkmerced  mezzanine  investments  through  the  sale  of  a  20% interest in the loan, pre-paid interest, and the monetization of the associated interest rate swaption. The buyer of the partial interest in the loan received an option to purchase our remaining 80%, however, the option expired when the buyer did not make its contractual payment in the fourth quarter 2023 required to maintain its purchase option.\n- \u00b7 In accordance with GAAP and because we receive first priority and a higher annualized return than the buyer of the partial interest in the loan, we were required to record the $33.5 million of cash received from the buyer as a balance  sheet  liability.  No  amount  is  due  to  repay  the  liability  until  after  we  receive  cash  payments  in  a subsequent transaction or recapitalization that total $134 million (Aimco's 80% remaining ownership of the loan) plus its annualized return.\n- \u00b7 Additionally, considering various quantitative and qualitative factors including the buyer's option expiration, the loan's maturity date, which is concurrent with the property's senior mortgage, and the financial condition of the borrower, we recorded a $158.0 million non-cash impairment to fully write off the remaining investment.\n- \u00b7 We continue to  monitor  the  mezzanine  investment  and  seek  to  recover  value  but  expects  to  do  so  without  a significant investment or allocation of resources.\n\n## Investment and Disposition Activity\n\nWe  are  focused  on  prudently  allocating  capital  and  delivering  strong  investment  returns.  Consistent  with  our  capital allocation philosophy, we monetize the value within our assets when accretive uses of the proceeds are identified and invests when the risk adjusted returns are superior to other uses of capital.",

        "page_content": "Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7 The monetization of the Parkmerced mezzanine investments as described above.\n- \u00b7 In the fourth quarter 2023, our joint venture in Fort Lauderdale, Florida monetized an additional portion of its investment by closing on the sale of the second of three land parcels along Broward Avenue.\n\n## Balance Sheet and Financing Activities\n\nWe are highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, including having at all times ample liquidity. As of December 31, 2023, we had access to $289.3 million in liquidity, including $122.6 million of cash on hand, $16.7 million of restricted cash,  and  the  capacity  to  borrow  up  to  $150.0  million  on  our  revolving  credit  facility.  Refer  to  the  Liquidity  and  Capital Resources section for additional information regarding our leverage.\n\n## Financial Results of Operations\n\nWe have three segments: (i) Development and Redevelopment; (ii) Operating; and (iii) Other.\n\nOur Development and Redevelopment segment includes properties that are under construction or have not achieved and maintained stabilization throughout the current year and comparable period, as well as land assemblages that are being held for future development. Our Operating segment includes 21 residential apartment communities that have achieved stabilized levels of operations as of January 1, 2022, and maintained it throughout the current year and comparable period. Our Other segment consists of properties that are not included in our Development and Redevelopment or Operating segments.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2023, Compared to the same period in 2022\n\nNet income attributable to Aimco common stockholders decreased by $241.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, as described more fully below.\n\n## Property Results\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our Development and Redevelopment segment included 11 properties, three of which were under construction.  Our  Operating  segment  included  21  communities  with  approximately  5,600  apartment  homes,  and  our  Other segment included 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, our only office building and St. George Villas.\n\nDuring  the  first  quarter  of  2023,  we  reclassified  one  residential  apartment  community  from  the  Other  segment  to  the Operating  segment  because  it  reached  stabilization.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  we  sold  one  land  parcel  from  the Development and Redevelopment segment, which resulted in its removal from the segment. Prior period segment information has  been  recast  based  upon  our  current  segment  population,  and  is  consistent  with  how  our  chief  operating  decision  maker (\"CODM\") evaluates the business. The recast conforms with our reportable segment classification as of December 31, 2023.\n\nWe use proportionate property net operating income to assess the operating performance of our segments. Proportionate property net operating income is defined as our share of rental and other property revenues, excluding utility reimbursements, less direct property operating expenses, including utility reimbursements, for the consolidated communities; but:\n\n- \u00b7 excluding  the  results  of  four  apartment  communities  with  an  aggregate  142  apartment  homes  that  we  neither manage  nor  consolidate,  our  investment  in  IQHQ,  the  Mezzanine  Investment,  and  investments  in  real  estate technology funds; and\n- \u00b7 excluding  property  management  costs  and  casualty  gains  or  losses,  reported  in  consolidated  amounts,  in  our assessment of segment performance.\n\nPlease refer to Note 14 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  Item  8  for  further  discussion  regarding  our  segments, including  a  reconciliation  of  these  proportionate  amounts  to  consolidated  rental  and  other  property  revenues  and  property operating expenses.",

The  increase  was attributable  primarily  to  a  $11.6  million,  or  8.4%  increase  in  rental  and  other  property  revenues  due  to  higher average revenues of $194 per apartment home, partially offset by a 70-basis point decrease in occupancy.\n- \u00b7 Other  proportionate  property  net  operating  income  decreased  by  $1.4  million,  or  13.5%.  The  decrease  was attributable  primarily  to  a  lease  termination  fee  recognized  in  2022  and  decreases  in  occupancy  following  lease expirations earlier in 2023 at our commercial office building in Miami, Florida.\n\nThe results of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as presented below, are based on segment classifications as of December 31, 2023.\n\n|                                                                    | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |          |          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------|----------|\n| (in thousands)                                                     | 2022                      | 2021                      | $ Change | % Change |\n| Rental and other property revenues, before utility reimbursements: |                           |                           |          |          |\n| Development and Redevelopment                                      | $919                      | $2,036                    | $(1,117) | nm       |\n| Operating                                                          | 138,137                   | 123,257                   | 14,880   | 12.1%    |\n| Other                                                              | 15,116                    | 13,605                    | 1,511    | 11.1%    |\n| Total                                                              | 154,172                   | 138,898                   | 15,274   | 11.0%    |\n| Property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements:        |                           |                           |          |          |\n| Development and Redevelopment                                      | 2,194                     | 1,446                     | 748      | nm       |\n| Operating                                                          | 41,410                    | 39,694                    | 1,716    | 4.3%     |\n| Other                                                              | 4,993                     | 4,336                     | 657      | 15.2%    |\n| Total                                                              | 48,597                    | 45,476                    | 3,121    | 6.9%     |\n| Proportionate property net operating income:                       |                           |                           |          |          |\n| Development and Redevelopment                                      | (1,275)                   | 590                       | (1,865)  | nm       |\n| Operating                                                          | 96,727                    | 83,563                    | 13,164   | 15.8%    |\n| Other                                                              | 10,123                    | 9,269                     | 854      | 9.2%     |\n| Total                                                              | $105,575                  | $93,422                   | $12,153  | 13.0%    |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in  2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Development and redevelopment proportionate net operating income decreased by $1.9 million.\n- \u00b7 Operating proportionate property net operating income increased by $13.2 million, or 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021. The increase was attributable to a $14.9 million, or 12.1% increase in rental and other property revenues, offset partially by a $1.7 million, or 4.3% increase in property operating expenses due primarily to higher real estate taxes and insurance.",

The increase is due primarily to higher rates of interest earned on excess cash invested in treasury bill investments and money market funds in 2023.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, Interest expense decreased by $36.1 million, or 48.9% due primarily to the prepayment of the notes payable due to AIR and other property debt, as well as the 2022 lease termination described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment Income (Loss), Net\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded Mezzanine Investment (Loss), Net of  $155.8 million and $179.2 million, respectively. This is due primarily to non-cash impairment charges of $158.0 million and $212.8 million for the years  ended  December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The prior year non-cash impairment charge was partially offset by interest income, which we ceased to recognize in 2023 following the impairment.\n\n## Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Options\n\nWe are  required  to  adjust  our  interest  rate  options  to  fair  value  on  a  quarterly  basis. As  a  result  of  the  mark-to-market adjustments,  we  recorded  unrealized  losses  of  $3.8  million  and  unrealized  gains  of  $36.9  million  during  the  years  ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In addition, we realized gains of $4.9 million and $11.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments\n\nWe measure our investments in stock based on its market price at period end and our investments in property technology funds at NAV as a practical expedient. As a result of changes in the values of these investments, we recorded unrealized gains of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to unrealized losses of $5.9 million for the same period in 2022.\n\nWe measure our investment in IQHQ at cost, less impairment if needed, with subsequent adjustments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer since it does not have a readily determinable fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized realized and unrealized gains on our investment in IQHQ totaling $26.2 million resulting from a partial redemption of our investment during June 2022. There were no observable price changes in 2023.\n\n## Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized gains on the disposition of real estate of $8.0 million comprised of $1.9 million from the contribution of real estate to an unconsolidated joint venture and a $6.1 million gain that resulted from the sale of one land parcel, compared to gains of $175.9 million recognized for the same period in 2022, that resulted from the sale of three apartment communities and one land parcel.\n\n## Lease Modification Income\n\nNo lease modifications occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $207.0 million of lease modification income related to the agreement entered into with AIR for the termination of the leases of four properties.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther  income  (expense),  net ,  includes  costs  associated  with  our  risk  management  activities,  partnership  administration expenses, fee income, and certain non-recurring items. For the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, Other  income  (expense),  net decreased  by  $4.8  million,  or  36.2%,  due  primarily  to  advisory  expenses  related  to  a strategic business review and the annual stockholder meeting incurred in 2022.\n\n## Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\n\nCertain aspects of our operations, including our development and redevelopment activities, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS entities. Additionally, our TRS entities hold investments in one of our apartment communities and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive.\n\nOur income tax benefit (expense) calculated in accordance with GAAP includes income taxes associated with the income or loss  of  our  TRS  entities.  Income  taxes,  as  well  as  changes  in  valuation  allowance  and  incremental  deferred  tax  items  in conjunction  with  intercompany  asset  transfers  and  internal  restructurings  (if  applicable),  are  included  in Income  tax  benefit (expense) in our C onsolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nConsolidated GAAP income or loss subject to tax consists of pretax income or loss of our taxable entities and income and gains retained by the REIT. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had consolidated net losses subject to tax of $15.2 million, compared to consolidated net income subject to tax of $88.8 million for the same period in 2022.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized income tax benefit of 12.8 million, compared to income tax expense of $17.3 million for the same period in 2022. The year-to-year change is due primarily to GAAP income taxes associated with the net lease modification income recognized in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our loan agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our available liquidity was $289.3 million, which consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 $122.6 million in cash and cash equivalents;\n- \u00b7 $16.7 million of restricted cash, including amounts related to tenant security deposits and escrows held by lenders for capital additions, property taxes, and insurance; and\n- \u00b7 $150.0 million of available capacity to borrow under our revolving secured credit facility.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had sufficient capacity on our construction loans to cover our remaining commitments on development  and  redevelopment  projects  of  approximately  $63.8  million.  The  initial  allocations  to  our  joint  ventures  have remaining unfunded commitments of $3.0 million. We also have unfunded commitments in the amount of $2.0 million related to four investments in entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal  operating  activities,  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  outstanding  debt,  capital  expenditures,  and  future investments. Additionally, our third-party property managers may enter into commitments on our behalf to purchase goods and services in connection with the operation of our apartment communities and our office building. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to historical levels.\n\nWe believe, based on the information available at this time, that we have sufficient cash on hand and access to additional sources of liquidity to meet our operational needs for the next twelve months.\n\nIn the event that our cash and cash equivalents, revolving secured credit facility, and cash provided by operating activities are  not  sufficient  to  cover  our  liquidity  needs,  we  have  the  means  to  generate  additional  liquidity,  such  as  from  additional property  financing  activity  and  proceeds  from  apartment  community  sales.  We  expect  to  meet  our  long-term  liquidity requirements, including debt maturities, development and redevelopment spending, and future investment activity, primarily through property financing activity, cash generated from operations, and the recycling of our equity. Our revolving secured credit facility matures in December 2024, prior to consideration of its one-year extension option.\n\n## Leverage and Capital Resources\n\nThe availability and cost of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We have taken steps to mitigate a portion of our short-term refunding risk. However, if property or development financing options become unavailable, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in capital spending or apartment community dispositions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 90% of our outstanding non-recourse property debt had a fixed interest rate and approximately 10% had a variable interest rate, all of which was hedged. In addition, the weighted-average contractual rate on our non-recourse debt was 4.8% and 4.6% inclusive of interest rate caps, and the average remaining term to maturity was 6.7 years. Our use of interest rate caps may vary from quarter to quarter depending on lender requirements, recycling of interest rate caps between projects, and our view on forecasted interest rates.\n\nWhile our primary sources of leverage are property-level debt and construction loans, we also have a secured $150.0 million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. As of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving secured credit facility, which requires that we maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, minimum tangible net worth of $625.0 million, and maximum leverage of 60% as defined in the credit agreement. We are currently in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants during the next twelve months.\n\n## Changes in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n\nThe following discussion relates to changes in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this report.",

        "page_content": "## Operating Activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $50.5 million. Our operating cash flow  is  primarily  affected  by  rental  rates,  occupancy  levels,  operating  expenses  related  to  our  portfolio  of  apartment communities and general and administrative costs. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased  by  $153.8  million  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2022,  due  primarily  to  cash  received  from  development  and redevelopment property lease terminations in 2022, lower net operating income associated with apartment communities sold in the latter part of 2022, and timing of balance sheet position changes, partially offset by decreased interest payments.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities of $260.4 million consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $272.5 million, offset by $9.3 million of proceeds received from the disposition of real estate. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $139.6 million compared to the same period in 2022, due primarily to increased capital expenditures and lower proceeds from dispositions of real estate, offset by decreased funding for net real estate and investment transactions.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities of $119.4 million consisted primarily of proceeds from construction loans, the sale of a participation in the Mezzanine Investment, and the monetization of interest rate options, partially offset by repayments on non-recourse property debt and common stock repurchases. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $217.7 million compared to the same period ended in 2022, due primarily to prior year repayment and borrowing activity, offset by current year activity, including increased proceeds from construction loans, the sale of a participation in the Mezzanine Investment and the monetization of interest rate options.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nWe  use  EBITDAre  and Adjusted  EBITDAre  in  managing  our  business  and  in  evaluating  our  financial  condition  and operating  performance.  These  key  financial  indicators  are  non-GAAP  measures  and  are  defined  and  described  below.  We provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\nEarnings Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate ('EBITDAre')\n\nEBITDAre and Adjusted  EBITDAre  are  non-GAAP  measures,  which  we  believe  are  useful  to  investors,  creditors,  and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of our ability to incur and service debt because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and allow for comparison of our credit strength to different companies. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators  of  liquidity.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  method  of  calculating  EBITDAre  and  Adjusted  EBITDAre  is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Nareit defines EBITDAre as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, further adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 gains and losses on the dispositions of depreciated property;\n- \u00b7 impairment write-downs of depreciated property;\n- \u00b7 impairment write-downs of investments in unconsolidated partnerships caused by a decrease in the value of the depreciated property in such partnerships; and\n- \u00b7 adjustments to reflect our share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities.\n\nEBITDAre is defined by Nareit and provides for an additional performance measure independent of capital structure for greater comparability between real estate investment trusts. We define Adjusted EBITDAre as EBITDAre adjusted to exclude the effect of net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests, and realized and unrealized (gains) losses on interest rate options, which we believe allow investors to compare a measure of our earnings before the effects of our capital structure and indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry. Additionally, we exclude the (income) loss recognized on our Mezzanine Investment.",

We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impairment of Real Estate and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\nQuarterly, or when changes in circumstances warrant, we will assess our real estate properties and other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on certain factors. Such factors include, among other things, operational performance, market conditions, our intent and ability to hold the related asset, as well as any significant cost overruns on development projects.\n\nIf a real estate property or other long-lived asset has an indicator of impairment, we assess its recoverability by comparing the  carrying  amount  to  our  estimate  of  the  undiscounted  future  cash  flows,  excluding  interest  charges,  of  the  asset.  If  the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the  carrying  amount  exceeds  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  asset.  There  were  no  such  impairments  for  the  years  ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment\n\nOn  a  periodic  basis,  we  assess  the  Mezzanine  Investment  for  impairment. An  investment  is  considered  impaired  if  we determine  that  its  fair  value  is  less  than  the  net  carrying  value  of  the  investment  on  an  other-than-temporary  basis.  We determined  our  Mezzanine  Investment  was  impaired  on  an  other-than-temporary  basis  after  considering  various  factors, including the purchaser's option expiration, the loan's maturity date, and the decline in value of the real estate collateral due to an increased capitalization rate. As a result, we have recognized a $158.0 million non-cash impairment to reduce the carrying value of the Mezzanine Investment to zero as of December 31, 2023. This non-cash impairment is inclusive of the 20% noncontrolling participation sold in June 2023. Although we do not expect proceeds from the Mezzanine Investment to exceed our first priority return requiring repayment of the $33.5 million received, we are unable to derecognize the Mezzanine investment participation sold in accordance with GAAP.",

        "page_content": "## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur chief market risks are refunding risk, that is the availability of property debt or other cash sources to refund maturing property debt, and repricing risk, that is the possibility of increases in base interest rates and credit risk spreads. We primarily use long-dated, fixed-rate, non-recourse property debt on stabilized properties in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short-term borrowings.\n\nWe use working capital primarily to fund short-term uses. We use derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately $81.3 million of variable-rate property-level debt outstanding and $267.7 million of variable-rate construction loans. The impact of rising interest rates is mitigated by our use of interest rate caps, which as of December 31, 2023, provided protection for our variable interest rate debt. Our use of interest rate caps may vary from quarter to quarter depending on lender requirements, recycling of interest rate caps between projects, and our view on forecasted interest rates. We estimate that an increase or decrease in our variable rate indices of 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads, would have no impact on interest expense on an annual basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we held interest rate caps with $627.4 million notional value. These instruments were acquired for $5.8 million and at December 31, 2023, were valued at $5.2 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $139.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, a portion of which earns interest at variable rates.\n\n## ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe independent registered public accounting firm's reports, consolidated financial statements and schedule listed in the 'Index to Financial Statements' on page F-1 of this Annual Report are filed as part of this report and incorporated herein by this reference.\n\n## ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Aimco\n\n## Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nAimco's management, with the participation of Aimco's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, Aimco's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, Aimco's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by Aimco's Board, management and  other  personnel  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  includes  those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of assets;",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA  company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.

In our opinion, Aimco OP L.P. (the Partnership) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  the  Partnership  as  of  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  the  related  consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 26, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe  Partnership's  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA  company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nDenver, Colorado February 26, 2024",

held twelve meetings during the year ended December 31, 2023. During 2023, there were the following four committees: Audit; Compensation and Human Resources; Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance; and Investment. During 2023, no director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate total number of meetings of the Board and each committee on which such director served.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Guidelines, as described below, provide that the Company generally expects that the Chairman of the Board will attend all annual and special meetings of the stockholders. Other members of the Board are not required to attend such meetings. Eight of Aimco's directors attended the Company's 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including the Chairman of the Board, and the Company anticipates that the full Board will attend the annual meeting this year.\n\nBelow is a table illustrating the current standing committee memberships and chairmen. Additional detail on each committee follows the table.\n\n| Director           | Audit Committee   | Compensation  and   Human Resources Committee   | Nominating,  Environmental,  Social, and  Governance Committee   | Investment  Committee   |\n|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Quincy L.

The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee oversees a related party transactions policy requiring review and approval of such transactions to help ensure that Aimco's decisions are based on considerations only in the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders.\n\nPledging or hedging shares held to satisfy stock ownership requirements. The Company's insider trading policy prohibits officers, directors, and certain other employees from engaging in pledging transactions and prohibits officers, directors, and all other employees from engaging in any hedging transactions.\n\nInterlocking Directorships. No member of Aimco management serves on a board or a compensation committee of a company at which an Aimco director is also an employee.\n\nDirector Overboarding. Aimco's corporate governance guidelines and committee charters limit the number of other boards and the number of other audit committees on which an Aimco director may serve. Typically, an Aimco director is limited to service on four or fewer boards (including the Company's) and is limited to service on three or fewer audit committees, including the Company's.\n\nRetirement Age or Term Limits. Rather than impose arbitrary limits on service, the Company regularly (and at least annually) reviews each director's continued role on the Board and considers the need for regular board refreshment.\n\n## CODE OF ETHICS\n\nThe Board has adopted a code of ethics entitled 'Code of Business Conduct and Ethics' that applies to the members of the Board, all of Aimco's executive officers and all teammates of Aimco or its subsidiaries, including Aimco's principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com) and is also available in print to stockholders, upon written request to Aimco's Corporate Secretary. If, in the future, Aimco amends, modifies, or waives a provision in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, rather than filing a Current Report on Form 8-K, Aimco intends to satisfy any applicable disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K by posting such information on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com), as necessary.",

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\n## COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS (CD&A)\n\nThis CD&A addresses the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Stockholder Engagement;\n- \u00b7 Overview of Aimco's Pay-for-Performance Philosophy\n- \u00b7 Overview of Aimco's Post-Separation and 2023 Performance Results;\n- \u00b7 Summary of Executive Compensation Program and Governance Practices;\n- \u00b7 What We Pay and Why: Components of Executive Compensation;\n- \u00b7 Total Compensation for 2023;\n- \u00b7 Other Compensation;\n- \u00b7 Post-Employment Compensation and Employment and Severance Arrangements;\n- \u00b7 Other Benefits; Perquisite Philosophy;\n- \u00b7 Stock Ownership Guidelines and Required Holding Periods After Vesting;\n- \u00b7 Role of Outside Consultants;\n- \u00b7 Base Salary, Incentive Compensation, and Equity Grant Practices;\n- \u00b7 2024 Compensation Targets; and\n- \u00b7 Accounting Treatment and Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation.\n\n## STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\n\nAt Aimco's 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 91% of the votes cast in the advisory vote to approve executive compensation (also commonly referred to as \"Say on Pay\") approved the compensation of Aimco's named executive officers (\"NEOs\") as disclosed in Aimco's 2023 proxy statement.  The Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the 'Committee') and Aimco management considered these results and remain committed to extensive engagement with stockholders as part of ongoing efforts to formulate and implement an executive compensation program designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. In 2022 and 2023, we engaged with stockholders representing more than 80% of our outstanding shares on a broad range of topics, including executive compensation. The Company continued to receive broad support from stockholders on its executive compensation program, including the program's structure, the program's alignment with pay and performance, the quantum of compensation delivered under the program, and the level of disclosure.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF AIMCO'S PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY\n\nAimco is a pay-for-performance organization. Aimco starts by setting target total compensation near the median of target total compensation for Aimco's peers as identified below, to provide an economic incentive to remain with Aimco. Actual compensation varies from target compensation based on Aimco's results. Each officer's annual cash incentive compensation, 'short term incentive' or STI, is based in part on Aimco's performance against corporate, rather than individual, goals. The more senior the officer, the greater the percentage of his or her STI that is based on Aimco's performance against its corporate goals. Aimco's longer term compensation, 'long term incentive' or LTI, follows a similar tiered structure. Each officer's LTI is based in part on relative 'total stockholder return' or TSR, with NEOs having a greater share of their LTI based on relative TSR. In the case of Mr. Powell, his entire LTI award is 'at risk' based on Aimco's relative TSR. LTI is measured and vests over time, so that officers bear longer term exposure to the decisions they make.",

        "page_content": "## SUMMARY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES\n\nBelow we summarize certain executive compensation program and governance practices, including practices we have implemented to drive performance and practices we avoid because we believe they would not serve our stockholders' long-term interests.\n\n| What Aimco Does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pays for performance.  A significant portion of executive pay is not guaranteed, but rather is at risk and tied to key financial and value creation metrics that are  set in advance and disclosed to stockholders. All of the incentive compensation (both STI and LTI) for Mr. Powell is subject to the achievement of various  performance objectives. For the other NEOs, all STI compensation, and two-thirds of target LTI compensation is subject to the achievement of various  performance objectives. |\n| Balances short-term and long-term incentives.  The incentive programs provide a balance of annual and longer-term incentives, with LTI compensation  vesting over multiple years comprising a substantial percentage of target total compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Uses multiple performance metrics.  These mitigate the risk of the undue influence of a single metric by utilizing multiple performance measures. Such  measures differ for STI and LTI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Caps award payouts.  Amounts or shares that can be earned under the STI plan and LTI plan are capped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Uses market-based approach for determining NEO target pay.  Target total compensation for NEOs is generally set near the median for peer comparators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Maintains stock ownership guidelines and holding periods after vesting until ownership guidelines are met.  Aimco has the following minimum equity  ownership requirements: CEO - five times base salary; and other executive officers - three times base salary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Includes double-trigger change in control provisions.  Equity awards include 'double trigger' provisions requiring both a change in control and a subsequent  termination of employment (other than for cause) for accelerated vesting to occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Uses an independent compensation consulting firm.  The Committee engages an independent compensation consulting firm that specializes in the real estate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Maintains a claw back policy.  In the event of an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements, the claw back  policy provides for the recovery of incentive compensation paid to executives based on the misstated financial information. The policy covers all forms of  bonus, incentive, and equity compensation.                                                                                                                                             |\n| Conducts a risk assessment.  The Committee annually conducts a compensation risk assessment to determine whether the compensation policies and  practices, or components thereof, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\nActs through an independent Compensation Committee. The Committee consists entirely of independent directors.\n\n## What Aimco Does Not Do\n\nGuarantee salary increases, bonuses or equity grants. The Company does not guarantee annual salary increases or bonuses. The Company makes no guaranteed commitments to grant equity-based awards.\n\nProvide excise tax gross-up payments. The Company does not have, and will not enter into, any contractual arrangements that include excise tax gross-up payments.\n\nReprice options. The Company has never repriced the per-share exercise price of any outstanding stock options. Repricing of stock options is not permitted under the Company's Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the '2015 Plan') without first obtaining approval from the stockholders of the Company.\n\nPay dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned performance shares. Performance share award agreements provide for the payment of dividends only if and after the shares are earned. Dividends, if any, accrue during the performance period and are paid once shares are earned.\n\nProvide more than minimal personal benefits. The Company does not provide executives with more than minimal perquisites, such as reserved parking spaces.",

In setting Mr. Powell's target total compensation for 2023, the Committee considered, among other things, the Company's peer group compensation data as discussed below and Mr. Powell's relevant expertise and experience. For 2023, the Committee set Mr. Powell's target total compensation near the median for the peer group. The Committee devised a compensation plan for Mr. Powell that resulted in approximately 16% base salary, 20% STI (based entirely on Aimco's performance against its 2023 corporate goals), and 64% LTI (based entirely on relative TSR). Mr. Powell's target compensation mix is illustrated as follows:\n\nHow the Committee determines the amount of target total compensation for the other executive officers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to reviewing the performance of, and determining the compensation for, the CEO, the Committee also reviews and approves the decisions made by the CEO as to the compensation of Aimco's other executive officers. Base salary, target STI, and target LTI are generally set near the median base salary, target STI, and target LTI for our peer comparators.\n\n## How peer comparators are identified\n\nThe Committee, with the advice of its independent executive compensation consultant, developed a peer group for purposes of benchmarking NEO compensation based on industry and business strategy. The peer group ranged from 0.4x to 1.76x Aimco's total capitalization, with Aimco at the 70th percentile, and with Aimco at the 58th and 37th percentile based on total assets and gross depreciable property, respectively. Based on this analysis, Aimco included as 'peers' for 2023 target compensation the following 12 real estate companies:\n\n|                                        | Peer Group                 |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| American Assets Trust, Inc.            | Five Point Holdings, LLC   |\n| Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc.        | Forestar Group Inc.        |\n| Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. | JBG SMITH Properties       |\n| Centerspace                            | Seritage Growth Properties |\n| Clipper Realty, Inc.                   | The St. Joe Company        |\n| Elme Communities                       | Veris Residential, Inc.    |\n\nRisk analysis of Aimco's compensation programs\n\nThe Committee considers risk-related matters when making decisions with respect to executive compensation and has determined that neither Aimco's executive compensation program nor any of its non-executive compensation programs create risk-taking incentives that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the organization. Aimco's compensation programs align management incentives with the long-term interests of the Company.",

        "page_content": "## Aimco's Compensation Program Discourages Excessive Risk-Taking\n\nLimits on STI. The compensation of executive officers and other teammates is not overly weighted toward STI. Moreover, STI is capped.\n\nUse of LTI. LTI is included in target total compensation and typically vests over a period of three to four years. The vesting period encourages officers to focus on sustaining Aimco's long-term performance. Executive officers with more responsibility for strategic and operating decisions have a greater percentage of their target total compensation allocated to LTI. LTI is capped at two times target, or 200%, for the CEO, and 1.67 times target, or 167%, for the other NEOs.\n\nStock ownership guidelines and required holding periods after vesting. Aimco's stock ownership guidelines require all executive officers to hold a specified amount of Aimco equity. Any executive officer who has not yet satisfied the stock ownership requirements for his or her position must retain LTI after its vesting until stock ownership requirements are met. These policies ensure each executive officer has a substantial amount of personal wealth tied to long-term holdings in Aimco stock.\n\nShared performance metrics across the organization. A portion of STI for the NEOs is based upon Aimco's performance against its corporate goals, which are reviewed and approved by the Committee. One hundred percent of Mr. Powell's STI, and 50% of the STI for the other NEOs, is based upon Aimco's performance against its corporate goals. In addition, having shared performance metrics across the organization reinforces Aimco's focus on a collegial and collaborative team environment.\n\nLTI based on TSR. One hundred percent of the Mr. Powell's LTI, and 67% of the LTI for the other NEOs, is based on relative TSR.\n\nMultiple performance metrics. Aimco had five corporate goals for 2023. In addition, through Aimco's performance management program, Managing Aimco Performance, or MAP, which sets and monitors performance objectives for every teammate, each teammate had several different individual performance goals that are set at the beginning of the year and approved by management. Mses. Stanfield and Johnson had an average of six individual goals for 2023. Having multiple performance metrics inherently reduces excessive or unnecessary risk-taking, as incentive compensation is spread among a number of metrics rather than concentrated in a few.\n\n## TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR 2023\n\nFor 2023, total compensation is the sum of base compensation earned in 2023, STI earned in 2023, and LTI awards granted in 2023. Additionally, total compensation for Ms. Stanfield includes a discretionary cash award approved by the Committee as described below under the heading \"Other Compensation.\"\n\n## Base Compensation for 2023\n\nFor 2023, Mr. Powell's base compensation was set at $625,000 (an increase from his 2022 base compensation of $550,000), near the median for CEOs in Aimco's peer group. Ms. Stanfield's base compensation was set at $475,000 (an increase from her 2022 base compensation of $450,000) and Ms. Johnson's base compensation was set at $425,000 (an increase from her 2022 base compensation of $395,000).\n\nShort-Term Incentive Compensation for 2023\n\nThe Committee determined Mr. Powell's STI by the extent to which Aimco met five designated corporate goals, which are described below and are referred to as Aimco's Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs.\n\nFor the other NEOs, calculation of STI was determined by two components: Aimco's performance against the KPI; and each officer's achievement of her individual MAP goals. For example, if an executive's target STI was $400,000 and weighted 50% on KPIs, then 50% of that amount, or $200,000, varied based on KPI results and 50% of that amount, or $200,000, varied based on MAP results. As actual KPI results were 119.80% of target in 2023, then the executive would receive 119.80% of $200,000 ($239,600) for the KPI portion of her STI, and if MAP results were 100%, such hypothetical executive would receive 100% of the $200,000, for a total STI payment of $439,600.",

        "page_content": "An explanation of the objective of each goal and performance levels and payouts for each goal is set forth below.\n\nPortfolio Management (20% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objective to achieve rent growth for its stabilized portfolio based on high levels of resident retention, through superior customer selection and satisfaction, coupled with disciplined innovation resulting in sustained cost control, to maximize NOI margins. For 2023, the range for stabilized portfolio NOI was as follows: 'Threshold' equated to achievement of five percent unfavorable to 2023 budgeted NOI; 'Target' equated to achievement of 2023 budgeted NOI; and 'Maximum' equated to five percent favorable to 2023 budgeted NOI. Stabilized property NOI was 0.7% above budgeted NOI. This resulted in a payout on the Portfolio Management goal of 22.80% for each of the NEOs.\n\nDevelopment and Redevelopment Execution (30% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objective of executing development, redevelopment, and lease-up projects pursuant to the Company's 2023 budget and plan. Large and/or complex projects provided increased weighting toward the total goal weighting of 30%, while smaller scale projects provided lower weighting toward the total goal weighting. Achievement for each project was determined with reference to the 2023 budgeted investment and plan for the project, and was based on the extent to which the project work was completed on time and within budget, as well as, where applicable, the extent to which year-end occupancy and rental rates were consistent with the 2023 budget and plan. In 2023, Aimco's development and redevelopment projects were on track as measured by budget and lease-up metrics. Aimco completed construction and lease up of The Hamilton, a 276-home waterfront apartment community in Miami, FL, completed and opened The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, CO, and delivered and leased initial homes at Upton Place in Washington, D.C., and at Oak Shore in Corte Madera, CA. In total, Aimco delivered 350 new apartment homes, opened the 106-room hotel and event space, and completed five single family rental homes. At these projects, Aimco signed leases at rates, on average, 17% above underwritten levels. Aimco and its joint venture partner continued construction on a 220-apartment home development at Strathmore Square in Bethesda, MD. This resulted in a payout on this goal of 32.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nCapital Deployment and Allocation (20% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objective of effectively deploying capital into its existing pipeline of previously identified and/or controlled investment opportunities. In 2023, Aimco invested $234 million, including $51 million of Aimco equity, into active development projects and another $19 million in planning across four markets. Additionally, Aimco closed a 20% non-controlling position in the Parkmerced mezzanine loan for $33.5 million. At the time of closing, the purchaser also pre-paid $4 million in interest on an option to acquire the remaining 80%. Separately, Aimco monetized its associated interest rate swaption for $54 million and invested the proceeds in a short-term treasury instrument as an ongoing hedge of the Parkmerced mezzanine loan investment. In total, Aimco monetized $91.5 million of its Parkmerced mezzanine investments. Aimco's joint venture in Fort Lauderdale, Florida monetized an additional portion of its investment by closing on the sale of the second of three land parcels along Broward Avenue. The 1.1-acre land parcel was sold for $31.2 million, more than double the original purchase price per acre. This resulted in a payout on this goal of 25.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nBalance Sheet (20% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objectives of maintaining abundant liquidity and other activities that strengthen Aimco's balance sheet and add financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2023, Aimco had access to $289.3 million, including $122.6 million of cash on hand, $16.7 million of restricted cash, and the capacity to borrow up to $150.0 million on its revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2023, 100% of Aimco's total debt was either fixed rate or hedged with interest rate cap protection and, including contractual extensions, Aimco has only $8.5 million, or less than 1% of its total debt, maturing prior to May 2026. This resulted in a payout on the balance sheet goal of 25.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nHuman Capital & Environmental, Social, and Governance (10% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Aimco's strategic objective of fostering a healthy environment of respect and innovation, empowering our human capital to create value, and furthering our broader commitment to corporate responsibility. In 2023, Aimco retained 100% of its officer team and reduced overall voluntary turnover by more than half year-over-year (from 14% voluntary turnover in 2022 to 6% in 2023). Every teammate is surveyed via a third-party, confidential survey performed on an annual basis. The team engagement score consists of the average of the responses to the questions that comprise the engagement index, on a scale of 1 to 5, for all teammates who complete the survey during the year. Team engagement for 2023 was 4.74 (up from 4.52 in 2022), a new Aimco record, based on a response rate of 100%. Aimco was recognized as a 'Healthiest Employer' by the Denver Business Journal, the South Florida Business Journal, and Healthiest Employers of Greater Washington, D.C., and certified as a 'Great Place to Work.' In 2023, Aimco refreshed its ESG policies and enhanced its disclosure pursuant to the TCFD. This resulted in a payout on the ESG goal of 15.00% for each of the NEOs.",

        "page_content": "Due to Aimco's overall achievement on each of its 2023 goals, Aimco's overall KPI performance was 119.80%. Accordingly, each NEO was awarded 119.80% of the portion of his or her target STI attributable to KPI.\n\nVarious of the key financial indicators we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are non-GAAP measures. Key non-GAAP measures we use are defined, described and, where appropriate, reconciled to the most comparable financial measures computed in accordance with GAAP under the Non-GAAP Measures heading within Part II, Item 7 of this filing.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards for 2023\n\nUnder the 2023 LTI program for executive officers, two forms of LTI awards were granted to NEOs on February 1, 2023, as follows: (1) performance-based restricted stock, which was granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, representing 100% of the 2023 LTI award for Mr. Powell and approximately two thirds of the respective 2023 LTI awards for Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, which vests as set forth below; and (2) time-based restricted stock, which was granted to Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, representing one-third of their respective 2023 LTI awards, with one-third of the awards vesting on each anniversary of the grant date subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting date. Aimco refers to the performancebased restricted stock as 'performance-based LTI awards' because the amount of restricted stock that vests, if any, is determined based on Aimco's relative TSR performance during a forward looking, three-year performance period, as described in detail below.\n\nThe Committee typically grants LTI awards at the time of its final compensation determination, generally in late January or early February.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Stanfield and Johnson. The Committee set threshold performance to be earned at 50% of target; target performance to be earned at 100% of target; and maximum performance to be earned at 200% of target. Performance below threshold will result in no amount earned. If performance is between threshold and target or between target and maximum, the amount earned will be interpolated. Performance-based LTI awards vest 100% following the end of the three-year performance period (based on attainment of TSR targets), for a three-year plan from start to finish, illustrated below, subject to the grantee's continued service to Aimco, and subject to a delay if absolute TSR for the three-year forward looking performance period is negative.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the purpose of calculating the number of shares of performance-based restricted stock to be granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, the dollar amount allocated to restricted stock was divided by $7.75 per share, which represents the per share value based on a Monte Carlo model calculated by a third party financial firm with particular expertise in the valuation of performance-based restricted stock. The share award agreements to which the performance-based restricted shares were granted do not provide for the payment of dividends, if any, until the shares are earned. Dividends, if any, accrue during the performance period.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating the number of shares of time-based restricted stock to be granted to Mses.

The Committee determined Mr. Powell's STI for 2023 would be based entirely on Aimco's performance against corporate goals, described above. The Committee calculated Mr. Powell's STI by multiplying his STI target of $781,000 by 119.80%, which was the Committee's payout determination having reviewed Aimco's overall performance against corporate goals, as described in detail above. The Committee granted Mr. Powell's LTI in the form of restricted stock on February 1, 2023, for the three-year performance period from January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2025; the LTI grant is entirely at risk, based on relative total stockholder returns over the performance period. Mr. Powell's 2023 target compensation and incentive compensation is summarized as follows:\n\n|                               |               | Target Total Incentive   | Target Total Incentive   | 2023 Incentive Compensation LTI   | 2023 Incentive Compensation LTI   | 2023 Incentive Compensation LTI                       |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                               |               | Compensation             | Compensation             | STI                               |                                   |                                                       |\n| Target Total Compensation ($) | Paid Base ($) | STI ($)                  | LTI ($)                  | ($) (1)                           | Time-Based Equity ($)             | Performance-Based Equity - Restricted Stock   ($) (2) |\n| 3,906,000                     | 625,000       | 781,000                  | 2,500,000                | 935,638                           | -                                 | 2,500,000                                             |\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOther NEO Compensation . For Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, an allocation of the target STI was made as follows: 50% of the target STI was calculated based on Aimco's performance against KPI and 50% of the target STI was calculated based on each executive's achievement of her individual MAP goals. As described above, Aimco's KPI performance was 119.80%. Accordingly, each was awarded 119.80% of the portion of her STI attributable to KPI.\n\nIn determining the MAP achievement component of 2023 STI, Mr. Powell made the following recommendations to the Committee: Ms. Stanfield's MAP objectives were achieved at 170% of target for her contributions to Aimco's balance sheet and to finance, capital allocation, and tax; and Ms. Johnson's MAP objectives were achieved at 155% of target for her leadership over legal matters, human capital, ESG efforts, and information technology. The Committee reviewed and approved Mr. Powell's recommendations with respect to Mses. Stanfield and Johnson. As described above, LTI for Mses. Stanfield and Johnson was granted on February 1, 2023, in the form of restricted stock. One-third of the LTI target vests ratably over three years, and is for the purpose of attracting and retaining key talent integral to the success of Aimco. Two-thirds of the LTI target is at risk, based on relative total stockholder returns for the three-year performance period from January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2025.

As part of the 2021 LTI program, the Company granted performance-share awards that might be earned based on relative TSR as compared to the Russell 200 Value Index (one-third weighting), FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index (one-third weighting), and Aimco's identified peer group (one-third weighting) over a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2023, with awards vesting 50% following the end of the three-year performance period (based on attainment of TSR targets) and 50% one year later, subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting date,for a four-year plan from start to finish. On January 31, 2024, the Committee determined that Aimco's three-year TSR was 2,190 basis points higher than the Russell 200 Value Index, 3,020 basis points higher than the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index, and at the 92nd percentile of the identified peer group for the",

In reviewing Ms. Stanfield's performance for 2023, Mr. Powell recommended to the Committee that Ms. Stanfield be provided a discretionary cash award in the amount of $75,000, for her efforts in negotiating and closing on the sale of a 20% non-controlling position in the Parkmerced mezzanine loan investment for $33.5 million plus $4 million in pre-paid interest on the remaining 80%, and the monetization of the associated interest rate swaption for $54 million. Because the cash bonus was a discretionary bonus paid in 2024, the bonus will be reflected in the 2024 Summary Compensation Table.\n\n## POST-EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYMENT AND SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS\n\n## 401(k) Plan\n\nAimco provides a 401(k) plan that is offered to all Aimco teammates. Aimco matches 100% of participant contributions to the extent of the first 3% of the participant's eligible compensation and 50% of participant contributions to the extent of the next 2% of the participant's eligible compensation. For 2023, the maximum match by Aimco was $13,200, which was the amount that Aimco matched for each of Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson's 2023 401(k) contributions.\n\nOther than the 401(k) plan, Aimco does not provide post-employment benefits. Aimco does not maintain a defined benefit pension plan, a supplemental executive retirement plan, or any other similar arrangements.\n\n## Executive Employment Arrangements\n\n2021 Powell Employment Agreement . On October 27, 2021, Aimco Development Company, LLC, an affiliate of the Company and the employer entity for Aimco's employees, entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Powell (the '2021 Employment Agreement'). The Committee evaluated the terms of the 2021 Employment Agreement in comparison to those of the CEOs of Aimco's peers. The 2021 Employment Agreement is for an initial term expiring on December 31, 2022. The 2021 Employment Agreement provides that on December 31, 2022, and on each subsequent one-year anniversary thereafter, the agreement shall be renewed for an additional one-year term unless either party gives written notice of intent not to renew to the other party at least 60 days before the end of the then calendar year. On each of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023, the 2021 Employment Agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term.\n\nThe 2021 Employment Agreement provides that the Committee shall review and set Mr. Powell's target total compensation on an annual basis in comparison to compensation paid to the Company's peers, taking into consideration experience, performance, and other relevant factors.\n\nPursuant to the 2021 Employment Agreement, upon termination of Mr. Powell's employment by Aimco Development Company, LLC without \"Cause,\" or by Mr. Powell for \"Good Reason\" (each as defined in the 2021 Employment Agreement), Mr. Powell is generally entitled to: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of (i) his annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) his target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination; (b) any short-term incentive bonus earned but unpaid for a prior fiscal year (the 'Prior Year STI'); (c) a pro-rata portion of the shortterm incentive bonus he would have earned for the year in which the termination occurs, based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance targets (the 'Pro Rata STI'); and (d) an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium for health and welfare plan coverage for Mr. Powell and his coverage dependents in effect on the date of termination (the 'monthly COBRA",

The vesting and exercisability of any equity awards held Mr. Powell on the date of termination would be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nIn the event of termination of Mr. Powell's employment by Aimco without \"Cause,\" or by Mr. Powell for \"Good Reason,\" in either case, within the period commencing six months prior to and ending 24 months following a 'Change in Control' (as defined in the 2021 Employment Agreement), then in lieu of the severance benefits described above, Mr. Powell will be entitled to: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to three times the sum of (i) his annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) his target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination; (b) the Prior Year STI; (c) the Pro Rata STI; (d) the monthly COBRA reimbursement multiplied by 36 months; and (e) 100% accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards then held by Mr. Powell (with performance-vesting awards vesting at the greater of target and actual performance).\n\nThe 2021 Employment Agreement provides that if Mr. Powell's employment is terminated by reason of his death or disability, then Mr. Powell will be eligible to receive the Prior Year STI and the Pro Rata STI. The vesting and exercise of any equity awards held by Mr. Powell at the time of his death or disability would be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nIn the event that any payment or benefit payable to Mr. Powell under the 2021 Employment Agreement would result in the imposition of excise taxes under the 'golden parachute' provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will either be made and/or provided in full or will be reduced such that the excise tax under Section 280G is not applicable, whichever is least economically disadvantageous to Mr. Powell. The 2021 Employment Agreement does not provide for any excise tax or other tax 'gross-up' payment.\n\nAll severance payments and benefits under the 2021 Employment Agreement are subject to applicable withholding obligations, Mr. Powell's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, and compliance with certain non-competition, nondisclosure, and non-solicitation covenants.\n\nNeither Ms. Stanfield nor Ms. Johnson has an employment agreement with the Company.\n\n## Executive Severance Arrangements\n\nAimco has an executive severance policy that provides that Aimco shall seek stockholder approval or ratification of any future severance agreement for any senior executive officer that provides for benefits, such as lump-sum or future periodic cash payments or new equity awards, in an amount in excess of 2.99 times such executive officer's base salary and bonus. Compensation and benefits earned through the termination date, the value of vesting or payment of any equity awards outstanding prior to the termination date, pro rata vesting of any other long-term awards, or benefits provided under plans, programs or arrangements that are applicable to one or more groups of employees in addition to senior executives are not subject to the policy. It has been Aimco's longstanding practice not to provide excessive severance arrangements.\n\nExecutive Severance Policy. On February 22, 2018, the Committee adopted the Apartment Investment and Management Company Executive Severance Policy (the 'Executive Severance Policy'). The Executive Severance Policy superseded and replaced any employment agreement or other plan, policy or practice involving the payment of severance benefits to participants under the Executive Severance Policy. On April 28, 2021, the Committee amended the Executive Severance Policy in accordance with recommendations provided by the Committee's compensation consultant to bring the policy in line with market. On October 27, 2021, the Committee amended the Executive Severance Policy to remove severance provisions for the Chief Executive Officer in connection with the Committee's approval of an employment agreement for Mr. Powell that includes severance provisions that are consistent with the severance to which he may otherwise become entitled under the Executive Severance Policy. The Company's Executive Vice Presidents, as determined on the records of the Company and any other entities through which the operations of the Company are conducted, are eligible to participate in the Executive Severance Policy. Each of Mses. Stanfield and Johnson are participants under the Executive Severance Policy.\n\nThe Executive Severance Policy provides that if the Company terminates a participant's employment without 'Cause,' or if the participant terminates his or her employment for 'Good Reason' (each as defined in the Executive Severance Policy), then the participant will be eligible to receive the following benefits:",

In addition, the vesting and exercise of any equity awards held by the participant at the time of his or her death or disability will be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nIn the event that any payment or benefit payable to a participant under the Executive Severance Policy would result in the imposition of excise taxes under the 'golden parachute' provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will either be made and/or provided in full or will be reduced such that the excise tax under Section 280G is not applicable, whichever is least economically disadvantageous to the participant. The Executive Severance Policy does not provide for any excise tax or other tax 'gross-up' payment.\n\nAll severance payments and benefits under the Executive Severance Policy are subject to applicable withholding obligations, the participant's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, and compliance with certain non-competition, nondisclosure and non-solicitation covenants set forth in a restrictive covenant agreement that is appropriate for the participant's position.\n\nThe Executive Severance Policy will remain in effect, subject to amendment, until terminated by the Board. The Board may terminate or amend the Executive Severance Policy at any time, so long as at least 90 days' prior notice is provided to any participant if the termination or amendment of the Executive Severance Policy would materially or adversely affect the rights of the participant.\n\n## Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements\n\nEffective in connection with their promotions by Aimco for Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, Aimco entered into certain non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with each executive. Mr. Powell's non-competition and nonsolicitation agreement was replaced by his 2021 Employment Agreement. Pursuant to these agreements, each of these NEOs agreed that during the term of his or her employment with the Company and for a period of two years following the termination of his or her employment without \"Cause\" (as defined in the non-competition and non-solicitation agreement), except in circumstances where there was a change in control of the Company, he or she would not (i) be employed by a competitor of the Company described on a schedule to the agreement, (ii) solicit other employees to leave the Company's employment, or (iii) solicit customers of Aimco to terminate their relationship with the Company. The agreements further require that the NEOs protect Aimco's trade secrets and confidential information. For Mr. Powell, the non-solicitation requirement survives a change in control of the Company. For Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, the agreements provide that in order to enforce the above-noted non-competition condition following the executive's termination of employment by the Company without cause, the executive",

        "page_content": "will receive, for a period not to extend beyond the earlier of 24 months following such termination or the date of acceptance of employment with a non-competitor, (i) non-compete payments in an amount, if any, to be determined by the Company in its sole discretion and (ii) a monthly payment equal to two-thirds of such executive's monthly base salary at the time of termination. For purposes of these agreements, 'cause' is defined to mean, among other things, the executive's (i) breach of the agreement, (ii) failure to perform required employment services, (iii) misappropriation of Company funds or property, (iv) conviction, plea of guilty, or plea of no contest to a crime involving fraud or moral turpitude, or (v) negligence, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, misconduct or violation of law.\n\n## Equity Award Agreements\n\nDouble Trigger Vesting Upon Change in Control . The award agreements pursuant to which restricted stock, stock option, and/or LTIP Unit awards have been granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, as applicable, provide that if (i) a change in control occurs and (ii) the executive's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Company without \"Cause\" or by the executive for \"Good Reason\" (each as defined in the equity award agreement), in either case, within the period commencing six months prior to and ending 24 months following a change in control, then (a) for time-based restricted stock and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock and LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested, and (b) for performance-based restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested based on the higher of actual or target performance through the truncated performance period ending on the date of the change in control, and all vested stock options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option.\n\nAccelerated Vesting Upon Termination of Employment Due to Death or Disability . The award agreements pursuant to which restricted stock, stock option, and/or LTIP Unit awards have been granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, as applicable, provide that upon a termination of employment due to death or disability, then (a) for time-based restricted stock and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock and LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested, and (b) for performance-based restricted stock, stock option, and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested based on the higher of actual or target performance through the truncated performance period ending on the date of termination, and all vested stock options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option.\n\n## OTHER BENEFITS; PERQUISITE PHILOSOPHY\n\nAimco's executive officer benefit programs are substantially the same as for all other eligible officers and employees. Aimco does not provide executives with more than minimal perquisites, such as reserved parking places.\n\n## STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES AND REQUIRED HOLDING PERIODS AFTER VESTING\n\nAimco believes that it is in the best interest of Aimco's stockholders for Aimco's executive officers to own Aimco equity. Every year, the Committee and CEO review Aimco's stock ownership guidelines, each executive officer's holdings in light of the stock ownership guidelines, and each executive officer's accumulated realized and unrealized restricted stock, stock option, and LTIP Unit gains. The Committee last updated the stock ownership guidelines in April 2022.\n\nEquity ownership guidelines for all executive officers are determined as a multiple of the executive's base salary. The Committee and management have established the following stock ownership guidelines for Aimco's executive officers:\n\n| Officer Position                | Ownership Target   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Chief Executive Officer         | 5x base salary     |\n| Other Executive Vice Presidents | 3x base salary     |\n\nAny executive officer who has not satisfied the stock ownership guidelines must, until the stock ownership guidelines are satisfied, hold 50% of any restricted stock that vests, after deduction of restricted stock sold for payment of income taxes related to the vesting, and hold shares equal to 50% of (i) the value realized upon option exercises less (ii) related income taxes.\n\nEach of Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson exceeded the ownership targets established in Aimco's stock ownership guidelines as of the date of this filing.",

        "page_content": "## ROLE OF OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS\n\nThe Committee has the authority under its charter to engage the services of outside advisors, experts and others to assist the Committee. In 2023, the Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson to advise the Committee regarding Aimco's executive compensation plan. Willis Towers Watson did not provide other services to Aimco. The Committee assessed the independence of Willis Towers Watson pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that Willis Towers Watson is independent.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee directed Willis Towers Watson to: (i) perform studies of competitive compensation practices; (ii) develop conclusions and recommendations regarding Aimco's executive compensation plans for consideration by the Committee; (iii) identify an executive compensation peer group; (iv) perform a benchmarking analysis of the base salary, STI, and LTI of the NEOs relative to competitive practices; (v) advise the Committee regarding stock ownership guidelines for the NEOs; and (vi) perform an assessment of the risks contained in Aimco's incentive compensation plans.\n\n## BASE SALARY, INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, AND EQUITY GRANT PRACTICES\n\nBase salary adjustments typically take effect on January 1. The Committee determines incentive compensation in late January or early February. STI is typically paid in February or March. LTI is granted on a date determined by the Committee, typically in late January or early February.\n\nAimco grants equity in three scenarios: in connection with its annual incentive compensation program as discussed above; in connection with certain new-hire or promotion packages; and for purposes of retention.\n\nWith respect to LTI, the Committee sets the grant date for the restricted stock, stock option, and LTIP Unit grants. The Committee typically sets grant dates at the time of its final compensation determination, generally in late January or early February. The date of determination and date of award are not selected based on share price. In the case of new-hire packages that include equity awards, grants are made on the executive's start date or on a date designated in advance based on the passage of a specific number of days after the executive's start date. For non-executive officers, as provided for in the 2015 Plan, the Committee has delegated the authority to make equity awards, up to certain limits, to the Chief Financial Officer (Ms. Stanfield) and/or Corporate Secretary (Ms. Johnson). The Committee and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson time grants without regard to the share price or the timing of the release of material non-public information and do not time grants for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.\n\n## 2024 COMPENSATION TARGETS\n\nBased on comparison to compensation paid to CEOs at Aimco's peers, the Committee set Mr. Powell's target total compensation (base compensation, STI and LTI) for 2024 at approximately $3.6 million, which approximated the peer median. The Committee set target total compensation (base compensation, STI and LTI) for 2024 for the other NEOs as follows: Ms. Stanfield - approximately $1.6 million; and Ms. Johnson - approximately $1.3 million. Aimco performance will determine the amounts paid for 2024 STI and the portion of LTI awards that vest, and such amounts may be less than, or in excess of, these target amounts. STI will be paid in cash. The LTI was granted on January 31, 2024, and was in the form of time- and performance-vesting restricted stock (or in the case of Mr. Powell, solely in the form of performance-vesting restricted stock).\n\n## ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nThe Committee generally considers the accounting treatment and tax implications of the compensation awarded or paid to our executives. Grants of equity compensation awards under our long-term incentive program are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 718. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction to any publicly held corporation for compensation paid to certain executive officers that exceeds $1.0 million in any taxable year. The Company has awarded, and may continue to award, compensation as it considers appropriate that does not qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m).\n\n## Compensation and Human Resources Committee Report to Stockholders\n\nThe Compensation and Human Resources Committee held five meetings during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion & Analysis with management. Based upon such review, the related discussions, and such other matters deemed relevant and appropriate by the",

The terms of these arrangements are described under 'CD&A - Post-Employment Compensation and Employment and Severance Arrangements - Executive Employment Arrangements, Executive Severance Arrangements, and Equity Award Agreements' above.\n\nIn the table that follows, potential payments and other benefits payable upon termination of employment and change in control situations are set out as if the conditions for payments had occurred and/or the terminations took place on December 31, 2023. In setting out such payments and benefits, amounts that had already been earned as of the termination date, including 2023 STI, which would have been earned as of the termination date but not yet paid, are not shown. Also, benefits that are available to all full-time regular employees when their employment terminates are not shown. The amounts set forth below are estimates of the amounts that could be paid out to the NEOs upon their termination. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such NEOs' separation from Aimco. The following table summarizes the potential payments under various scenarios if they had occurred on December 31, 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the principal executive officer. The disclosure is required for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The annual total compensation for 2023 for Mr. Powell, our CEO, was $4,073,841, as reported under the heading 'Summary Compensation Table.' Our median employee's total compensation for 2023 was $224,236. As a result, we estimate that Mr. Powell's 2023 total compensation was approximately 18 times that of our median employee.\n\nOur CEO to median employee pay ratio was calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining 2023 total compensation, consisting of base salary, annual bonus amounts, stock-based compensation (based on the grant date fair value of awards granted during 2023) and other incentive payments for all individuals who were employed by Aimco on December 31, 2023, other than our CEO. Our measuring date of December 31 remained the same as last year. We included all active employees and annualized the compensation for any employees who were not employed by Aimco for the full 2023 calendar year. After identifying the median employee based on 2023 total compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the 'Total' column in the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n## DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nIn formulating its recommendation for director compensation, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviews director compensation for independent directors of companies in the real estate industry and companies of comparable market capitalization, revenue, and assets and considers compensation trends for other NYSE-listed companies. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee also considers the size of the Board as compared to other boards, the participation of each independent director on committees, and the resulting workload on the directors. In addition, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee considers the overall cost of the Board to the Company and the cost per director.\n\n## 2023 Compensation\n\nFor 2023, based on the advice of Aimco's independent compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, with such advice based on a review of director compensation for Aimco's identified peer group, compensation for the non-management directors included an annual fee of $200,000, payable up to 50% in the form of a cash retainer with the remainder in stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units. The stock, stock options, and LTIP Units were awarded on February 1, 2023. The closing price of Aimco's Common Stock on the NYSE on February 1, 2023, was $7.59. Ms. Rexroad, who joined the Board on March 27, 2023, was awarded a prorated annual fee of $150,000, which was awarded in stock on March 27, 2023. The closing price of Aimco's Common Stock on the NYSE on March 27, 2023, was $7.13.\n\nAdditional retainers for Board leadership positions in 2023 were as follows: Chairman of the Board - $65,000; Audit Committee Chairman - $20,000; Compensation and Human Resources Committee Chairman - $15,000; Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee Chairman - $14,000; and Investment Committee Chairman -$15,000. No meeting fees were paid to non-management directors for attending meetings of the Board and the committees on which they serve.",

        "page_content": "## ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\n\n## CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\n\n## Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions\n\nAimco recognizes that related person transactions can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that Aimco's decisions are based on considerations other than the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. Nevertheless, Aimco recognizes that there are situations where related person transactions may be in, or may not be inconsistent with, the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee, pursuant to a written policy approved by the Board, has oversight for related person transactions. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee will review transactions, arrangements or relationships in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $100,000 in any calendar year, (2) Aimco (or any Aimco entity) is a participant, and (3) any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than an interest arising solely as a result of being a director of another corporation or organization that is a party to the transaction or a less than ten percent beneficial owner of another entity that is a party to the transaction). The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee has also given its standing approval for certain types of related person transactions such as certain employment arrangements, director compensation, transactions with another entity in which a related person's interest is only by virtue of a non-executive employment relationship or limited equity position, and transactions in which all stockholders receive pro rata benefits.\n\n## Sublease of a Portion of Aimco Office Space\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Aimco entered into a sublease agreement (the 'Sublease') with an entity in which Mr. Considine, former Director who resigned from the Board in February 2023, has sole voting and investment power. Under this agreement, Aimco has subleased to said entity approximately 2,957 square feet of office space within the same building as Aimco's corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado, and consisting of excess space not needed by Aimco, on exactly the same terms as Aimco leases the space. The Sublease does not provide any benefit to the entity, as other space in the building requires comparable rent. The Sublease provides some benefit to Aimco as it gives Aimco the ability to put the excess space to productive use. The entity has a lease term less favorable than Aimco's lease with the landlord, in that Aimco has the option to terminate the Sublease at any time, for any or no reason, upon six months' notice. The Sublease has a term that began on April 1, 2019, and ends on April 30, 2029, the same term as the Aimco lease. The annual amount of rent in the first year was $78,361, subject to annual increases. The aggregate amount of rent expected to be paid under the Sublease, assuming the entire lease term is fulfilled, is approximately $850,000. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed the Sublease and determined that it is in the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders.\n\n## Related Person Transactions\n\nIn November 2019, Aimco confirmed an arrangement with Richard M. Powell, of R.M. Powell & Co., a contractor for Aimco since 1997 and father of Mr. Wes Powell, Director, President and CEO. Depending on the success of potential transactions identified by Mr. Richard Powell, he may earn fees in amounts in excess of $120,000. Pursuant to the Company's related party transactions policy, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed and approved the arrangement with Mr. Richard Powell, subject to the Committee's subsequent review and approval of any specific transaction in which R.M. Powell & Co. provides services.\n\nIn March 2020, Elizabeth Likovich, the daughter of Mr. Considine, former Director who resigned from the Board in February 2023, became a full-time employee of the Company. Her compensation for 2023 was in line with the median for her peers, and consisted of $302,614 in base salary, $140,200 in STI, $5,305 in non-discretionary matching contributions under Aimco's 401(k) plan, and $106,492 in equity awards vesting over three years. Prior to joining Aimco, Ms. Likovich held a similar position at a peer apartment company. Pursuant to the policy noted above, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed and approved the employment of Ms. Likovich.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe Board has determined that to be considered independent, a director may not have a direct or indirect material relationship with Aimco or its subsidiaries (directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). A material relationship is one that impairs or inhibits, or has the potential to impair or inhibit, a director's exercise of critical and disinterested judgment on behalf of Aimco and its stockholders. In determining whether a material relationship exists, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including whether the director or a family member is a current",

The Board consults with the Company's counsel to ensure that such determinations are consistent with all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the definition of 'independent director,' including but not limited to those categorical standards set forth in Section 303A.02 of the listing standards of the NYSE.\n\nConsistent with these considerations, the Board has affirmatively determined the independence of Messrs.

A summary of the Pre-Approval Policy is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Pre-Approval Policy describes the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and Other Permitted services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 Pre-approvals are typically subject to a dollar limit of $50,000.\n- \u00b7 The term of any general pre-approval is generally 12 months from the date of pre-approval.\n- \u00b7 At least annually, the Audit Committee reviews and pre-approves the services that may be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 Unless a type of service has received general pre-approval and is anticipated to be within the dollar limit associated with the general pre-approval, it requires specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it is to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee will consider whether all services are consistent with the rules on independent registered public accounting firm independence.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee also considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, for reasons such as its familiarity with Aimco's business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance Aimco's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. Such factors are considered as a whole, and no one factor is necessarily determinative.\n\nAll of the services described in the Principal Accountant Fees section above were approved pursuant to the annual engagement letter or in accordance with the Pre-Approval Policy.",

In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 26, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error  or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective  or  complex  judgments.  The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.",

As more fully described in Note 2 and Note  12  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  periodically  evaluates  the  mezzanine  investment for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized to adjust the investment to its estimated  fair value when the Company determines the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment  on an other-than-temporary basis.   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed  the Matter in Our  Audit          | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls  over the Company's process to determine the fair value of the mezzanine investment and measure the  impairment loss.

(the Partnership) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31,  2023,  and  the  related  notes  and  financial  statement  schedule  listed  in  the  Index  at  Item  15(a) (collectively  referred  to  as  the  'consolidated  financial  statements').  In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 26, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error  or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective  or  complex  judgments.  The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.",

        "page_content": "## Description  of  the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Partnership's process to determine the fair value of the mezzanine investment and measure the impairment loss. This included testing controls over management's evaluation of the significant inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.\n\nTo test the impairment loss on the mezzanine investment, our audit procedures included, among others, testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  the  information  included  in  the  valuation  model  and evaluating  the  capitalization  rate  that  was  used  to  estimate  fair  value.    With  the  assistance  of  our valuation  specialists,  we  compared  the  capitalization  rate  to  observable  market  data  and  published industry resources for comparable properties in the same or nearby markets.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Partnership's auditor since 2020.\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\n## Impairment of mezzanine investment\n\nDuring  2023  the  Partnership  recorded  an  impairment  loss  on  its  mezzanine  investment  of  $158.0 million to reduce the investment to its estimated fair value of zero. As more fully described in Note 2 and  Note  12  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Partnership  periodically  evaluates  the mezzanine investment for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized to adjust the investment to its estimated fair value when the Partnership determines the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment on an other-than-temporary basis.\n\nAuditing the Partnership's measurement of the impairment loss on the mezzanine investment involved a higher degree of judgment due to the subjective nature of the capitalization rate used in determining the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.",

On  December  15,  2020,  Aimco  completed  the separation  of  its  businesses  (the  'Separation'),  creating  two,  separate  and  distinct,  publicly  traded  companies,  Aimco  and Apartment Income REIT Corp. ('AIR') (Aimco and AIR together, as they existed prior to the Separation, 'Aimco Predecessor'). Events  noted  in  this  filing  as  occurring  before  December  15,  2020,  were  those  entered  into  by Aimco  Predecessor. Aimco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the general partner and directly is the special limited partner of Aimco OP L.P. (\"Aimco Operating Partnership\").\n\nExcept  as  the  context  otherwise  requires,  'we,'  'our,'  and  'us'  refer  to Aimco, Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  and  their consolidated subsidiaries, collectively.\n\n## Business\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Aimco owned 92.4% of the legal interest in the common partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership and 94.8% of the economic interest in Aimco Operating Partnership. The remaining 7.6% legal interest is owned by limited  partners.  The  common  partnership  units  of Aimco  Operating  Partnership  are  referred  to  as  \"OP  Units\". As  the  sole general  partner  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  Aimco  has  exclusive  control  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership's  day-to-day management.\n\nWe own or lease a portfolio of real estate investments focused primarily on the U.S. multifamily sector. At December 31, 2023,  our  entire  portfolio  of  operating  properties  includes  26  apartment  communities  (22  consolidated  properties  and  four unconsolidated properties). We also own one commercial office building that is part of an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building.  Properties  that  are  under  construction  or  have  not  achieved  stabilization  include  a  106  room  hotel,  three  residential apartment communities, of which 510 apartment homes have been completed and an additional 675 are planned, a single family rental community with 16 planned homes and eight accessory dwelling units, and land parcels held for development. Our real estate portfolio also includes two unconsolidated investments in land held for development. In addition, we hold other alternative investments, including our Mezzanine Investment (see Note 2 for further information); our investment in IQHQ, Inc. (\"IQHQ\"); and our investment in real estate technology funds.\n\nAny  reference  to  the  number  of  apartment  communities,  homes,  accessory  dwelling  units,  square  footage,  or  occupancy percentage in these notes to our consolidated financial statements is unaudited.\n\n## Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated  subsidiaries.  Aimco  Operating  Partnership's  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Aimco Operating  Partnership  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries.  All  significant  intercompany  balances  have  been  eliminated  in consolidation.\n\nAs used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, 'partnership' refers to a limited partnership or a limited liability company and 'partner' refers to a partner in a limited partnership or a member of a limited liability company.\n\nCertain  reclassifications  have  been  made  to  prior  period  amounts  to  conform  to  the  current  period  consolidated  financial statement  presentation  with  no  effect  on  the  Company's  previously  reported  results  of  operations,  financial  position,  or  cash flows.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nWe  consolidate  a  variable  interest  entity  ('VIE'),  in  which  we  are  considered  the  primary  beneficiary.  The  primary beneficiary  is  the  entity  that  has  (i)  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  the  entity's  economic performance  and  (ii)  the  obligation  to  absorb  losses  of  the  VIE  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  from  the  VIE  that  could  be significant to the VIE.

        "page_content": "## Common Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nCommon noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership consist of OP Units held by third parties, and are reflected  in  Aimco's  accompanying Consolidated  Balance  Sheets as Common  Noncontrolling  Interests  in  Aimco  Operating Partnership . Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss is allocated to the holders of OP Units, other than Aimco, based on the weighted-average number of OP Units (including Aimco) outstanding during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2023,  2022,  and  2021,  the  holders  of  OP  Units  had  a  weighted-average  economic  ownership  interest  in  Aimco  Operating Partnership of approximately 5.1%, 5.1%, and 5.0%, respectively. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Aimco are held by Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nRedeemable  noncontrolling  interests  consist  of  equity  interests  held  by  a  limited  partner  in  a  consolidated  real  estate partnership  that  has  a  finite  life.  If  a  consolidated  real  estate  partnership  includes  redemption  rights  that  are  not  within  our control, the noncontrolling interest is included as temporary equity.\n\nRedeemable  noncontrolling  interests  in  consolidated  real  estate  partnerships  as  of  December  31,  2023,  consists  of  the following: (i) a $102.0 million preferred equity interest in an entity that owns a portfolio of operating apartment communities and (ii) equity interests in two separate consolidated joint ventures that are actively developing residential apartment communities. Capital contributions, distributions, and net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships are determined in accordance with the relevant partnership agreements. These interests are presented as Redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe assets of our consolidated real estate partnerships must first be used to settle the liabilities of the consolidated real estate partnerships. The consolidated real estate partnership's creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nThe following table shows changes in our redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships during the years ended December 31, 2023 , and 2022 (in thousands):\n\n|                                | 2023      | 2022      |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Balance at Beginning of Period | $ 166,826 | $ 33,794  |\n| Capital contributions          | 125       | 138,479   |\n| Distributions                  | (9,243 )  | (9,365 )  |\n| Redemptions                    | -         | (4,911 )  |\n| Net income                     | 13,924    | 8,829     |\n| Balance at December 31,        | $ 171,632 | $ 166,826 |\n\n## Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nWe own general  and  limited  partner  interests  in  partnerships  that  either  directly,  or  through  interests  in  other  real  estate partnerships,  own  apartment  communities.  We  generally  account  for  investments  in  real  estate  partnerships  that  we  do  not consolidate under the equity method. Accordingly, we recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods presented, inclusive of our share of any impairments and disposition gains or losses recognized by and related to such entities, and we present such amounts within Income from unconsolidated real estate partnerships in  our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe  excess  of  our  cost  of  the  acquired  partnership  interests  over  our  share  of  the  partners'  equity  or  deficit  is  generally ascribed to the fair values of land and buildings owned by the partnerships. We amortize the excess cost ascribed to the buildings over the related estimated useful lives. Such amortization is recorded as an adjustment of the amounts of earnings or losses we recognize from such unconsolidated real estate partnerships.\n\nWe assess the recoverability of our equity method investments if there are indicators of potential impairment. We did not recognize any such impairments of our equity method investments during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Mezzanine Investment\n\nIn  November  2019, Aimco  Predecessor  made  a  five-year,  $275.0  million  mezzanine  loan  to  the  partnership  owning  the 'Parkmerced Apartments' located in southwest San Francisco (the 'Mezzanine Investment'). The loan bears interest at a 10% annual  rate,  accruing  if  not  paid  from  property  operations.  Legal  ownership  of  the  subsidiaries  that  originated  and  hold  the Mezzanine Investment was retained by AIR following the Separation.\n\nThe Separation Agreement with AIR provides for AIR to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the Mezzanine Investment, and a related equity option to acquire a 30% interest in the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments. At the time of Separation and as of the date of this filing, legal title of these subsidiaries had not yet transferred to us. Until legal title of the subsidiaries is transferred, AIR is obligated to pass payments received on the Mezzanine Investment to us, and we are obligated to indemnify AIR against any costs and expenses related thereto. We have the risks and rewards of ownership of the Mezzanine Investment and have recognized an asset related to our right to receive the Mezzanine Investment from AIR.\n\nIn June 2023, we closed on the sale of a 20% non-controlling participation in the Mezzanine Investment for $33.5 million. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we receive a first priority return from any payments made to service or pay down the Mezzanine  Investment  equal  to  $134.0  million  plus  no  less  than  a  19%  annualized  return  as  well  as  80%  of  any  residual payments after the purchaser receives a 10% annualized return on its subordinate investment. Additionally, we are responsible for the servicing and administration of the Mezzanine Investment.\n\nBecause we receive first priority and a higher return than the purchaser, the partial sale and transfer of the financial interest does not qualify for sale accounting in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, we recorded the cash received from the purchaser as a liability, which is included in Mezzanine investment - participation sold in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with GAAP. Although the cash received is accounted for as a liability in accordance with GAAP, no amount is due to the purchaser until after we receive $134.0 million plus our annualized return. Transaction costs have been deferred and presented as a direct reduction from the related liability in Mezzanine investment - participation sold in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The cash flows associated with the Mezzanine investment - participation sold have been included in Cash Flows from Financing Activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn connection with the participation sold, the purchaser also made a $4.0 million non-refundable payment for the option to acquire  the  remaining  80%  for  an  additional  $134  million  plus  our  annualized  return. The  option  expired  unexercised  in  the quarter  ended  December  31,  2023. As  a  result,  we  recognized  the  non-refundable  payment  in Mezzanine  investment  income (loss), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOn  a  periodic  basis,  we  assess  the  Mezzanine  Investment  for  impairment.  An  investment  is  considered  impaired  if  we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment on an other-than-temporary basis. We determined our  Mezzanine  Investment  was  impaired  on  an  other-than-temporary  basis  after  considering  various  factors,  including  the purchaser's option expiration, the loan's maturity date, and the decline in value of the real estate collateral due to an increased capitalization rate. As a result, we have recognized a $158.0 million non-cash impairment to reduce the carrying value of the Mezzanine  Investment  to  zero  as  of  December  31,  2023.  This  non-cash  impairment  is  inclusive  of  the  20%  non-controlling participation sold in June 2023. Although we do not expect proceeds from the Mezzanine Investment to exceed our first priority return requiring repayment of the $33.5 million received, we are unable to derecognize the Mezzanine investment - participation sold in accordance with GAAP.\n\nPrior  to  recording  a  non-cash  impairment  charge  during  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2022,  we  recognized  as income the net amounts earned on the Mezzanine Investment by AIR on its equity investment that were due to be paid to us when  collected  to  the  extent  the  income  was  supported  by  the  change  in  the  counterparty's  claim  to  the  net  assets  of  the underlying  borrower.  The  income  recognized  primarily  represented  the  interest  accrued  under  the  terms  of  the  underlying Mezzanine Investment.\n\n## Real Estate\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nUpon the acquisition of real estate, we determine whether the purchase qualifies as an asset acquisition or, less frequently, meets  the  definition  of  an  acquisition  of  a  business.  We  generally  recognize  the  acquisition  of  real  estate  or  interests  in partnerships that own real estate at our cost, including the related transaction costs, as asset acquisitions.",

        "page_content": "We allocate the cost of real estate acquired based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using valuation techniques that rely on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs within the  fair  value  framework.  We  determine  the  fair  value  of  tangible  assets,  such  as  land,  buildings,  furniture,  fixtures,  and equipment  using  valuation  techniques  that  consider  comparable  market  transactions,  replacement  costs,  and  other  available information. We determine the fair value of identified intangible assets or liabilities, which typically relate to in-place leases, using  valuation  techniques  that  consider  the  terms  of  the  in-place  leases,  current  market  data  for  comparable  leases,  and  our experience in leasing similar real estate.\n\nThe intangible assets or liabilities related to in-place leases are comprised of: (a) the value of the above- and below-market leases in-place, measured over the period, including probable lease renewals for below-market leases, for which the leases are expected  to  remain  in  effect;  (b)  the  estimated  unamortized  portion  of  avoided  leasing  commissions  and  other  costs  that ordinarily would be incurred to originate the in-place leases; (c) the value associated with in-place leases during an estimated absorption period, which estimates rental revenue that would not have been earned had the leased space been vacant at the time of  acquisition,  assuming  lease-up  periods  based  on  market  demand  and  stabilized  occupancy  levels;  and  (d)  tax  abatement contract  related  intangibles,  to  the  extent  the  property  has  them  in  place.  The  above  and  below-market  lease  intangibles  are amortized  to  rental  revenue  over  the  expected  remaining  terms  of  the  associated  leases,  which  include  reasonably  assured renewal  periods.  Other  intangible  assets  related  to  in-place  leases  are  amortized  to  depreciation  and  amortization  over  the expected remaining terms of the associated leases.\n\n## Capital Additions\n\nWe capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopments,  other  tangible  apartment  community  improvements,  and  replacements  of  existing  community  components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by employees in connection with the planning, execution, and control of all capital addition activities at our communities. We characterize as 'indirect costs' an allocation of certain  department  costs,  including  payroll,  at  the  area  operations  and  corporate  levels  that  clearly  relate  to  capital  addition activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes, and insurance during periods in which construction projects are in progress. We commence capitalization of costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital addition activities, at the point in time when activities necessary to get communities, apartment homes, or leased spaces ready for their intended use begin. These activities include when communities, apartment homes or leased spaces are undergoing physical construction, as well as when homes or leased spaces are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting,  planning,  and  design  are  in  progress.  We  cease  the  capitalization  of  costs  when  the  communities  or  components thereof are substantially complete and ready for their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and homes  or  leased  spaces  are  available  for  occupancy.  We  charge  costs  including  ordinary  repairs,  maintenance,  and  resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we capitalized to buildings and improvements $39.7 million, $30.6 million, and $21.3 million of interest costs, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we capitalized to buildings and improvements $14.3 million, $16.9 million, and $20.9 million of indirect costs, respectively.\n\n## Gain or Loss on Dispositions\n\nGain or loss on dispositions are recognized when we no longer hold a controlling financial interest in the real estate and sufficient consideration has been received. Upon disposition, the related assets and liabilities are derecognized, and the gain or loss on disposition is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities and the value of consideration received. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recognized total Gains on dispositions of real estate of $8.0 million, $175.9 million, and $0.0 million, respectively.\n\n## Impairment of Real Estate and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\nReal estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the community. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the community. There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.",

This includes a specific tenant analysis and aging analysis.\n\n## Deferred Leasing Costs\n\nWe  defer  leasing  costs  incremental  to  a  lease  that  we  would  not  have  incurred  if  the  contract  had  not  been  obtained. Amortization of these costs over the lease term on the same basis as lease income, is included in Depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Operations .",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Fixed Assets\n\nWe capitalize qualified implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract for which we are the customer in accordance with the requirements for capitalizing costs incurred to develop internal-use software. These capitalized implementation costs are recorded within Other assets, net, and are amortized on a straight-line basis. We capitalized $4.7 million of implementation costs for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Revenue from Leases\n\nWe are  a  lessor  for  residential  and  commercial  leases.  Our  operating  leases  with  residents  may  provide  that  the  resident reimburse us for certain costs, primarily the resident's share of utilities expenses, incurred by the apartment community. Our operating leases with commercial tenants may provide that the tenant reimburse us for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other recoverable costs incurred by the commercial property. Residential and commercial reimbursements represent revenue attributable to non-lease components for which the timing and pattern of recognition is the same as the revenue for the lease components. Reimbursements and the related expenses are presented on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, with  the  reimbursements  included  in Rental  and  other  property  revenues in  the  period  the  recoverable  costs  are incurred. We recognize rental revenue attributed to lease components, net of any concessions, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## Debt Issuance Costs\n\nWe defer, as debt issuance costs, lender fees and other direct costs incurred in obtaining new financing and amortize the amounts over the terms of the related loan agreements. In connection with the modification of existing financing arrangements, we  defer  lender  fees  and  amortize  these  costs  and  any  unamortized  debt  issuance  costs  over  the  term  of  the  modified  loan agreement. Debt issuance costs associated with non-recourse property debt are presented as a direct deduction from the related liabilities  in  our Consolidated  Balance  Sheets. For  debt  issuance  costs  associated  with  our  revolving  credit  facilities  and construction loans that have not been drawn we record the costs in Other assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortize the costs to Interest expense, on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. Debt issuance costs associated with construction loans are reclassified as a direct deduction to the construction loan liability in proportion to any draws on the loans  in  our Consolidated  Balance  Sheets and  subsequently  amortized  to Interest  expense on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the remaining term of the arrangement in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nWhen financing arrangements are repaid or otherwise extinguished prior to maturity, unamortized debt issuance costs are written  off.  Any  lender  fees  or  other  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  an  extinguishment  are  recognized  as  expense. Amortization  and  write-off  of  debt  issuance  costs  and  other  extinguishment  costs  are  included  in Interest  expense in  our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation for all tangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Acquired buildings and improvements are depreciated over a useful life based on the age, condition, and other physical characteristics of the asset. Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are generally depreciated over five years.\n\nWe depreciate  capitalized  costs  using  the  straight-line  method  over  the  estimated  useful  life  of  the  related  improvement, which is generally 5, 15, or 30 years. We also capitalize payroll and other indirect costs incurred in connection with preparing an asset for its intended use. These costs include corporate-level costs that clearly relate to the capital addition activities, which we allocate to the applicable assets. All capitalized payroll costs and indirect costs are allocated to capital additions proportionately based on direct costs and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of such capital additions.\n\nPurchased equipment is recognized at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally five years. Leasehold improvements are also recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's estimated useful life or the term of the related lease.\n\nCertain homogeneous items that are purchased in bulk on a recurring basis, such as appliances, are depreciated using group methods that reflect the average estimated useful life of the items in each group. Except in the case of casualties, where the net book value of the lost asset is written off in the determination of casualty gains or losses, we generally do not recognize any loss in  connection  with  the  replacement  of  an  existing  community  component  because  normal  replacements  are  considered  in determining the estimated useful lives used in connection with our composite and group depreciation methods.",

Additionally, our TRS entities hold investments in one of our apartment communities and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive.\n\nOur income tax benefit (expense) calculated in accordance with GAAP includes income taxes associated with the income or loss  of  our  TRS  entities.  Income  taxes,  as  well  as  changes  in  valuation  allowance  and  incremental  deferred  tax  items  in conjunction  with  intercompany  asset  transfers  and  internal  restructurings  (if  applicable),  are  included  in Income  tax  benefit (expense) in our C onsolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nConsolidated GAAP income or loss subject to tax consists of pretax income or loss of our taxable entities and income and gains  retained  by  the  REIT.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  we  had  consolidated  net  losses  subject  to  tax  of  $15.2 million, compared to consolidated net income subject to tax of $88.8 million for the same period in 2022, and consolidated net losses subject to tax of $31.4 million for the same period in 2021.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized income tax benefit of $12.8 million, compared to income tax expense of $17.3 million for same period in 2022, and income tax benefit of $13.6 million for the same period in 2021. The year-overyear changes are due primarily to the GAAP income taxes associated with the net lease modification income recognized in 2022.\n\nAimco has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, and Aimco intends to continue to operate in such a manner. Aimco's current and continuing  qualification  as  a  REIT  depends  on  its  ability  to  meet  the  various  requirements  imposed  by  the  Code,  which  are related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. If Aimco qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it will generally not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the 'double taxation' (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.\n\nEven  if Aimco  qualifies  as  a  REIT, Aimco  may  be  subject  to  United  States  federal  income  and  excise  taxes  in  various situations, such as on undistributed income. Aimco also will be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm's length transactions between Aimco and a TRS and on any net income from sales of apartment communities that were held for sale in the ordinary course. The state and local tax laws may not conform to the United States federal income tax treatment, and Aimco may be subject  to  state  or  local  taxation  in  various  state  or  local  jurisdictions,  including  those  in  which  we  transact business. Any taxes imposed on us reduce our operating cash flow and net income.\n\n## Earnings per Share and per Unit\n\nAimco and Aimco Operating Partnership calculate earnings per share and unit based on the weighted-average number of shares  of  Common  Stock  or  OP  Units,  participating  securities,  common  stock  or  common  unit  equivalents  and  dilutive convertible  securities  outstanding  during  the  period. Aimco  Operating  Partnership  considers  both  OP  Units  and  equivalents, which have identical rights to distributions and undistributed earnings, to be common units for purposes of the earnings per unit computations. Please refer to Note 10 for further information regarding earnings per share and unit computations.\n\n## Share-Based Compensation\n\nWe measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the award's fair  value  on  the  grant  date  and  recognize  the  cost  as  share-based  compensation  expense  over  the  period  during  which  the employee  is  required  to  provide  service  in  exchange  for  the  award,  which  is  generally  the  vesting  period.  Share-based compensation expense associated with awards is updated for actual forfeitures. For further discussion, see Note 11.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.",

The  new  guidance  is  effective  for  the  annual  period  ended December 31, 2024 and interim periods beginning in 2025. The amendments in the ASU apply retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statement. The segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in prior periods are based on the significant expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 'Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures' ('ASU  2023-09'),  which  is  intended  to  enhance  the  transparency  and  decision  usefulness  of  income  tax  disclosures.  This amendment  modifies  the  rules  on  income  tax  disclosures  to  require  entities  to  disclose  (1)  specific  categories  in  the  rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) (disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes) as well as individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid net of refunds. (3) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (disaggregated between domestic and foreign) and (4) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (disaggregated by federal, state and foreign). The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, while retrospective application is permitted.  We  are  currently  evaluating  the  potential  impact  of  adopting  this  new  guidance  on  our  consolidated  financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n## Note 3 - Significant Transactions\n\n## Dispositions\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we sold properties as summarized below (dollars in thousands):\n\n|                             | Year ended December 31, 2022 2021   | Year ended December 31, 2022 2021   | Year ended December 31, 2022 2021   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                             | 2023                                |                                     |                                     |\n| Number of properties sold   | 1                                   | 4                                   | -                                   |\n| Gain on sale of real estate | $ 6,138                             | $ 175,863    $                      | -                                   |\n\nIn  December  2023,  we  sold  a  land  parcel  in  downtown  Fort  Lauderdale,  for  a  gross  sales  price  of  $31.2  million  and recognized a gain from the sale of $6.1 million. The land parcel was purchased in January 2022. In conjunction with this sale, we provided seller financing with a stated value of $21.2 million. The financing matures at 18 months, with an option to extend for an additional six months. In addition, during the second quarter of 2023, we recognized a $1.9 million gain from the contribution of real estate to an unconsolidated joint venture.\n\n## Note 4 - Lease Arrangements\n\n## Aimco as Lessor\n\nThe majority of lease payments we receive from our residents and tenants are fixed. We receive variable payments from our residents and commercial tenants primarily for utility reimbursements and other services.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, our total lease income was comprised of the following amounts for all residential and commercial property leases (in thousands):\n\n|                       | Year ended December 31, 2022 2021   | Year ended December 31, 2022 2021   | Year ended December 31, 2022 2021   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                       | 2023                                |                                     |                                     |\n| Fixed lease income    | $ 172,580    $                      | 176,080    $                        | 157,842                             |\n| Variable lease income | 13,892                              | 13,654                              | 11,487                              |\n| Total lease income    | $ 186,472                           | $ 189,734                           | $ 169,329                           |",

Future minimum annual  rental  payments  we  will  receive  under  commercial  leases,  excluding  such  extension  options,  are  as  follows  as  of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n\n|            | Future Minimum Annual  Rental Payments   |\n|------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 2024       | $ 12,167                                 |\n| 2025       | 7,382                                    |\n| 2026       | 4,904                                    |\n| 2027       | 3,035                                    |\n| 2028       | 1,295                                    |\n| Thereafter | 1,106                                    |\n| Total      | $ 29,889                                 |\n\nGenerally, our residential leases do not provide extension options, so the average remaining term is less than one year. Our commercial leases, as of December 31, 2023, have an average remaining term of 2.2 years.\n\n## Aimco as Lessee\n\nWe  are  lessee  to  finance  leases  for  the  land  underlying  the  development  sites  at  Upton  Place,  Strathmore  Square,  and Oakshore.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our finance leases had weighted-average remaining terms of 93.4 years and 94.2 years, respectively, and weighted-average discount rates of 6.1% and 6.1%, respectively.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, amortization related to finance leases was $0.0 million, net of amounts capitalized, compared to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2023, we capitalized $8.0 million of lease costs associated with active development and redevelopment projects on certain of the underlying property and ground lease assets, compared to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, related to our finance leases was $0.3 million compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nIn June 2022, we, as lessee, and AIR, as lessor, entered into a lease termination agreement with respect to four leases entered into on January 1, 2021 that pertained to our North Tower of Flamingo Point, 707 Leahy, The Fremont, and Prism properties. This agreement terminated these four finance leases on September 1, 2022. Upon termination, both parties were released of any and all liabilities and obligations under each respective lease other than those liabilities and obligations, if any, that expressly survived termination. On September 1, 2022, we relinquished control of the leasehold improvements on these four properties as well as the underlying land. In exchange, AIR remitted a total of $200.0 million in consideration to us as termination payments.\n\nBecause  the  termination  agreement  modified  the  expiration  date  of  each  lease  to  September  1,  2022,  we  accelerated depreciation  on  the  associated  leasehold  improvements  using  lease  terms  that  ended  September  1,  2022.  We  recorded  $85.7 million  of  total  depreciation  expense  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022.  In  addition,  we  recognized Lease  modification income of  $207.0  million,  which  is  included  in  our Consolidated Statements of Operations for  the  year  ended  December 31, 2022.\n\n## Operating Lease Arrangements\n\nWe have operating leases primarily for corporate office space. Substantially all of the payments under our office leases are fixed. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our operating leases had weighted-average remaining terms of 5.2 years and 6.3 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our operating leases had weighted-average discount rates of 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively.\n\nWe record operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Total operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $1.5 million, $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, operating lease right-of-use assets of $6.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively, are included in Other  assets,  net in  our Consolidated  Balance  Sheets. As  of  December  31,  2023  and  December  31,  2022,  operating  lease liabilities  of  $11.5  million  and  $12.8  million,  respectively,  are  included  in Accrued liabilities  and  other in  our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor finance and operating leases, when the rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, we estimate the value of our lease liabilities using discount rates equivalent to the rates we would pay on a secured borrowing with terms similar to the leases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components,",

The  accounting  standards  for  the  consolidation  of  VIEs  require  qualitative assessments  to  determine  whether  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  The  primary  beneficiary  analysis  is  based  on  power  and economics. We conclude that we are the primary beneficiary and consolidate the VIE if we have both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly influence the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  from,  the  VIE  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  the  VIE.  Significant  judgments  and assumptions related to these determinations include, but are not limited to, estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions. We consolidate Aimco Operating Partnership, a VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary. Through Aimco Operating Partnership, we consolidate all VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary. Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are those of Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nAimco Operating Partnership is the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidates, five VIEs that own interests in real estate. Assets of our consolidated VIEs must first be used to settle the liabilities of those VIEs. The consolidated VIEs' creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Aimco Operating Partnership.",

Under our secured revolving credit facility, we have agreed to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, minimum adjusted tangible net worth of $625.0 million, and maximum leverage of 60.0% as defined in the credit agreement, among other customary covenants. We are in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Notes Payable to AIR\n\nIn  July  2022,  we  completed  the  prepayment  of  $534.1  million  of  Notes  Payable  to  AIR,  which  was  entered  into  on December 14, 2020. As a result, we incurred $17.4 million of spread maintenance costs, which are included in Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations . For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we recognized interest expense of $13.7 million, and $27.8 million, respectively, associated with the Notes Payable to AIR, which is included in Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations .\n\n## Note 7 - Income Taxes\n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of our taxable entities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Aimco had 140,576,102 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Stock Repurchases\n\nAimco's  Board  has,  from  time  to  time,  authorized Aimco  to  repurchase  shares  of  its  outstanding  Common  Stock. As  of December 31, 2023, Aimco was authorized to repurchase up to 21.1 million shares of its outstanding Common Stock, subject to certain customary limitations, which may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This  authorization  has  no  expiration  date.  During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023, Aimco  repurchased  approximately  6.2 million shares of its Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $7.33 per share.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Aimco repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of its Common Stock at a weighted-average  price  of  $7.21  per  share.  No  repurchases  of  Common  Stock  were  made  by Aimco  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Cash Dividend\n\nAs a REIT, Aimco is required to distribute annually to holders of shares of its Common Stock at least 90.0% of its 'real estate investment  trust  taxable  income,'  which,  as  defined  by  the  Code  and  United  States  Department  of  Treasury  regulations,  is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income. Aimco's Board determines and declares Aimco's dividends. In making a dividend determination, Aimco's Board considers a variety of factors, including REIT distribution requirements, current market conditions, liquidity needs, and other uses of cash, such as deleveraging and accretive investment activities. No dividends were paid during the year ended December 31, 2023. On September 30, 2022, Aimco paid a special cash dividend of $0.02 per share to stockholders of record on September 14, 2022.\n\n## Note 9 - Partners' Capital\n\nIn Aimco Operating Partnership's Consolidated Balance Sheets , the OP Units held by Aimco are classified within Partners' capital as General Partner and Special Limited Partner capital and the OP Units held by entities other than Aimco are classified within Limited Partners capital.  In Aimco's Consolidated Balance Sheets ,  the  OP Units held by entities other than Aimco are classified within permanent equity as Common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership .\n\nOP Units held by Aimco are not redeemable whereas OP Units held by interests in Aimco Operating Partnership other than Aimco are redeemable at the holders' option, subject to certain restrictions, on the basis of one OP Unit for either one share of Common Stock or cash equal to the fair value of a share of Common Stock at the time of redemption. Aimco has the option to deliver shares of Common Stock in exchange for all or any portion of such OP Units tendered for redemption. When a limited partner  redeems  an  OP  Unit  for  Common  Stock, Limited  Partners' capital  is  reduced,  and  the General  Partner  and  Special Limited Partners' capital is increased.",

We calculate diluted earnings per share and diluted  earnings  per  unit  taking  into  consideration  dilutive  shares  of  Common  Stock  and  OP  Unit  equivalents  and  dilutive convertible securities outstanding during the period.\n\nAimco's Common Stock and OP Unit equivalents include options to purchase shares of Common Stock, which, if exercised, would result in Aimco's issuance of additional shares of Common Stock and Aimco Operating Partnership's issuance to Aimco of additional OP Units equal to the number of shares of Common Stock purchased under the options. These equivalents also include unvested market-based restricted stock awards that do not meet the definition of participating securities, which would result in an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock and OP Units outstanding equal to the number of the shares that vest. OP Unit equivalents also include unvested long-term incentive partnership units. The Common Stock and OP Unit equivalents were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share and unit for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2023, because the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. The Common Stock and OP Unit equivalents were included in the  computation  of  diluted  earnings  per  share  and  unit  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  because  the  effect  of  their inclusion was dilutive. As of December 31, 2023, the Common Stock and OP Unit equivalents that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share or unit in future periods totaled 3.7 million and 8.0 million, respectively.\n\nAimco's time-based restricted stock awards receive non-forfeitable dividends similar to shares of Common Stock and OP Units  prior  to  vesting,  and  our  market-based  long-term  incentive  partnership  units  (\"LTIP  Units\")  receive  non-forfeitable distributions based on specified percentages of the distributions paid to OP Units prior to vesting and conversion. The unvested restricted shares and units related to these awards are participating securities. We include the effect of participating securities in basic and diluted earnings per share and unit computations using the two-class method of allocating distributed and undistributed earnings when the two-class method is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. Participating securities were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share and unit for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2023, because the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. Participating securities were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share and unit for the year ended December 31, 2022, because the effect of their inclusion was dilutive. As of December 31, 2023, participating securities that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share or unit in future periods totaled 2.5 million.",

As of December 31, 2023, approximately 18.9 million shares were available for issuance under the Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the '2015 Plan'). The total number of shares available for issuance under this plan may increase due to any forfeiture,  cancellation,  exchange,  surrender,  termination  or  expiration  of  an  award  outstanding  under  the  2015  Plan. Awards under the 2015 Plan may be in the form of stock options, stock, and LTIP Units as authorized under the 2015 Plan. Our plans are administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into an agreement to modify all outstanding awards granted to the holders of such awards. Each outstanding time or performance based Aimco award was converted into one share of Aimco Common Stock and one share of AIR common stock. Generally, all such Aimco equity awards retain the same terms and vesting conditions as the original Aimco equity awards immediately before the Separation.\n\nFollowing  the  Separation,  compensation  expense  related  to  these  modified  awards  for  the  employees  retained  by  us  is incurred by Aimco. The compensation expense related to these modified awards for employees of AIR is incurred by AIR.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, total compensation cost recognized for share-based awards was (in thousands):\n\n|                                          | 2023     | 2022    | 2021    |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|---------|---------|\n| Share-based compensation expense (1)     | $ 9,221  | $ 6,441 | $ 3,377 |\n| Capitalized share-based compensation (2) | 1,274    | 1,016   | 340     |\n| Total share-based compensation (3)       | $ 10,495 | $ 7,457 | $ 3,717 |",

        "page_content": "As of December 31, 2023, our share of total unvested compensation cost not yet recognized was $11.8 million. We expect to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years. The aggregate fair value of the vested Restricted Stock Awards and LTIP I Units during each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $0.9 million, $0.6 million, and $0.6 million, respectively.\n\nFor our employees, we grant restricted stock awards and two forms of LTIP Units that are subject to time-based vesting and require continuous employment, typically over a period of three to five years from the grant date, and we refer to these awards as Time-Based Restricted Stock, Time-Based LTIP I Units, and Time-Based LTIP II Units. We also grant stock options, restricted stock awards, and two forms of LTIP Units, that vest conditioned on our total shareholder return ('TSR'), relative to identified indices  over  a  forward-looking  performance  period  of  three  years.  We  refer  to  these  awards  as  TSR  Stock  Options,  TSR Restricted Stock, TSR LTIP I Units, and TSR LTIP II Units. Earned TSR-based awards, if any, will generally vest over a period of three to four years from the grant date, based on continued employment. Vested LTIP II Units may be converted at the holders' option to LTIP Units for a conversion metric over a term of 10 years. Our TSR Stock Options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant.\n\nWe recognize compensation cost associated with time-based awards ratably over the requisite service periods. We recognize compensation cost related to the TSR-based awards, over the requisite service period, commencing on the grant date. The value of  the  TSR-based  awards  takes  into  consideration  the  probability  that  the  market  condition  will  be  achieved;  therefore, previously recorded compensation cost is not adjusted in the event that the market condition is not achieved, and awards do not vest.\n\nWe  had  Time-Based  Restricted  Stock,  Time-Based  LTIP  I  Units,  Time-Based  LTIP  II  Units,  TSR  Stock  Options,  TSR Restricted  Stock, TSR LTIP I Units and TSR LTIP II Units outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

Under this method, the prices of the indices and shares of our Common Stock were simulated through the end of the performance period. The correlation matrix between shares of our Common Stock and the indices, as well as the corresponding return volatilities, were developed based upon an analysis of historical data.\n\nThe following table includes the assumptions used for the valuation of TSR-based awards that were granted in 2023 and 2022.\n\n| TSR Award Assumptions                                                                         | 2023          | 2022          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Grant date market value of a common share                                                     | $7.59         | $6.96         |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                                                       | 3.89%-4.73%   | 0.19%-1.38%   |\n| Dividend yield                                                                                | 0%            | 0%            |\n| Expected volatility                                                                           | 34.08%-36.19% | 32.09%-33.04% |\n| Derived vesting period of TSR Restricted Stock                                                | 3.0           | 3.0           |\n| Weighted average expected term of TSR Stock Options, TSR LTIP I Units, and TSR LTIP II  Units | N/A           | 4.9           |\n\n## Note 12 - Fair Value Measurements\n\n## Recurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nFrom time to time, we purchase interest rate swaps, caps, and other instruments to provide protection against increases in interest  rates  on  our  variable  rate  debt. These  instruments  are  presented  as Interest  rate  options in  our Consolidated Balance Sheets .  As  of  December  31,  2023,  we  held  interest  rate  caps  with  a  $627.4  million  notional  value.  These  instruments  were acquired for $5.8 million, and the fair value of these instruments is $5.2 million as noted in the table below.\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  we  monetized  the  $1.5  billion  notional  amount  interest  rate  swaption, purchased in conjunction with the Mezzanine Investment to protect against future interest rate increases, for gross proceeds of $54.2 million.\n\nOn a recurring basis, we measure at fair value our interest rate options. Our interest rate options are classified within Level 2 of  the  GAAP  fair  value  hierarchy,  and  we  estimate  their  fair  value  using  pricing  models  that  rely  on  observable  market information, including contractual terms, market prices, and interest rate yield curves. The fair value adjustment is included in earnings  in Realized  and  unrealized  gains  (losses)  on  interest  rate  options in  our Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations . Changes in fair value are reflected as a non-cash transaction in adjustments to arrive at cash flows from operations, any upfront premium is reflected in Purchase of interest rate options , and any proceeds are reflected in Proceeds from interest rate options in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows .",

In  addition,  as  of  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  we  have  investments  in property technology funds of $2.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, in entities that develop technology related to the real estate  industry. These  investments  are  measured  at  net  asset  value  ('NAV')  as  a  practical  expedient.

We  used  internally  developed  models  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  Mezzanine Investment.  This  incorporated  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  real  estate  collateral  that  incorporates  various  estimates  and assumptions, the most significant being the capitalization rate of 5.25% compared to 3.75% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These assumptions are based on Level 3 inputs. See Note 2 for further details.\n\n## Fair Value Disclosures\n\nWe  believe  that  the  carrying  value  of  the  consolidated  amounts  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash,  accounts receivables and payables approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, due to their relatively short-term nature and high probability of realization. We estimate the fair value of our debt using an income and market approach, including comparison of the contractual terms to observable and unobservable inputs such as market interest rate risk spreads, contractual interest rates, remaining periods to maturity, debt service coverage ratios, and loan to value ratios. We classify the fair value of our non-recourse property debt and construction loans within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy based on the significance of certain of the unobservable inputs used to estimate their fair value.\n\nThe following table summarizes carrying value and fair value of our non-recourse property debt and construction loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n\n|                            | As of December 31, 2023   | As of December 31, 2023   | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                            | Carrying Value            | Fair Value                | Carrying Value            | Fair Value                |\n| Non-recourse property debt | $852,502                  | $807,240                  | $938,476                  | $878,804                  |\n| Construction loans         | 309,521                   | 309,170                   | 126,317                   | 125,954                   |\n| Total                      | $1,162,023                | $1,116,410                | $1,064,793                | $1,004,758                |\n\n## Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Commitments\n\nIn  connection  with  our  development,  redevelopment,  and  other  capital  additions  activities,  we  have  entered  into  various construction-related contracts, and have made commitments to complete development and redevelopment of certain real estate, pursuant to financing or other arrangements. As of December 31, 2023, we had remaining commitments for construction-related contracts of $63.8 million, with $124.2 million undrawn on our construction loans.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have remaining commitments of $3.0 million related to our unconsolidated joint ventures, which we expect to fund over the next twelve months. In addition, we have remaining commitments of $2.0 million related to our investments in property technology funds invested in entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry. The timing of the remaining funding of these commitments is uncertain.",

Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.\n\n## Legal Matters\n\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings, incidental to the normal course of business. While the outcome of the legal  proceedings  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty,  we  believe  there  are  no  legal  proceedings  pending  that would have a material effect upon our financial condition or result of operations.\n\n## Note 14 - Business Segments\n\nWe have three segments: (i) Development and Redevelopment; (ii) Operating; and (iii) Other.\n\nOur  Development  and  Redevelopment  segment  consists  of  properties  that  are  under  construction  or  have  not  achieved stabilization, as well as land held for development. As of December 31, 2023, our Development and Redevelopment segment consists of 11 properties, three of which were under construction.\n\nOur Operating segment includes 21 residential apartment communities with 5,600 apartment homes that have achieved a stabilized level of operations as of January 1, 2022 and maintained it throughout the current year and comparable period. We aggregate all our apartment communities that have reached stabilization into our Operating segment.\n\nDuring  the  first  quarter  of  2023,  we  reclassified  one  residential  apartment  community  from  the  Other  segment  to  the Operating  segment  because  it  reached  stabilization.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  we  sold  one  land  parcel  from  the Development and Redevelopment segment, which resulted in its removal from the segment. Prior period segment information has  been  recast  based  upon  our  current  segment  population,  and  is  consistent  with  how  our  chief  operating  decision  maker (\"CODM\") evaluates the business. The recast conforms with our reportable segment classification as of December 31, 2023.\n\nOur Other segment consists of properties currently owned that are not included in our Development and Redevelopment or Operating segments. Our Other segment includes 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, our only office building, and St. George Villas.\n\nOur CODM uses cash flow, construction timeline to completion, and actual versus budgeted results to evaluate our properties in our Development and Redevelopment segment. Our CODM uses proportionate property net operating income to assess the operating performance of our Operating segment. Proportionate property net operating income is defined as our share of rental and  other  property  revenues,  excluding  utility  reimbursements,  less  direct  property  operating  expenses,  including  utility reimbursements, for the consolidated communities; but\n\n- \u00b7 excluding the results of four apartment communities with an aggregate 142 apartment homes that we neither manage nor consolidate, our investment in IQHQ and the Mezzanine Investment; and\n- \u00b7 excluding  property  management  costs  and  casualty  gains  or  losses,  reported  in  consolidated  amounts,  in  our assessment of segment performance.",

This Policy shall be effective as of the Effective Date as provided herein.\n\nThis Policy supersedes any prior plan, policy or practice involving the payment of severance benefits to eligible Executives. While the Policy is in effect, any severance benefits provided to an eligible Executive must be paid pursuant to this Policy or pursuant to another express written agreement between the Company or any member of the Company Group and the eligible Executive (including but not limited to an employment agreement), which agreement must be signed by such Executive and a duly authorized officer of the Company or Company Group.\n\n- Section 2. Definitions . As used herein, the following terms shall have the following respective meanings:\n- 2.1 'Accrued Rights' shall have the meaning given in Section 4.5 hereof.\n- 2.2 'Board' means the Board of Directors of the Company.\n- 2.3 'Bonus' means the short-term incentive  bonus  payable  to  Executive  under  the  Company Group's short-term  incentive (STI) compensation plan, which provides for annual cash incentive bonuses, or any successor bonus program approved by the Compensation Committee in which Executive participates from time to time.\n- 2.4 'Base Salary' means the annual base salary in effect for the payroll period during which Executive's employment is terminated. Bonuses, commissions, incentive pay and any taxable or nontaxable fringe benefits or payments are not included in the calculation of Base Salary.\n- 2.5 'Cause' means the termination of an Executive's employment because of the occurrence of any of the following, as determined by the Board in accordance with the procedure below:\n- (i) the refusal by the Executive to attempt in good faith to perform his or her duties as assigned to the Executive by the CEO or to follow the lawful direction of the CEO (other than due to the Executive's physical or mental incapacity); provided, however, that the CEO shall have  provided  the  Executive  with  written  notice  of  such  failure  and  the  Executive  has  been afforded at least fifteen (15) days to cure same;\n- (ii) the Executive's conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or any other serious crime involving moral turpitude or dishonesty;\n- (iii) the Executive's willfully engaging in misconduct in the performance of his  or  her  duties  for  the  Company  Group  (including  theft,  fraud,  embezzlement,  securities  law violations, a material violation of the Company Group's code of conduct or a material violation of other material written policies) that is demonstrably injurious to the Company Group, monetarily or otherwise;\n- (iv) the  Executive's  willfully  engaging  in  misconduct  unrelated  to  the performance  of  his  or  her  duties  for  the  Company  Group  that  is  demonstrably  injurious  to  the Company Group, monetarily or otherwise;",

No action or inaction by the Executive shall be treated as Cause  if  it  was  taken  at  the  direction  of  counsel  to  the  Company  or  Company  Group.

If such claim for disputed benefits is wholly or partially denied, the Compensation Committee will, within a reasonable period of time, but no later than ninety (90) days after receipt of the claim, notify the claimant of the denial of the claim. Such notice of denial will: (i) be in writing; (ii) be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant; and (iii) contain (A) the specific reason or reasons for denial of the claim, (B) a specific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial is based, (C) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim, along with an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and (D) an explanation of the Plan's claim review procedure.\n\n11.2 Request For Review Of Denial Of Claim.

Any reductions  described  in  the  preceding  sentence  shall  be  done  in  the  manner  that  is  least  economically disadvantageous to Executive.

The Compensation Committee may, from time to time, by action of its appropriate officers, delegate to designated persons or entities the right to exercise any of its powers or the obligation to carry out its duties under the Policy.\n\n## Section 16. Amendment and Termination .\n\nThis Policy will continue in effect, subject to amendment, until terminated by the Board. The Board may terminate or amend the Policy at any time except that: ninety (90) days' prior notice to affected Participants will be required  for  any  termination  of  the  Plan  or  amendment  that  materially  and  adversely  affects  the  rights  of  such Participants, no termination or amendment will materially and adversely affect the rights of any Participant whose employment terminated  prior  to  the  date  of  such  amendment  or  termination,  and  a  Participant's  right  to  receive payments or benefits with respect to a termination occurring in connection with or within twenty-four (24) months after a Change of Control shall not be adversely affected by an amendment or termination of the Plan that is made within 6 months before or twenty-four (24) months after the Change of Control date.\n\n## Section 17. Other Provisions .\n\n17.1 Acknowledgment. Executive acknowledges that this Policy does not constitute a contract  of  employment  or  impose  on  the  Company  Group  any  obligation  to  retain  Executive  as  an employee and that this Policy does not prevent Executive from terminating employment at any time.\n\n17.2 Non-Duplication of Benefits. The benefits under this Policy are not intended to duplicate  any  other  benefits  provided  by  the  Company  Group  in  connection  with  the  termination  of  an employee's  employment,  such  as  wage  replacement  benefits,  pay-in-lieu-of-notice,  severance  pay,  or similar  benefits  under  any  other  benefit  plans,  severance  programs,  employment  contracts,  or  applicable federal or state laws, such as the WARN Acts. Should such other benefits be payable, the benefits under this Policy  will  be  reduced  accordingly  or,  alternatively,  benefits  previously  paid  under  this  Policy  will  be treated as having been paid to satisfy such other benefit obligations. In either case, the Company Group will determine how to apply this provision and may override other provisions in this Policy in doing so.\n\n17.3 Arbitration. Subject to satisfaction of the Claims Procedures set forth in Section 11,  any  dispute  or  controversy  arising  under  or  in  connection  with  this  Policy  or  the  Executive's employment with the Company Group shall be subject to the Arbitration Agreement entered into by the Company Group and the Executive.\n\n17.4 Construction.  This Policy shall be governed and enforced in accordance with the laws  of  the  State  of  Colorado,  and  any  litigation  between  the  parties  relating  to  this  Policy  shall  be conducted  in  the  courts  of  the  City  and  County  of  Denver,  including  where  necessary  for  federal  court matters.\n\n17.5 Severability.  If any provision of this Policy, or the application of such provision to any person or in any circumstance, is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision may be modified or severed from this Policy to the extent necessary to make such provision unenforceable against such person or in such circumstance. Neither the unenforceability of such provision nor the modification or severance of such provision will affect (i) the enforceability of any other  provision  of  this  Policy  or  (ii)  the  enforceability  of  such  provision  against  any  person  or  in  any circumstance other than those against or in which such provision is found to be unenforceable.",

Executive shall have the general authority usually vested in Executive's position and shall also perform such other duties as may be required by law or as may be delegated to Executive by AIMCO's Board of Directors (the ' Board ') commensurate with Executive's position.\n\nExecutive  shall  devote  substantially  his  full  time,  ability  and  attention  to  the  business  of  AIMCO,  its subsidiaries and affiliates during the Agreement Term. While employed, Executive shall have no other employment with, nor receive any compensation from, any other person, firm or corporation without the prior authorization of the AIMCO Board of Directors. Executive, with prior Board approval, will not be precluded from devoting a reasonable amount of time to serving as a director or committee member of a for-profit or non-profit organization. Executive is not precluded from  devoting  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  to  speaking  engagements,  engaging  in  professional  organizations  and program activities, charities, and such similar activities.

Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions of Code Section 409A or any Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder are applicable to  any amounts payable hereunder, the Company and Executive intend that this Agreement will meet the requirements of such Code section and regulations and that the provisions hereof will be interpreted in a manner  that  is  consistent  with  such  intent.  Executive  will  cooperate  with  the  Company  in  taking  such actions as the Company may reasonably request to assure that this Agreement will meet the requirements of Code Section 409A and any regulations promulgated thereunder.\n- b. Unless  otherwise  permitted  under  Code  Section  409A,  all  in-kind  benefits, expenses or other reimbursements paid pursuant to this Policy that are taxable income to Executive (i) will be paid no later than the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which Executive incurs such expense; (ii) will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (iii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in- kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year.\n- c. For purposes of Code Section 409A, Executive's right to receive any installment payments under this Policy (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at",

With  respect  to  any  amount  that  becomes  payable  to  Executive  under  this Agreement upon Executive's 'separation from service,' as defined below, for any reason, notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  if  the  Company  determines  in  good  faith  that Executive  is  a  'specified  employee'  under  Code  Section  409A  then,  to  the  extent  required  under  Code Section 409A, any amount that otherwise would be payable to Executive during the six (6) month period following  Executive's  separation  from  service  shall  be  suspended  until  the  lapse  of  such  six  (6)  month period  (or,  if  earlier,  the  date  of  death  of  Executive).  The  amount  that  otherwise  would  be  payable  to Executive during such period of suspension shall be paid in a single payment on the day following the end of such six (6) month period (or, if such day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day) or within thirty (30) days following the death of Executive during such six (6) month period, provided that the death of Executive during such six (6) month period shall not cause the acceleration of any amount that otherwise would be payable on any date during such six (6) month period following the date of Executive's death.  Any  amounts  not  subject  to  the  suspension  described  in  the  preceding  sentence  shall  be  paid  as otherwise provided in this Agreement. A 'separation from service' means a separation from service with the Company and all other persons or entities with whom the members of the Company would be considered a single employer under Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code, applying the eighty percent (80%) threshold used in such Code sections and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, all within the meaning of Code Section 409A.\n- e. To  the  extent  required  to  avoid  the  imposition  of  additional  taxes  and  penalties under Code Section 409A, amounts payable under this Agreement on termination of employment will not be paid  until  Executive  experiences  a  separation  from  service  within  the  meaning  of  Code  Section  409A  as specified above.\n- f. In no event will the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on Executive under Code Section 409A or for any damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.\n- g. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the timing of Executive's execution of the Release, directly or indirectly, result in Executive designating the calendar year of payment, and if a payment pursuant to this Agreement that is subject to execution of the Release could be made in more than one (1) taxable year, based on timing of the execution of the Release, payment shall be made in the later taxable year.\n- h. Section  409A  Compliance.  It  is  the  intent  of  the  parties  to  comply  with  all provisions of Section 409A so that Executive shall not be required to include in Executive's gross income for federal income tax purposes, prior to the actual receipt thereof, any amounts received that may otherwise be considered to be deferred payments. In the event that the interpretation or requirements of Section 409A change during the Agreement Term, the parties will amend this Agreement, only as necessary, to comply with  any  such  change,  if  and  to  the  extent  such  an  amendment  would  be  permitted  by  Section  409A. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require AIMCO to pay any tax, penalty or interest assessed against Executive or otherwise required to be paid by Executive for any Section 409A failures or non-compliance with Section 409A.\n- 9. Withholding  Taxes .  All  compensation  payable  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  shall  be  subject  to reduction by all applicable withholding, social security and other federal, state and local taxes and deductions, and the Company shall be authorized to make all such withholdings to the extent it determines necessary under applicable law.\n\n## 10. Parachute Payments . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the\n\ncontrary, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2)) to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, then Executive shall  be  entitled  to  receive  (i)  the  greatest  amount  so  that  no  portion  the  payments  shall  be  an  excess  parachute payment (the 'Limited Amount'), or (ii) if the amount of payments otherwise paid or provided (without regard to clause (i)) reduced",

Any reductions described in the preceding sentence shall be done in the manner that is least economically disadvantageous to Executive. Where the decision to cut back between two (2) amounts is economically equivalent, but the amounts are payable at different times, the amounts will be reduced on a pro rata basis.\n\n## F. Confidential Information; Trade Secrets; Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Investment; Non-Disparagement; Cooperation.\n\n## 1. Confidential Information.\n\n- a. Executive acknowledges that the successful development of AIMCO entity services and products, including the AIMCO entities' current and potential customer and business relationships, and business strategies and plans requires substantial time and expense. Such efforts generate for the AIMCO entities valuable and proprietary information (' Confidential Information ') which gives AIMCO a business advantage  over  others  who  do  not  have  such  information.  Confidential  Information  includes,  but  is  not limited to the following: trade secrets, technical, business, proprietary or financial information of any of the AIMCO entities not generally known to the public, business plans, proposals, past and current prospect and customer  lists,  trading  methodologies,  systems  and  programs,  training  materials,  research  data  bases  and computer software; but shall not include information or ideas acquired by Executive prior to Executive's employment with the AIMCO entities if such pre-existing information is generally known in the industry and is not proprietary to any AIMCO entity. Executive agrees that, except in connection with the necessary performance of Executive's duties under this Agreement, Executive will not disclose to any person or entity or  use,  during  the  Agreement  Term  or  any  time  thereafter,  any  Confidential  Information.  Neither  will Executive disclose to any person or entity or use, while employed by AIMCO, information that Executive knows or believes to be trade secrets or proprietary technical, business, or financial information of a person or entity other than the AIMCO entities.\n- b. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this  subsection  shall  not  apply  to  the  extent Executive  remains  employed  by  AIMCO  and  is  required  to  disclose  Confidential  Information  to  any regulatory  agency  or  as  otherwise  required  by  law.  This  subsection  shall  also  not  apply  following termination for any reason to the extent Executive is required by law to testify in a legislative, judicial or regulatory proceeding or is otherwise required by law to disclose Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement  should  be  construed  to  limit  Executive  from  reporting  possible  violations  of  federal  law  or regulations  to  any  governmental  entity  or  participating  in  any  governmental  investigation.  Nor  should anything in this Agreement be construed as requiring notice or authorization to AIMCO or AIMCO before reporting possible violations of law or participating in a governmental investigation.\n- 2. Trade Secrets . During the term of employment under this Agreement, Executive will have access to and become acquainted with Trade Secrets and various information not generally available to the public consisting of records,  documents, drawings, specifications, customer lists, procedural and operational manuals and information, financial  records  and  accounts,  projections  and  budgets,  and  similar  information,  all  of  which  are  owned  by  the Company and regularly used in the operation of the Company's business. Such assets of the Company are secret, are not generally available to the public and give the Company an advantage over competitors who do not know of or use such information. Executive agrees such information and documents constitute ' Trade Secrets ' of the Company. All Trade Secrets, whether they are prepared by Executive or come into Executive's possession in any other way, are owned by the Company, shall remain the exclusive property of the Company and shall not be removed from the premises of the Company under any circumstances whatsoever, without prior written consent of the Board, except in the good faith performance of Executive's duties hereunder.\n- 3. Misuse  Of  Confidential  Information  and  Trade  Secrets .  Executive  covenants  that  he  shall  not misuse, misappropriate or disclose any of the Trade Secrets or Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, or use them in any way, either during the Agreement Term or at any time thereafter, except as required in the course of his employment with the Company, unless such action is either previously agreed to in writing by the Board or required by law, is requested by a governmental or regulatory agency or is otherwise reasonably appropriate to disclose in",

Executive  acknowledges  and agrees  that  the  sale  or  unauthorized  use  or  disclosure  of  any  of  the  Trade  Secrets  or  Confidential  Information, including information concerning the Company's current, future or proposed work, services or investments, the fact that any such work, services or investments are planned, under consideration, or under negotiation, as well as any descriptions thereof, constitute ' Unfair Competition '.  Executive promises and agrees not to engage in any Unfair Competition with the Company, either during the Agreement Term or at any time thereafter.\n- 5. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1833(b) .  18  U.S.C. \u00a7 1833(b) provides: 'An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (x) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (y) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.' Accordingly, the parties to this Agreement have the right to disclose in confidence trade secrets to Federal, State, and local government officials, or to an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law. The parties also have the right to disclose trade secrets in a document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, but only if the filing is made under seal and protected from public disclosure. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1833(b).\n- 6. Whistleblower Protection .  Nothing  in  this Agreement  prohibits  Executive  from  reporting  possible violations  of  United  States  federal  law  or  regulation  to  any  governmental  agency  or  entity,  including  the  United States Department of Justice, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Congress, and any Inspector General of any United States federal agency, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of United States federal, state or local law or regulation; provided, that Executive will use his reasonable best efforts to (1) disclose only information that is reasonably related to such possible violations or that  is  requested  by  such  agency  or  entity,  and  (2)  request  that  such  agency  or  entity  treat  such  information  as confidential.  Executive  does  not  need  the  prior  authorization  from  the  Company  to  make  any  such  reports  or disclosures  and  is  not  required  to  notify  the  Company  that  Executive  has  made  such  reports  or  disclosures.  This Agreement does not limit Executive's right to receive an award for information provided to any governmental agency or entity.\n- 7. Non-Competition. Executive  hereby  covenants  and  agrees  that,  during  the  period  of  Executive's employment with the Company and for 24 months thereafter (the ' Covenant Period '), Executive shall not, without the  prior  written  consent  of  the  Board  (which  may  be  withheld  in  the  sole  and  absolute  discretion  of  the  Board), engage in Competition (as defined below) with the Company.\n- For purposes of this Agreement, if Executive takes any of the following actions Executive shall be engaged in ' Competition ': engaging in or carrying on, directly or indirectly, any enterprise, whether as an advisor, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, stockholder or other form of investor holding more than one percent (1%) of  the  outstanding  shares  of,  associate  or  consultant  to  any  person,  partnership,  corporation  or  any  other  business entity that competes with the Company and is set forth on a written list presented to Executive by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee simultaneously with the execution hereof, and attached hereto as Exhibit B, and agreed thereto by Executive as evidenced by execution of this Agreement. The entities so listed, as amended pursuant to  the  following  sentence,  shall  be  the  sole  competitors  of  the  Company  (collectively,  the  ' Competitors '  and individually, a ' Competitor '). Such list of the Competitors may be amended by the Board in good faith based on the same criteria as the initial list (except to the extent the Company's business has changed or expanded) at any time up to one hundred eighty (180) days prior to Executive's Date of Termination by written notice to Executive. Executive may at any time request, in writing, that the Company confirm whether any such Competitor is, on the date of such request,  still  a  Competitor,  and  the  Company's  Senior  Human  Resources  Executive  will  respond  within  ten  (10) business days to such an inquiry in writing.\n- 8. Non-Solicitation; No-Hire . Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, during the Covenant Period, whether for Executive's own account or for the account of any other person or entity (other than the Company), (i) Executive shall not attempt to influence, persuade or induce, or assist any other person in so influencing, persuading or  inducing,  any  employee,  agent,  independent  contractor,  developer,  partner,  vendor,  supplier  or  lender  of  the Company to give up, or to not commence, employment or a business relationship with the Company or, solely with",

Executive shall not be prohibited from providing references for employees or independent contractors if so requested by any such individual.\n\n- 9. Non-Investment . Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, during the Agreement Term, Executive shall not invest in, or receive any payment in any form, whether paid currently or deferred, from any customer or any person or  entity  in  discussions  to  become  a  customer  of  the  Company,  vendor  to  the  Company,  lender  and  those companies that are set forth on a written list presented to Executive by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee  simultaneously  with  the  execution  hereof,  and  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  C,  and  agreed  thereto  by Executive  as  evidenced  by  execution  of  this Agreement  (each  entity  so  listed,  a  ' Prohibited  Investment  Entity '). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee may amend such list in good faith  based  on  the  same  criteria  as  the  initial  list  (except  to  the  extent  the  Company's  business  has  changed  or expanded) at any time by written notice to Executive; provided, that, if any such modification shall be made which would cause Executive to be in a then current violation, Executive shall be afforded a reasonable period to divest himself of such investment, and nothing herein shall preclude Executive from holding less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of any publicly traded Prohibited Investment Entity or from indirectly holding an interest in any such Prohibited Investment Entity as a result of any investment in a publicly traded or available mutual or index fund or a hedge fund or private equity fund.\n- 10. Mutual Non-Disparagement . Executive hereby covenants and agrees that Executive will not at any time, whether during or within five (5) years after the end of the Agreement Term, defame, disparage or criticize the Company, or any of their respective directors or officers, or products or services. The provisions of this Section 10 shall  not  apply  to  truthful  testimony,  statements  made  by  Executive  in  the  course  of  Executive's  good  faith performance  of  his  duties  to  the  Company  or  in  connection  with  his  fiduciary  duties  to  the  Company  (including normal  work-related  statements  in  connection  with  the  performance  of  services  for  the  Company  (including performance  reviews)),  normal  competitive-type  statements  if  Executive  is  working  for  a  competitor  and  such statements are made in connection with a comparison of quality of performance, or statements made in rebuttal of statements  made  by  the  officers  and  directors  of  the  Company  and  limited  to  the  extent  reasonably  necessary  to accomplish such rebuttal. The Company shall request that, and instruct, its directors and senior officers not defame, disparage or criticize Executive, except in the good faith performance of their duties to the Company or in connection with their fiduciary duties to the Company.\n- 11. Cooperation .  Upon  the  receipt  of  reasonable  notice  from  the  Company  (including  the  Company's outside counsel), Executive agrees that while employed by the Company and thereafter, Executive will respond and provide information with regard to matters of which Executive has knowledge as a result of Executive's employment with the Company, and will provide reasonable assistance to the Company and their respective representatives in defense of any claims that may be made against the Company (or any member thereof), and will provide reasonable assistance  to  the  Company  in  the  prosecution  of  any  claims  that  may  be  made  by  the  Company  (or  any  member thereof), to the extent that such claims may relate to matters related to Executive's period of employment with the Company (or any predecessors). Any request for such cooperation shall take into account Executive's other personal and business commitments and shall not require Executive to cooperate against his own legal interests. Executive also agrees to promptly inform the Company (to the extent Executive is legally permitted to do so) if Executive is asked to assist in any investigation of the Company (or any member thereof) or their actions, regardless of whether a lawsuit  or  other  proceeding  has  then  been  filed  with  respect  to  such  investigation,  and  shall  not  provide  such assistance  unless  legally  required.  If  Executive  is  required  to  provide  any  services  pursuant  to  this  Section  11 following  the  Agreement  Term,  upon  presentation  of  appropriate  documentation,  the  Partnership  shall  promptly reimburse Executive for reasonable out-of-pocket travel, lodging, communication and duplication expenses incurred in connection with the performance of such services and in accordance with the Company's expense policy for its senior  officers,  and  for  legal  fees  to  the  extent  Executive  in  good  faith  reasonably  believes  that  separate representation  is  warranted,  subject  to  any  different  process  required  by  the  terms  of  the  directors'  and  officers' liability insurance policy. Executive's entitlement to reimbursement of such costs and expenses, including legal fees, pursuant to this Section 11, shall in no way affect Executive's rights, if any, to be indemnified or advanced expenses or afforded exculpation in accordance with the Company's (or any of its affiliates' or subsidiaries') corporate or other organizational documents, any separate written indemnification agreement, any applicable insurance policy, under applicable law, or in accordance with this",

Without intending to limit the remedies available to the Company, each party hereto acknowledges that a breach by such party of any of the covenants contained in this Section F may result in material and irreparable injury to the other party hereto (including, in the case of the Company, its affiliates or subsidiaries), for  which  there  is  no  adequate  remedy  at  law,  that  it  will  not  be  possible  to  measure  damages  for  such  injuries precisely  and  that,  in  the  event  of  such  a  breach  or  threat,  the  aggrieved  party  shall  be  entitled  to  a  temporary restraining  order  or  a  preliminary  or  permanent  injunction  restraining  the  other  party  hereto  from  engaging  in activities  prohibited  by  this  Section  F  or  such  other  relief  as  may  be  required  specifically  to  enforce  any  of  the covenants in this Section F. If for any reason it is held that the restrictions under this Section F are not reasonable or that consideration therefor is inadequate, such restrictions shall be interpreted or modified to include as much of the duration and scope identified in this section as will render such restrictions valid and enforceable.\n- 13. Tolling . In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Section F, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination restrictions contained in this Section 13 shall be extended by a period of time equal to  the  period  of  such  violation  (unless  the  Company  determined  not  to  challenge  such  violation),  it  being  the intention of the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.\n- 14. Transfer of Duties .  Executive must cooperate with the orderly transfer of his duties as reasonably requested by the Company.\n- 15. Return  of  Property .  Executive  must  return  all  Company  property  by  a  date  specified  by  the Company.\n- 16. Change of Control . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon and after the occurrence of  a  Change  of  Control,  Executive  shall  not  be  bound  by  Sections  F(7)  or  F(9)  and  the  provisions,  restrictions, covenants, and limitations thereof shall no longer apply and shall be of no force and effect.\n- G.

If  a  court  holds  that  the  restrictions  as  set  forth  above  are  unreasonable,  the  parties hereto  agree  that  the  maximum  period,  scope  or  geographical  area  reasonable  under  the  circumstances  shall  be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law.\n- H. Remedies . Executive agrees that given the nature of AIMCO's business, the scope and duration of the restrictions as set forth above are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of AIMCO and do not unduly interfere with Executive's career or economic pursuits. Executive recognizes and agrees that a breach by Executive of any or all of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute immediate and irreparable harm to AIMCO's business, for which damages cannot be readily calculated and for which damages is an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, Executive acknowledges that AIMCO shall therefore be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent any breach or threatened breach of any such Section. Each party shall be responsible for its own costs and expenses,  including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  costs,  incurred  in  connection  with  the  enforcement  of  this Agreement.\n\n## I.

As more fully set forth below, the Company desires to provide you with certain benefits in exchange for certain agreements by you.

Definitions.\n- a. 'You' and 'Your' shall refer to Wes Powell.\n- b. The 'Separation Date' shall be [INSERT DATE].\n- c. The  'Separation  Amount'  shall  be  $[AMOUNT],  equal  to  the  sum  of  your  Severance Payment and your COBRA Severance Payment, less applicable tax withholdings.\n- 2. Separation  of  Employment. Your  employment  with  Aimco  will  terminate  effective  as  of  the Separation  Date.  From  and  after  the  Separation  Date,  You  shall  have  no  authority  and  shall  not represent Yourself as an employee or agent of any of the Aimco Parties (as defined below).\n- 3. Separation Pay and Benefits. In exchange for the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practical after Company's receipt of a signed original counterpart (the 'Effective Date') and after the tenth (10 th ) day following Your execution of this Agreement but in no event later than fifty (50) days following Your Separation Date, the Company shall:\n- a. Provide You with separation pay equal to the Separation Amount in one lump sum payment and, to the extent applicable, provide You with a Pro- Rata Bonus (together, the 'Separation Pay'). Subject to the timing restrictions above, payment may be made in accordance with the Company's ordinary payroll practices at the conclusion of regularly scheduled pay periods, provided,  however,  that Your  Pro-Rata  Bonus  shall  be  paid  on  the  date  that  Bonuses  are normally paid, but in no event later than March 15th of [INSERT YEAR].\n- b. Additionally, regardless of whether You sign this Agreement:\n- (i) You will be paid and otherwise remain entitled to any and all Accrued Rights.\n- (ii) Without  limiting  the  terms  of  subsection  (i)  above,  if  You  are  covered  by  the Company's  medical  and/or  dental  insurance  plans  on  the  Separation  Date,  these benefits will continue through the end of the month of the Separation Date. You will have  the  right  to  continue  Your  medical  insurance  thereafter  pursuant  to  the provisions  of  the  Consolidated  Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act  of  1985 ('COBRA'). The COBRA qualifying event shall be deemed to have occurred on the Separation Date. Following the end of the month of the Separation Date, You shall  be  required  to  pay  the  full  COBRA  premium  rate  if  You  elect  COBRA coverage.\n\nYou acknowledge that except for (i) the specific financial consideration set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) any Accrued Rights, which will be paid to You and otherwise provided in accordance with the terms of Your Employment Agreement, You are not entitled to any additional consideration from the Company or any of the Company Parties.\n\n- 4.

Parties.  This Agreement is binding upon and between Employee and Aimco, which is defined to include Aimco and all of Aimco's parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates (including Apartment Investment and Management Company and Aimco OP L.P.),  divisions,  acquiring  or  ownership  entities,  parent,  associated  or  allied  companies,  corporations,  firms,  partnerships, management  companies,  or  organizations,  purchasers  of  assets  or  stock,  investors,  joint  ventures,  and  any  related  entities (including  any  management  company  and  its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates),  and  the  successors,  predecessors,  assigns,  board members, officers, partners, directors, managers, agents, representatives, or employees thereof (hereinafter, 'the Company'). Employee  also  agrees  to  arbitrate  claims  against  any  person  or  entity  he  or  she  alleges  to  be  a  joint  employer  with  the Company.\n- 2. Condition of Employment; No Alteration of Employment Relationship.  Acceptance of the terms of this Agreement by Employee shall be an express condition of employment or continued employment with the Company.  Except for those rights and  duties  encompassed  by  this  Agreement  itself,  this  Agreement  shall  not  otherwise  alter  the  'at  will'  nature  of  the employment  relationship  between  Employee  and  the  Company , and  shall  not  be  construed  to  confer  upon  Employee  any additional rights or privileges that Employee would not otherwise have.\n- 3. Binding Arbitration.  Any Claim (as defined in Paragraph 7, below) shall be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION ONLY, and NO COURT ACTION MAY BE BROUGHT BY EMPLOYEE or the Company to resolve any Claim. The determination of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The remedies available in such arbitration shall in all respects be the same as those available in a court of law.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Arbitration under this Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted according to the Federal Arbitration Act.\n- 4. Negotiation  and  Mediation.    Notwithstanding  this Agreement,  either  the  Company  or  Employee  may  request  that  the Parties engage in bilateral negotiation or mediation of any Claim through a neutral party.  Should both Parties agree to such mediation, and agree upon a particular neutral party to conduct the same, the fees of such mediator shall be split between Employee  and  the  Company.    Negotiation  or  mediation  as  described  herein  is  strictly  voluntary,  and  no  Party  is  required hereunder to engage in any such activity at any time.\n- 5. Arbitrator.    The  binding  arbitration  conducted  hereunder  shall  be  administered  under  the  Judicial  Arbitration  and Mediation  Services  (JAMS)  Employment  Arbitration  Rules  and  Procedures,  as  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time (collectively,  the  'JAMS  Rules')  (available  online  at  www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration),  or  under  other  such rules and procedures to which the Parties may mutually agree.  However, in the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the JAMS Rules, the terms of this Agreement shall control.  The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted by a single, mutually agreed-upon neutral arbitrator from a panel of arbitrators provided by JAMS or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties.  If Employee and the Company are unable to mutually agree upon an arbitrator from the panel provided by JAMS, Employee and the Company shall utilize the JAMS procedures for arbitrator selection. The selected arbitrator shall be qualified in  employment  matters,  and  subject  to  the  agreed  upon  rules,  shall  afford  the  Parties  the  opportunity  to  present  and  rebut evidence relating to the Claim.\n- 6. Notice and Procedures.  Arbitration under this Agreement shall be initiated by Employee or the Company by serving written notice upon the other Party by mail or other reasonable method of a demand for arbitration hereunder, and, upon such written  notice,  Employee  and  the  Company  shall  use  their  best  efforts  to  cause  the  arbitration  to  be  conducted  in  an expeditious manner.\n- a.

Unless otherwise required by law or the JAMS Rules as determined by the arbitrator, (i) each Party shall bear its own costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees in such arbitration and (ii) at Employee's option, the fees and costs of the  arbitration  charged  by  the  arbitrator  either  (a)  shall  be  shared  equally  by  the  Parties,  (b)  shall  be  paid  solely  by  the Company, or (c) shall be paid solely by Employee. The arbitrator shall enforce any and all statutes of limitation or other time limitations in any way applicable to any Claim, to include time limitations resulting from a failure to timely exhaust administrative remedies. The arbitrator also shall have the authority to provide for reimbursement of legal fees or costs, in whole or in part, as part of any remedy or award in accordance with applicable law or in the interests of justice. Upon the close of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written reasoned decision, which shall include a summary of the claims, issues, and relief requested, and the reasons for the results reached in the case.\n- c. The Parties agree not to bring any disputes between each other on a collective, class, or representative basis; rather, the Parties agree to bring such disputes in arbitration on an individual basis only. Under this Agreement, any class  action,  collective  action,  representative  action,  or  other  procedure  for  consolidation  or  joinder  of  Claims  of  multiple parties is prohibited. This Agreement shall not be construed to allow or permit the consolidation or joinder of claims of other claimants, or to permit such claims to proceed as a class or collective action, or as a representative action. No arbitrator acting hereunder shall have the authority under this Agreement to order any such class or collective action or the power to decide any class, collective, representative, joined or consolidated claims.  No Party to this Agreement may attempt to proceed hereunder as a member or representative of any class, putative class, or group purporting to have similar Claims.  Neither may any Party proceed hereunder against any class or group it purports to be similarly liable. Only a court of competent jurisdiction may rule upon the enforceability of this Paragraph 6(c). Notwithstanding Paragraph 11 below, should any such court determine in a proceeding involving this Agreement that any provision of this Paragraph 6(c) is unenforceable for any reason, the particular Claims encompassed in the particular provision deemed unenforceable shall stay in court, and this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. The Parties agree that the foregoing class, collective or representative action waiver shall be enforced to the full  extent  permitted  by  law. To  the  extent  any  class,  collective  or  representative  actions  are  deemed  nonwaivable, such actions will remain in court.\n- 7. Claims Defined.  For the purposes of this Agreement, 'Claim' shall be defined as any dispute, matter, controversy, demand, action, cause of action, or claim of any kind or nature whatsoever by Employee or the Company relating to, arising out of, in connection with, or involving Employee's employment or termination of employment, whether for damages or for other  legal  or  equitable  relief,  and  whether  arising  under  federal,  state,  or  local  law.    'Claim'  shall  include,  without limitation, any claim arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; the Civil Rights Act of 1991; Sections  1981  through  1988  of  Title  42  of  the  United  States  Code,  as  amended;  the  Equal  Pay  Act,  as  amended;  the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended; the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended; the Fair Credit Reporting Act (and any similar state law); the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as amended; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended; the Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended; the Immigration Reform and Control Act, as amended; the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act; the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002; the Fair Labor Standards Act; or any other federal, state or local law, whether statutorily codified  or  not,  governing  discrimination  in  employment  or  the  payment  of  wages  and  benefits  or  any  claim  arising  in contract or in tort.  This Agreement shall not apply to worker's compensation disputes; unemployment insurance; any claim for employee benefits governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985; or any claim arising under the National Labor Relations Act; or any other claim not subject to arbitration under applicable law.\n- 8. Administrative Agencies.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent Employee from filing a complaint, charge, or petition with any administrative agency regarding employment issues as to which the agency has independent jurisdiction to investigate or administer, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, National Labor Relations Board, or any similar state or local agencies. Once the agency's proceedings are completed, however, if Employee wishes to pursue the matter further, Employee understands that Employee",

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, either the Company or Employee may file a complaint or commence a court action to obtain an injunction to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or to seek a temporary  restraining  order  or  preliminary  injunction  or  other  provisional  relief  to  maintain  the  status  quo,  pending  the application  or  enforcement  of  this Agreement.    Despite  any  such  complaint  or  action,  the  Company  and  Employee  shall otherwise continue to abide by this Agreement in good faith.\n- 10. Participation  in  Other  Forums;  Waiver.    Participation  by  the  Company  in  proceedings  in  any  other  forum  shall  not constitute a waiver of this Agreement, and the Company and Employee shall at all times have the right to demand arbitration pursuant to this Agreement.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the Party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced.  No valid waiver of any provision of this Agreement at any time shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement at such time or be deemed a valid waiver of such provision at any other time.  No failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right.  No single or partial exercise by any Party of any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will preclude any other or future exercise thereof.\n- 11. Survival and Severability.  The provisions of this Agreement shall survive Employee's termination of employment for any reason. Except as set forth in Paragraph 6(c) above, if any portion of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, such portion shall be severed from this Agreement, and the balance of this Agreement shall remain in effect.  If a court of competent jurisdiction  declares  this  Agreement  to  be  unenforceable  in  its  entirety,  this  Agreement  shall  be  deemed  void  and  any Arbitration Agreement previously executed by Employee and the Company shall supersede this Agreement and control.\n- 12. Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, including its statute of limitations, without regard to any otherwise applicable principles of conflict of laws or choice of law rules (whether of the State of Colorado or any other jurisdiction) that would result in the application of the substantive or procedural laws or rules of any other jurisdiction.\n- 13.

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the respective  meanings  set  forth  in  the  Apartment  Investment  and  Management  Company  Second  Amended  and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the 'Plan').\n\nWHEREAS, effective [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Date of Grant'), the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the  'Committee')  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  'Board')  of  the  Company  granted  the  Recipient  a Restricted Stock Award, pursuant to which the Recipient shall receive shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ('Common Stock'), pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recipient's services to the Company and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n- 1. Number of Shares and Share Price.  The Company hereby grants the Recipient a Restricted Stock Award (the 'Stock Award') of [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] shares of Common Stock (the 'Restricted Stock') pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan.\n\n## 2. Restrictions and Restricted Period.\n\n- (a) Restrictions.    Shares  of  Restricted  Stock  granted  hereunder  may  not  be  sold,  assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and shall be subject to a risk of forfeiture until the lapse of  the  Restricted  Period  (as  defined  below).   The  Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any shares of Restricted Stock which shall have been sold or transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth in this Agreement,  or  (ii)  to  treat  as  owner  of  such  shares  or  to  accord  the  right  to  vote  as  such  owner  or  to  pay dividends to any transferee to whom such shares shall have been so transferred.\n- (b) Lapse of Restrictions; Restricted Period.  The restrictions set forth above shall lapse and the Restricted  Stock  shall  become  freely  transferable  (provided , that such  transfer  is  otherwise  in  accordance  with federal and state securities laws) and non-forfeitable as follows:  as to twenty five percent (25%) of the Restricted Stock on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]; as to twenty five percent (25%) of the Restricted Stock on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]; as to twenty five percent (25%) of the Restricted Stock on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]; and as to twenty five percent (25%) of the Restricted Stock on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Restricted Period').  In order to enforce the foregoing restrictions, the Board may (i) require that the certificates representing the shares of Restricted Stock remain in the physical custody of the Company or in book entry until any or all of such restrictions expire or have been removed, and (ii) may cause a legend or legends to be placed on the certificates which make appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed under the Plan.\n- (c) Rights of a Stockholder.  From and after the Date of Grant and for so long as the Restricted Stock is held by or for the benefit of the Recipient, the Recipient shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock, including but not limited to the right to receive dividends and the right to vote such shares, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2(d) hereof.\n- (d) Dividends.  Dividends paid on Restricted Stock shall be paid at the dividend payment date for the Common Stock, or be deferred for payment to such date as determined by the Committee; provided such deferral is in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property.  Stock distributed in connection with a Common Stock split or Common Stock dividend, and other property distributed as a dividend (excluding cash), shall be subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Common Stock or other property has been distributed.",

Except  as  otherwise  set  forth  in  this  Agreement,  in  the  event  that Recipient ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason prior to the lapse of the Restricted Period, then the Restricted Stock and any accrued but unpaid dividends that are at that time subject to restrictions set forth herein, shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests  in  such  shares  of  Restricted  Stock  or  certificates.  In  the  event  that  Recipient's  employment  with  the Company is terminated due to his death or total and permanent disability then the Restricted Period set  forth  in Section  2(b)  hereof  shall  immediately  lapse  as  to  all  shares  of  Restricted  Stock  and  the  Restricted  Stock  shall become immediately fully vested.  For purposes of this Section 3, Recipient's employment will have terminated by reason of total and permanent disability if, in the reasonable and good faith judgment of the Company, the Recipient is totally and permanently disabled and is unable to return to or perform his or her duties on a full-time basis.\n- 4. Change in Control.  All unvested shares of Restricted Stock issued hereunder shall, in addition to any provisions relating to vesting contained in this Agreement, become immediately fully vested upon the termination of Recipient's employment with the Company by the Company without Cause or by Recipient for Good Reason, in either case within the period commencing six months prior to and ending twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below).\n- (a) For  purposes  of  this Agreement,  a  'Change  in  Control'  shall  mean  the  occurrence  of  any  of  the following events:\n- (i) an  acquisition  (other  than  directly  from  the  Company)  of  any  voting  securities  of  the Company (the 'Voting Securities') by any 'person' (as the term 'person' is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or Section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act')) immediately after which such person has 'beneficial ownership' (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) ('Beneficial Ownership') of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities that are acquired in a Non-Control Acquisition (as hereinafter defined) shall not constitute an acquisition that would cause a Change in Control.  'Non-Control Acquisition' shall mean an acquisition (A) by or under an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (1) the Company or (2) any corporation, partnership or other person of which a majority of its voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by the Company or in which the Company serves as a general partner or manager (a 'Subsidiary'), (B) by the Company or any Subsidiary, or (C) by any person in connection with a Non-Control Transaction (as hereinafter defined).  'NonControl Transaction' shall mean a merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization involving the Company, in which (1) the stockholders of the Company, immediately before such merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization,  own,  directly  or  indirectly  immediately  following  such  merger,  consolidation,  share  exchange  or reorganization, at least 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation that is the successor in such merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization (the 'Surviving Company') in substantially  the  same  proportion  as  their  ownership  of  the  Voting  Securities  immediately  before  such  merger, consolidation,  share  exchange  or  reorganization,  and  (2)  the  individuals  who  were  members  of  the  Board  of Directors  of  the  Company  immediately  prior  to  the  execution  of  the  agreement  providing  for  such  merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization constitute at least 50% of the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Company;\n- (ii) the  individuals  who  constitute  the  Board  as  of  the  date  hereof  (the  'Incumbent  Board') cease for any reason to constitute at least 50% of the Board; provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, of any new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such new director shall be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided, further, that no individual shall be considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened 'election contest' (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (an 'Election Contest') or  other  actual  or  threatened  solicitation  of  proxies  or  consents  by  or  on behalf  of  a  person  other  than  the  Board  of  Directors  (a  'Proxy  Contest')  including  by  reason  of  any  agreement intended to avoid or settle any Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or\n\n(iii) the consummation of any of the following: (A) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization involving the Company (other than a Non-Control Transaction); (B) a complete liquidation",

Any termination shall be treated as a termination for Cause  only  if  (i)  Recipient  is  given  at  least  five  (5)  business  days'  written  notice  of  termination  specifying  the alleged  Cause  event  and  shall  have  the  opportunity  to  appear  (with  counsel)  before  the  full  Board  to  present information regarding his or her views on the Cause event, and (ii) after such hearing, Recipient is terminated for Cause by at least a majority of the Board.  After providing the notice of termination in the foregoing sentence, the Board may suspend Recipient with full pay and benefits until a final determination pursuant to this Section 4(b) has been made.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(b), if Recipient is party to an employment agreement with the Company that provides a definition of Cause, such definition shall apply instead of the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(b).\n\n- (c) 'Good  Reason'  mean  (i)  a  reduction  in  Recipient's  base  salary;  (ii)  a  material  diminution  in Recipient's title or responsibilities; or (iii) relocation of Recipient's primary place of employment more than fifty miles; provided, however, that  Recipient  may  only  terminate  employment for Good Reason by delivering written notice  to  the  Board  within  ninety  (90)  days  following  the  date  on  which  Recipient  first  knows  of  the  event constituting Good Reason, which notice specifically identifies the facts and circumstances claimed by Recipient to constitute Good Reason, and the Company has failed to cure such facts and circumstances within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice; and provided further, however, that if Recipient is party to an employment agreement with the Company that provides a definition of Good Reason, such definition shall apply instead of the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(c).\n\n## 5.

Capitalized  terms  used  but  not  otherwise  defined  in  this Agreement shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the 'Plan').\n\nWHEREAS, effective [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Date of Grant'), the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the  'Committee')  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  'Board')  of  the  Company  granted  the  Recipient  a Performance Restricted Stock Award, pursuant to which the Recipient shall receive shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ('Common Stock'), pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recipient's services to the Company and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n- 1. Number of Shares and Share Price.  The Company hereby grants the Recipient a Performance Restricted Stock Award (the  'Stock Award')  with  a  target  of  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  shares  of  Common  Stock  (the  'Restricted Stock') pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan.  The Recipient may ultimately vest into  more  shares  of  Common  Stock  or  fewer  or  no  shares  of  Common  Stock,  as  set  forth  in  more  detail  in  this Agreement.\n\n## 2. Restrictions and Restricted Period.\n\n- (a) Restrictions.    Shares  of  Restricted  Stock  granted  hereunder  may  not  be  sold,  assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and shall be subject to a risk of forfeiture until the lapse of  the  Restricted  Period  (as  defined  below).   The  Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any shares of Restricted Stock which shall have been sold or transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth in this Agreement,  or  (ii)  to  treat  as  owner  of  such  shares  or  to  accord  the  right  to  vote  as  such  owner  or  to  pay dividends to any transferee to whom such shares shall have been so transferred.\n- (b) Lapse of Restrictions; Restricted Period.  The restrictions set forth above shall lapse and the Restricted  Stock  shall  become  freely  transferable  (provided , that such  transfer  is  otherwise  in  accordance  with federal and state securities laws) and non-forfeitable as set forth in this Section 2(b) and on Exhibit A.\n- (i) The Company's total shareholder return (as defined in more detail on Exhibit A, 'TSR') over  the  period  beginning  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  and  ending  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  (the 'Performance Period'), as calculated by comparison to the indices stipulated on Exhibit A to this Agreement (and using the methodology set forth on such Exhibit A), shall be compared to the threshold,  target  and  maximum  TSR  hurdles  set  forth  on  Exhibit  A  to  determine  the  'Vesting Portion' (as defined on Exhibit A) of the Stock Award as a percentage of the Target Award.  Such calculations shall be determined by the Committee no later than [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the date of such determination, the 'Determination Date').  Restrictions with respect to 50% of the related Vesting  Portion  of  the  Stock  Award  set  forth  on  Exhibit  A  shall  lapse  as  of  the  later  of  the Determination Date and [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'First Vesting Date'), with the restrictions on the remaining  50%  of  such  Vesting  Portion  lapsing  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  (the  'Second  Vesting Date').\n- (ii) Except as set forth in Section 3, each such lapse of restrictions shall occur only if the Recipient has remained employed by the Company through the First Vesting Date or the Second Vesting Date, as the case may be (the 'Restricted Period').  The portion of the Restricted Stock which does not vest as of the First Vesting Date (or the Second Vesting Date, as the case may be)",

From and after the Date of Grant and for so long as the Restricted Stock is held by or for the benefit of the Recipient, the Recipient shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock, including but not limited to the right to receive dividends and the right to vote such shares, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2(d) hereof.\n- (d) Dividends.  Stock distributed in connection with a Common Stock split or Common Stock dividend, and other property distributed as a dividend (including cash), shall be subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Common Stock or other property has been distributed. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, cash dividends paid on Restricted Stock shall be deferred for payment until the Determination Date; provided such deferral is in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property.  Such deferred dividends shall be paid to recipient as promptly as practicable in the pay period following the Determination Date.\n- 3. Termination of Employment.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, in the event that the Recipient ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason prior to the lapse of the Restricted Period, then the Restricted Stock and any accrued but unpaid dividends that are at that time subject to restrictions set forth herein, shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such shares of Restricted Stock or certificates.  In the event that the Recipient's employment with the Company is terminated due to his death or total and permanent disability, then the Restricted Period set forth in Section 2(b) hereof shall immediately lapse and the Restricted Stock shall become immediately and fully vested, with the level of TSR performance calculated as if the date of termination was the final day of the Performance Period,  and  as  if  the  level  of  TSR  performance  as  of  such  date  was  the  higher  of  (a)  target  or  (b)  actual  TSR performance as of such date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee in accordance with Section 2(b) and  Exhibit A.    Restricted  Stock  not  vesting  in  accordance  with  the  foregoing  sentence  shall  be  forfeited  to  the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors,  heirs,  assigns  or  personal  representatives  shall  thereafter  have  any  further  rights  or  interests  in  such shares  of  Restricted  Stock  or  certificates.    For  purposes  of  this  Section  3,  the  Recipient's  employment  will  have terminated  by  reason  of  total  and  permanent  disability  if,  in  the  reasonable  and  good  faith  judgment  of  the Committee, the Recipient is totally and permanently disabled and is unable to return to or perform his or her duties on a full-time basis.\n- 4. Change  in  Control.    The  Restricted  Stock  issued  hereunder  shall,  in  addition  to  any  provisions relating to vesting contained in this Agreement, become immediately and fully vested, and the Restricted Period set forth in Section 2(b) hereof shall immediately lapse, upon the termination of the Recipient's employment with the Company by the Company without Cause or by the Recipient for Good Reason, in either case within the period commencing  six  months  prior  to  and  ending  twenty-four  (24)  months  following  the  occurrence  of  a  Change  in Control (as defined below), with the level of TSR performance calculated as if the date of the Change in Control was the final day of the Performance Period, and as if the level of TSR performance as of such date was the higher of (a) target  or  (b)  actual  TSR  performance  as  of  such  date,  as  determined  in  the  sole  discretion  of  the  Committee  in accordance with Section 2(b) and Exhibit A.",

'Non-Control Acquisition' shall mean an acquisition (A) by or under an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (1) the Company or (2) any corporation, partnership or other person of which a majority of its voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by the Company or in which the Company serves as a general partner or manager (a 'Subsidiary'), (B) by the Company or any Subsidiary, or (C) by any person in connection with a Non-Control Transaction (as hereinafter defined).

Tax Withholding; Tax Treatment.\n\n- (a) Tax Withholding.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the release of the shares of Restricted Stock  hereunder  shall  be  conditioned  upon  the  Recipient  making  adequate  provision  for  federal,  state  or  other withholding obligations, if any, which may arise upon the vesting of the Restricted Stock.\n- (b) Tax Treatment.

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the 'Plan').\n\nWHEREAS, on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Grant Date') the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the 'Committee') of the Board of Directors (the 'Board') of the Company awarded the Optionee a nonqualified stock option, exercisable to purchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share ('Common Stock'), pursuant to, and subject to the terms and provisions of, the Plan.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Optionee's services to the Company and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n1. Number of Shares and Purchase Price.  The Company hereby grants the Optionee a nonqualified stock option (the 'Option') to purchase [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] shares of Common Stock (the 'Target Option Shares')  at  a  purchase  price  per  share  equal  to  [ $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the  'Exercise  Price'),  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan. The Optionee may ultimately vest into more Target Option Shares or fewer or none as set forth in more detail in this Agreement.\n\n## 2. Period of Option and Conditions of Exercise.\n\n- (a) Unless  the  Option  is  previously  terminated  pursuant  to  this Agreement  or  the  Plan,  the Option shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant (the 'Expiration Date').  Upon the termination of the Option, all rights of the Optionee hereunder shall cease.\n- (b)   The Option shall become exercisable as set forth in this Section 2(b) and on Exhibit A.\n- (i) The Company's total shareholder return (as defined in more detail on Exhibit A, 'TSR') over  the  period  beginning  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  and  ending  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  (the  'Performance Period'), as calculated by comparison to the indices stipulated on Exhibit A to this Agreement (and using the methodology set forth on such Exhibit A), shall be compared to the threshold, target and maximum TSR hurdles set forth on Exhibit A to determine the 'Vesting Portion' (as defined on Exhibit A) of the Option as a percentage of the Target Option Shares.  Such calculations shall be determined by the Committee no later than  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  (the  date  of  such  determination,  the  'Determination  Date').    Restrictions  with respect to 50% of the related Vesting Portion of the Option set forth on Exhibit A shall lapse as of the later of the Determination Date and [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'First Vesting Date'), with the restrictions on the remaining 50% of such Vesting Portion lapsing on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Second Vesting Date').\n- (ii) Except  as  set  forth  in  Section  4,  each  such  lapse  of  restrictions  shall  occur  only  if  the Recipient has remained employed by the Company through the First Vesting Date or the Second Vesting Date, as the case may be (the 'Restricted Period').  The portion of the Option that does not vest as of the First Vesting Date (or the Second Vesting Date, as the case may be) based on TSR performance, shall, as of the  First  Vesting  Date  (or  the  Second  Vesting  Date,  as  the  case  may  be),  be  forfeited  to  the  Company without  payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such Option.\n\n(iii) All determinations with respect to the calculations pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee.",

Exercise of Option.\n\n- (a) The  Option  may  be  exercised  only  by  the  Optionee  or,  in  the  event  of  the  death  or incapacity of the Optionee, the Optionee's successor, heir or legal representative.  The Option shall be exercised by delivery to the Company of (i) a written notice, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, specify the number of shares for which the Option is being exercised to purchase, and (ii) full payment of the Exercise Price for such  number  of  shares  being  purchased  (in  respect  of  such  shares,  the  'Total  Exercise  Price'),  in  the  manner provided below, and any transfer or withholding taxes applicable thereto.\n- (b) Payment of the Exercise Price for any shares being purchased shall be made as follows:\n- (i) The Optionee may satisfy all or any portion of the Total Exercise Price by delivery to the Company of cash, by certified or cashier's check, or\n- (ii) The Optionee may satisfy all of any portion of the Total Exercise Price by (A) assignment, transfer  and  delivery  to  the  Company,  free  of  any  liens,  claims  or  encumbrances,  of  shares  of  Common Stock",

If the Optionee pays by assignment, transfer and delivery of shares of Common Stock, the Optionee must include with  the  notice  of  exercise  the  certificates  for  such  shares  of  Common  Stock,  either  duly  endorsed  for transfer  or  accompanied  by  an  appropriately  executed  stock  power  in  favor  of  the  Company.    If  the Optionee  pays  by  assignment  and  transfer  of  OP  Units,  the  Optionee  must  include  with  the  notice  of exercise a duly executed assignment of all of the Optionee's interest in such OP Units.  For purposes of this Agreement, the value of all such shares of Common Stock delivered by the Optionee will be their Fair Market Value, and the value of all OP Units assigned by the Optionee will be the Fair Market Value of the number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  for  which  such  OP  Units  are  then  subject  to  exchange  upon  a redemption of such OP Units.  If the value of the shares of Common Stock delivered, or OP Units assigned, by  the  Optionee  exceeds  the  amount  required  to  be  paid  pursuant  to  this  Section  5,  the  Company  will provide to the Optionee, as soon as practicable, cash or a check in an amount equal to the value of any fractional portion of a share of Common Stock or OP Unit, and will issue a certificate to the Optionee for any whole share(s) of Common Stock or OP Units exceeding the number of shares of Common Stock or OP Units required to pay the Exercise Price for all shares being purchased; or\n- (iii) At the discretion of the Administrator, the Optionee may satisfy all of any portion of the Total Exercise Price by means of a cashless exercise procedure.\n- (c) Not less than 100 shares of Common Stock may be purchased at any time upon the exercise of the Option, unless the number of shares of Common Stock so purchased constitutes the total number of shares for which the Option is then exercisable.  The Option may be exercised only to purchase whole shares of Common Stock, and in no case may a fractional share of Common Stock be purchased.  The right of the Optionee to purchase shares for which the Option is then exercisable may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, prior to the Expiration Date.\n- (d) The Company may require the Optionee to pay, prior to the delivery of any shares to which the Optionee shall be entitled upon exercise of the Option, an amount equal to the Federal, state and local income taxes and other amounts required by law to be withheld by the Company with respect thereto.  Alternatively, the Optionee may authorize the Company to withhold from the number of shares he or she would otherwise receive upon exercise  of  the  Option,  that  number  of  shares  having  a  Fair  Market  Value  equal  to  the  minimum  statutory withholding taxes with respect thereto.\n- (e) This Option may not be exercised unless such exercise is in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act') and all applicable state securities laws as they are in effect on the date of exercise and the requirements of any stock exchange or national market system on which the Common Stock may be listed at the time of exercise.  The Optionee understands that the Company is under no obligation to register, qualify or list the Option Shares with the Securities Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any stock exchange or national market system to effect such compliance.\n\n## 6.

After providing the notice of termination  in  the  foregoing  sentence,  the  Board  may  suspend  Optionee  with  full  pay  and  benefits  until  a  final determination pursuant to this Section 6(a) has been made.

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and  Incentive  Plan  (the  'Plan'),  and  the  Partnership  Unit  Designation  relating  to  LTIP  Units  in  the  Partnership Agreement (the 'Partnership Unit Designation' or 'PUD').\n\nWHEREAS, effective [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Date of Grant'), pursuant to the Plan and the amended and Restated  Agreement  of  Limited  Partnership  of  the  Partnership,  as  amended  (the  'Partnership  Agreement'),  the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the 'Committee') of the Board of Directors (the 'Board') of the Company granted the Recipient this LTIP Award and hereby causes the Partnership to issue to the Recipient the maximum  number  of  LTIP  Units  set  forth  below,  having  the  rights,  restrictions,  limitations  as  to  distributions, qualifications  and  terms  and  conditions  of  redemption  and  conversion  set  forth  herein,  in  the  Plan  and  in  the Partnership Agreement.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recipient's services to the Company and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n- 1. Number of  LTIP  Units.    The  Company  hereby  grants  the  Recipient  an  LTIP  Unit Award  (the  'LTIP Award') with a target of [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] LTIP Units (the 'LTIP Units') pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the provisions of the Plan and the provisions of the Partnership Agreement.  The Recipient may ultimately vest into more LTIP Units or fewer or no LTIP Units, as set forth in more detail in this Agreement.  The Recipient shall be admitted as a partner of the Partnership with beneficial ownership of the LTIP Units as of the Date of Grant by (i) signing  and  delivering  to  the  Partnership  a  copy  of  this  Agreement  and  (ii)  signing,  as  a  limited  partner,  and delivering to the Partnership a counterpart signature page to the Partnership Agreement (attached hereto as Exhibit A).\n\n## 2. Restrictions and Restricted Period.\n\n(a) Restrictions.  LTIP Units granted hereunder may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and shall be subject to a risk of forfeiture until the lapse of the Restricted Period (as defined below).  Neither the Company nor the Partnership shall be required (i) to transfer on its books any LTIP  Units  which  shall  have  been  sold  or  transferred  in  violation  of  any  of  the  provisions  set  forth  in  this Agreement,  or  (ii)  to  treat  as  owner  of  such  LTIP  Units  or  to  accord  the  right  to  vote  as  such  owner  or  to  pay dividends to any transferee to whom such LTIP Units shall have been so transferred.\n\n(b) Lapse of Restrictions; Restricted Period.  The restrictions set forth above shall lapse and the LTIP Units shall become freely transferable (provided , that such transfer is otherwise in accordance with federal and state securities laws) and non-forfeitable as set forth in this Section 2(b) and on Exhibit B.\n\n(i) The  Company's  total  shareholder  return  (as  defined  in  more  detail  on  Exhibit  B, 'TSR')  over  the  period  beginning  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  and  ending  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  (the  'Performance Period'),  as  calculated  by  comparison  to  the  indices  stipulated  on  Exhibit  B  to  this  Agreement  (and  using  the methodology set forth on such Exhibit B), shall be compared to the threshold, target and maximum TSR hurdles set forth on Exhibit B to determine the 'Vesting Portion' (as defined on Exhibit B) of the LTIP Award as a percentage of the Target Award.  Such calculations shall be determined by the Committee no later than [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the date  of  such  determination,  the  'Determination  Date').

The portion of the LTIP Units which does not vest as of the First Vesting Date (or the Second Vesting Date, as the case may be) based on TSR performance shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such shares of LTIP Units.\n\n(iii)All determinations with respect to the calculations pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee.\n\n## (c) Allocations.\n\n(iv)Unless and until the LTIP Units are converted in accordance with Section 2(e) below (such  LTIP  Units  being  referred  to  herein  as  'Converted  LTIP  Units'),  the  LTIP  Units  shall  have  a  Sharing Percentage of 2%.

Provisions in the Partnership Unit Designation with respect to allocations in a Catch-Up Year will not apply to the Converted LTIP Units.\n\n(v) The 'REIT Share Economic Target' applicable to the LTIP Units prior to conversion to Converted LTIP Units means, as of any date, (x) the Market Value of a REIT Share on such date, multiplied by the Adjustment Factor, less (y) the closing price of Aimco's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the Date of Grant (the 'Grant Date Closing Price').  Notwithstanding Section 4(c) of the Partnership Unit Designation, the intention of the parties is to make the Capital Account balance of the holder of the LTIP Units (but not Converted LTIP Units), to the extent attributable to such holder's LTIP Units, economically equivalent (on a per-unit basis) to the REIT Share Economic Target, as defined above.  If the Capital Account of the holder of the LTIP Units (but not Converted LTIP Units), to the extent attributable to such holder's LTIP Units, exceeds (on a per-unit basis) the REIT Share  Economic  Target,  and  Liquidating  Losses  are  available  to  be  allocated  to  an  LTIP  Unit,  then  any  such Liquidating Losses shall be allocated to the holder of the LTIP Units until the holder's Capital Account, to the extent attributable to such holder's LTIP Units, is equal (on a per-unit basis) to the REIT Share Economic Target.\n\n## (d) Distributions.\n\n(vi)From  and  after  the  Date  of  Grant,  the  Recipient  shall  be  entitled  to  receive distributions with respect to all LTIP Units in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Unit Designation, subject to  the  Recipient's  Sharing  Percentage  specified  above.

Termination  of  Employment.    Except  as  otherwise  set  forth  in  this Agreement,  in  the  event  that  the Recipient ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason prior to the lapse of the Restricted Period, then the Unvested LTIP Units shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such LTIP Units.

'Non-Control Acquisition' shall mean an acquisition (A) by or under an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (1) the Company or (2) any corporation, partnership or other person of which a majority of its voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by the Company or in which the Company serves as a general partner or manager (a 'Subsidiary'), (B) by the Company or any Subsidiary, or (C) by any person in connection with a Non-Control Transaction (as hereinafter defined).

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the respective  meanings  set  forth  in  the  Apartment  Investment  and  Management  Company  Second  Amended  and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the 'Plan').\n\nWHEREAS, effective [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Date of Grant'), the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the  'Committee')  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  'Board')  of  the  Company  granted  the  Recipient  a Restricted Stock Award, pursuant to which the Recipient shall receive shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ('Common Stock'), pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recipient's services to the Company and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n- 1. Number of Shares and Share Price.  The Company hereby grants the Recipient a Restricted Stock Award (the 'Stock Award') of [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] shares of Common Stock (the 'Restricted Stock') pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan.\n\n## 2. Restrictions and Restricted Period.\n\n- (a) Restrictions.    Shares  of  Restricted  Stock  granted  hereunder  may  not  be  sold,  assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and shall be subject to a risk of forfeiture until the lapse of  the  Restricted  Period  (as  defined  below).   The  Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any shares of Restricted Stock which shall have been sold or transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth in this Agreement,  or  (ii)  to  treat  as  owner  of  such  shares  or  to  accord  the  right  to  vote  as  such  owner  or  to  pay dividends to any transferee to whom such shares shall have been so transferred.\n- (b) Lapse of Restrictions; Restricted Period.  The restrictions set forth above shall lapse and the Restricted  Stock  shall  become  freely  transferable  (provided,  that  such  transfer  is  otherwise  in  accordance  with federal and state securities laws) and non-forfeitable as follows:  as to one-third (1/3) of the Restricted Stock on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]; as to one-third (1/3) of the Restricted Stock on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]; and as to one-third (1/3) of the Restricted Stock on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Restricted Period').  In order to enforce the foregoing restrictions, the Board may (i) require that the certificates representing the shares of Restricted Stock remain in the physical custody of the Company or in book entry until any or all of such restrictions expire or have been removed, and (ii) may cause a legend or legends to be placed on the certificates which make appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed under the Plan.\n- (c) Rights of a Stockholder.  From and after the Date of Grant and for so long as the Restricted Stock is held by or for the benefit of the Recipient, the Recipient shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock, including but not limited to the right to receive dividends and the right to vote such shares, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2(d) hereof.\n- (d) Dividends.  Dividends paid on Restricted Stock shall be paid at the dividend payment date for the Common Stock, or be deferred for payment to such date as determined by the Committee; provided such deferral is in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property.  Stock distributed in connection with a Common Stock split or Common Stock dividend, and other property distributed as a dividend (excluding cash), shall be subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Common Stock or other property has been distributed.",

Except  as  otherwise  set  forth  in  this  Agreement,  in  the  event  that Recipient ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason prior to the lapse of the Restricted Period, then the Restricted Stock and any accrued but unpaid dividends that are at that time subject to restrictions set forth herein, shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests  in  such  shares  of  Restricted  Stock  or  certificates.    In  the  event  that  Recipient's  employment  with  the Company is terminated due to his death or total and permanent disability then the Restricted Period set  forth  in Section  2(b)  hereof  shall  immediately  lapse  as  to  all  shares  of  Restricted  Stock  and  the  Restricted  Stock  shall become immediately fully vested.  For purposes of this Section 3, Recipient's employment will have terminated by reason of total and permanent disability if, in the reasonable and good faith judgment of the Company, the Recipient is totally and permanently disabled and is unable to return to or perform his or her duties on a full-time basis.\n- 4. Change in Control.  All unvested shares of Restricted Stock issued hereunder shall, in addition to any provisions relating to vesting contained in this Agreement, become immediately fully vested upon the termination of Recipient's employment with the Company by the Company without Cause or by Recipient for Good Reason, in either case within the period commencing six months prior to and ending twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below).\n- (a) For  purposes  of  this Agreement,  a  'Change  in  Control'  shall  mean  the  occurrence  of  any  of  the following events:\n- (i) an  acquisition  (other  than  directly  from  the  Company)  of  any  voting  securities  of  the Company (the 'Voting Securities') by any 'person' (as the term 'person' is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or Section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act')) immediately after which such person has 'beneficial ownership' (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) ('Beneficial Ownership') of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities that are acquired in a Non-Control Acquisition (as hereinafter defined) shall not constitute an acquisition that would cause a Change in Control.  'Non-Control Acquisition' shall mean an acquisition (A) by or under an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (1) the Company or (2) any corporation, partnership or other person of which a majority of its voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by the Company or in which the Company serves as a general partner or manager (a 'Subsidiary'), (B) by the Company or any Subsidiary, or (C) by any person in connection with a Non-Control Transaction (as hereinafter defined).  'NonControl Transaction' shall mean a merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization involving the Company, in which (1) the stockholders of the Company, immediately before such merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization,  own,  directly  or  indirectly  immediately  following  such  merger,  consolidation,  share  exchange  or reorganization, at least 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation that is the successor in such merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization (the 'Surviving Company') in substantially  the  same  proportion  as  their  ownership  of  the  Voting  Securities  immediately  before  such  merger, consolidation,  share  exchange  or  reorganization,  and  (2)  the  individuals  who  were  members  of  the  Board  of Directors  of  the  Company  immediately  prior  to  the  execution  of  the  agreement  providing  for  such  merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization constitute at least 50% of the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Company;\n- (ii) the  individuals  who  constitute  the  Board  as  of  the  date  hereof  (the  'Incumbent  Board') cease for any reason to constitute at least 50% of the Board; provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, of any new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such new director shall be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided, further, that no individual shall be considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened 'election contest' (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (an 'Election Contest') or  other  actual  or  threatened  solicitation  of  proxies  or  consents  by  or  on behalf  of  a  person  other  than  the  Board  of  Directors  (a  'Proxy  Contest')  including  by  reason  of  any  agreement intended to avoid or settle any Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or\n\n(iii) the consummation of any of the following: (A) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or reorganization involving the Company (other than a Non-Control Transaction); (B) a complete liquidation",

Any termination shall be treated as a termination for Cause  only  if  (i)  Recipient  is  given  at  least  five  (5)  business  days'  written  notice  of  termination  specifying  the alleged  Cause  event  and  shall  have  the  opportunity  to  appear  (with  counsel)  before  the  full  Board  to  present information regarding his or her views on the Cause event, and (ii) after such hearing, Recipient is terminated for Cause by at least a majority of the Board.  After providing the notice of termination in the foregoing sentence, the Board may suspend Recipient with full pay and benefits until a final determination pursuant to this Section 4(b) has been made.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(b), if Recipient is party to an employment agreement with the Company that provides a definition of Cause, such definition shall apply instead of the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(b).\n\n- (c) 'Good  Reason'  mean  (i)  a  reduction  in  Recipient's  base  salary;  (ii)  a  material  diminution  in Recipient's title or responsibilities; or (iii) relocation of Recipient's primary place of employment more than fifty miles; provided, however, that  Recipient  may  only  terminate  employment for Good Reason by delivering written notice  to  the  Board  within  ninety  (90)  days  following  the  date  on  which  Recipient  first  knows  of  the  event constituting Good Reason, which notice specifically identifies the facts and circumstances claimed by Recipient to constitute Good Reason, and the Company has failed to cure such facts and circumstances within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice; and provided further, however, that if Recipient is party to an employment agreement with the Company that provides a definition of Good Reason, such definition shall apply instead of the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(c).\n\n## 5.

Capitalized  terms  used  but  not  otherwise  defined  in  this Agreement shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the 'Plan').\n\nWHEREAS, effective [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Date of Grant'), the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the  'Committee')  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  'Board')  of  the  Company  granted  the  Recipient  a Performance Restricted Stock Award, pursuant to which the Recipient shall receive shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ('Common Stock'), pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recipient's services to the Company and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n- 1. Number of Shares and Share Price.  The Company hereby grants the Recipient a Performance Restricted Stock Award (the  'Stock Award')  with  a  target  of  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  shares  of  Common  Stock  (the  'Restricted Stock') pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan.  The Recipient may ultimately vest into  more  shares  of  Common  Stock  or  fewer  or  no  shares  of  Common  Stock,  as  set  forth  in  more  detail  in  this Agreement.\n\n## 2. Restrictions and Restricted Period.\n\n- (a) Restrictions.    Shares  of  Restricted  Stock  granted  hereunder  may  not  be  sold,  assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and shall be subject to a risk of forfeiture until the lapse of  the  Restricted  Period  (as  defined  below).   The  Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any shares of Restricted Stock which shall have been sold or transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth in this Agreement,  or  (ii)  to  treat  as  owner  of  such  shares  or  to  accord  the  right  to  vote  as  such  owner  or  to  pay dividends to any transferee to whom such shares shall have been so transferred.\n- (b) Lapse of Restrictions; Restricted Period.  The restrictions set forth above shall lapse and the Restricted  Stock  shall  become  freely  transferable  (provided , that such  transfer  is  otherwise  in  accordance  with federal and state securities laws) and non-forfeitable as set forth in this Section 2(b) and on Exhibit A.\n- (c) (i) The Company's total shareholder return (as defined in more detail on Exhibit A, 'TSR') over the period beginning on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] and ending on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Performance Period'), as calculated by comparison to the indices stipulated on Exhibit A to this Agreement (and using the methodology set forth on such Exhibit A), shall be compared to the threshold, target and maximum TSR hurdles set forth on Exhibit A to determine the 'Vesting Portion' (as defined on Exhibit A) of the Stock Award as a percentage of the Target Award.  Such calculations shall be determined by the Committee no later than [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the date of such determination, the 'Determination Date').  Restrictions with respect to 100% of the related Vesting Portion of the Stock Award set forth on Exhibit A shall lapse as of the later of the Determination Date and [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Vesting Date').\n- (ii) Except  as  set  forth  in  Section  3,  such  lapse  of  restrictions  shall  occur  only  if  the Recipient has remained employed by the Company through the Vesting Date, as the case may be (the  'Restricted  Period').    The  portion  of  the  Restricted  Stock  which  does  not  vest  as  of  the Vesting Date based on TSR performance, and any related accrued but unpaid dividends that are at that time subject to restrictions as set forth herein, shall, as of the Vesting Date, be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or",

From and after the Date of Grant and for so long as the Restricted Stock is held by or for the benefit of the Recipient, the Recipient shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock, including but not limited to the right to receive dividends and the right to vote such shares, subject to the provisions of paragraph 2(d) hereof.\n- (e) Dividends.  Stock distributed in connection with a Common Stock split or Common Stock dividend, and other property distributed as a dividend (including cash), shall be subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Common Stock or other property has been distributed. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, cash dividends paid on Restricted Stock shall be deferred for payment until the Determination Date; provided such deferral is in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property.  Such deferred dividends shall be paid to recipient as promptly as practicable in the pay period following the Determination Date.\n- 3. Termination of Employment.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, in the event that the Recipient ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason prior to the lapse of the Restricted Period, then the Restricted Stock and any accrued but unpaid dividends that are at that time subject to restrictions set forth herein, shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such shares of Restricted Stock or certificates.  In the event that the Recipient's employment with the Company is terminated due to his death or total and permanent disability, then the Restricted Period set forth in Section 2(b) hereof shall immediately lapse and the Restricted Stock shall become immediately and fully vested, with the level of TSR performance calculated as if the date of termination was the final day of the Performance Period,  and  as  if  the  level  of  TSR  performance  as  of  such  date  was  the  higher  of  (a)  target  or  (b)  actual  TSR performance as of such date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee in accordance with Section 2(b) and  Exhibit A.    Restricted  Stock  not  vesting  in  accordance  with  the  foregoing  sentence  shall  be  forfeited  to  the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors,  heirs,  assigns  or  personal  representatives  shall  thereafter  have  any  further  rights  or  interests  in  such shares  of  Restricted  Stock  or  certificates.    For  purposes  of  this  Section  3,  the  Recipient's  employment  will  have terminated  by  reason  of  total  and  permanent  disability  if,  in  the  reasonable  and  good  faith  judgment  of  the Committee, the Recipient is totally and permanently disabled and is unable to return to or perform his or her duties on a full-time basis.\n- 4. Change  in  Control.    The  Restricted  Stock  issued  hereunder  shall,  in  addition  to  any  provisions relating to vesting contained in this Agreement, become immediately and fully vested, and the Restricted Period set forth in Section 2(b) hereof shall immediately lapse, upon the termination of the Recipient's employment with the Company by the Company without Cause or by the Recipient for Good Reason, in either case within the period commencing  six  months  prior  to  and  ending  twenty-four  (24)  months  following  the  occurrence  of  a  Change  in Control (as defined below), with the level of TSR performance calculated as if the date of the Change in Control was the final day of the Performance Period, and as if the level of TSR performance as of such date was the higher of (a) target  or  (b)  actual  TSR  performance  as  of  such  date,  as  determined  in  the  sole  discretion  of  the  Committee  in accordance with Section 2(b) and Exhibit A.\n- (a) For  purposes  of  this Agreement,  a  'Change  in  Control'  shall  mean  the  occurrence  of  any  of  the following events:",

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and  Incentive  Plan  (the  'Plan'),  and  the  Partnership  Unit  Designation  relating  to  LTIP  Units  in  the  Partnership Agreement (the 'Partnership Unit Designation' or 'PUD').\n\nWHEREAS, effective [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Date of Grant'), pursuant to the Plan and the amended and Restated  Agreement  of  Limited  Partnership  of  the  Partnership,  as  amended  (the  'Partnership  Agreement'),  the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the 'Committee') of the Board of Directors (the 'Board') of the Company granted the Recipient this LTIP Award and hereby causes the Partnership to issue to the Recipient the maximum  number  of  LTIP  Units  set  forth  below,  having  the  rights,  restrictions,  limitations  as  to  distributions, qualifications  and  terms  and  conditions  of  redemption  and  conversion  set  forth  herein,  in  the  Plan  and  in  the Partnership Agreement.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recipient's services to the Company and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n1. Number of  LTIP  Units.    The  Company  hereby  grants  the  Recipient  an  LTIP  Unit Award  (the  'LTIP Award') with a target of [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] LTIP Units (the 'LTIP Units') pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the provisions of the Plan and the provisions of the Partnership Agreement.  The Recipient may ultimately vest into more LTIP Units or fewer or no LTIP Units, as set forth in more detail in this Agreement.  The Recipient shall be admitted as a partner of the Partnership with beneficial ownership of the LTIP Units as of the Date of Grant by (i) signing  and  delivering  to  the  Partnership  a  copy  of  this  Agreement  and  (ii)  signing,  as  a  limited  partner,  and delivering to the Partnership a counterpart signature page to the Partnership Agreement (attached hereto as Exhibit A).\n\n## 2. Restrictions and Restricted Period.\n\n(a) Restrictions.  LTIP Units granted hereunder may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and shall be subject to a risk of forfeiture until the lapse of the Restricted Period (as defined below).  Neither the Company nor the Partnership shall be required (i) to transfer on its books any LTIP  Units  which  shall  have  been  sold  or  transferred  in  violation  of  any  of  the  provisions  set  forth  in  this Agreement,  or  (ii)  to  treat  as  owner  of  such  LTIP  Units  or  to  accord  the  right  to  vote  as  such  owner  or  to  pay dividends to any transferee to whom such LTIP Units shall have been so transferred.\n\n(b) Lapse of Restrictions; Restricted Period.  The restrictions set forth above shall lapse and the LTIP Units shall become freely transferable (provided , that such transfer is otherwise in accordance with federal and state securities laws) and non-forfeitable as set forth in this Section 2(b) and on Exhibit B.\n\n(i) The  Company's  total  shareholder  return  (as  defined  in  more  detail  on  Exhibit  B, 'TSR')  over  the  period  beginning  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  and  ending  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  (the  'Performance Period'),  as  calculated  by  comparison  to  the  indices  stipulated  on  Exhibit  B  to  this  Agreement  (and  using  the methodology set forth on such Exhibit B), shall be compared to the threshold, target and maximum TSR hurdles set forth on Exhibit B to determine the 'Vesting Portion' (as defined on Exhibit B) of the LTIP Award as a percentage of the Target Award.

Restrictions with respect to 100% of the related Vesting Portion of the LTIP Award set forth on Exhibit B shall lapse as of the later of the Determination Date and the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (the 'Vesting Date').\n\n(ii)Except  as  set  forth  in  Section  3,  such  lapse  of  restrictions  shall  occur  only  if  the Recipient has remained employed by the Company through the Vesting Date or the Anniversary Date, as the case may be (the 'Restricted Period').  The portion of the LTIP Units which does not vest as of the Vesting Date  based on TSR performance shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such shares of LTIP Units.\n\n(iii)All determinations with respect to the calculations pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee.\n\n## (c) Allocations.\n\n(iv)Unless and until the LTIP Units are converted in accordance with Section 2(e) below (such  LTIP  Units  being  referred  to  herein  as  'Converted  LTIP  Units'),  the  LTIP  Units  shall  have  a  Sharing Percentage of 2%.  After any LTIP Units are converted into Converted LTIP Units pursuant to Section 2(e), they will have a Sharing Percentage of 100%.  Provisions in the Partnership Unit Designation with respect to allocations in a Catch-Up Year will not apply to the Converted LTIP Units.\n\n(v)The 'REIT Share Economic Target' applicable to the LTIP Units prior to conversion to Converted LTIP Units means, as of any date, (x) the Market Value of a REIT Share on such date, multiplied by the Adjustment Factor, less (y) the closing price of Aimco's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the Date of Grant (the 'Grant Date Closing Price').  Notwithstanding Section 4(c) of the Partnership Unit Designation, the intention of the parties is to make the Capital Account balance of the holder of the LTIP Units (but not Converted LTIP Units), to the extent attributable to such holder's LTIP Units, economically equivalent (on a per-unit basis) to the REIT Share Economic Target, as defined above.  If the Capital Account of the holder of the LTIP Units (but not Converted LTIP Units), to the extent attributable to such holder's LTIP Units, exceeds (on a per-unit basis) the REIT Share  Economic  Target,  and  Liquidating  Losses  are  available  to  be  allocated  to  an  LTIP  Unit,  then  any  such Liquidating Losses shall be allocated to the holder of the LTIP Units until the holder's Capital Account, to the extent attributable to such holder's LTIP Units, is equal (on a per-unit basis) to the REIT Share Economic Target.\n\n## (d) Distributions.\n\n(vi)From  and  after  the  Date  of  Grant,  the  Recipient  shall  be  entitled  to  receive distributions with respect to all LTIP Units in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Unit Designation, subject to  the  Recipient's  Sharing  Percentage  specified  above.    Such  LTIP  Units  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  the  full distribution  payable  on  Partnership  Common  Units  outstanding  as  of  the  record  date  next  following  the  Date  of Grant, multiplied by the Sharing Percentage, whether or not they have been outstanding for the whole period.\n\n(vii)To  the  extent  that  the  Partnership  makes  distributions  to  holders  of  Partnership Common Units partially in cash and partially in additional Partnership Common Units or other securities, unless the Administrator in its sole discretion determines to allow the Recipient to make a different election, the Recipient shall be deemed to have elected with respect to all LTIP Units eligible to receive such distribution only in Partnership Common Units or other securities.\n\n## (e) Conversion.\n\n(viii)At any time prior to the ten year anniversary of the Date of Grant, the holder of LTIP Units shall have the right,  at  such  holder's  option,  at  any  time  to  convert  all  or  a  portion  of  such  holder's Vested LTIP Units into a number of Converted LTIP Units equal to (x) the Market Value of a REIT Share on the Conversion  Date,  multiplied  by  the Adjustment  Factor,  less  the  Grant  Date  Closing  Price,  multiplied  by  (y)  the number of LTIP",

Termination  of  Employment.    Except  as  otherwise  set  forth  in  this Agreement,  in  the  event  that  the Recipient ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason prior to the lapse of the Restricted Period, then the Unvested LTIP Units shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such LTIP Units.  In the event that the Recipient's employment with the Company is terminated due to his death or total and permanent disability, then the Restricted Period set forth in Section 2(b) hereof shall immediately lapse and the LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested, with the level of TSR performance calculated as if the date of termination was the final day of the Performance Period, and as if the level of TSR performance as of such date was the higher of (a) target or (b) actual TSR performance as of such date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee in accordance with Section 2(b) and Exhibit B.  LTIP Units not vesting  in  accordance  with  the  foregoing  sentence  shall  be  forfeited  to  the  Company  without  payment  of  any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient nor any of his or her successors, heirs, assigns or personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such LTIP Units.  For purposes of this Section 3, the Recipient's employment will have terminated by reason of total and permanent disability if, in the reasonable and good faith judgment of the Committee, the Recipient is totally and permanently disabled and is unable to return to or perform his or her duties on a full-time basis.\n- 4. Change in Control.  The LTIP Units issued hereunder shall, in addition to any provisions relating to vesting contained in this Agreement, become immediately and fully vested, and the Restricted Period set forth in Section 2(b) hereof shall immediately lapse, upon the termination of the Recipient's employment with the Company by the Company without Cause or by the Recipient for Good Reason, in either case within [                      ] the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below), with the level of TSR performance calculated as if the date of the Change in Control was the final day of the Performance Period, and as if the level of TSR performance as of such  date  was  the  higher  of  (a)  target  or  (b)  actual  TSR  performance  as  of  such  date,  as  determined  in  the  sole discretion of the Committee in accordance with Section 2(b) and Exhibit B.\n- (a) For purposes of this Agreement, a 'Change in Control' shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events:\n\n(xi)an acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the 'Voting Securities') by any 'person' (as the term 'person' is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or Section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act')) immediately after which such person has 'beneficial ownership' (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) ('Beneficial Ownership') of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred, the acquisition of Voting Securities in a Non-Control Acquisition (as hereinafter defined) shall not constitute an acquisition that would cause a Change in Control.  'Non-Control Acquisition' shall mean an acquisition (A) by or under an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (1) the Company or (2) any corporation, partnership or other person of which a majority of its voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by the Company or in which the Company serves as a general partner or manager (a 'Subsidiary'), (B) by the Company or any Subsidiary, or (C) by any person in connection with a Non-Control Transaction (as hereinafter defined).

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the 'Plan').\n\nWHEREAS, on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Grant Date') the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the 'Committee') of the Board of Directors (the 'Board') of the Company awarded the Optionee a nonqualified stock option, exercisable to purchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share ('Common Stock'), pursuant to, and subject to the terms and provisions of, the Plan.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Optionee's services to the Company and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n- 1. Number of Shares and Purchase Price.  The Company hereby grants the Optionee a nonqualified stock option (the 'Option') to purchase [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] shares of Common Stock (the 'Target Option Shares') at a purchase price per share equal to [ $      ] (the 'Exercise Price'), pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan. The Optionee may ultimately vest into more Target Option Shares or fewer or none as set forth in more detail in this Agreement.\n\n## 2. Period of Option and Conditions of Exercise.\n\n- (a) Unless  the  Option  is  previously  terminated  pursuant  to  this Agreement  or  the  Plan,  the Option shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant (the 'Expiration Date').  Upon the termination of the Option, all rights of the Optionee hereunder shall cease.\n- (b)   The Option shall become exercisable as set forth in this Section 2(b) and on Exhibit A.\n- (i) The Company's total shareholder return (as defined in more detail on Exhibit A, 'TSR') over  the  period  beginning  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  and  ending  on  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  (the  'Performance Period'), as calculated by comparison to the indices stipulated on Exhibit A to this Agreement (and using the methodology set forth on such Exhibit A), shall be compared to the threshold, target and maximum TSR hurdles set forth on Exhibit A to determine the 'Vesting Portion' (as defined on Exhibit A) of the Option as a percentage of the Target Option Shares.  Such calculations shall be determined by the Committee no later than  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_]  (the  date  of  such  determination,  the  'Determination  Date').    Restrictions  with respect to 100% of the related Vesting Portion of the Option set forth on Exhibit A shall lapse as of the later of the Determination Date and [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Vesting Date').\n- (ii) Except as set forth in Section 4, such lapse of restrictions shall occur only if the Recipient has  remained  employed by the Company through the Vesting Date, as the case may be (the 'Restricted Period').  The portion of the Option that does not vest as of the Vesting Date based on TSR performance, shall,  as  of  the  Vesting  Date,  be  forfeited  to  the  Company  without  payment  of  any  consideration  by  the Company,  and  neither  the  Recipient  nor  any  of  his  or  her  successors,  heirs,  assigns  or  personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such Option.\n- (iii) All determinations with respect to the calculations pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee.\n- 3. Change  in  Control.    Unexercised  and  unvested  stock  options  issued  hereunder  shall,  in addition to any provisions relating to exercisability contained in this Agreement, become immediately fully vested and  exercisable  by  the  Optionee  upon  the  termination  of  Optionee's  employment  with  the  Company  by  the Company",

Exercise of Option.\n\n- (a) The  Option  may  be  exercised  only  by  the  Optionee  or,  in  the  event  of  the  death  or incapacity of the Optionee, the Optionee's successor, heir or legal representative.  The Option shall be exercised by delivery to the Company of (i) a written notice, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, specify the number of shares for which the Option is being exercised to purchase, and (ii) full payment of the Exercise Price for such  number  of  shares  being  purchased  (in  respect  of  such  shares,  the  'Total  Exercise  Price'),  in  the  manner provided below, and any transfer or withholding taxes applicable thereto.\n- (b) Payment of the Exercise Price for any shares being purchased shall be made as follows:\n- (i) The Optionee may satisfy all or any portion of the Total Exercise Price by delivery to the Company of cash, by certified or cashier's check, or\n- (ii) The Optionee may satisfy all of any portion of the Total Exercise Price by (A) assignment, transfer  and  delivery  to  the  Company,  free  of  any  liens,  claims  or  encumbrances,  of  shares  of  Common Stock that the Optionee owns, or (B) assignment and transfer to the Company, free of any liens, claims or encumbrances, of common partnership units of Aimco OP L.P.

If  the Optionee  pays  by  assignment  and  transfer  of  OP  Units,  the  Optionee  must  include  with  the  notice  of exercise a duly executed assignment of all of the Optionee's interest in such OP Units.  For purposes of this Agreement, the value of all such shares of Common Stock delivered by the Optionee will be their Fair Market Value, and the value of all OP Units assigned by the Optionee will be the Fair Market Value of the number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  for  which  such  OP  Units  are  then  subject  to  exchange  upon  a redemption of such OP Units.

The Option may be exercised only to purchase whole shares of Common Stock, and in no case may a fractional share of Common Stock be purchased.  The right of the Optionee to purchase shares for which the Option is then exercisable may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, prior to the Expiration Date.\n- (d) The Company may require the Optionee to pay, prior to the delivery of any shares to which the Optionee shall be entitled upon exercise of the Option, an amount equal to the Federal, state and local income taxes and other amounts required by law to be withheld by the Company with respect thereto.  Alternatively, the Optionee may authorize the Company to withhold from the number of shares he or she would otherwise receive upon exercise  of  the  Option,  that  number  of  shares  having  a  Fair  Market  Value  equal  to  the  minimum  statutory withholding taxes with respect thereto.\n- (e) This Option may not be exercised unless such exercise is in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act') and all applicable state securities laws as they are in effect on the date of exercise and the requirements of any stock exchange or national market system on which the Common Stock may be listed at the time of exercise.  The Optionee understands that the Company is under no obligation to register, qualify or list the Option Shares with the Securities Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any stock exchange or national market system to effect such compliance.\n\n## 6. Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement:\n\n- (a) 'Cause'  shall  mean  the  termination  of  the  Optionee's  employment  because  of  the occurrence of any of the following events, as determined by the Board in accordance with the procedure below:  (i) the failure by Optionee to attempt in good faith to perform his or her duties or to follow the lawful direction of the individual  to  whom  Optionee  reports; provided,  however, that  the  Company  shall  have  provided  Optionee  with written notice of such failure and Optionee has been afforded at least 15 days to cure same; (ii) the indictment of Optionee for, or Optionee's conviction of or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or any other serious crime involving moral turpitude or dishonesty; (iii) Optionee's willfully engaging in misconduct in the performance of his or her duties (including theft, fraud, embezzlement, securities law violations, a material violation of the Company's code  of  conduct  or  a  material  violation  of  other  material  written  policies)  that  is  injurious  to  the  Company, monetarily  or  otherwise,  in  more  than  a de  minimis manner;  (iv)  Optionee's  willfully  engaging  in  misconduct unrelated  to  the  performance  of  his  or  her  duties  for  the  Company  that  is  materially  injurious  to  the  Company, monetarily or otherwise; (v) the material breach by Optionee of any material written agreement with the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, no act, or failure to act, on the part of Optionee shall be considered 'willful' unless done, or omitted to be done, by Optionee in bad faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.  Any termination shall be treated as a termination for Cause only if (i) Optionee is given at least five business days' written notice of termination specifying the alleged Cause event and shall have the opportunity to appear (with counsel) before",

The Option shall be exercised by delivery to the Company of (i) a written notice, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, specifying the number of shares for which the Option is being exercised to purchase, and (ii) full payment of the Exercise Price for such number of shares being purchased (in respect of such shares, the 'Total Exercise Price'), in the manner provided below, and any transfer or withholding taxes applicable thereto.\n- (b) Payment of the Exercise Price for any shares being purchased shall be made as follows:\n- (i) The Optionee may satisfy all or any portion of the Total Exercise Price by delivery to the Company of cash, by certified or cashier's check, or\n- (ii) The Optionee may satisfy all of any portion of the Total Exercise Price by (A) assignment, transfer  and  delivery  to  the  Company,  free  of  any  liens,  claims  or  encumbrances,  of  shares  of Common Stock that the Optionee owns, or (B) assignment and transfer to the Company, free of any liens, claims or encumbrances, of common partnership units of Aimco OP L.P.

If the value of the shares of Common Stock delivered, or OP Units assigned, by the Optionee exceeds the amount required to be paid pursuant to this Section 3, the Company will provide to the Optionee, as soon as practicable, cash or a check in an amount equal to the value of any fractional portion of a share of Common Stock or OP Unit, and will issue a certificate to the Optionee for any whole share(s) of Common Stock or OP Units exceeding the number of shares of Common Stock or OP Units required to pay the Exercise Price for all shares being purchased; or\n- (iii) At the discretion of the Administrator, the Optionee may satisfy all of any portion of the Total Exercise Price by means of a cashless exercise procedure.\n- (c) Not less than 100 shares of Common Stock may be purchased at any time upon the exercise of the Option, unless the number of shares of Common Stock so purchased constitutes the total number of shares for which the Option is then exercisable.

The right of the Optionee to purchase shares for which the Option is then exercisable may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, prior to the Expiration Date.\n- (d) The  Company  may  require  the  Optionee  to  pay,  prior  to  the  delivery  of  any  shares  to  which  the Optionee  shall  be  entitled  upon  exercise  of  the  Option,  an  amount  equal  to  the  Federal,  state  and  local income  taxes  and  other  amounts  required  by  law  to  be  withheld  by  the  Company  with  respect  thereto. Alternatively, the Optionee may authorize the Company to withhold from the number of shares he or she would otherwise receive upon exercise of the Option, that number of shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum statutory withholding taxes with respect thereto.\n- (e) This Option may not be exercised unless such exercise is in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act') and all applicable state securities laws as they are in effect on the date  of  exercise  and  the  requirements  of  any  stock  exchange  or  national  market  system  on  which  the Common Stock may be listed at the time of exercise.  The Optionee understands that the Company is under no obligation to register, qualify or list the Option Shares with the Securities Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any stock exchange or national market system to effect such compliance.\n- 4. Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold,  or  require  the Optionee to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any Federal, state, and local taxes (including the Optionee's FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld as a result of any taxable event arising in connection with the Option, in accordance with the terms of the Plan and applicable law.\n- 5. No Right to Employment.  Nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall confer on the Optionee any right to continue in the employ of, or other relationship with, the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary or limit in any way the right of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Partnership or any  Partnership  Subsidiary  to  terminate  the  Optionee's  employment  or  other  relationship  at  any  time,  with  or without cause.\n- 6. No Rights as a Stockholder.  Neither the Optionee nor any of the Optionee's successors in interest shall have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to the Option until the date such shares are credited in electronic form in an account by the Company's transfer agent or other designee or the date of issuance of a stock certificate for such shares.\n\n## 7. Miscellaneous.\n\n- (a) Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and the Plan contain the entire understanding and agreement of the Company and the Optionee concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersede all earlier negotiations and understandings, written or oral, between the parties with respect thereto.",

After  any  LTIP  Units  are  converted  into Converted LTIP Units pursuant to Section 2(e), they will have a Sharing Percentage of 100%.

Notwithstanding Section 4(c) of the Partnership Unit Designation, the intention of the parties is to make the Capital Account balance of the holder of the LTIP Units (but not Converted LTIP Units), to the extent attributable to such holder's LTIP Units, economically equivalent (on a per-unit basis) to the REIT Share Economic Target, as defined above.  If the Capital Account of the holder of the LTIP Units (but not Converted LTIP Units), to the extent attributable to such holder's  LTIP  Units,  exceeds  (on  a  per-unit  basis)  the  REIT  Share  Economic  Target,  and Liquidating  Losses  are  available  to  be  allocated  to  an  LTIP  Unit,  then  any  such  Liquidating Losses shall be allocated to the holder of the LTIP Units until the holder's Capital Account, to the extent attributable to such holder's LTIP Units, is equal (on a per-unit basis) to the REIT Share Economic Target.\n\n## (d) Distributions.\n\n(iii)From  and  after  the  Date  of  Grant,  the  Recipient  shall  be  entitled  to receive  distributions  with  respect  to  all  LTIP  Units  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the Partnership  Unit  Designation,  subject  to  the  Recipient's  Sharing  Percentage  specified  above. Such LTIP Units shall be entitled to receive the full distribution payable on Partnership Common Units  outstanding  as  of  the  record  date  next  following  the  Date  of  Grant,  multiplied  by  the Sharing Percentage, whether or not they have been outstanding for the whole period.\n\n(iv)To  the  extent  that  the  Partnership  makes  distributions  to  holders  of Partnership  Common  Units  partially  in  cash  and  partially  in  additional  Partnership  Common Units or other securities, unless the Administrator in its sole discretion determines to allow the Recipient to make a different election, the Recipient shall be deemed to have elected with respect to all LTIP Units eligible to receive such distribution only in Partnership Common Units or other securities.",

Change  in  Control.    The  LTIP  Units  issued  hereunder  shall,  in  addition  to  any provisions  relating  to  vesting  contained  in  this Agreement,  immediately  become  Vested  LTIP Units, upon the termination of the Recipient's employment or service with the Company by the Company without Cause or by the Recipient for Good Reason, in either case within twelve (12) months following the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined below).",

Number  of  Shares  and  Share  Price.    The  Company  hereby  grants  the  Recipient  a Performance  Restricted  Stock Award  (the  'Stock Award')  with  a  target  of  [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] shares of Common Stock (the 'Restricted Stock') pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the  provisions  of  the  Plan.    The  Recipient  may  ultimately  vest  into  more  shares  of  Common Stock or fewer or no shares of Common Stock, as set forth in more detail in this Agreement.\n\n## 2. Restrictions and Restricted Period.\n\n- (a) Restrictions.  Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and shall be subject to a risk of forfeiture until the lapse of the Restricted Period (as defined below).  The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any shares of Restricted Stock which shall have been sold or transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth in this Agreement, or (ii) to treat as owner of such shares or to accord the right to vote as such owner or to pay dividends to any transferee to whom such shares shall have been so transferred.\n- (b) Lapse  of  Restrictions;  Restricted  Period.    The  restrictions  set  forth  above shall lapse and the Restricted Stock shall become freely transferable (provided , that such transfer is otherwise in accordance with federal and state securities laws) and non-forfeitable as set forth in this Section 2(b) and on Exhibit A.\n- (c) (i) The Company's total shareholder return (as defined in more detail on Exhibit A, 'TSR') over the period beginning on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] and ending on [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Performance Period'), as calculated by comparison to the indices stipulated on Exhibit A to this Agreement (and using the methodology set forth on such Exhibit",

Such calculations shall be determined by the Committee no later than [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the date of such determination, the 'Determination Date').  Restrictions with respect to 100% of the related Vesting Portion of the Stock Award set forth on Exhibit A shall lapse as of the later of the Determination Date and [\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_] (the 'Vesting Date').\n- (ii) Except as set forth in Section 3, such lapse of restrictions shall occur only if the Recipient has remained employed by the Company through the Vesting Date, as the case may be (the 'Restricted Period').  The portion of the Restricted Stock which does not vest as of the Vesting Date based on TSR performance, and any  related  accrued  but  unpaid  dividends  that  are  at  that  time  subject  to restrictions  as  set  forth  herein,  shall,  as  of  the  Vesting  Date,  be  forfeited  to  the Company without payment of any consideration by the Company, and neither the Recipient  nor  any  of  his  or  her  successors,  heirs,  assigns  or  personal representatives shall thereafter have any further rights or interests in such shares of Restricted Stock or certificates.\n- (iii) In order to enforce the foregoing restrictions, the Committee may (A) require that the certificates representing the shares of Restricted Stock remain in the  physical  custody  of  the  Company  or  in  book  entry  until  any  or  all  of  such restrictions expire or have been removed, and (B) cause a legend or legends to be placed on the certificates or book entry which make appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed under the Plan.\n- (iv) All  determinations  with  respect  to  the  calculations  pursuant  to  this Agreement shall be made in the sole discretion of the Committee.\n- (d) Rights of a Stockholder.  From and after the Date of Grant and for so long as the Restricted Stock is held by or for the benefit of the Recipient, the Recipient shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock, including but not limited  to  the  right  to  receive  dividends  and  the  right  to  vote  such  shares,  subject  to  the provisions of paragraph 2(d) hereof.\n- (e) Dividends.  Stock distributed in connection with a Common Stock split or Common Stock dividend, and other property distributed as a dividend (including cash), shall be subject  to  restrictions  and  a  risk  of  forfeiture  to  the  same  extent  as  the  Restricted  Stock  with respect to which such Common Stock or other property has been distributed. Notwithstanding the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  cash  dividends  paid  on  Restricted  Stock  shall  be  deferred  for payment  until  the  Determination  Date;  provided  such  deferral  is  in  compliance  with  Section 409A of the Code, in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property.  Such deferred dividends shall  be  paid  to  recipient  as  promptly  as  practicable  in  the  pay  period  following  the Determination Date.\n- 3. Termination of Employment.

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a CIC Termination that occurs prior to the date of a Change in Control, the Restricted  Stock  shall  remain  outstanding  and  eligible  to  vest  upon  the  occurrence  of  such Change  in  Control  during  the  six  month  period  immediately  following  such  termination  of employment  with  the  Company,  in  accordance  with  the  preceding  sentence.  Any  shares  of Restricted Stock that do not become vested in accordance with this Section 4 shall be canceled and forfeited without payment of any consideration therefor (x) as of the six-month anniversary of the date on which such termination of employment with the Company occurs (in the case of a CIC Termination that occurs prior to the date of the Change in Control) or (y) as of the date of such termination (in the case of a CIC Termination that occurs on or after the date of the Change in Control), and the Recipient shall have no further right to or interest in such forfeited shares of Restricted Stock.",

Financial  reporting  measures  are  measures  that  are  determined  and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company's financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures, including non-GAAP financial measures.  For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation does not include (i) annual base salary, (ii) compensation that is awarded based solely on continued service, including equity-based awards that are subject to time-based vesting, (iii) compensation that is  awarded  solely  at  the  discretion  of  the  Committee  ( however ,  the  exercise  of  negative  discretion  with  respect  to  an award that is otherwise based on attainment of a financial measure will not be considered discretionary for this purpose), or (iv) compensation that is awarded based on subjective standards, strategic measures (e.g., completion of a merger) or operational measures (e.g., attainment of a certain market share).\n- f) 'Lookback Period' means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare a Restatement for a given reporting period, with such date being the earlier of: (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required,  concludes,  or  reasonably  should  have  concluded,  that  the  Company  is  required  to  prepare  an  accounting restatement  due  to  the  material  noncompliance  of  the  Company  with  any  financial  reporting  requirement  under  the securities  laws  as  described  in  Rule  10D-1(b)(1);  or  (ii)  the  date  a  court,  regulator  or  other  legally  authorized  body directs the Company to prepare an accounting restatement.\n- g) 'Restatement' means (A) the restatement of one or more previously issued financial statements of the Company, for any period ending after the Effective Date, that corrects an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or (B) the restatement of one or more previously issued financial statements of the Company that corrects an error not material to previously issued financial statements, but would result in a material misstatement if the error was left uncorrected in the current period, or the error correction was recognized in the current period.    For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  a  Restatement  shall  not  include  any  restatement  required  due  to  (i)  changes  in accounting  rules  or  standards  or  changes  in  applicable  law;  (ii)  retrospective  application  of  a  change  in  accounting principle; (iii) retrospective revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the structure of the Company's internal organization; (iv) retrospective reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (v) retrospective application of a change in reporting entity, such as from a reorganization of entities under common control; (vi) retrospective adjustment to provisional amounts in connection with a prior business combination; or (vii) retrospective revision for stock splits reverse stock splits, stock dividends or other changes in capital structure.  The Committee shall take into consideration any applicable interpretations and clarifications of the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') and the New York Stock",

In no event shall the Company be required to award Executives an additional payment if the Restatement would have resulted in a higher incentive compensation payment.\n\n## Authority and Interpretations:\n\nThis Policy generally will be administered and interpreted by the Committee.  Any determination by the Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties.  The determinations of the Committee under this Policy need not be uniform with respect to all Executives.\n\nThis Policy is intended to comply with, shall be interpreted to comply with, and shall be deemed automatically amended to comply with, Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as it may be amended from",
