        "page_content": "14\n\n## Dear readers and friends of Symrise!\n\n  Increasing the value of the company and solidifying its future prospects are the key pillars that de/fine our strategy at Symrise. For us, economic success and sustainability go hand in hand. Our business is inspired by the biodiversity of nature. We contribute to securing the livelihoods of future generations through climate protection measures. We understand that business activities involve social responsibility. That is why we actively support the princi ples of responsible management enshrined in the United Nations Global Compact. In this regard, we foster relationships in the spirit of partnership with all the stakeholders of our company and take their interests into account when making decisions. Holistic thinking and acting is what makes us strong. The strength we gain shapes and supports the sustainable growth of our company.\n\n2020, on which we report, was unusual in many respects. The rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic forced governments worldwide to drastically curtail public and personal life as well as economic activity. The global economy fell into a deep recession. Symrise performed very solidly in this daunting market environment. We obviously /first focused on protecting employees, customers and partners from infection. Who would have thought at the start of 2020 that we would end up producing tons of disinfectant in our Holzminden production facility and supplying some of it to public institutions? The pandemic had both positive and negative e/ffects on the operating business: For example, sales fell for luxury items such as perfumes or sun protection and people visited restaurants less often. At the same time, demand increased for products in the personal care, hygiene and healthy nutrition categories. Growth was particu-\n\nlarly strong in the pet food segment. Our company's broad portfolio once again proved its value in the crisis as it enables us to clearly distinguish ourselves from the competition.\n\nIn late 2020, we faced another unforeseen challenge: A criminal cyber attack on Symrise conducted with the intention of extorting the company. It was out of the question for us to give in. The attack temporarily slowed our business processes and production and logistics operations. For that reason, we were not able to fully achieve our 2020 growth targets. In view of this, however, an organic sales increase of 2.7 % and an EBITDA margin of 21.1 % are all the more impressive. Achieving such reputable results was only possible through the extraordinary commitment and great /flexibility of our employees. We would like to expressly thank them for having gone the extra mile in 2020 - whether because of the coronavirus pandemic or the cyber attack.\n\nFor Symrise, 2020 was nevertheless not just about managing crises; it was also about continued development, new ideas and innovative solutions. Our sights are still set on our targets: We intend to increase our sales to \u20ac 5.5 to 6 billion and signi/ficantly improve our sustainability performance by 2025, and to be climate-positive by 2030. We are working toward these goals in many large and small projects a selec tion of them is presented in our Corporate Report 2020.\n\nThe Executive Board of Symrise AG",

Sustainability is an integral part of our busi ness model. It provides us with tangible competitive advantages and secures the long-term success of the company.\n\n  Successful companies distinguish themselves through their strong corporate cultures. Symrise is a perfect example of this. Our employees in more than 40 countries around the world share these values as a basis for shared goals: Our values - our roots - describe the attitude and team spirit we are committed to at Symrise. They explain the manner in which we want to achieve our goals.\n\nSymrise is one of the world's leading suppliers of custom fragrance, taste and nutrition solutions, many with health-promoting or nurturing characteristics. We want to further secure and expand this position by constantly being among the most pro/fi table companies in the industry. Above-average sales growth, steady increases in e/ffi  ciency, and targeted expansion and optimization of the product portfolio are key levers for achieving this goal.\n\nSymrise assumes responsibility that goes beyond the company itself. It takes its customers and consumers, its employees, society and the environment into consideration. Sustainability is a core component of the business model at Symrise. Our corporate strategy integrates economic ambitions with our four sustainability approaches: footprint, innovation, sourcing and care. In this way, we ensure value creation that is oriented to the long term and allow our stakeholders to participate in the company's success.\n\nOur special commitment is to global climate protection. Symrise has reported on its activities in this area on the CDP platform since 2006. In 2017, Symrise was one of the /fi rst companies worldwide to receive approval for its scienti/fi cally based climate targets. Since 2018, Symrise has also been one of the now over 1,700 companies all over the world that supports the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our scenario analyses in the areas of climate change, water and forests for the CDP reporting are accordingly consistent with the recommendations of the TCFD. Further information on our climate-related reporting can be found in our Sustainability Record 2020, where we also refer to the covered reporting requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We have been sourcing all of our external electricity from renewable sources in Germany since 2018 - our goal has been to expand this measure to our sites worldwide by 2025. In view of the aggravating situation concerning climate change, we again intensi/fi ed our e/ff orts in 2020 and thus were able to reach our ambitious goal ahead of schedule. In 2020, we demonstrably covered our external electricity needs worldwide using renewable sources. Our major goal: Symrise wants to be climate-positive starting in 2030!\n\nYou can /fi nd further information in the 'Sustainability & Responsibility' chapter and at www.symrise.com/sustainability.",

Our business activity is ultimately based on the responsible use and thus the preservation of natural resources and natural diversity.\n\n \n\n## Business principle of sustainability\n\nOur business processes follow the principles of the cir cular economy to a wide extent. We bundle the aspects of sustainability that are relevant to Symrise into the four pillars of environmental protection (Footprint), sustainable innovation (Innovation), raw material sourcing (Sourcing) and employees and society (Care). Concrete goals to be reached by 2025 have been established for each pillar (see page 35). These are directly related to our key topics and are derived from a number of programs including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our business model uses this comprehensive approach to combine economic success with sustainable governance and social acceptance.\n\nEveryone is called upon At Symrise, sustainability is the business of all employees. Everyone is called upon to constantly monitor the work processes in their own /field of activity and responsibility for e/fficiency, safety and resource conservation, and to develop ideas for improvement. For example, we started an initiative in late 2020 that is geared toward avoiding the use of plastic materials in the company to the greatest extent possible. Symrise will discontinue the use of all disposable plastic containers in 2021 and the Group will use exclusively sustainable packaging materials by 2025. A global network of more than 120 Sustainabil ity Ambassadors promotes targeted initiatives on energy and waste management, climate, water and environmental protection, and occupational health and safety at the corporate locations. Managers are responsible for operationalizing sustainability in their teams and laying out clear goals. Sustainability objec-\n\ntives are also a component of individual goals for all senior executives including the members of the Executive Board. This advances our sustainability approach consistently in all divisions. The global, cross-business Symrise Sustainability Board manages integration of our sustainability principles into the core processes: Under the chairmanship of the Chief Sustainability O/fficer (CSO), division and sta/ff department management representatives come together multiple times per year to ensure that sustainabi lityrelated topics and the concerns of our important stakeholder groups are considered along the entire value chain. The Sustainability Board sets sustainability objectives, which are directly implemented in the respective divisions. The Executive Board and the Sustainability Board have appointed sustainabi lity o/fficers for the Flavor, Nutrition and Scent & Care business segments as well as one representative each for the sta/ff departments of Human Resources, Finance  /Investor Relations, Corporate Commu nications and Corporate Sustainability. Direct responsibility for strategy lies with the Chief Executive O/fficer of Symrise AG, who receives regular reports on the progress of all sustainability activities.\n\n## In a dialogue with stakeholders and rating\n\nagencies Symrise receives a great deal of external recognition for its commitment to sustainability. For instance, we have already been presented with the German Sustainability Award twice; in addi tion, the German Association for Sustainability named us one of the 'Sustainability Heroes' of 2020, and we were one of only 10 companies worldwide to reach Triple A status with CDP in 2020, with a /first-class",

Examples of this are the various WBCSD committees, global representative bodies IFRA and IOFI, and initiatives such as OP2B and the Development and Climate Alliance.\n\nWe exchange sustainability information particularly closely with the company's shareholders, investors, voting proxies and rating agencies. Rating agencies MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS ESG provide especially high-quality and e/fficient communication of our ESG performance to investors. Moreover, our sustainability performance is regularly evaluated by internationally recognized institutions such as CDP, EcoVadis and SEDEX.

First and foremost, we concentrate on limiting our own emissions by constantly improving energy e/fficiency at our production sites. That's how we saved more than 68,000 tons of CO2 in 2020. Even\n\nin the planning phases of new projects, sustainabil ity and climate protection play a huge role. Symrise developed an 'instrument case for a green factory,' which is now being used for the /first time in the construction of a new factory in Tocancip\u00e1, Colombia. It includes the installation of solar collectors for electricity production, water and wastewater management systems and environmentally friendly recycling of waste. A second level of our action plan concerns using energy from renewable sources. We redoubled our e/fforts in this area in 2020; for example, we have already succeeded in veri/fiably sourcing our global external electricity from renewable sources this year. This means that we have also met the objective of the global initiative RE100 ahead of schedule. The third objective of our action plan for climate protection integrates our most important suppliers into the Symrise climate strategy via the CDP Supply Chain Program. By now, 87 % of our main suppliers have committed to their own climate targets and reduction measures on our initiative, meaning Symrise has far exceeded its Science Based Target (SBT) of 80 %.\n\nSymrise is a company of dynamic growth. We want to increase sales to \u20ac 5.5 to 6 billion by 2025. If we didn't take countermeasures, this would create more",

If the climate protection measures that we implement in our own sphere of activity prove insu/fficient in making a positive impact on our carbon footprint, Symrise will also further reduce its Scope 1 emissions by supporting highquality, certi/fied climate protection projects all over the world. In 2019, Symrise sponsored a hydro electric power generation project in Madagascar, through which 5,711 tons of CO2 were avoided. Symrise also has a project in Brazil that has saved 5,300 tons of CO2. In 2020, we supported two projects with 'Veri/fied Carbon Standard' status to /fight poverty and conserve forests in Madagascar and Brazil. A total of 12,046 tons of CO2 were saved in this way. To ensure that climate protection has the highest priority apart from the business goals, the climate pro tection targets are integrated into the remuneration system for Symrise upper management.\n\nSymrise reports transparently about its climate protection measures and the preliminary results of those measures. At the same time, we do not lose sight of the risks and opportunities that can arise for Symrise as a result of climate change. We follow the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), systematically identify the possible e/ffects in our risk management and include them in our strategic considerations and in the company's /financial planning. Our scenario analyses in the areas of climate change, water and forests for the CDP reporting are consistent with the recommendations of the TCFD. In our Sustainability Record 2020, we also refer to the covered reporting requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We regularly inform our shareholders, investors, creditors and the /financial markets about the /financial impact of climate change on the company. The following table lays out the identi/fiable risks and opportunities of climate change for Symrise. For 2020, they are reported on a gross risk basis (before countermeasures) and are stated as the estimated e/ffect on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), not weighted according to probability:\n\n| RISK                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | EFFECT                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Current regulation For example, increasing prices of CO 2  certi/ficates for  own facilities as well as indirect e/ffects on generally  increasing energy costs                                                                           | approx.  \u20ac 0.1 million |\n| Future regulation For example, the abolition of the EEG reallocation                                                                                                                                                                      | approx.  \u20ac 0.2 million |\n| Sourcing For example, increased prices for agricultural raw                                                                                                                                                                               | approx.  \u20ac 8.5 million |\n| materials through bad harvests due to water scarcity Reputation                                                                                                                                                                           | approx.                |\n| For example, sales losses through breach of   sustainability requirements placed on Symrise   by its customers Acute physical risks                                                                                                       | \u20ac 35.3 million approx. |\n| For example, disruptions to production through   individual phenomena such as storms, /flooding or  earthquakes Chronic physical risks                                                                                                    | \u20ac 2.8 million          |\n| For example, through rising sea levels or enduring  heat waves and droughts / water shortages                                                                                                                                             | approx.  \u20ac 6.4 million |\n| OPPORTUNITY                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | EFFECT                 |\n| Energy For example, increasing our own e/fficient and   low-CO 2  energy generation                                                                                                                                                       | approx.  \u20ac 0.7 million |\n| Demand For example, through an increased demand for   Symrise products such as sunscreen due to rising  temperatures                                                                                                                      | approx.  \u20ac 2.1 million |\n| Demand For example, through an increased demand for   sustainably manufactured products that Symrise   can cover better than its competitors Capital Market For example, improved access to investors that place  value on sustainability | approx.  \u20ac 2.9 million |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | n.a.                   |",

The index tracks the shares of companies that achieve above average performance in their sector in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR). It serves as a compass for institutional investors who place value on sustainable investments.\n\n  ISS ESG Prime In its regular review of the sustainability performance of Symrise, the international rating agency ISS ESG con/firmed our company's prime status. Compared with the 169 other companies from the industry that were evaluated, Symrise is in the top 10 %. The ESG rating from ISS - E for environmental, S for social, G for governance covers nearly 10,000 companies globally, the majority of which are listed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  SUSTAINALYTICS ESG Risk Rating The international rating agency SUSTAINALYTICS continuously analyzes and evaluates companies' risks in the areas of\n\nESG. A number of /financial service providers and institutional investors across Europe use the services of the agency as a basis for decisions related to investment and credit. Out of 133 evaluated companies in the chemical industry, the risk pro/file of Symrise ranks 20th. 19 companies have a lower ESG risk pro/file; 113 have a higher one. Compared with 2019, the risk assessment of Symrise in 2020 fell by 2.9 points to an index score of 24.5, in large part because the company combated major risks with successful strategies.\n\n  'A' rating since 2015 The US-based company MSCI is a leading sustainability rating agency and provider of highly respected sustainability share indices. Since 2015, MSCI has ranked Symrise in the 'A' category, which attests to its above-average sus tainability per-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nformance. In its analysis, MSCI highlights that Symrise has an impressive strategy to minimize the e/ffects of its operating activities on the environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  FTSE4Good Index The Symrise share has been included in the FTSE4Good Index since the end of 2015. This index comprises the securities of companies that achieve outstanding results in the areas of the environment, social aspects and corporate governance (ESG). At the regular audit in June 2020, Symrise received very good ratings in all categories and has been included in the index for another year. More and more institutional in-\n\nvestors, banks and insurance companies are including sustainability criteria in their assessment of the creditworthiness of companies. Membership in the FTSE4Good Index is thus extremely important for the standing of Symrise on the capital market.",

EcoVadis assesses companies worldwide in the four areas of environment, social aspects, ethics and sustain ability  in the supply chain. Symrise belongs to the top 2 % of all companies in the chemical sector. In addition, we use the EcoVadis databank to evaluate the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsus tainability performance of our suppliers.

This puts Symrise in the top 7 % of all companies evaluated by CDP worldwide. For four years now, Symrise has been asking its suppliers to participate in the CDP Supply Chain Program with their own climate protection goals and measures.

To achieve this ambitious goal, the company must review all operational processes worldwide for their climate compatibility and /find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An important issue in this zero-waste strategy is the implementation of numerous measures for sustainable packaging. The focus is on avoidance of waste, reusability and recycling. Together with customers and suppliers, the supply chain experts at Symrise are constantly looking for innovative and sustainable solutions. Paper bags instead of plastic bags, large barrels instead of small canisters, and reusable metal cups are a few examples of the many improvements. In addition, unavoidable CO2 emissions caused during production and transport\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nare increasingly being o/ffset by certi/fied climate protection projects. For example, as part of a pilot project for climate-neutral boxes that has been running in Germany since March 2020, cartons are marked with a QR code. The code leads to a website where readers can /find out which sustainability projects Symrise supports to compensate for unavoidable emissions. The goal is to expand the concept to all production sites.\n\n  Expansion of the fragrance portfolio Symrise acquires the Fragrance and Aroma Chemicals business of the US company Sensient Technologies Corporation. These activities, which achieved sales of around \u20ac 77 million in 2019, include fragrances from renewable raw materials such as pine oil and citrus products, as well as various Aroma Molecules solutions. They are used in personal care and household products. With this acquisition, Symrise is strengthening its portfolio of renewable ingredients and expanding its value chain in the area of green chemistry. At the same time, Symrise is\n\nreceiving access to additional customers and strengthening its presence in EAME and Latin America. Symrise plans to combine the acquired research and development and production capacities with parts of its own activities at its site in Granada, Spain, and to expand them in the coming years through targeted investments.",

Symrise employees in Latin America used this thought as a reason to start the 'Together We Care' initiative. Rather than giving Christmas gifts to customers and partners as usual, all business units in Latin America collected the resources that had been earmarked for gifts and made donations to charitable organizations that were especially hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The employees developed an internal\n\nand external ad campaign for the initiative and incorporated customers and business partners into it.

The company was also the victim of a global cyber attack in December. How has Symrise done in these times?\n\n  Symrise has performed very solidly in a market environment dominated by the coronavirus pandemic. We were well on track until mid-December 2020, when we became the target of a criminal cyber attack with the intention of extorting the company. It was out of the question for us to give in. However, this meant that our business operations were severely restricted at times, and for that reason we were not able to fully achieve our growth targets.\n\nBut we follow a clear ethical compass and reject any form of criminal fraud or extortion. Although there were delays in production and logistics, customers and business partners supported our stance. We would like to expressly thank them for this support.\n\n## It sounds as though the coronavirus has left the company more or less untouched.\n\n  We were fully operational across the entire Group worldwide. But for our employees, the pandemic is nevertheless a great burden. Many of them were able to work at home in cases where this was an option, but this was not possible in our factories. We reacted quickly and /flexibly, introducing new shift models, severely restricting or partially discontinuing travel, and paying close attention to hygiene and cleaning cycles. As a thank you for their strong commitment to the Group, we paid all employees a coronavirus bonus.\n\n## And how did business develop?\n\n  The pandemic has had a major impact on people's behavior since the spring. There were closures of businesses and schools, retail stores and the restaurant industry, as well as travel restrictions and hygiene regulations. This also had a direct or indirect impact on demand in many areas. People stocked up on supplies, had to prepare to work at home or for home schooling, shopped more online and focused on local products and brands. >>",

Organic sales increased slightly by 1.5 %. Incidentally, right in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, we produced disinfectants in our Holzminden production facility by the ton to meet the increased demand, including from public institutions. The Flavor segment was also a/ffected both positively and negatively because, on the one hand, people were eating and drinking less outside their homes, but on the other, they were consuming signi/ficantly more ready meals, baking mixes and snacks. Here we achieved an increase in sales of about 1 %. The strongest growth of 8.2 % was in the Nutrition segment, particularly in the area of pet food. This market will continue to develop very positively. In reporting currency, including the acquisition of the ADF / IDF group, sales increased by around 27 %.\n\n+ 8.2 %\n\nThe strongest growth was in the Nutrition segment, particularly in the area of pet food. This market will continue to develop very positively.\n\n## Other companies focus on a few product /fields while Symrise does just the opposite. How are the /fields strategically related?\n\n  Our diversi/fied portfolio is one of the three pillars of our strategy, alongside our growth and e/fficiency in all processes. We now generate more than a third of our sales outside of our traditional business /fields. In so doing, we rely /first on identifying rapidly expanding areas, and then on repeatedly combining our resources and expertise to achieve strong synergy e/ffects.\n\n## What you've just said describes 'the power of holistic action,' the motto of this Annual Report.\n\n  Exactly, we always have to keep the whole system in mind: from the innovations in our research and development to the 10,000 raw materials we purchase all over the world and the way we process them, to the wishes of our customers and consumers. Only by understanding and constantly questioning the whole can we achieve excellence in the details. Our partners along the value chain are also important in this respect: These are the small-scale farmers and suppliers, research institutions and customers with whom we jointly develop sustainable products and bring them to market.\n\n## Were there any concrete bene/fits to this strategy last year?\n\n  At the beginning of the year, some companies had problems with their supply chain, though we were able to deliver without interruption. One reason for this is our backward integration. In recent years, we have greatly expanded important production facilities such as those for menthols and vanilla extraction; we have also linked many of our raw materials closely to us through partnerships and our involvement in the countries of origin. This makes us more /flexible and allows us to count on reliably available raw materials and products. It also makes",

We proved this in many places once again last year. For example, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) awarded us top marks in all three of the topics it examined - climate change, forests and water conservation. Only ten out of the 9,600 worldwide that took part achieved this, and we are the only one in Germany. This is one way we are pursuing the ambitious goal of being climatepositive by 2030.\n\n## Are the company's shareholders interested in all this?\n\n  Absolutely. Our shareholders and investors are increasingly taking this commitment into consideration because their decisions are based on how companies will fare in the future. And if companies don't act sustainably today, they will face high costs later, for example due to regulatory requirements. That's why, for example, analysts and rating agencies such as MSCI, Sustainalytics, ISS ESG, CDP, EcoVadis and SEDEX are asking us more and more questions about our ESG performance - in other words, about environmental protection, social commitment and good corporate governance. >>\n\n' Only by under\u00ad standing and con\u00ad stantly questioning the whole can we achieve excellence in the details.'",

For Symrise especially, this is important be cause we obtain many of our raw materials from nature. At the same time, we can only be sustainable if we are economically successful. So the two issues are inextricably linked.\n\n## Let's return to the topic of growth. What do you expect for the coming years?\n\n  We will continue to grow in ways that are healthy and sustainable by using three levers. First, we want to become organically stronger, that is, to increase capacity in our old and new business units, win new customers and increase sales. We will also\n\nsuccessively expand our business model and ultimately continue to make selected acquisitions.\n\n## Are there any current examples of this?\n\n  In the past /fiscal year, for example, we opened our largest single investment ever: the new site for /flavor and fragrance production in Nantong, China, in which we invested \u20ac 50 million.

Sensient has sites in Mexico and Spain, where we will invest heavily in Granada and develop the plant into the second-largest mixing plant for fragrances and perfume compositions in the EAME region.\n\n## In which areas will you expand the company's pro/file?\n\n  All our divisions have the potential to further di/fferentiate themselves by sharpening their pro/files. In recent years for example, our acquisition of Diana positioned us very strongly in the pet food sector, which has enormous growth rates. We will continue to expand our business in that sector and make even greater use of our know-how, which is unique in the industry. Another fast-growing area is healthy food. By making use of our outstanding knowledge of natural raw materials, our backward integration and our taste know-how, we can tackle all challenges. These include, for example, putting less sugar, salt, fat and meat in food while keeping its taste the same, or using functional ingredients such as alternative proteins in food.\n\n## Is this being accepted by your customers?\n\n  Yes, we are gaining more and more customers; by now, we have all the major global food, perfumery and cosmetics groups in our order books. At the same time though, none of them amounts to more than 5 % of sales. We have found a healthy mix among our 6,000 customers. One-third are locally, regionally or globally active companies from all the industries that are important to us. This makes us independent and less susceptible to crises. Incidentally, we are also seeing internal diversity. In recent years, we have greatly increased the proportion of projects in which colleagues from di/fferent business units or even segments work together. This results in signi/ficant synergies because we rely on cross-divisional teams and know-how in project development or to make processes more e/fficient, for example.\n\nLast year, you said you wanted to double your sales from 2018 to 2025 - and you had already grown strongly in the years prior to that. Is this still what you expect?\n\n  We will continue to grow over the next four years, and our goal remains \u20ac 5.5 to \u20ac 6 billion in annual sales. We also want to become even more pro/fitable. We have motivated employees who provide the best in their /fields, outstanding technologies, a broad mix of products and a healthy raw material base, and we are active in many rapidly expanding markets. There are therefore plenty of good reasons why we will continue to grow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n47",

The road ahead is long and highly complex, as a look into the company's climate activities demonstrates.\n\n  At more than 100 locations worldwide, Symrise requires electricity, gas and steam for production. The individual plants di/ffer tremendously in this respect. Some produce tens of thousands of tons of a substance a year using energy-intensive processes while others mix valuable ingredients in the range of mere kilograms, which requires hardly any energy. The company reviews all processes as part of its climate strategy. The goal: Symrise wants to be climate-positive by 2030. On the path to that goal, Symrise has set an interim target of improving its environmental e/fficiency in terms of greenhouse gas emissions by 63 % by 2025.\n\nIn order to achieve these goals, Symrise has grouped energy consumption based on the scopes of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol - that is, according to the three areas of energy consumption de/fined by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Scope 1 includes energies such as oil, gas and heat that are supplied to the company by energy service providers; Scope 2 includes electricity generated by the company itself or purchased from electricity suppliers; and Scope 3 includes all other emissions that result from raw material extraction, or for example during transport from suppliers and to customers. >>\n\n49",

For Scope 2, Symrise is switching to renewable energies wherever it can. To this end, the company has sourced all its external electricity from renewable sources in Germany since 2018. Symrise had set this same goal for all its sites worldwide to reach by 2025: However, in its e/ffort to combat worsening climate change, the company reached this goal ahead of schedule in 2020. This means Symrise buys certi/fied guarantees of origin which are used for projects such as the construction of a wind power plant on the German-Polish border, thus investing indirectly in the expansion of renewable energies.\n\nSymrise  was one of the first ten companies in Germany to join the Science Based Targets initiative, and it orients itself to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.\n\nSymrise has also begun work on Scope 3, addressing the energy used to produce raw materials and for plant logistics. Raw material purchasing accounts for nearly half of sales at Symrise and CO2 emissions from raw material production are responsible for about 92 % of Scope 3. Symrise has therefore asked suppliers to de/fine their own energy and climate goals. The company has now achieved 87 % of these goals and saved more than 3 million tons of CO2 in 2020 through collaborative e/ffort within the /flavor and fragrance industry.\n\nWell compensated In some places, certain greenhouse gases cannot yet be reduced. Symrise compensates for these through climate certi/ficates. These operate on the principle that greenhouse gas emissions which cannot be avoided at the production sites are at least averted elsewhere in the world. When it does, the company takes great care to only purchase certi/ficates that make a di/fference where Symrise operates. This has two advantages: The projects can be better reviewed, and the employees and residents in the region directly bene/fit from the measures.\n\nIn Brazil, for example, Symrise obtains the certi/ficates from the Jari Foundation, which supports a project on sustainable forest management in the Amazon rainforest. This reduces the clearing of forests, which are gaining importance worldwide for their CO2 storage in the form of biomass. The proj ect saves a total of 115,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually. In Madagascar, on the other hand, Symrise supports the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor proj ect with the certi/ficates. This proj ect protects the complex ecosystem of the island.",

This encourages companies to observe binding due diligence obligations and to create more sustainable material and goods /flows. Symrise welcomes the latest political developments in this area.\n\n## Of ideas big & small\n\nChief Sustainability O/fficer Bernhard Kott explains in an interview what sustainability objectives Symrise is pursuing and describes how the path to achieving them only works through shared commitment on all levels of the company.\n\nMr. Kott, if a company wants to operate sustainably, it must not only announce goals, but also anchor them in the company. How do you do that at Symrise?\n\n  To involve the entire workforce, we have introduced an ambassador system that serves as an addition to our Sustainability Board and our sustainability o/fficers in all divisions. The global ambassador network, in which more than 120 employees are now active, brings many big and small ideas to our company and to the communities around our sites. In 2020, we held many video conferences within the network, each with dozens of participants, which we used to transfer know ledge between business units. >>",

For example, we will largely ban single-use plastic from the company by mid-2021 and use only sustainable materials by 2025. We will also write these goals into our Sustainability Record so that they are traceable and veri/fiable. We made enormous progress on plastics last year, and many approaches to this came directly from the business units.\n\n## What has changed speci/fically?\n\n  Our employees constantly test new products such as /flavor solutions or purees and powders that we make from vegetables and fruit. Previously, they always used plastic cups or spoons for this purpose. We have now launched very successful projects around the world. In Holzminden, for example, employees now use compostable paper cups instead of 400,000 plastic cups annually. In Brazil, nearly 700,000 plastic cups are saved annually, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin France, 20,000 plastic spoons have been replaced with reusable ones. And in Indonesia, employees use their own cups to reduce the number of plastic bottles. These are just a few of the projects, which incidentally were driven both from above - i.e., by Group-wide or site-wide decisions - and from below, by individual employees. Another project ensures that we use more sustainable packaging such as paper bags instead of plastic bags, or large barrels instead of small canisters. This is only possible in collaboration with our suppliers and customers.\n\n## From the small to the big, what goals are at the core of the sustainability agenda at Symrise?\n\n  We want to continuously improve our ESG (environmental, social, governance) performance over the long term. There are many examples of this, which we also see here in the Corporate Report. For us, preserving biodiversity is at the top of the list. We use an enormous amount of raw materials from nature and rely on backward integration. 90 % of our procurement volume will be derived from veri/fied sustainable sources by 2025 and our strategic raw materials will become fully traceable. We have been committed to this for years, also directly in the countries of origin.\n\n## At the same time, you're growing, which also leads to increased CO2 emissions.\n\n  In fact, we are growing very dynamically, especially in the emerging markets with rising incomes. That's why we are putting in double the e/ffort. We need to o/ffset the impact of rising sales while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions in our value chain. In order to accomplish this, we ensure consistently increasing levels of energy e/fficiency in our production facilities.

An innovative project has now ensured that the raw material can be extracted much more e/fficiently and therefore also more sustainably. The improved process allows daily production to be increased by a quarter and, at the same time, food coloring yields rise from 65 to 83 %. Another advantage is that water consumption decreases enormously. Previously, 6,000 liters of fresh water were required per extraction process. Now, the water is used in a recirculation process. In addition, the water maintains its temperature, while previously it had to be heated from 15 \u00b0 to 55 \u00b0  Celsius.\n\nSymrise ships thousands of products every day that must be packed sensibly and securely. Since March 2020, the company's packaging material suppliers have been o/ffsetting the CO2 emissions generated by producing the cardboard boxes. In the middle of the year, these materials were replaced with climate-neutral alternatives. By the end of 2020, this had saved around 389 tons of CO2. Since the beginning of this year, all packaging materials in Holzminden have subsequently become climate-neutral, which will reduce emissions by around 12,500 tons by the end of 2021. In the coming year, the main production sites in all regions around the world will follow.\n\n53",

Here, in the Brazilian state of Cear\u00e1, acerola cherries grow particularly well because of the hot weather and abundant light. The harvesters pick the fruits, carefully place them in their buckets, and then collect them in wide, light green containers. On the same day, they are driven by truck to a factory a few kilometers away. This is important because otherwise the valuable and delicate goods spoil quickly. In the factory, the fruit is processed into juice, which is then carefully concentrated. Afterwards, it is transported to France in large containers. At the Diana Food plant in Antrain, Brittany - only a few kilometers from the tourist attraction Mont-Saint-Michel - the juice concentrate is /finally processed into highly aromatic powder in a spray drying plant.\n\nThe e/ffort is worth it because the reward is the important and equally valuable ingredient of acerola cherries. It is considered the fruit with the highest content of vitamin C. The juice of this slightly sour stone fruit contains up to 50 times as much vitamin C as in a lemon - depending on where the cherry is grown. The ones from Cear\u00e1 contain between 2,000 and 3,000 milligrams per 100 grams of fruit. They also contain minerals such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium and secondary plant substances such as /flavonoids, pectins and anthocyanins. This diverse mix o/ffers great bene/fits. Acerola, for example, has an antioxidant and cell-rejuvenating e/ffect because it boosts the metabolism.\n\nNaturally better Many people bene/fit from the vitamin boost by taking food supplements containing acerola. Demand is constantly increasing, says Nathalie Richer, who works for Diana Food in the health and nutrition area. As product manager, she is responsible for acerola products, among other\n\nthings. Symrise has been o/ffering these products for 20 years already. In recent years, the business has experienced a major boost. 'Customers increasingly want products from nature,' explains Nathalie. 'With vitamin supplements, this makes a lot of sense because natural vitamins are much better metabolized than synthetic ones. Therefore, they work better.' In addition to tablets, the powder is also used in beverages or functional foods designed to increase well-being.\n\nIn order to obtain the best raw materials, Diana Food has been involved in the producing countries for years. In Brazil, the company works with several suppliers in the region to ensure the availability and the best quality of the fruit. The companies in turn buy the acerola cherries from a number of farmers who live in the Amazon region. 'We help to improve cultivation and harvesting methods to achieve higher quality,' says Nathalie. To do so, the agronomists from the suppliers and from Diana Food share information. 'For example, they have stipulated that farmers should harvest the fruit when it is j ust about to ripen because that is when the vitamin content is at its highest.' The still green acerola cherries land in the baskets. This initially caused incredulous looks. However, farmers quickly realized that their products had to be harvested unripe for exactly this purpose - and that in this way they could increase the value of their harvests and thus their income.\n\nOver the years, the organic trend has changed agriculture in the area. 'More than 10 % of our acerola purchases now come from organic agriculture, with a strong upward trend,' explains Nathalie. The acerola powder that Diana Food /finally brings to market has a vitamin C content of 17 %. Another one that contains twice as much of the ingredient comes from conventional agriculture. It is mainly used to preserve food products such as processed meat goods. As a strong antioxidant, it is well suited for this. >>",

'We were the /first company worldwide to develop a fair trade acerola powder,' says Marie Le Hena/ff, Global Sustainability Manager within Symrise Nutrition. A customer speci/fically commissioned the concept, which also includes organic certi/fication. 'Now it will be expanded to other customers, especially in Europe,' says the company's sustainability manager. The certi/fication, which is veri/fied by the strict 'Fair for Life' seal, requires very di/fferent measures and is checked by external experts. This includes, for example, quality, traceability and food safety. Social and ecological aspects as well as long-term commitment to suppliers also play a role.\n\n'In the beginning, we looked for a partner among our suppliers who already produced organic ingredients anyway,' continues Marie Le Hena/ff. The positive impact on the environment was important, and now the social component can be added. 'The new certi/fication that we started in May 2020 ful/fills several purposes at once for us: We can really make a di/fference for the people in the region while diversifying our product portfolio and meeting the demand for fair trade products,' Marie Le Hena/ff explains. This is how sustainability and economic success work together.\n\nCommitment with planning stability But that's easier said than done, Marie Le Hena/ff emphasizes. To receive the 'Fair for Life' certi/ficate, which is veri/fied annually directly with the farmers, companies must be committed and address the entire value chain - from the farmer to the factory to the customer. An important element is that suppliers pay farmers at least 10 % more for fair trade raw materials than for conventional ones. This is guaranteed for three years so that both sides can count on it in the long term - no matter how the market develops. >>\n\n'  The farmers can only convert their production if they know that we will work with them over a long period of time.'\n\nMARIE LE HENAFF Global Sustainability Manager at Symrise Nutrition\n\n<!-- image -->",

For vegans, vegetarians and /flexitarians, plant-based proteins are often on the menu, and there's no question that they also have to taste good. Symrise supplies the crucial ingredients for hundreds of these foods. Here are some insights into a growing business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  In 2050, ten billion people are expected to live on earth, a good two billion more than today. What will they eat? It is clear that the current form of nutrition with lots of meat, /fish and dairy products will no longer be viable at that point. There are several reasons for this. Climate-damaging emissions from mass livestock farming, which produce large amounts of methane gas, nitrates and ammonia, would increase. At the same time, livestock farming requires more and more water, which causes natural resources to dwindle. Last but not least, animal welfare is also increasing in the public eye.\n\nConsumers have been responding to this for years. In addition to people who eat a vegan or vegetarian diet, there has been particularly strong growth in the group of what are known as /flexitarians, who limit their meat consumption but do not want to give it up completely. 'In the context of coronavirus pandemic, we are seeing increased consumption of plant-based proteins as many consumers perceive this diet to be healthy and safe,' says Regine Lueghausen, Vice President Global Marketing Flavor Division. 'In the future, we can expect people to enjoy meat more consciously and focus on quality rather than quantity.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  The food industry is innovative and frequently launches new products worldwide. In supermarkets, for example, the range of vegetarian or vegan meat alternatives is growing, and even traditional suppliers are changing their product ranges. 'In 2019, global sales of these products totaled USD 19.5 billion,' explains Lueghausen. 'Compared to the traditional food market, this segment is still small, but it has signi/ficantly higher growth rates than the conventional food industry - /five times higher in the USA alone.' Alternatives to dairy products are also an important market, with sales expected to rise to USD 22 billion by 2023. This corresponds to growth of almost 10 %. While this development has so far mainly taken place in North America and Europe, the markets in Asia, Africa and South America will also become increasingly attractive in the coming years.\n\n63",

'We know exactly what consumers want and can develop the best possible products,' says Regine Lueghausen. Symrise also communicates with cooks around the world to gain culinary insights, including recipes and developments in alternative proteins.

'People also want the foods to be similar in terms of appearance, texture, juiciness, and even preparation, if applicable.' This is quite complex, as beef, chicken, pork and lamb have very di/fferent characteristics. The second main group is more interested in plant-based products and is open to 'culinary innovations,' even if they have no equivalent in the 'meat world.' These people test plant-based products in novel formats and dishes.

We look in particular at the speci/fic properties of the individual raw materials and how the sensory properties are linked to the molecular composition of scent and /flavor-active substances,' says Dr. Gerhard Krammer, Senior Vice President Global Research and Technology Group. This ensures that the ingredients achieve the desired e/ffect even when combined with others. They then provide good /flavor, a certain consistency, and the right nutrients, or they balance desirable and undesirable tastes. In addition, Diana Food o/ffers natural colors and food protection solutions for customer-friendly packaging labels that are easy to understand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  Symrise relies on raw materials form nature, including in solutions for alternative proteins. In extensive research programs, the company has analyzed and deciphered natural /flavoring substances. Symrise o/ffers these products, which are purchased in a transparent and traceable way, on its code of nature \u00ae platform. ' Our teams carefully prepare and optimize them to achieve an authentic, natural taste in plant-based products,' explains Global Marketing Manager Stefanie Hartwig. This approach also helps with regulatory issues. Manufacturers, and increasingly also consumers, want to know what food is made from. Ingredients from nature can be labeled clearly and understandably for this purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What\n\n## solutions Symrise o/ffers\n\n  The Symrise portfolio is broad and o/ffers solutions for all the culinary and sensory challenges that alternative proteins pose. For example, when plant-based raw materials such as peas, soy, chickpeas or rapeseed are used in vegetarian or vegan meat alternatives, they often taste bitter and sometimes leave an unpleasant mouthfeel. The tastebalancing solutions from Symrise compensate for these undesirable e/ffects. 'We have carried out extensive scienti/fic work and studies on this and have patented the results. These property rights, along with our new /flavor management technologies and our /flavorists' expertise, demonstrate our innovative strength and make us the industry leader,' says Dr. Gerhard Krammer. New analytical methods such as ProtiScan\u2122, which uses a special measuring technique to reduce o/ff-/flavors and optimize /flavor release for foods containing plant-based protein, also contribute to the company's strength. Symrise has also developed natural and vegan chicken and beef /flavors as well as a barbecue and smoked foods collection in order to replicate the /flavors of the original as perfectly as possible.\n\n65",

In the best case, these shampoos smell like human care products. One thing is clear: Preferences diverge widely. In addition, our four-legged friends are much more sensitive to odors than humans: '10 % of a dog's brain is dedicated to olfaction, as compared to only 0.3 % in humans. Dogs have about 200 million olfactive neurons, cats have 67 million and humans only 15 million,' says Anne Cabotin, Senior Vice President of Consumer Fragrances. 'We need to tailor fragrances that do not irritate dogs and also contribute to making them feel relaxed and happy.' Dogs also have much thinner skin with a higher pH value, which means they need more shampoos and creams speci/fically adapted to their sensitive skin.\n\nThe market for animal care products is huge. There are 830 million domestic dogs and cats around the world, and this number has risen by 40 % in the past ten years. 'But this growth is far from over. We're talking about a market for animal care products of around \u20ac 10 billion,' says Bertrand de Launay, President of Diana Pet Food, citing another concise /figure that points to rising /figures: According to studies, two-thirds of all millennials in the U.S. - those\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor pet owners, animal care products should ideally smell like care products for people.\n\nborn between the early 1980 s and late 1990 s - already own a pet. 'However, we are no longer talking about pet owners, but about pet parents. And because this humanization will progress even more, we see enormous potential in the beauty and home care industries as well.'\n\nSo how do you bring the needs of humans and animals together in pet care products? A team from the Pet Food business unit of Symrise's Division Diana, has joined forces with researchers from the Consumer Fragrances business unit of Symrise's Fragrance Division. The result are fragrances with a NeoFresh \u00ae technology inside that help suppressing odors without the animals perceiving the smell of the care product as unpleasant. Both sides brought their strengths to the development process. An example of this is the evaluation subjects: 'We know the animals' preferences very well because we have been working for years with more than 1,000 cats and dogs living in our Panelis centers in France, Brazil and the USA,' says Bertrand de Launay. Experts are also evaluating the products with 2,300 dogs and cats that live with families in the French region, who were brought together to form the Panelis in-home panel. The process also involved veterinarians and ethologists (animal behavior experts). The experts are additionally evaluating feedbacks from pet parents of Yummypets, a pioneering social media network for pets. Yummypets also belongs to Diana Pet Food.

Three customer groups were to be addressed: companies that already o/ffer animal care products, beauty care companies that want to add beauty products for animals, and companies that sell animal food and want to expand their range. In developing the fragrances and also selling the products to the care product manufacturers, the project relied on the know-how of Symrise colleagues from the Cosmetic Ingredients Division, who are par ticularly well versed in products for sensitive skin and hair. 'At Symrise, we want to increase health and well-being for the whole family, and that includes pets,' says Gabriele Vielhaber, Senior Vice President Global Accounts Cosmetic Ingredients.

The coronavirus crisis has further intensi/fied the development of the market. 'Consumers are spending much more time at home with their cats and dogs, which has made them realize they can improve living conditions for their pets as well - not just with food, but with odors,' says Gabriele Vielhaber.\n\nThe entry of large and trendy cosmetics customers into the segment has also boosted business. 'This is the ideal time to also expand our product range,' says Gabriele. 'However, and this is particularly important, the products must be precisely adapted to the needs of the animals: In dogs, for example, this means that we use our gentlest ingredients and fragrances because of the higher skin pH, thinner epidermis and /finer hair.' In addition, the products are vegan, mostly biodegradable and manufactured without controversial substances such as parabens.\n\nThe teams are also currently developing products for which they have advanced into another area: household cleaning products. 'What does a pet have the most contact with?' Bertrand asks, and he answers immediately, saying, 'The /floor. Dogs and cats walk on carpets or hard /floor coverings all day long, so it is only logical that we take a close look at this area as well.'

From the company's beginnings in 1874, when its founders extracted vanillin from conifers, to today, when we process thousands of raw materials from nature,' says Ricardo Omori. The company now wants to pursue this approach even more actively and also display it externally, explains Omori, who is Senior Vice President Global Fine Fragrances and responsible for the business development of the division.\n\nTo do this, the company looked to the 220 year old Maison Lautier brand, a symbol of luxury natural materials. As a /first step, Omori's team /first commissioned a historian to explore the history of the storied brand. She discovered the exciting story that begins in 1795 with a perfume merchant and producer in southern France in the city of Grasse, the birthplace of perfume. 'We already knew a little bit, but I still found it very interesting to learn about the parallels between then and now,' says Ricardo Omori. His colleague Veronique Ferval adds, 'What's fascinating to me is that we basically still follow the approach of our predecessors: We rely on natural raw materials, which we extract through a great deal of manual labor and develop with highly innovative technologies.' As Vice President Creation Fine Fragrances Global, Ferval spends all of her time with fragrances and accordingly has a special relationship with these creative solutions. 'It's like a magical process.'\n\nIn the coming years Symrise will further strengthen the Maison Lautier brand by increasing the number of natural raw materials in the palette with a focus on three main pillars: Madagascar, Artisan, High Tech. 'For example, in Madagascar we are constantly testing new plants to see if they are suitable for the production of essences,' says Omori. Symrise has long been familiar with the rich diversity on the East African island. Symrise's vanilla project, which the company launched in Madagascar 15 years ago, brought the country even more sharply into focus. 'We created backward integration there, meaning we took over upstream manufacturing steps. This allows us to obtain reliably available and sustainably produced raw materials while supporting thousands of small farmers,' explains Omori.\n\n'  Under the Maison Lautier umbrella, we will build an exciting portfolio that would still inspire its founders in Grasse with its creativity and innovation.'\n\nRICARDO OMORI,\n\nSenior Vice President Global Fine Fragrances\n\nThis model now serves as an example that the company follows all over the world - for example, in Ecuador, Brazil and Indonesia. This is also where the second pillar of the new brand comes in. Ferval explains, 'We work in part exclusively with suppliers who know the farmers well and re/fine their raw materials, using handcrafted methods that are both gentle and e/fficient. This guarantees us high-quality substances for our portfolio.' In the past four years alone, around 42 ingredients have come onto the market in this way, which will become part of the Maison Lautier label in the future. The company will be able to launch between three and ten new substances annually, Omori estimates, with a market volume of \u20ac 400 to 500 million each in the same period.\n\nThe third pillar is the technologies Symrise uses to process the natural substances and, above all, to use them as e/fficiently as possible. Omori calls the Symtrap\u2122 process a good example of this. 'This has allowed us to develop new, natural essences from leftovers from vegetable production in France, which can now also replace synthetic /flavors,' says Omori, emphasizing the special nature of the process. And Omori has even bigger goals for the brand. 'Under the Maison Lautier umbrella, we will build an exciting portfolio that would still inspire its founders in Grasse with its creativity and innovation.'",

In doing so, he laid a stone in the foundation for the city's reputation as the world capital of perfume.\n\nA few years later, the two families came together, as Lautier married a granddaughter of Fran\u00e7ois Ranc\u00e9. With his wife's brother, Lautier ran a factory near Grasse and in 1862 took part in the World's Fair in London. The two men subsequently fell out - and Lautier founded his own company, Lautier Fils, with the brand Maison Lautier in 1865.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlmost 1,000 kilometers further north in Paris and 50 years later, Jean-Baptiste Lautier started a perfume business. In order to secure its raw materials, he built distillation stations in the southeast part of the country. This made him the /first merchant to extract the highly fragrant lavender oils used as the basis of many perfumes, and he later secured a monopoly on the sale of geranium essences from Algeria.\n\nOver the following centuries, the business grew, and the company became one of the most important raw material processing companies in Grasse. It continued to use more and more di/fferent perfume plants, invest in research and apply for patents for new processes to extract oils and process fragrances in cosmetic products. The company also became increasingly international, and by 1920, it had branches and warehouses in Algeria, Beirut, Paris, London, New York, Chicago and Kobe.\n\n1 8 45\n\n19 2 0\n\nAfter World War II, Lautier Fils struggled with economic di/fficulties.

In 1981, the brand was transferred to the US manufacturer Florasynth, which was in turn acquired by Bayer in 1995. The German group merged Lautier Fils with the Flavor Division of its subsidiary Haarmann & Reimer, one of the two predecessor companies of Symrise.

These include the artisan programs, which support sus\u00ad tainable raw material cultivation in countries such as Italy and Egypt. The focus is also on the 'Bridging the Gap' activities learning partnerships between suppliers, farmers, Symrise and its customers. This is one way in which the company commits to the important Sustainable Development Goal No. 17 set by the United Nations: To operate sustainably alongside strong partners.\n\nIn these holistic partnerships, environmentally sustainable agricultural practices are taught and /financial investments made to support better living and working conditions. All the projects can only be carried out through partnerships, which is why Symrise, together with its partners, will invest \u20ac 16 million over the next four years in the 'Bridging the Gap' measures alone. Only in this way can the Group achieve an important goal: Purchasing raw materials of excellent quality that are pro\u00ad duced in a sustainable manner, traceable, and reliable in the long term. The three examples that follow are illustrative of the many sustainable supply partnerships we are working on.",

The factory only processes fruits that are not suitable for the fresh fruit market because of small spots, their size or - particularly important for bananas - because of a wrong curvature. The process is sustainable at all levels. A challenge at the moment, however, are the peels that are left over after processing. So far, the approximately 22,000 tons have been composted and then used as fertilizer. A small portion is also used for food supplements. These are good solutions, but there is still room for improvement. Diana Food is evaluating the possibility of methanizing the peels to produce biogas. In addition, similar projects will be implemented with several communities in the region that will bene/fit the farmers again.\n\nIn addition, Diana Food has entered into a close partnership on the topic of bananas with the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ). Together, they are exploring the possibility of launching an experimental platform involving one of the world's leading specialists in sustainable tropical agriculture and key players in banana production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## O R A L   C A R E   D I V I S I O N A N D   F L A V O R   S E G M E N T\n\n  Bridging the Gap Mint is one of the key /flavors for oral care products and chewing gum - and one of the top-selling products for Symrise. Since the 1970s, the company has been one of the /first and largest producers of synthetic menthol, along with /flavorings derived from the various types of mint around the world. In India, for example, more than 750,000 small-scale farmers grow around 80 % of the world's supply of Mentha arvensis mint. There, Symrise is working closely with Mars, GIZ - the German Society for International Cooperation - and the training NGO Tanager on a 'Bridging the Gap' project to support 25,000 mint farmers in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The three-year project aims to improve sustainability in the mint supply chain and help farmers optimize their farm management in a sustainable way. Professionalized structures will allow farmers to increase productivity, reduce water consumption and improve their overall income. In addition, self-help groups are designed to empower women with regard to their rights and increase economic participation opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

From one ton of individually hand-picked /flowers (about six million), the farms there produce 1.5 kilograms of jasmine absolute - a material whose richness and intensity inspire perfumers to make magni/ficent creations and give them multiple ol factory facets. One of the most important manufacturers of these absolutes, as well as of concret\u00e8s and recently also oils from distillation, is the company A. Fakhry & Co., which has been active in the industry since 1955 and has long cooperated with the Scent & Care and Flavor segments of Symrise. The quality of the product is naturally an important reason for working together, but Symrise also values the supplier's commitment.\n\nFor example, Fakhry established the Fakhry Aid Foundation, which bene/fits about 25,000 jasmine farmers and pickers as well as their families. The organization funds teachers for schools and organizes extracurricular activities. There is also a broad-based awareness campaign on health issues directly and indirectly related to jasmine. The farmers learn how to use environmentally friendly pesticides and improve their agriculture. They are also taught about better nutrition. Finally, the Fakhry Aid Foundation facilitates access to health care, supports employees through interest-free micro/financing and seeks to empower women by organizing discussion groups where they can talk about their health, family life, or access to education and work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## B R I D G I N G   T H E G E N E R A T I O N   G A P\n\nIn many countries around the world, the same problem can be observed in small-scale agriculture: Sons and daughters do not want to take over their parents' farms, and parents want a less arduous life and a better education for their children. Because of that, bottlenecks for some types of fruit and vegetables are already being projected. This challenge is a focus of the /first 'Bridging the Gap' initiative that Symrise launched with many partners in several countries such as Brazil and Madagascar.

The US-based companies have decades of experience with protein products from chicken and eggs, which they provide to the pet food, animal feed and food industries. Both sides pro/fit from the purchase: The Group gets a raw material base and broader market access in the USA, and the new colleagues there can o/ffer their products more globally and draw on extensive research in the parent company.\n\n  People in the business world often speak of synergies. When two companies join together, they are meant to reinforce each other so the whole becomes stronger than the sum of the two parts. Since Symrise expanded the American family business ADF, IDF and IsoNova for USD 900 million at the end of 2019, the newly acquired company's eleven factories have made a major contribution to sales and pro/fit. Moreover - and this is just as important in the long term - the individual divisions work hand in hand with their partners at Symrise Nutrition. A look at the details shows how this works.\n\nThe Americans are working in a /field that completes and enriches Symrise portfolio in this form: Using raw materials from chicken production, ADF manufactures pet food ingredients, while IDF produces broth, protein powder and fat products for human consumption. By contrast, IsoNova produces egg proteins.\n\nThe merger is now having several synergy e/ffects: One is the pace of research by way of the following example from the ADF/IDF - IsoNova point of view:\n\nand development and of production and sales. John Tiedeman veri/fies this 'Because we are now working with Diana Pet Food and Diana Aqua, we've been able to accelerate our original /five-year plan by 12 to 24 months in some cases.' One example: Diana Aqua has opened doors with major aquaculture feed producers that would have taken IsoNova years to gain access to on their own. The company expects commercial sales in early 2021 - something that IsoNova didn't project in its original business plans until at least 2022. The manager previously supervised the egg protein business at IsoNova and is now the General Manager responsible for Animal Nutrition within the Nutrition segment. He thinks the acquisition by Symrise has changed a number of things. 'Our company was a family business, which we all very much appreciated,' he describes his impressions. 'I recognize many of the positive aspects of a family business in Symrise: enthusiasm about the product, for example, and commitment to the work.'",

'If we look at the area of food, IDF used to provide the broth while Diana Food brought the vegetables. Now we're delivering all the soup. That's a really simple way of describing the synergies,' explains Steve Arrick, President of ADF/IDF, with a laugh. 'There aren't many companies that can do that,' says Steve. 'When it was clear the acquisition was happening, we started the integration process right away and had an intensive exchange of ideas with our counterparts,' comments Steve. 'HR, /financial, IT teams, but also all business and support functions teams have played a major role in the coalescence of the companies'.\n\nMultiple workshops - some of which had to be held online because of the coronavirus pandemic - allowed employees from both sides to work closely together. 'Fortunately, even before the coronavirus really broke out, we organized a kicko/ff week at the locations in Rennes, Vannes and Antrain in France. This allowed us to get to know each other personally, which helped as the work teams progressed,' says Chantel Gebhard, HR VP within ADF/IDF. The integration process required a lot of patience on all sides and the determination to bring a largescale project together.

Others are newer, with clean sheet-metal facades. And then the new Diana Pet Food plant comes into view, where palatability enhancers and health and nutrition ingredients for pet food are manufactured. The building has large windows, gray walls, and suspended ceilings covered with bamboo cane. The natural material on the facade already hints at what makes the factory special. Here, 30 kilometers north of the Colombian capital of Bogot\u00e1, Diana Pet Food has built a production facility that is environmentally friendly in all respects. Its history shows that even ambitious ideas can be realized if the partners really want it.\n\nAn idea leads to a project: Everything began in 2015, with the 'Future Generation' program. This brought to gether young senior executives from across the Symrise Group to work on speci/fic projects. One of them was Fernando Putrino, at the time Operations Manager responsible for the factories in Latin America. Since August 2020, he has been General Manager of the pet food business unit in Brazil. 'Two things came together: We wanted to build a factory in Colombia anyway, to serve the growing mar ket in the Andean region,' says the production expert. 'Symrise had also already begun to produce more sustainably. We linked these two approaches together.'\n\nNo one had much experience with this. Until then, Fernando Putrino explains, the company had only implemented such large-scale measures in existing factories - to minimize CO2 emissions, for instance or it had focused on individual sustainability ob-\n\n## '  We have chosen to become a place for education and networking.'\n\nFERNANDO PUTRINO,\n\nGeneral Manager at Diana Pet Food\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nkilometers north of the Colombian capital of Bogot\u00e1 Diana Pet Food has built a production facility.\n\njectives for new plants. 'But we wanted to develop a holistic sustainable production, from the construction to supply and production to the products themselves,' says Fernando. With Claus Oliver Schmidt as a mentor - who, as a Vice President at Symrise, is responsible for global quality control and innovation management - Fernando and his three colleagues Catherine Orain, Edison Diaz and Jenny Weissbrodt started a concept in 2016 based on six criteria.\n\n'We analyzed energy management, waste and water management, building management, supply chain, and social justice, and considered measures we could take to become increasingly sustainable in these areas.'\n\nA result: overall, CO2 emissions from the highly automated facility, in which only around 20 people work, have been reduced by a third compared to similar plants. The power supply contributes to this: there are 240 solar collectors installed on the roof, which generate 13 % of the required electrical energy. 'During phases when we don't consume so much power, we feed the electricity into the public grid,' says Christophe Sala\u00fcn, the General Manager in Colombia.

'To avoid burdening the municipal waterworks, we drilled a well 170 meters deep that allows us to use the groundwater.' The proprietary water treatment plant also returns half the process water to circulation. Diana Pet Food also uses collected rainwater for the plant's sanitary facilities.\n\nIn order to both assess and control the e/ffectiveness of the measures, Diana Pet Food worked with an eco-design matrix that the company developed in the last few years. This makes it possible to assess how ecological the manufacturing of products is along the entire value chain. The sustainability experts compare various factors for individual products: water consumption, land use, emissions of CO2 and particulate matter, acidi/fication of soil and water, abiotic resource consumption (such as the use of fossil fuels) and the enrichment of the ecosystem with nutrients. 'We can adjust various factors to /find out how we can make the products more sustainable,' says Christophe Sala\u00fcn.\n\nOne result, for example, is that products manufactured in Colombia and distributed in the Andean region have shorter transport distances and are therefore more sustainable than imported goods from Argentina, where Diana Pet Food also operates a plant. In addition, the company also obtains its raw materials - byproducts from chicken meat production that are not consumed by humans - from the immediate vicinity. 'In this way, we provide many small companies with the opportunity to sell us their products while building a long-term relationship with us,' explains the Frenchman, who has been working at Diana Pet Food in Colombia for 18 years.\n\nThe plant was built to comply with the strict Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards developed by the U.S. Green Building Council in 1998.

Depending on outside temperatures and humidity, the greenery has an insulating e/ffect against heat or cold. In addition, Fernando Putrino explains, many building materials such as the windows, concrete and paneling came from the surrounding area. Incidentally, all the glass doesn't just serve to make the building look light and airy: Because it lets in plenty of daylight, it makes the factory transparent.' This is completely intentional because we also want to do something for society. We have chosen to become a place for education and networking,' emphasizes Fernando Putrino, who also points out 500 trees planted by Diana Pet Food in the immediate area. A glass corridor on the upper /floor provides a view of the production. 'We invite schools and universities to visit, for example, so they can get an idea of what this kind of production looks like.

        "page_content": "The challenge In the past few years, Symrise has developed a higher number of natural taste-balancing solutions compared to other companies in the industry that are predominantly based on renewable natural raw material sources. In creating these, the company's researchers and developers are faced with two challenges. For one, they have to identify natural /flavoring substances that can close the taste gap that appears in reduced-sugar food products - that is no simple task. Even though 25,000 of the world's approximately 400,000 known natural /flavoring substances are available at least in small quantities in natural substance libraries, only a few dozen of those are currently considered taste balancing. The second challenge lies in the combination: Although there is a relatively low number of substances, there are countless di/fferent ways to combine them. The right mixing ratios and correctly processing the ingredients are key here.\n\n## Research inspired by 40,000 recipes\n\n## CLIMATE & GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n  One of the major health problems globally is excess weight, which can lead to diabetes, cardiovascular illness, heart attacks or strokes. Many countries have passed laws to reduce the amount of sugar, fat and salt in foods. Most consumers support these laws but, at the same time, they don't want to lose out on taste. That's why Symrise has developed a broad port-\n\nfolio of natural taste-balancing solutions - the /flavor solutions for reduced- sugar products alone have a market potential of some USD 1.1 billion by 2023. Symrise researchers combine centuries-old knowledge with digital methods in order to track down these ingredients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM A G A Z I N E\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe solution For a long time now, Symrise has been systematically researching plant-based products that have been described in the literature as taste-balancing or pleasant-tasting. The researchers identify and test possible candidates, and they also check whether they could be sourced or cultivated responsibly. The company found a surprising source of inspiration for these ingredients during a cooperation with the German-Chinese company BiColl and the Institute of Chinese Life Sciences (ICL) at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin. Supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the scientists of the joint project SimLeap combed through around 40,000 old Chinese recipes for ingredients to improve taste. To this end, the original written works were scanned and now lie - translated into modern Chinese - in an electronic library at the ICL. With the help of linguistic methods and arti/ficial intelligence-based search engines, the researchers discovered potential botanic raw materials, recipes and methods that could be used to reduce or improve undesired tastes in traditional recipes. Based on this, BiColl and Symrise manufactured extracts that were then tested using the patented high-temperature ultra-performance liquid chromatography method 'LC Taste \u00ae ' for taste-modulating properties. The outcome was a variety of novel /flavor solutions that balance out and improve tastes naturally and that make an important contribution to a healthy diet with less sugar, salt and fat.\n\n83",

        "page_content": "Farmers around the world produce fresh and saltwater /fish and crustaceans to meet the increasing consumer demand. The market is huge: In 2019, 33.5 million tons of farmed /fish from aquacultures were sold worldwide. For the animals to develop well, not only the water quality and external conditions such as the temperature are crucial: nutrition is as well. Diana Aqua business unit from the Symrise Nutrition segment supplies feed manufacturers with high quality products that make a di/fference - natural solutions that transform simple plant-based ingredients into nutritious and tasty feed. The ingredients simultaneously achieve more, partly replacing the /fish meal in the feed that encourages the animals to eat. Fish meal is often produced from fresh /fish, and around 15 million tons of wild-caught /fish are used for this purpose. This means it is no longer available for humans - not to mention the ecological consequences of the process.\n\nThese 'palatability enhancers' that Diana Aqua produces mainly in France, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Thailand, are complex products. 'They've been developed through a lot of research,' says Fabio Soller, who has worked with his team to build a new development center for the company, named Aqualis, near the Thai capital of Bangkok. Shrimp and tilapia swim in 96 tanks and aquar  iums in the 1,000-square-meter white building with blue steel struts. Tilapia is becoming increasingly popular in kitchens of the world - around 6.8 million tons are o/ffered on the mar ket every year. 'Here we can run two dozen test diets simultaneously to try out ours and competitors products,' explains Fabio Soller, who has been the Technical Director of Diana Aqua in Asia  /Paci/fic since 2018. 'These trials last between ten and fourteen days each.'\n\nIn the case of Diana Aqua, for example, the 'products' are the palatability enhancers. To produce them, co-products from shell/fish and /fish processing are converted into a liquid or a powder. These are left over from food production and would otherwise be further processed into /fish meal, or even disposed of. This process uses enzymes under clearly de/fined protocols to transform proteins into peptides. The palatability enhancers are added to feed in proportions between 0.5 and 2 %, making the feed particularly attractive for the farmed animals. Fabio Soller searches for a simple comparison. 'You have to imagine, it's like us humans eating bread without butter, or soup without spices.' There are always three main factors involved: How to have a positive in/fluence on survival, feed intake and animal growth?\n\nDiana Aqua did not previously have its own testing center in Asia, where 89 % of the world's aquacultures production takes place.\n\nInstead, the company cooperated with universities. Now the testing capacity has increased greatly, while mastering perfectly the performance demonstration, close to its customers. With increased reliability, the company can now also react more /flexibly to customer requirements and test its own innovations. 'For example, if we improve the feed /flavor with our palatability enhancers, we can increase the feed intake of farmed animals by a considerable high percentage,' Fabio Soller reports. Diana Aqua keeps on conducting trials in collaboration with universities, with the addition of testings at aquaculture farmers' sites. 'We practically and scienti/fically demonstrate to our partners how they can bene/fit from better palatability enhancer in their feed.'\n\nThe entire Aqualis system is built on sustainability: The test animals are not killed after the test series, as is often the case, but sold to small farms in the area. 'Often our employees or their families have small farms that are happy to take the animals for further growth to market size,' says Fabio Soller. The 5 employees who work in the testing center and in the neighboring factory also bene/fit from another element: a small percentage of the water where the /fish and shrimp live must be changed regularly. All the water passes through /filters returning to the /fish tanks recirculation system, the excess feed and nutrients that are /filtered out land in an outdoor canal where they serve as nutrients for various vegetables. The process, known in technical jargon as aquaponics, combines the breeding of /fish in aquacultures with that of crop plants using hydroponics. 'At the moment, we are cultivating lettuce, kale and bok choy,' says Fabio Soller, adding: 'Our employees can take the products home free of charge. If they want, they can also donate small amounts of money which goes to a charity project for children.' Last but not least, the building stands for e/fficiency, especially in terms of energy. The heated air escapes through the roof and fresh air /flows in through the open sides, so that no air conditioning is necessary. In addition, everything is illuminated with energysaving LEDs - and planning is underway for the installation of a solar power system for electricity generation in 2021.\n\nIncidentally, there's no end to the experiments in sight. New regulations, the use of alternative ingredients and production methods by feed manufacturers make sure of that. 'When manufacturers optimize their feeds and processes, we also have to adapt our products,' says Fabio Soller. Besides, the market is extremely dynamic, new raw materials are currently being tried out. 'For example, we're taking a look at proteins from insects,' Fabio explains. 'This includes the black soldier /fly, whose larvae can be grown on leftover food and used to make hydrolyzed products. This is another step toward sustainability.'\n\n89",

Symrise has ful/filled these preferences in recent years by developing relevant innovations in all divisions. In the Scent & Care segment, one program in particular addresses this issue: 'Act for Good' pioneered by Consumer Fragrances Business Unit, focuses on new standards in the production of scent molecules that are used in cosmetics, detergents and cleaning products.\n\n  The Act for Good program gradually and systematically transforms customer desires into new products. The program starts out with the chapter 'Act for Me.' Consumers want the scents in their cosmetics to have natural origins but not to trigger allergies. This is not always easy with natural substances, because essential oils are often highly allergenic. Symrise thus develops hypoallergenic solutions that contain few to no substances that can cause irritation. In addition, the company uses an increasing number of raw materials from organic farming which are produced according to the highest possible sustainability practices and are certi/fied with the recognized COSMOS label. >>\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n91",

Consumers want the people who cultivate the raw materials for their care products to also be able to enjoy better lives.

Symrise works with non-pro/fit organizations in various countries, like UEBT (Union for Bio Ethical Trade) to support health care systems and schools and to improve cultivation methods. Another important point: All new products contain no animalbased ingredients and are vegan.\n\nThe /final step is called 'Act for the Planet.' If environmental balance and biodiversity are to be maintained, not every substance can come directly from nature, as nature is limited. Symrise uses green chemistry methods, ensuring that natural resources aren't overused in the /first place and that by-products from other production processes are used. This results in molecules that not only come from renewable sources but are also naturally biodegradable. Overall, Symrise has used these methods in recent years to bring hundreds of substances to market in the areas of Fragrances, Aroma Molecules and Cosmetic Ingredients.\n\nSymrise uses green chemistry methods, ensur\u00ad ing that natural resources aren't overused in the first place and that byproducts from other pro\u00ad duction pro\u00ad cesses are used.",

        "page_content": "Four out of ten employees working from home, production facilities all over the world working around the clock, and on top of that the health concerns of our colleagues: The HR department of Symrise encountered some unexpected tasks in 2020. In this interview, Dr. I\u00f1igo Natzel, Head of Human Resources, explains which challenges faced by the Group around the world needed to be overcome.\n\nDr. Natzel, the coronavirus pandemic shook the global economy and even turned it upsidedown in many areas. How did Symrise react to the developments?\n\n  Like many others, we underestimated the coronavirus pandemic in the early stages when it started to spread around Asia. No one saw the pandemic coming. In those /first weeks, everyone thought that the coronavirus would be a locally con/fined phenomenon. Most importantly, however, we did not foresee the disruptive power of the pandemic - with its impact not only on public health but also on our daily private and working lives. That is why, this year, we focused our attention on our employees more than ever before.\n\n## What does that exactly mean?\n\n  Our traditional HR standards, such as our rules for working from home, were no longer adequate. We needed to ensure that our employees could get through the crisis healthy and safe. Therefore, we /first identi/fied how we could protect those working in our plants all over the world. Production could not be interrupted. For this reason, we increased our occupational safety regulations, provided disinfectants for hands and surfaces everywhere, had o/ffices and warehouses cleaned more often, installed plexiglass panels wherever needed, and, of course, made it mandatory for employees to wear face masks in common areas.\n\n## How many employees are working from home?\n\n  When the pandemic /first peaked in the spring it was 40 %, which then plateaued between 20 and 25 % during the course of the year. That is a very high percentage for a production plant and still /first needed to work in technical terms. Employees required equipment, needed to be provided with video conference tools and had to /figure out themselves how to balance work and family, which partially converged at home. We also provided our /flexible support in this area.\n\n## Working from home has been part of everyday working life since the spring of 2020. How did you experience this at Symrise?\n\n  My experiences were largely positive because of the enormous engagement of our employees. As always, our workforce contributed to our success here. Through this massive change, we also identi/fied a few areas where we can improve.\n\n## What would be an example?\n\n  Our managers faced the challenge of leading their teams virtually. Some of the employees were in the o/ffice; others at home. In addition to that, there were some living in other time zones and were unable to travel. This greatly complicates management duties. And we also had to make clear to the employees working at our factories, meaning those who could not work from home, that their health is just as important to us. Because of that, we introduced, for example, staggered working times in the labs and handover periods for shifts in production. On top of that, we gave a one-time 'corona bonus' to all employees as recognition for their e/ffort. This put those who earn less in a better situation in relation to those who earn more which was important for us.\n\n## The crisis was di/fficult for all employees. Were you able to get a sense of the mood in the company?\n\n  Yes, we did that early on in the summer by surveying 750 of our employees, some online, others in person in 20 focus groups, and in over 50 individual interviews. In addition to that, we handed out survey cards, and thousands of them have already come back to us. We are delighted by the results because they con/firm that we acted responsibly during the crisis. Furthermore, the employees made it clear that they like their work to involve creativity and innovative technologies, and that they see their activities as meaningful because we make a positive impact on the lives of so many people and manufacture more and more sustainable products. This obviously also allows us to prevail in the /fight for the best minds in the job market. >>\n\n95",

I\u00d1IGO NATZEL, Head of Human Resources\n\nContinued education, which has always been important to Symrise, is also bene/ficial to that end. How were you able to ensure it?\n\n  After realigning the core processes, such as performance measurement, we turned our attention to career development. This included, of course, the establishment of corresponding feedback processes and the further development of the teams. The latter in particular is not easy during times in which people are con/fined to their domestic environment due to the pandemic. We tried to ensure as much communication as possible.\n\n## How did you manage to promote individual careers further?\n\n  This year we rolled out our new global career development process called 'Grow.' Through it, we aim to give employees feedback regarding their career development and identify those who have the potential to leap forward in their careers in line with our succession planning. We use our global HR management tool career@symrise for this. 1,700 employees received feedback in 2020. Of these, 90 % received a detailed development plan, and 270 were identi/fied as having the potential to be considered for management duties. These processes enable us to see who, for example, needs more international experience or who should lead training sessions for price negotiation, presentation or communication skills. We will increasingly rely on e-learning for these kinds of training sessions, which are also integrated in the Grow platform. Due to the coronavirus, we moved all our on-site training sessions, such as language courses, management or communication seminars, to e-learning back in 2020. Many employees used their time in lockdown to sharpen their skills.\n\nAll over the world, women had to dedicate even more time to family again while working from home due to the coronavirus. Is that a setback for the e/fforts to further diversify the working world?\n\n  I hope not. As a matter of fact, it is not that easy to fairly address the needs of all social groups when it comes to, for example, /flexible working models. But I am still optimistic: Half of the employees identi/fied as potentially suitable to take on management duties in the 2020 assessment are women, as are a third in our succession planning for the two management levels below the Executive Board. And 40 % of the participants in our 'Future Generation Leadership Development' program are women - which is, incidentally, an upward trend that we also see in the fact that 45 % of promoted employees in 2020 were women.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic placed enormous demands on humanity in many areas, but it also accelerated processes such as digitalization. What has Symrise taken from these developments?\n\n  We will continue to build on the experiences gained from remote working, but not to the same extent seen during the coronavirus pandemic. However, I do think that we could improve work-life balance in some areas, for example, if employees have to travel long distances from their workplaces back to their homes. We also make a contribution here by having learned to hold certain events as video conferences. This way, Symrise is more /flexible, faster, and we can reduce our carbon emissions by traveling less. However, it is also very important to realize that creative and innovative types need to interact directly with other people, both across departments and within teams. Therefore, we are moving toward a healthy working model that is both digital and analog.\n\nThree women tell us about their careers at Symrise.",

Occupational safety is an essential component of the sustainability and corporate strategy at Symrise, and the company takes extensive measures to ensure it. Facilities are safe; forklifts and trucks observe the highest possible safety standards; hazardous substances are stored so that no one comes into contact with them; colleagues have been briefed and are trained on an ongoing basis. Nevertheless, acci-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndents that pose danger to life and limb happen here - like they do at every company. For the employees who su/ffer them, they represent considerable, sometimes permanent, health damage.\n\nYet nearly all accidents could be avoided, says Jessica Hildebrandt, Director Corporate Communications. 'Most of them are related to behavior. With this campaign, we want to increase employee awareness of safety. The goal is for them to intuitively recognize potential sources of danger and to react safely,' explains the new occupational safety campaign's project leader. This includes supposedly small things that everyone has done at some point, like crossing the road at the plant while talking on the phone or running too fast down the stairs without using the handrail.\n\nFor this reason, Symrise has launched the comprehensive 'Drive to 100 % Safety' campaign in Holzminden, the company's headquarters. The campaign is a pilot project of subsidiary TESIUM and will be rolled out in other areas of the company in 2021. 'First, we carried out a comprehensive analysis. To do so, we interviewed a number of managers and employees and analyzed the data so we could even\n\nbegin to categorize the demand,' says Hildebrandt in describing the project, which is vital for the company.\n\nNext, the team developed a campaign that is designed to present employees with an emotional depiction of the importance of observing safety regulations and acting thoughtfully. Clay /figures take center stage, visualizing potential dangers in an amusing way without trivializing them. The imagery, which is used in all analog and\n\ndigital media, email banners, newsletters, posters, brochures, and in the Symportal community, is clearly de/fined and understandable all over the world. 'In addition, we have de/fined key /figures for occupational safety, which we will evaluate and analyze on an ongoing basis,' says Hildebrandt.

Searching is futile,' is written in big letters on the poster hanging in a hallway in the Symrise headquarters in Holzminden. Below, in smaller letters, is the explanation. From July 3, 2021, the EU will prohibit many disposable plastic items. One way in which Symrise supports this e/ffort is by replacing almost all plastic cups in quality control with compostable cups made of recycled material. This initiative can reduce waste by approximately 300,000 plastic cups every year.\n\nThe poster is part of a sustainability campaign that Symrise launched at its sites in early 2021. 'We're doing this to direct the attention of our employees to this complex topic in a light manner,' says Sabine Rieke, Quality Control Sensory Flavor, who designed the campaign. 'We want to inspire them to conserve resources more e/ffectively and act more responsibly.' There are currently six versions in addition to the plastic motif; in humorous ways, they announce\n\nthat Symrise is banning disposable packaging in its cafeteria, and that the Oral Care department replaced plastic toothbrushes with bamboo ones starting in 2020, for example. By contrast, other posters promote behavioral changes. For instance, they point out that there are alternatives to liquid shampoo, and that reducing one's consumption of meat by half can save large amounts of water and reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nAccording to Friedrich-Wilhelm Micus, who is responsible for sustainability communication within the company, the medium-term goal is to get the employees across the entire Group to participate. 'Our sustainability approach pursues clear strategic goals, which we want to communicate not only externally but also internally.' To achieve this, not just the posters but all internal media will be utilized, including the Team Spirit employee magazine and digital channels. The focus will always be on motivating the employees to participate, says Micus.

Bananas, acerola, pineapples, mint, parsley, rosemary, and countless more types of fruit, vegetables and herbs will grow here and be harvested when the time comes.\n\nThe gardening project in the city's low-income district is one of many that the NGO provides for approximately 100 street children. Approximately half of them visit CAMM's day care center, the only one in the community. Since 2020, the Symrise Cosmetic Ingredients business unit has supported the project, which hopes to help the children /find an alternative\n\nto living on the street. For example, an environmental educator will teach them about recycling and cultivation in a workshop.\n\n'The earlier we begin working with the youngest ones, the more likely they are to develop in a\n\nhealthy and positive way,' says Symrise brand ambassador Domitila Barros, who herself grew up in a favela in Recife. As a global brand ambassador for CAMM, she advocates in many places for Brazil's street children. For example, her sustainable beach fashion and eco-friendly jewelry label collaborates with local craftswomen from Brazil, many of whom are single mothers who have lost their husbands to violence and crime. 'Our project helps kids be kids again,' says Domitila. 'We're delighted that we are able to expand the CAMM garden together with Symrise. The kids learn so much about our environment and are developing a sense of responsibility also for our planet.'\n\n103",

A small contribution to this is made by using raw materials more fully - for example through upcycling. For Symrise, this includes utilizing natural substances that would otherwise be thrown away or not even considered valuable in food production, for example. Three cross-divisional projects show how.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  Recognizing side streams To completely utilize a raw material, the side streams /first have to be analyzed, then the valuable elements identi/fied and extracted - and should then be put to good use. The Symrise segment Nutrition gets a lot of these side streams from the production of meat (ADF/IDF and Diana Food), /fish and shrimp (Diana Aqua) and fruits and vegetables (Diana Food). Diana Nova, the innovation incubator for the segment, has initially chosen 50 side streams thus eight of them makes up around 80 % of all side streams - such as red beet, celery or carrot pulp, egg or shrimp shells or also chicken bones. The researchers investigated their chemical and nutritional-physiological characteristics and checked whether they were appropriate for upcycling. They also considered possible environmental impacts and business potential.\n\nThe results - eight products up to now - are not only interesting for the food and animal feed industry. The Symrise business unit Cosmetic Ingredients, for example, can use some of them in cosmetics, like a cranberry side stream consisting of pulp and seeds. The antioxidant, calming, antimicrobial and purifying properties of the fruit can help not only from within in the form of juices and powders but also applied externally as elements of creams.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Unusual overlap In the world of perfumery, many of the /finest fragrance ingredients come from nature. Blossoms and other parts of /flowers, trees and plants are processed using age-old techniques into resins and oils. It was only fairly recently that synthetic ingredients increasingly made their way into perfumes. Today, as consumers embrace a healthier lifestyle, they are again looking to the plant world in all aspects of their lives - with the focus on highly sustainable and circular supply chains.\n\nSymrise has always been on the forefront of sustainability. The most recent endeavor is the highly innovative and unique Fine Fragrance 'Garden Lab', created through a cooperation between Nutrition and Scent & Care segments, based on an idea from the company's own perfumery school. The starting point is the in-house developed Symtrap\u2122 technology which processes aqueous phases from vegetable production in France. The remaining highly aromatic liquid, which would usually be disposed of, can be processed in very natural aroma molecules and be utilized in Fragrances.\n\nBecause the project contributed multiple never-before-used ingredients to the fragrance portfolio, many /fine fragrance perfumers needed to experiment with them to discover how they worked in a fragrance formula. They discovered truly amazing results. For instance, a new geranium note was developed from artichokes and will be mixed into soon to be launched women's and men's perfumes; earthy and nutty notes are processed from asparagus; mossy and mineral notes from leek and animalistic notes from cauli/flower; even onion, which most people can't imagine at all in a perfume, is used for a fruity note.\n\n  Developing natural /flavors Food manufacturers use maltodextrin in many products. The mixture of sugar components, which is mostly extracted from cornstarch, has little taste. It functions as an energy source, thickener and carrier for other ingredients. It's also a component in a variety of cosmetics. As they are doing for many other materials, companies in this industry are also looking for alternatives to maltodextrin. In 2015, the Flavor segment at Symrise and a major customer from the food industry jointly developed a technology that has been used to process onion pomace - turning the pressed leftovers of the sweet and spicy vegetable into a natural carrier of its /flavoring components.\n\nThe proprietary technology ensures that the byproduct from the onion process is used e/fficiently. Previously, it was mostly used as natural fertilizer. At the same time, the technology enables to develop wholly natural taste solutions that also make clean label possible, as there is no need any more to add maltodextrins as a carrier for /flavor. At the moment, the Flavor team is working on trying out other vegetables for these purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n105",

We have set ambitious goals for ourselves in this area. As of 2030, we expect our company to be climate positive. There is a clear action plan for how we want to achieve this. Since 2020, we have already been sourcing 100% of our electricity from renewable sources. By 2025 we also aim to increase the eco-e/fficiency of our greenhouse gas emissions by more than 60% compared to 2010. The sustainability team is vigorously pursuing this initiative. In addition, the focus is on preserving biodiversity. Symrise is a company that depends heav ily on nature. We use natural substances from all parts of the world and from a wide variety of climate zones. We must protect our nature, and we want to make our contribution.\n\n## What is the commitment of Symrise to sustainability?\n\n  We want to produce evidence that our measures work instead of sugarcoating them. Take the climate target for 2030. We were the 61 st company worldwide and in Germany one of the /first three companies to receive a scienti/fically tested ScienceBased Target. We were among the /first ten companies in Germany to join the Science Based Targets initiative. In addition, we continue to align ourselves closely with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and to report on our annual progress. Since 2018, Symrise has also been one of the now over 1,700 companies all over the world that supports the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Accordingly, we report climate-related facts, /figures and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndata in our Sustainability Record and also refer to the covered reporting requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\n\nWe have divided the sustainability aspects of Symrise into four thematic blocks: environmental protection (Footprint), employees and society (Care), raw material sourcing (Sourcing) and sustainable innovations (Innovation). They form the framework that we are required by law to certify every year. The Symrise Supervisory Board is responsible for these non-/financial indicators. This involves a great deal of transparency for a listed company.\n\nOur commitment to sustainability is based on the four pillars of environmental protection (Footprint), sustainable innovation (Innovation), raw material sourcing (Sourcing) and employees and society (Care).

Symrise is expressly committed to respecting these rights: see our position paper on human rights and ethical sourcing and the declaration on human tra/fficking and slavery. Our suppliers must sign a code of conduct for this purpose, which includes factors such as human rights, the environment, health and safety, and integrity, in addition to transparent disclosures on the source of raw materials. As a member of SEDEX, we are able to evaluate the performance of our key suppliers according to these factors and additional ethical criteria.

Every day, our employees and partners around the world create the basis for new, sustainably successful products and consumption patterns through the productive use of environmentally friendly chemistry and new technologies, as well as resourcee/fficient manufacturing. The Product Sustainability Scorecard illustrates this progress. Diversity in our teams, equal treatment and equal participation of our employees are a matter of course for us - for example, through gender-independent remuneration. The integrated management system of our HR policy is based on the requirements of the Group-wide binding Social Accountability 8000 (SA 8000) standard, which is based on the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In order to exemplify equal opportunities in a prominent position, we set the goal of increasing the proportion of women at the /first global management level below the Executive Board to at least 30 % by 2025, and at the second global management level to at least 45 %.

In the alliance, a total of 33 companies and organizations are campaigning for binding human rights due diligence requirements for companies along their supply chains - and thus for greater legal certainty and a level playing /field that goes beyond voluntary initiatives.

For their sourcing, an environment rich in species is just as important as a trusting relationship with local communities and small-scale farmers - this is particularly evident in times of crisis. We promote both in cooperation with nonpro/fit organizations and through close exchange with our partners and local communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Resilient supply chains as an investment\n\n  The coronavirus pandemic has put global supply chains to the test and made us aware of the importance of resilience and crisis security. Capital management company Union Investment recognized this relevance early on. 'We are always interested in long-term investments. In this respect, Symrise is the right choice for us,' explains Arne Rautenberg, portfolio manager for equities at Union Investment. When it comes to investment decisions, the three factors of environmental, social and responsible corporate governance (ESG) are playing an increasingly important role.\n\n' At Symrise, sourcing is central - the supply chain is where the main ESG footprint lies.'\n\nARNE RAUTENBERG, Portfolio Manager at Union Investment\n\nRautenberg expects ESG factors to continue to grow in importance in the future. 'The impact of the coronavirus pandemic reinforces this trend,' says Rautenberg. The pandemic accelerated trends such as digitalization or responsible consumption and underscored the importance of crisis-proof supply chains. Symrise is also placing an important focus on improving conditions in raw material sourcing. 'In the future, the company wants to analyze 100 % of its suppliers according to sustainability criteria. We welcome this goal.' Nevertheless, Rautenberg sees a need for further action: 'We would like Symrise to make even greater use of its good partnerships with suppliers to improve their sustainability performance.' After all, dialogue and joint e/fforts could lead to long-term improvements that bene/fit all sides.",

The nonpro/fit organization promotes sourcing that treats people and biodiversity with respect. Together with UEBT, Symrise works to make its supply chain environmentally and socially sustainable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nquestions for Maria Julia Oliva, Deputy Director and Senior Coordinator for ABS and Policy at UEBT.\n\nWhat challenges do companies like Symrise face with regard to biodiversity in their supply chains?\n\n3\n\n  Consumer demand for natural raw materials is growing - but biodiversity loss is a/ffecting their availability. Long-term and transparent partnerships with suppliers are crucial. The activities of Symrise in Madagascar are a good example: Combining research with close relationships with local people, the company is working to improve conditions in vanilla cultivation. Such initiatives are important, even if they require time, resources and a strong commitment from management.\n\n## What role do social aspects play here?\n\n  The social and environmental conditions in supply chains are directly linked - people are part of biodiversity! At UEBT, we work with our members to preserve and regenerate nature through the ethical sourcing of natural ingredients, ensuring a better future for us humans. This includes fair prices for local suppliers, respect for human rights, support for local development and working conditions along the supply chain. This holistic approach is central to addressing the challenges.\n\n## Where do you see further need for action for Symrise?\n\n  In light of the biodiversity crisis, more needs to be done faster and Symrise is no exception. More attention needs to be paid to biodiversity, regenerative practices and living wages and incomes in the myriad supply chains around the world. We are pleased to support Symrise on this journey.",

To achieve this, Symrise employees are applying innovative approaches to solutions and continuously developing them further.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The circular economy in aquaculture\n\n  Alongside oil and bananas, shrimp are one of Ecuador's most important export products. Since some buyers want the shrimp without the head and shell, the animals are peeled directly after being caught in the factories on site. This results in over 5 tons of shrimp waste each month. 'These waste materials were a big problem for the industry until a few years ago,' says Hiroshi Ozeki, head of the Business Unit Aqua for the Latin and North America regions. 'It frequently ended up on surrounding /fields.' An environmentally friendly solution was needed.\n\n'We saw these catch leftovers as more of an opportunity than a problem,' says Ozeki. The shrimp heads are particularly rich in nutrients. The experts in the\n\nBusiness Unit Aqua thus developed a process to produce a high-quality ingredient for /fish feed from the shrimp waste. The result: the nutritious powder Actipal HP 1. It maintains the health of /fish, has a long shelf life and is easy to transport - ideal for the needs of /fish feed producers.\n\nEspecially in commercial farming, Actipal HP 1 has clear bene/fits: Due to its high nutritional value, /fish farmers need fewer wild /fish as feed. The ingredient in the feed pellets attracts the animals and they ingest the feed before it can sink to the bottom and become an environmental burden. Hiroshi Ozeki is convinced: 'With Actipal HP 1, we are helping to make commercial /fish farming more sustainable in the long term.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are multiple reasons for this: 'For about ten years now, awareness of healthy eating has been growing in Western countries,' explains Renaud Allaire, the Global Account Director at Symrise. At the same time, awareness for animal welfare has also increased. 'And as a third point, concern has been growing for several years about the impact of livestock farming on global warming,' says Allaire.\n\nTo achieve a higher acceptance of plant-based milk alternatives in the broader population the taste must be just right. 'I often hear the prejudice that plant-based milk alternatives don't taste good. That is completely incorrect. Many people in Europe and the USA like almond milk, as well as drinks made from nuts or cereals,' says Allaire. In the Asia/Paci/fic region rice drinks are very popular.\n\nIn addition to the interaction between /flavor and source material, Symrise can also in/fluence the perception of the product in the mouth - by blocking receptors of unwanted taste tones. We have also succeeded in applying this process to neuroreceptors in the brain that in/fluence the intensity of taste experiences. 'This is, so to speak, the magic of our industry,' says Allaire. The goal is it to impress not only vegans but also /flexitarians when it comes to plant-based alternatives. The perfect /flavor alone is not enough what counts is the overall experience of a food. Moreover, the price must be reasonable and the supply chain sustainable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' For the past decade or so, awareness of healthy eating has been growing in Western countries.'\n\nRENAUD ALLAIRE, Global Account Director at Symrise\n\n125\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' With Actipal HP 1, we are helping to make commercial /fish farming more sustainable in the long term.'\n\nHIROSHI OZEKI,\n\nHead of Business Unit Aqua for Latin and North America",

As a result, the public-private partnership has enabled \u20ac 4.5 million in programmatic investments.\n\nThe program focuses on reducing the water footprint in the growing areas and increasing yields and thus farmers' incomes. 'We also work closely with women in Uttar Pradesh to build their con/fidence through /financial literacy.

So WhatsApp videos, phone calls and text messages became the new normal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Lutsch, how do you and your team know consumers' preferences?\n\n  To identify developments early on and properly understand consumers, we regularly conduct tastings, surveys and trend studies. Based on the results, we follow a standardized process: Product development is adjusted accordingly and new, needs-oriented solutions are developed.\n\n## What do consumers actually look for when choosing products?\n\n  We were able to identify three core drivers that are particularly important to consumers: taste, price and brand. But sustainability aspects are also signi/ficant when it comes to the popularity of a product. However, how important these are rated depends heavily on the product category, the market and the individual consumer. In the future, the sustainability component will probably move from the niche into the mainstream - if it tastes good and the price is right.\n\n## What impact is the coronavirus pandemic having on consumer preferences?\n\n  Changing consumption patterns can already be observed. Many people have a need for safety and health right now. This drives the trend toward increased consumption of regional products, alternative proteins and natural foods.",
