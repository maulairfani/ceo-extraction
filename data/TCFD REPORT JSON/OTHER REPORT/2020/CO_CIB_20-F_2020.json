These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent only the Bank's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside the Bank's control. The words 'anticipate', 'believe', 'estimate', 'expect', 'intend', 'plan', 'predict', 'target', 'forecast', 'guideline', 'should', 'project' and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. It is possible that the Bank's actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nInformation regarding important factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those in the Bank's  forward-looking  statements  appear  in  a  number  of  places  in  this  Annual  Report,  principally  in  Item  3.  'Key Information - D. Risk Factors' and Item 5. 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects'. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) changes in general economic, business, political, social, fiscal or other conditions in Colombia, or in any  of  the  other  countries  where  the  Bank  operates  such  as  continuing  or  deepening  recessions  and  fluctuations  in employment and the credit worthiness of customers beyond those taken into account in our estimates of expected credit losses, including, without limitation, those affected by COVID-19; the COVID-19 pandemic which is expected to continue to have adverse effects on our revenues due to lower levels of lending, lower interest rates, and generally the potential for material adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations, liquidity and  capital; deviations from economic assumptions that form the basis for our expected credit losses calculations (including, without limitation, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic); (ii) changes in capital markets or in markets in general that may affect policies or attitudes towards lending;  (iii)  unanticipated  increases  in  financing  and  other  costs  or  the  inability  to  obtain  additional  debt  or  equity financing on attractive terms; (iv) inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and/or interest rates; (v) sovereign risks; (vi) liquidity risks; (vii) increases in delinquencies by the Bank's borrowers; (viii) lack of acceptance of new products or services  by  the  Bank's  targeted  customers;  (ix)  competition  in  the  banking,  financial  services,  credit  card  services, insurance,  asset  management,  remittances,  business  and  other  industries  in  which  the  Bank  operates;  (x)  adverse determination of legal or regulatory disputes or proceedings and the consequences thereof (including without limitations, actions taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic); (xi) changes in official policies and regulations and the Colombian government's banking policy as well as changes in laws, regulations or policies in other jurisdictions in which the Bank does business; and (xii) the negative impact on operations and financial results of the Bank resulting from widespread health emergencies, infectious diseases or pandemics, such as COVID-19; (xiii) factors specific to the Bank, including changes to the estimates and assumptions underlying our financial statements; our success in identifying risks (such as the incidence of loan delinquencies) and managing risks; our ability to achieve our financial and capital targets which may result in our failure to achieve any of the expected benefits of our strategies; model limitations or failures including, without limitation, the impact that COVID -19 may have on the performance and utilization of our models which may require us to establish additional loan loss reserves or raise additional capital; a reduction in our credit ratings, which would decrease our funding availabilty; failure to achieve regulatory stress testing; and changes to the reliability and security of our data",

In addition, the Bank's policies and procedures may not be able to detect money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption or other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis.\n- \u00b7 The Bank is subject to increasing competition which may adversely affect its results of operations.\n- \u00b7 Discontinuation of the London InterBank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') could adversely affect the Bank.\n\n## Summary of risks relating to the Banks's preferred shares and the ADSs.\n\n- \u00b7 Preemptive rights may not be available to holders of American Depositary Receipts ('ADRs') evidencing ADSs.\n- \u00b7 The Bank's preferred shares have limited voting rights.\n- \u00b7 Holders of the Bank's ADRs may encounter difficulties in the exercise of dividend and voting rights.\n- \u00b7 Relative illiquidity of the Colombian securities markets may impair the ability of an ADR holder to sell preferred shares.\n- \u00b7 Changes in Colombia's tax regime may affect ADRs tax treatment.\n\n## Risk Factors Relating to Colombia and Other Countries Where the Bank Operates\n\nChanges  in  economic  and  political  conditions  in  Colombia,  Panama,  El  Salvador  and  Guatemala  or  in  other countries where the Bank operates may adversely affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Bank's financial condition, results of operations and asset quality are significantly dependent on the macroeconomic and political conditions prevailing in Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala and the other jurisdictions where the Bank operates. Accordingly, decreases in the growth rate, periods of negative growth, increases in inflation, changes in policy,  or  future  judicial  interpretations  of  policies  involving  exchange  controls  and  other  matters  such  as  currency depreciation, inflation, interest rates, taxation, banking laws and regulations and other political or economic developments in such jurisdictions may affect the overall business environment and may in turn negatively affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn particular, the governments of Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala have historically exercised substantial influence on their economies, and they are likely to continue to implement policies that will have an important impact on the business and results of operations of companies in such countries (including the Bank), market conditions, and prices and rates of return on securities of local issuers (including the Bank's securities). Potential changes in laws, public policies and regulations may cause instability and volatility in Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala, and their respective markets. Future developments in government policies could negatively affect the Bank's business and financial condition and the market value of its securities.\n\nColombia and Panama currently have investment grade credit ratings from international rating agencies;  El Salvador and Guatemala do not. As of the date of this Annual Report, El Salvador has a long-term debt rating B- from Fitch, B3 from Moody's, and B- by S&P. Guatemala has ratings of BB- from Fitch, Ba1 from Moody's and BB- S&P. Downgrades in the ratings of either country, or the failure of Colombia or Panama to maintain investment grade credit ratings, could increase the Bank's funding costs and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.",

        "page_content": "The economies of the countries in which the Bank operates are vulnerable to external effects that could be caused by  significant  economic  difficulties  experienced  by  their  major  regional  trading  partners  or  by  more  general contagion effects, which could have a material adverse effect on economic growth in these countries and their ability to service their public debt.\n\nA significant decline in economic growth or a sustained economic downturn of any of Colombia, Panama, El Salvador or Guatemala's major trading partners (i.e., the European Union, the United States, China and other Latin American countries for Colombia and the United States and European Union for Panama, Guatemala and El Salvador) could have a material adverse impact on Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala's balance of trade and remittances inflows, resulting in lower economic growth.\n\nDeterioration in the economic and political situation in neighboring countries could adversely affect the economy and cause  instability  in  Colombia,  Panama,  El  Salvador  and  Guatemala  by  disrupting  their  diplomatic  or  commercial relationships with neighboring countries. Any future tensions may cause political and economic uncertainty, instability, market volatility, low confidence levels and higher risk aversion by investors and market participants that may negatively affect economic activity in any of those jurisdictions.\n\nEvents  occurring  in  a  market  where  we  do  not  operate  may  cause  international  investors  to  have  an  increased  risk perception of an entire region or class of investment, which could in turn negatively affect market prices and liquidity of securities issued or owned by the Bank.\n\n## Any additional taxes resulting from changes to tax regulations or the interpretation thereof in Colombia, Panama, El  Salvador,  Guatemala  or  other  countries  in  where  the  Bank  operates,  could  adversely  affect  the  Bank's consolidated results.\n\nUncertainty  related  to  tax  legislation  represents  a  constant  risk  for  us.  Changes  in  legislation  and  regulation  and developments resulting from judicial decisions could affect tax burdens by increasing tax rates and fees, creating new taxes,  limiting  deductions  and  exemptions,  and  eliminating  incentives  and  non-taxed  income.  The  Colombian  and Salvadorian governments have significant fiscal deficits that could result in future tax increases.\n\nOn April 15 th 2021, the Colombian Government submitted a new tax reform bill to be discussed and approved by the Colombian Congress. Given that the bill has been recently submitted and is yet to be debated and approved by Congress, the effects of the proposed measures are yet to be determined.\n\nMoreover, since the bill is required to be subjected to a number of debates in Congress before its approval, we can not dismiss the possibility of changes to the measures originally proposed or the inclusion of new measures which could have a significant impact on our operations, our clients and shareholders. The aforementioned measures could include, amongst others, a surcharge for income tax which could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow, or an increase in taxes for security holders such as the Bank's shareholders.\n\nIn addition, national or local taxing authorities may not interpret tax regulations in the same way as we do, even though the Bank does not normally adopt aggressive positions on tax law interpretation. Different interpretations of tax regulations could result in future tax audits, litigation and associated costs, which could affect our results.\n\n## Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the Colombian economy, the market price of the Bank's ADSs, and the dividends payable to holders of the Bank's ADSs.\n\nColombia has adopted a floating exchange rate system. The Central Bank maintains the power to intervene in the exchange market in order to consolidate or dispose of international reserves, and to control any volatility in the exchange rate. From time to time, including during 2020, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Colombian peso and the U.S. dollar. Unforeseen events in the international markets, fluctuations in interest rates, volatility of the oil price in the international markets, or changes in capital flows, may cause exchange rate instability that could generate sharp movements in the value of the peso. Because a portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in, or indexed to, foreign currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, sharp movements in exchange rates may negatively impact our results.",

Despite the peace treaty between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ('Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia or FARC'), a lasting decrease in violence or drug-related crime in Colombia or the successful integration of former guerilla members into Colombian society, may not be achieved. In 2018, the Colombian government suspended the peace negotiations with the National Liberation Army ('Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional' or 'ELN') and in 2019, a minority group of dissidents within FARC announced their return to illegal activities. An escalation of violence or drug-related crime may have a negative impact on the Colombian economy and on us.\n\n## Allegations of corruption against the government, politicians and private industry in the countries where we operate could create economic and political uncertainty and could expose us to additional credit risk.\n\nAllegations of corruption against the government, politicians and private industry in the countries where we operate could create economic and political uncertainty specially, if the investigations triggered by these cases reach conviction or result in  further  allegations  or  findings  of  illicit  conduct  committed  by  the  accused  parties.  Furthermore,  proven  or  alleged wrongdoings could have adverse effects on the political and economic stability in such countries. These adverse political and economic effects may negatively impact our business, including by depressing business volumes, reducing our ability to recover amounts we have loaned to persons or projects involved in illicit or allegedly illicit conduct and/or harming our reputation.\n\n## Risk Factors relating to the Bank's Business and the Banking Industry\n\n## Our financial results may be negatively affected by changes to accounting standards.\n\nWe  report  our  results  and  financial  position  in  accordance  with  IFRS  as  issued  by  the  IASB.  Changes  to  IFRS  or interpretations thereof may cause our future reported results and financial position to differ from current expectations. Such changes may also affect our regulatory capital and financial ratios. We monitor potential accounting changes and when possible, we determine their potential impact and disclose significant future changes in our financial statements that we expect as a result of those changes. Currently, there are not a number of issued but not yet effective IFRS changes, that could be expected to impact our reported results, financial position and regulatory capital in the next several years. For further information about developments in financial accounting and reporting standards, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Significant Accounting Policies'.\n\n## Our financial results may be negatively affected by changes to assumptions supporting the value of our goodwill.\n\nWe test for impairment at least annually the goodwill that we have recognized with respect to the financial positions of our operating segments. Our impairment test in respect of the assets recognized as of December 31, 2020 indicated that our goodwill balances are not impaired. The impairment test requires that we make assumptions regarding estimated earnings, discount rates and long-term growth rates impacting the recoverable amount of the goodwill associated with each operating segment and on estimates of the carrying amounts of the operating segments to which the goodwill relates. If the actual results in future periods deviate from the earnings and other assumptions on which our impairment testing is based, the value of the goodwill in any one or more of our businesses may become impaired in the future, resulting in charges to income.\n\nThe  outbreak  of  COVID-19  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  triggered  exceptional  volatility  in  the  financial  markets. Accordingly, in connection with its evaluation of economic budgets, forecasts and other assumptions commonly used to determine  the  recoverable  value  of  non-financial  long-lived  assets,  the  Bank  considered  various  macroeconomic circumstances and ran multiple weighted scenarios for assessing the expected future cash flows for each cash-generating unit ('CGUs') and took into consideration the impact of COVID-19. However, depending on the time it takes for economic",

For further information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 'Significant Accounting Policies'. We cannot predict what developments may arise in the future that may cause our assumptions to be affected.\n\n## Our financial results may be negatively affected by macroeconomic and other challenges and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe  COVID-19 pandemic has affected all  of  the  regions and  countries  where  the  Bank  operates.  The  pandemic  and responses to it have had, and will likely continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions, although the impacts will likely vary from time to time by region or country, largely depending on the duration and severity of the public health consequences, including availability of effective vaccines.\n\nIn responding to these challenges, the Bank has taken prudential measures to determine whether (a) uncertainties regarding the ability to continue generating revenues from commissions and contracts with customers has occurred, (b) going concern considerations have arisen in relation to liquidity, regulatory capital requirements and concentrations of market risk, (c) fair  value adjustments are necessary for financial instruments, (d) the impact of changes in loan terms agreed to with customers were significant, (e) significant increase in credit risk (SICR) had occurred for its financial assets, and (f) any impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and long-lived assets is warranted, performing interim impairment test for all CGUs.\n\nThe extent of the impact on the Bank's financial performance and operations, including its ability to execute its business initiatives and strategies, will continue to depend on future developments in Colombia and the other countries where the Bank  operates,  including  with  respect  to  the  further  spread  of  COVID-19,  the  availability  of  effective  vaccines,  the measures adopted by governments in order to prevent the spread of the virus, the speed at which economies may recover, the fiscal and monetary policies adopted by governments, among others, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\nThe Bank could face additional  challenges  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  including  legal  and  reputational, increase in the level of customer complaints due to service deficiencies caused by isolation measures and scrutiny regarding the  implementation  of  its  initiatives  to  provide  relief  to  clients  affected  by  the  pandemic.  Further,  any  disruption  to, breaches of or attacks on the Bank's information technology systems, including from cyber incidents, could have adverse effects on the Bank's businesses. These systems are supporting a substantial portion of the Bank's employees who have been affected by local pandemic restrictions and have been forced to work remotely.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on the Bank's borrowers will also vary by region, sector and industry, with some borrowers experiencing greater stress  levels,  which  could  lead  to  increased  pressure  on  their  results  of  operations  and  financial condition, increased borrowings or credit ratings downgrades, thus likely leading to higher credit costs for the Bank. In addition,  stress  levels  ultimately  experienced  by  the  Bank's  borrowers  may  be  different  from  and  more  intense  than assumptions made in earlier estimates or models used by the Bank, resulting in a further increase in the Bank's allowance for credit losses or net credit losses.\n\nThe  post-pandemic  environment  may  undergo  unexpected  developments  or  changes  in  financial  markets,  the  fiscal, monetary, tax and regulatory environments and consumer and corporate customer behaviors. These developments and changes could have an adverse impact on the Bank's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFor further information about the current impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's performance and financial position as of December 31, 2020, see Note 2 'Significant Accounting Policies' and Note 31 \"Risk management\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Changes in banking laws and regulations in Colombia and in other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates could adversely affect the Bank's consolidated results.\n\nBanking laws and regulations, or their official interpretation, in Colombia and in other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates,  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Bank's  business  and  operations . Banking  laws  and  regulations  may  change frequently, and changes may be adopted, enforced or interpreted in a manner that may have an adverse effect on the Bank's",

As a result of the social and economic hardship generated by the pandemic, the political climate in the region could  result  in  populism  and  instability  that  may  support  further  regulation  to  financial  institutions.  In  addition,  the increasing tendency towards the enhancement of financial consumer protection standards among legislators, regulators and courts, could result in additional costs for our operations.\n\nThe Colombian Government presented to Congress an initiative to amend certain laws that regulate capital markets, and licenses and authorized activities for its participants. Also, this iniative includes broad capacities to the Government to regulate  capital  markets,  which  could  lead  to  increased  uncertainty  of  possible  changes  in  the  future.  Although  this initiative has not been discussed by Congress yet, the enactment of this reform could have an impact on the way we do business.\n\nFurthermore, there is a trend in banking laws and regulations to authorize flexible modular licencing to financial entities whose services could compete with the segments or services offered by the Bank,  which, in turn, could lead to lower margins for affected products and services and could adversely affect the Bank's results of operations.\n\nThe Bank is subject to regulatory inspections, examinations, inquiries or audits in Colombia and in other countries where it operates, and any sanctions, fines and other penalties resulting from such inspections, examinations, inquiries or audits could materially and adversely affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\n\nThe Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by the banking authorities of Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala and the other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates or is an issuer. These Banking authorities have broad powers to adopt regulations and impose other requirements affecting or restricting virtually all aspects of the Bank's capitalization, organization and operations, including the imposition of anti-money laundering measures and the authority to regulate the terms and conditions on which the banks can extend credit. In the event of non-compliance with applicable regulations, the Bank could be subject to fines, sanctions or the revocation of licenses or permits to operate its business. In Colombia, for instance, if the Bank encounters significant financial problems or becomes insolvent or in danger of becoming insolvent, banking authorities would have the power to take over the Bank's management and operations. Any sanctions, fines and other penalties resulting from non-compliance with regulations in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama and other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates could materially and adversely affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\n\n## An increase in constitutional public interest actions ( acciones populares ) or class actions ( acciones de grupo ) may affect the Bank's businesses and results of operations.\n\nUnder the Colombian constitution, individuals may initiate constitutional public interest or class actions to protect their collective  or  class  rights,  respectively.  Colombian  financial  institutions,  including  the  Bank,  have  experienced  a  high number of these actions. The great majority of such actions have been related to fees, financial services and interest rates, and their outcome is uncertain. Pursuant to Law 1425 of 2010, monetary awards for plaintiffs in constitutional actions or class actions were eliminated as of January 1, 2011. Nevertheless, individuals continue to have the right to initiate these actions against the Bank.\n\n## Future restrictions on interest rates or banking fees could negatively affect the Bank's profitability.\n\nIn prior years, the legislature of the jurisdictions in which the Bank operates have considered various legislative and/or regulatory initiatives regarding banking fees. Although most of such initiatives have not been adopted in the past, there might be renewed attempts to impose restrictions on banking fees in the future. If we are prohibited or otherwise limited (including by limits with respect to pricing) from continuing to charge our clients for certain products or services, including specified types of transactions, or from imposing charges for products or services that might be introduced in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.",

Twenty out of the 37 territories have signed  the  convention  on  mutual  administrative  assistance  in  tax  matters.  Additionally,  10  territories  carried  out  an effective  exchange  of  information  with  Colombia  as  of  December  31,  2018  (Resolution  91  of  2019  Colombian  tax authority).\n\nAs a result of the tax haven regulation, the Bank's clients who are residents in the 37 territories would be subject to a higher withholding tax rate on interest and dividends derived from investments in the Colombian securities market (nondeductibility of payments made to such residents or entities located in tax havens could proceed unless the required tax amount has been withheld).\n\nSimilarly, the tax haven regulation states that these types of transactions are subject to the transfer pricing regime. As a result, the Bank must file a transfer pricing report and an informative report for each such transactions, regardless of the threshold. Additional information disclosure requirements for transactions with related companies could be requested by the tax authorities, any of which could have a negative impact on Bancolombia's business and financial results due to the disallowance of certain costs and expenses.\n\nAdditionally, these transactions could increase the probability of a tax audit by the Colombian authorities.\n\nOn the other hand, in order to avoid Panama's designation as a tax haven, Colombia and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding which states that both countries will negotiate a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation. This treaty is  expected  to  include  provisions  regarding  the  exchange  of  information  between  Colombian  and  Panamanian  tax authorities.\n\nAdditionally, based on the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement, Panama enacted in 2019 an internal decree which sets forth that financial institutions are required to send information to the tax authorities in order to be shared with the Colombian government.\n\n## The Bank and most of its Subsidiaries are subject to the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 and the OECD's Automatic Exchange of Information - Common Reporting Standard (CRS).\n\nBancolombia and most of its subsidiaries are considered foreign financial institutions ('FFIs') under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 ('FATCA') (see 'Item 4. Information on the Company  - B. Business Overview - B.8. Supervision and Regulation - International regulations applicable to Bancolombia and its subsidiaries'). Additionally, Bancolombia  and  some  of  its  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  the  reporting  obligations  derived  from  the  conventions  that implement the Common Reporting Standard ('CRS') approved by the OECD.\n\nGiven the size and the scope of the Bank's international operations, we have taken measures and implemented procedures aimed at complying with FATCA and CRS, including transmitting to the relevant authorities the reports required under FATCA and CRS.\n\nHowever, if the Bank cannot satisfy the requirements thereunder, certain payments to Bancolombia, or its Subsidiaries, may be subject to withholding under FATCA or other penalties imposed by each government. The possibility of such withholding or penalties and the need for accountholders and investors to provide certain information may discourage some customers or potential customers from banking with us, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations and financial  condition.  In  addition,  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  intergovernmental  agreements  ('IGA'),  particular agreements entered into with the IRS, the international conventions signed for the exchange of information under CRS, the laws or any other regulations enforced in the relevant jurisdictions may increase our compliance costs. Legislation and regulations  implementing  FATCA  and  CRS  in  some  of  the  countries  in  which  the  Bank  operates  remain  under development, and the reporting dates vary depending on the jurisdiction.",

These services  include  online  banking  platforms,  data  processing  and  payment  services,  clearing  and  settlement  services, software for processing credit and debit card services, and technological infrastructure, among others. The Bank faces the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on such third-party vendors for certain components of its systems.\n\nWhile  the  Bank  conducts  due  diligence  prior  to  engaging  with  third  party  service  providers  and  performs  ongoing monitoring of vendor controls, it does not control their operations. If any of our key service providers fails to fulfill any of their contractual obligations or cause disruptions in services (including as a result of a cyberattack, other information security event or a natural or health disaster (such as COVID-19 or other epidemics), failure to handle current or higher volumes, poor performance of services and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations), the Bank's ability to conduct its businesses could be adversely affected and could also negatively impact its results of operations and financial position.  In  addition,  the  Bank  may  be  required  to  incur  significant  additional  costs  to  find  replacement  providers. Furthermore, the unavailability of the services provided by some technology vendors could result in the unavailability of certain channels through which our clients execute transactions with us until a replacement provider is engaged, which could result in lost revenue, additional costs and, potentially, adverse regulatory consequences and reputational harm.\n\nThe Bank has a robust vendor selection process designed to ensure that the service providers appointed are among the most experienced and qualified available in the market. The Bank also, generally requires that service providers have contingency plans, which must be regularly updated to anticipate, identify, and mitigate these potential risks. In addition, in most cases, when contracting a critical service provider, in accordance with applicable regulation, the Bank seeks to include contractual provisions related to SLAs (service level agreements), penalty clauses and insurances to deter the service providers from failing to comply with their contractual obligations.\n\nNotwithstanding the measures described above, the Bank may not be able to prevent all significant negative consequences in case of a material failure of its key service providers.\n\n## The Bank is subject to credit risk and estimating exposure to credit risk involves subjective and complex judgments.\n\nA number of our products expose the Bank to credit risk. These products include loans, financial leases, guarantees and lending commitments.\n\nThe Bank estimates and establishes reserves for credit risk and potential credit losses. This process involves subjective and complex judgments, including projections of economic conditions and assumptions about the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. This process is also subject to human error as the Bank's employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit risk rating to a client, which may result in the Bank's exposure to a higher credit risk than one indicated by the Bank's risk rating system. The Bank may not be able to timely detect these risks before they occur, or due to limited resources  or  available  infrastructure,  the  Bank's  employees  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  implement  its  credit  risk management system, which may increase the Bank's exposure to credit risk. Moreover, the Bank's failure to continuously refine its credit risk management system may result in a higher risk exposure for the Bank, which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.\n\nOverall, if the Bank is unable to effectively control the level of non-performing or poor credit quality loans in the future, or  if  its  loan  loss  reserves  are  insufficient  to  cover  future  loan  losses,  the  Bank's  financial  condition  and  results  of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe amount of the Bank's non-performing loans may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond the Bank's control, such as changes in the income levels of the Bank's borrowers, increases in the inflation rate or an increase in interest rates, the impact of macroeconomic trends and political events affecting Colombia and other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates or has exposure (especially Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala) or events affecting specific industries.

The use of these models brings benefits such as objectivity, automation and efficiency. but also entails costs related to the resources required for their development as well as heightened risks.\n\nThe heightened risks arise from three fundamental sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Data deficiencies in both availability and quality.\n- \u00b7 Methodological errors in the design of the model such as volatility in the estimates, inadequate simplifications or approximations, erroneous hypotheses and incorrect design.\n- \u00b7 The inappropriate use of the model which may include the application outside of its intended use, implementation errors, lack of updating or recalibration.\n\nThe  use  of  inadequate  models  could  negatively  impact  the  analysis  of  decisions  concerning  business  strategies,  risk identification and measurement, positions valuation, performance of stress tests, capital adequacy evaluation, customer asset  management,  internal  limits  compliance  or  compliance  of  financial  or  regulatory  information  requirements  and issuance of public information.\n\n## The Bank is subject to credit risk with respect to its non-traditional banking businesses including investing in securities and entering into derivatives transactions.\n\nNon-traditional sources of credit risk can arise from, among other things: investing in securities, entering into derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to the Bank, and executing securities, futures, currency or commodity trades from the Bank's proprietary trading desk that fail to settle at the required time due to nondelivery  by  the  counterparty  or  systems  failure  by  clearing  agents,  exchanges,  clearing  houses  or  other  financial intermediaries. Any significant increases in exposure to any of these non-traditional risks, or a significant decline in the credit quality or the insolvency of any of the counterparties, could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank is exposed to risks associated with the mortgage loan market, as a result of the value of the collaterals.\n\nThe Bank is a significant participant in the mortgage loan markets in which it operates. Colombia's mortgage loan market is highly regulated and has historically been affected by macroeconomic factors, as well as the mortgage loan markets of Panama,  Guatemala  and  El  Salvador.  During  2020,  the  loan  portfolio  quality  was  impacted  as  a  result  of  the implementation of financial relief strategies implemented by governments in the countries where we operate. In addition, mortgage loan portfolio has also been impacted by the value on collaterals accepted as securities for loans, considering the current market conditions and subsequent fluctuations as result of COVD-19 pandemic.\n\n## The Bank is subject to concentration of default risks in its loan portfolio. Problems with one or more of its largest borrowers may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Bank's 20 largest economic groups, on a consolidated basis, represented 11.6% of the Bank's loan portfolio. No single group exposure represented more than 2% of the loan book. Problems with one or more of the Bank's largest economic groups could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.",

In addition, the Bank may be unable to realize the full value of the collateral or guarantees securing the outstanding principal and interest balance of its loans.\n\nThe Bank's loan collateral primarily includes real estate, assets pledged in financial leasing transactions and other assets that are located primarily in Colombia, El Salvador, Panama and Guatemala, the value of which may significantly fluctuate or  decline  due  to  factors  beyond  the  Bank's  control.  Such  factors  include  market  factors,  environmental  risks, macroeconomic factors and political events affecting the local economy. In addition, the Bank may face difficulties in enforcing its rights as a secured creditor. Timing delays, procedural problems enforcing collateral and local protectionism may make foreclosures on collateral and enforcement of judgments difficult. Any decline in the value of the collateral securing the Bank's loans may result in a reduction in the recovery from collateral realization and may have an adverse impact on the Bank's results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, isn't it known whether the COVID-19 affected the collateral value as well as the processes to update market asset values.\n\n## The Bank is subject to market risk.\n\nThe Bank is directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk, or the risk of losses in positions arising from movements in market prices, is inherent in the products and instruments associated with our operations, including  loans,  deposits,  securities,  bonds,  long-term  debt,  short-term  borrowings,  proprietary  trading  in  assets  and liabilities and derivatives. Changes in market conditions that may affect our financial condition and results of operations include fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, securities prices and changes in the implied volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, among others.\n\n## The Bank's results of operations are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.\n\nThe Bank holds a substantial portfolio of loans and debt instruments that have both fixed and floating interest rates. Therefore,  changes  in  interest  rates  could  adversely  affect  our  net  interest  margins  as  well  as  the  value  of  the  debt instruments. Increases in interest rates may reduce the market value of the Bank's debt instruments, leading to smaller gains or larger losses on these investments. Sustained high interest rates have historically discouraged customers from borrowing and have resulted in increased delinquencies in outstanding loans and deterioration in the quality of assets. On the other hand, decreases in interest rates may cause margin compression and lower net interest income as the Bank usually maintains more assets than liabilities at variable rates. Decreasing interest rates also may trigger loan prepayments which could negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. Generally, in a declining interest rate environment, prepayment activity increases, reducing the weighted average maturity of the Bank's interest earning assets and adversely affecting its operating results. Prepayment risk also has a significant adverse impact on the Bank's earnings from its credit card and collateralized mortgage obligations, since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these portfolios, which may result in a mismatch in funding or in reinvestment of the prepayment proceeds at lower yields. In addition, these risks could significantly impact the Bank's portfolio as well as portfolios managed by the Bank and owned by third parties. To the extent we experience withdrawals of third-party assets, our asset management revenues and related income will be adversely affected.\n\n## The Bank's income from its proprietary trading activities is highly volatile.\n\nThe Bank derives a portion of its profits from its proprietary trading activities. Income from this activity is highly volatile and depends on numerous factors beyond the Bank's control, such as the general market environment, overall market trading activity, interest rate levels, fluctuations in exchange rates oil prices and general market volatility. A significant decline in the Bank's trading income, or the incurrence of a trading loss, could adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\nThe Bank has significant exposure to sovereign risk, and especially Colombian sovereign risk, and the Bank's results could be adversely affected by decreases in the value of its sovereign debt instruments.\n\nThe Bank's debt instruments portfolio is primarily composed of sovereign debt instruments. Therefore, the Bank's results are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risk associated with sovereign debt, in particular risk associated with securities",

As  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Bank's  total  debt  instruments represented  11.33%  of  its  total  assets,  and  45.29%  of  these  securities  were  issued  or  guaranteed  by  the  Colombian Government. A significant decline in the value of the securities issued or guaranteed by the Colombian Government could adversely affect the Bank's debt instruments portfolio and consequently the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank is subject to market, liquidity, operational and structural risks associated with its derivative transactions.\n\nThe Bank enters into derivative transactions for hedging purposes on its own account and on behalf of its customers. The Bank is subject to market, liquidity (due to the difficulty in closing out a trade prior to maturity or if bid-ask spreads are so large, representing a significant cost) and operational risk associated with these transactions, including basis risk (the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost) and credit or  default  risk  (the  risk  of  insolvency  or  other  inability  of  the  counterparty  to  a  particular  transaction  to  perform  its obligations thereunder). In addition, the market practice and documentation for derivative transactions is less developed in the jurisdictions in which the Bank operates as compared to other more economically developed countries, and the court systems in such jurisdictions have limited experience in dealing with issues related to derivative transactions. As a result, there are increased operating and structural risks associated with derivatives transactions in these jurisdictions.\n\nIn addition, the execution and performance of derivatives transactions depend on the Bank's ability to develop adequate control and administrative systems, and to hire and retain qualified personnel. Moreover, the Bank's ability to adequately monitor, analyze and report these derivative transactions depends, to a great extent, on its information technology systems. These factors may further increase the risks associated with these transactions and could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank is subject to operational risks and losses.\n\nThe Bank's businesses are dependent on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risks and losses can result from fraud, employee errors, technological failures and failure to properly document transactions or to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements, breaches of conduct of business rules, equipment failures, natural disasters or the failure of external systems. The Bank has adopted procedures to prevent and manage each of the operational risks, but there can be no assurance that our procedures will be sufficient to prevent losses resulting from these risks.\n\nIn addition, the Bank's businesses are exposed to risk from potential non-compliance with policies, employee misconduct or negligence and fraud, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. In recent years, a number of financial institutions have suffered material losses due to the actions of employees and third parties. The precautions the Bank takes to prevent and detect employee and third-party misconduct may not always be effective.\n\nFor instance, accumulated net economic losses in 2020 increased 82.3% compared to the previous year, mainly due to processes and controls adjustments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that led to greater external fraud, technological incidents and process failures. The increase in external fraud is a consequence of the social and economic crisis caused by COVID-19 and some actions implemented by the Bank in order to facilitate our client virtual transactions and reducing physical operations in branches, such as increasing of transactional amount limits for client operations and reducing the blocking rules by securities alerts in virtual channels.\n\nThe Bank's businesses rely heavily on data collection, processing and storage systems, the failure of which could materially and adversely affect the effectiveness of its risk management, reputation and internal control system as well as its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAll of the Bank's principal businesses are highly dependent on the ability to timely collect and process a large amount of financial and other information at its various branches across numerous markets, at a time when transaction processes have become increasingly complex with increasing volume. The proper functioning of financial control, accounting or other data collection and processing systems is critical to the Bank's businesses and to its ability to compete effectively.",

If the Bank cannot maintain an effective data collection and management system, its business operations, financial condition, reputation and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe Bank is also dependent on information systems to operate its website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. The Bank may experience operational problems with its information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer hackers or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of its systems could cause information, including data related to customer requests and other client information, to be lost, compromised, or to be delivered to the Bank's clients with delays or errors, which could reduce demand for the Bank's services and products, resulting in additional costs for the Bank and potentially fines and penalties by regulators which could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position. To guarantee service continuity,  the  Bank  plans  and  implements  exercises  related  to  business  continuity  and  disaster  recovery  as  well  as cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities' management, according to internal and external control areas requirements. There can be no assurance that these measures will successfully eliminate or substantially mitigate the risk associated with failure of our data collection, processing and storage systems.\n\n## The Bank is subject to cyber-security risk.\n\nThe threat of cyber-attack remains a concern for the Bank, as it does across all the financial sector. Failure to protect the Bank from such an attack may result in losses, disruption for clients or a loss of information. This could undermine the Bank's reputation and its ability to retain clients. The most common cybersecurity threats attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the systems, through malware or unauthorized access, to disrupt our business and/or cause data and financial loss.\n\nThere have been no material cyber-attacks during 2020. However, the risk remains that future cyber-attacks might have a material adverse effect on the Bank's reputation, operations, and financial results.\n\nThe Bank has continued to strengthen its digital services, products and channels to allow customers to execute financial transactions through virtual channels. To make this possible, the Bank uses information technology systems on its own infrastructure, cloud services or third-party providers to receive, process, transmit and store the information assets. Such information assets are the main target of cyber threats which generally target confidential information or the integrity or availability of the systems, which could result in financial losses or regulatory penalties or negatively affect the reputation of the Bank.\n\nThe Bank's management recognizes that the  landscape  of  cyber-attacks  is  constantly  evolving,  and  that  increasingly complex techniques and tools are used by those who perpetrate such attacks. As a result, the Bank constantly invests significant  resources  in  improving  its  physical  and  virtual  security  control  environment  and  has  also  changed  the methodologies to identify, treat and mitigate cybersecurity risks, including the identification of primary threats, technical vulnerabilities, common weaknesses of systems and information assets. With respect to third party vendors, the Bank takes certain actions to mitigate the risks associated with these relationships such as risk assessments, periodic visits, validation of the quality of software developments and data protection, assessments of their control environment and requests for implementation of action plans to mitigate cyber risks. Regardless of such efforts, given, among other factors, the large area of existing attack vectors and the incremental exposure through third parties, it is possible that not all cyber threats can be anticipated.\n\nFor  further  information  see  'ITEM  4.

To mitigate potential failures, and obsolescence risks, and to prevent future threats, the Bank has implemented technological updates, controls and measures, such as enabling alternative channels to guarantee the clients' uninterrupted access to our services.\n\nThe Bank recognizes the importance of having a business continuity management system and accordingly gives high priority to the design of contingency plans to avoid service interruption risks.\n\n## The occurrence of natural or other disasters in the regions in which the Bank operates could impair its ability to conduct business effectively and could impact its results of operations.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to the risk of natural or other disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tropical storms, floods,  wind  and  hurricanes  in  the  regions  where  it  operates.  Although  the  Bank  has  implemented  disaster  recovery systems, in the event of a natural disaster, unanticipated problems could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's ability to conduct business in the affected region, particularly if those problems affect its computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data.\n\nIn addition, if a significant number of the Bank's employees and managers became unavailable due to a natural disaster, the Bank's ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. In addition, the Bank may face added credit risk if its clients that are located in the affected region are not able to make timely payment on outstanding loans or other obligations to the Bank. A natural disaster or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business and results of operations in the affected region.\n\nAs a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, during 2020 the Bank activated its business continuity plan, enabling employees to work from home while allowing the continuity of the operation of critical business processes highlighting the maturity of our continuity plan and the mitigation of possible risks of interruption. However, we cannot assure that other disasters will not impair our operations despite the existence of such business continuity plans, therefore affecting our results of operations.\n\n## The effects generated by climate change could have an effect on the bank's operations, affect the financial situation of clients and cause a deterioration in the quality of the credit portfolio and investments.\n\nClimate change can generate extreme climatic effects in all the countries where the Bank operates. These weather events can lead to disruptions at customer service locations and affect the value of some of the bank's real estate investments. Some adverse weather events may also affect the financial situation of our clients and thereby affect their payment capacity and generate a deterioration in the credit quality of our loan and investment portfolio.\n\nAlso, the Bank finances clients with business across different industries whose operations can contribute negatively to climate change. Although the Bank has been making risk appetite decisions aimed at modifying its financing model in these industries, a possible impact on the business models of these clients may affect their financial situation and the credit quality of the credit and investment portfolio and affect our reputation.\n\n## The Bank's ability to attract and retain specialized talent could impact some digital business objectives.\n\nThe current economic landscape requires workforces to exhibit new skills and attributes such as creativity, innovation and flexibility, which are necessary to adapt the Bank's operations to constant technological advances, and to update the Bank's digital business models and strategies to develop new products and services. To respond to these trends, many companies, including financial institutions as the Bank, are struggling to engage employees with specialized knowledge in a variety of technological information areas, including data science, quantitative resources, information security and other technical areas, in which it is becoming more difficult to acquire and retain staff on a cost-effective basis.",

Specifically, the development of new products, services and digital tools demands that its human talent specialized capabilities to carry out the relevant process, enabling to achieve competitive advantages with respect to its competitors.\n\nWhile  the  Bank  has  implemented  strategies  to  attract  and  retain  experienced  and  skilled  professionals,  the  lack  of specialized workforce to fill positions that require this kind of knowledge in various areas could negatively affect the Bank's ability to deal with future challenges, slow the digital business strategy execution, including development of new products and affect the Bank's results of operation.\n\n## Digital misinformation could adversely affect the Bank's reputation as well as its operational and financial results.\n\nThe increase in digital interconnection has increased the spread and distribution of digital content such as texts, photos, audio  and  videos,  some  of  which  are  used  with  the  intent  to,  among  other  purposes,  commit  fraud.  Such  digital misinformation can affect organizations, such as the Bank, if used to blackmail or defame the Bank's reputation in order to negatively affect the trust of customers and other interest groups in the financial services industry, therefore leading to reduced business for the Bank which would negatively affect  the operational, economic and reputational performance of the Bank.\n\n## Acquisitions and strategic alliances may not perform in accordance with expectations or may disrupt the Bank's operations and adversely affect its profitability.\n\nAn element of the Bank's business strategy is to identify and pursue growth-enhancing strategic opportunities. The Bank may base assessments of potential acquisitions and alliances on assumptions with respect to operations, profitability and other matters that may subsequently prove to be incorrect, and any future acquisitions, investments and alliances may not produce the anticipated synergies or perform in accordance with the Bank's expectations which could adversely affect its operations  and  profitability.  In  particular,  the  Bank  holds  a  minority  financial  investment  in  an  infrastructure  project located in Colombia through a private equity fund. In recent years, the main shareholder of the project and the concession company have faced negative press related to irregular practices. If any of these situations result in sanctions or convictions then the company in which the Bank indirectly holds a minority stake, which is the holder of a toll road concession, may suffer a reputational harm, which in turn may have an adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition and the return on the Bank's investment.\n\n## The Bank faces risks relating to regulatory compliance in general, and in particular with respect to laws relating to anti-competitive practices, consumer protection and protection of personal data.\n\nThe Bank is subject to laws and regulations related to anti-competitive practices, including the formation of cartels and the abuse of its dominant position. Violation of these laws and regulations may result in significant administrative sanctions imposed by the SIC.\n\nThe Bank has created a special unit responsible for overseeing and ensuring regulatory compliance in general and, in particular,  compliance  with  regulations related  to  anti-competitive  practices,  personal  data  protection  and  consumer protection.\n\nMoreover, to ensure compliance with regulations regarding the use and protection of personal data, the Bank is currently developing a comprehensive data protection program.\n\nThe Bank may not be able to prevent all risks  associated  with  regulatory  compliance  or  detect  all  instances  of  noncompliance  with  the  regulations  described  above.  Any  failure  by  the  Bank  to  detect  and  prevent  the  aforementioned practices in a timely manner could damage the Banks reputation and facing substantial fines and penalties which could adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.",

These laws and regulations require the Bank, among other things, to adopt and enforce 'know your customer' policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to the applicable authorities. While the Bank has adopted policies and procedures aimed at preventing and detecting the use of its banking network for money laundering and terrorism financing activities and by terrorists and terrorist-related organizations and individuals generally, as the methods  used  by  criminals  evolve  and  become  increasingly  sophisticated,  such  policies  and  procedures  may  not completely  eliminate  the  risk  that  the  Bank  may  be  used  by  other  parties  to  engage  in  money  laundering,  terrorism financing, corruption or other illegal or improper activities.\n\nThe Bank is subject to laws and regulations that prohibit corrupt payments to public officials, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Colombian regulations on transnational bribery. The Bank has anti-corruption procedures, which incorporates, among others, an anti-corruption policy, training, reporting channels, monitoring, internal investigations and sanctions. While this system is designed to prevent and detect corrupt behavior, it does not completely eliminate the risk that the Bank's employees, providers, clients or agents may engage in corrupt practices.\n\nIf  the  Bank  fails  to  fully  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  it  may  face fines,  penalties  or  other  liabilities including restrictions on its ability to conduct business. In addition, the Bank's business and reputation could suffer if it is not able to prevent and detect money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption or other illegal practices.\n\n## The Bank is subject to increasing competition which may adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nThe  Bank  operates  in  a  highly  competitive  environment  and  management  expects  competition  to  increase  in  the jurisdictions where the Bank operates. Intensified merger activity in the financial services industry has produced larger, better capitalized and more geographically diverse firms that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and  services  at  more  competitive  prices.  Also,  the  emergence  of  new  financial  technologies,  unregulated  financial intermediaries (known as 'shadow banking') and the recent enactment of regulations aimed at enabling non-Colombian residents (other than individuals) to offer loans in COP, may increase competition for the Bank. The Bank's ability to maintain its competitive position depends mainly on its ability to fulfill new customers' needs through the development of new products and services, the Bank's ability to offer adequate services and strengthen its customer base through crossselling and the Bank's ability to bring in and retain human talent. The Bank's business will be adversely affected if the Bank is not able to maintain efficient service strategies. In addition, the Bank's efforts to offer new services and products may  not  succeed  if  product  or  market  opportunities  develop  more  slowly  than  expected  or  if  the  profitability  of opportunities is undermined by competitive pressures.\n\n## Downgrades in the credit ratings of the Bank and its subsidiaries would increase their cost of borrowing funds and make their ability to raise new funds, attract deposits or renew maturing debt more difficult.\n\nThe Bank's and its subsidiaries' credit ratings are an important component of the liquidity profile of each entity, and their ability to successfully compete depends on various factors, including their financial stability as reflected by their credit ratings. A downgrade in the credit ratings of the Bank or its subsidiaries would increase their cost of raising funds from other banks or in the capital markets. Purchases of the Bank's or its subsidiaries' securities by institutional investors could be reduced if they suffer a decline in their credit ratings. The ability of the Bank or its subsidiaries to renew maturing debt could become restricted and the terms for such renewal more expensive if their credit ratings were to decline. The Bank's and  its  subsidiaries'  lenders  and  counterparties  in  derivative  transactions  are  sensitive  to  the  risk  of  a  credit  rating downgrade. A downgrade in the credit rating of the Bank or its subsidiaries may adversely affect perception of their financial stability and their ability to raise deposits, which could make each entity less successful when competing for deposits and loans in the marketplace.",

Additionally,  in  March  2021,  the  UK  Financial  Conduct  Authority announced that the publication of LIBOR on a representative basis will cease for the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings immediately after December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately after June 30, 2023. This announcement may trigger future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks or lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks.\n\nIn order to address the discontinuation of LIBOR, a work team was organized within the Bank, which is implementing different initiatives to mitigate risks. This team is focused on (i)  systems adaptation, (ii) analyzing and implementing appropriate  \"fallback  language\"  and  (iii)  designing  a  strategy  to  approach  clients.  Addressing  the  discontinuation  of LIBOR includes understanding and identifying the impacts on products, contracts, technological applications, areas and processes that could be affected, as well as the effects on customers and the calculation of possible exposure of companies in  Colombia,  Panama,  El  Salvador  and  Guatemala.  This  team  is  supervised  by  a  steering  committee  and  the  Risk Committee of the board of directors.\n\nThe  Bank  is  exposed  to  assets  and  liabilities  linked  to  the  calculation  of  LIBOR.  For  more  information,  see  Item  5 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - B. Liquidity and Capital Resources - B.1 Liquidity and Funding'.\n\nAny failure by market participants, such as the Bank, and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace Libor and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in disruption of the financial and capital markets. In addition, the transition process to an alternative reference rate could impact the Bank's business, financial condition or result of operations, as a result of:\n\n- \u00b7 An adverse impact in pricing, liquidity, value, return and trading for a broad array of financial products, loans and derivatives that are included in the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Extensive changes to internal processes and documentation that contain references to Libor or use formulas that depend on Libor.\n- \u00b7 Disputes,  litigation  or  other  actions  with  counterparties  regarding  the  interpretation  and  enforceability  of provisions in LIBOR-based products such as fallback language or other related provisions.\n- \u00b7 The transition and development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition the Bank's risk management processes from Libor-based products to those based on one or more alternative reference rates in a timely manner; and\n- \u00b7 An increase in prepayments of Libor-linked loans by the Bank's clients.\n\n## Risks Relating to the Preferred Shares and the ADSs.\n\n## Preemptive rights may not be available to holders of American Depositary Receipts ('ADRs') evidencing ADSs.\n\nThe Bank's by-laws and Colombian law require that, whenever the Bank issues new shares of any outstanding class, it must offer the holders of each class of shares (including holders of ADRs) the right to purchase a number of shares of such class sufficient to maintain their existing percentage ownership of the aggregate capital stock of the Bank. These rights are called preemptive rights. United States holders of ADRs may not be able to exercise their preemptive rights through The Bank  of  New  York  Mellon,  which  acts  as  depositary  (the 'Depositary')  for  the Bank's  ADR  facility,  unless  a registration statement under the Securities Act is effective with respect to such rights and class of shares or an exemption from the registration requirement thereunder is available. The Bank is obligated to file a registration statement or find a corresponding exemption only if it determines to extend the rights to holders of the ADRs.

Accordingly, the Bank may in some cases decide not to file a registration statement.\n\nUnder the deposit agreement between the Bank and the Depositary, only the Depositary is entitled to exercise preemptive rights,  and  the Depositary  has  no  obligation  to  make available preemptive rights  to  holders  of ADRs. If the Bank offers or causes to be offered to the holders of any deposited securities, including preferred shares of the Bank,  any  rights  to  subscribe for  additional preferred  shares of  the Bank  or  any  rights  of  any  other  nature, the Depositary has discretion as to the procedure to be followed in making such rights available to any holders of ADRs or in disposing of such rights on behalf of any holders of ADRs and making the net proceeds available to such holders of ADRs. If by the terms of such rights offering or for any other reason, the Depositary does not either make such rights available to any holders of ADRs or dispose of such rights and make the net proceeds available to such holders of ADRs, then the Depositary will allow the rights to lapse. Whenever the rights are sold or lapse, the equity interests of the holders of ADRs will be proportionately diluted.\n\n## The Bank's preferred shares have limited voting rights.\n\nThe Bank's corporate affairs are governed by its by-laws and Colombian law. Under the Bank's by-laws and Colombian law, the Bank's preferred stockholders may have fewer rights than stockholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction.  Under the Bank's by-laws and Colombian corporate law, holders of preferred shares (and, consequently, holders of ADRs) have no voting rights in respect of preferred shares, other than in limited circumstances as described in 'Item 10. Additional Information - B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Voting Rights - Preferred Shares'. Holders of the Bank's preferred shares, including holders of ADRs, are not entitled to vote for the election of directors or to influence the Bank's management policies.\n\n## Holders of the Bank's ADRs may encounter difficulties in the exercise of dividend and voting rights.\n\nHolders of the Bank's ADRs may encounter difficulties in the exercise of some of their rights with respect to the shares underlying ADRs. If the Bank makes a distribution to holders of underlying shares in the form of securities, the Depositary is allowed, in its discretion, to sell those securities on behalf of ADR holders and instead distribute the net proceeds to the ADR holders. Also, even in those limited instances in which the preferred shares represented by the ADRs have the power to vote, under some circumstances, ADR holders may not be able to vote by giving instructions to the depositary. This may occur if ADR holders do not receive from the Depositary a notice of meeting sufficiently prior to the instruction date to  ensure  that  the  Depositary  will  vote  the  preferred  shares  represented  by  the  ADRs  in  accordance  with  instructions received from such holders. There are no circumstances in which holders of ADRs may vote in a way other than by providing instructions to the Depositary.\n\n## Relative illiquidity of the Colombian securities markets may impair the ability of an ADR holder to sell preferred shares.\n\nThe Bank's common and preferred shares are listed on the Colombian Securities Exchange, which is relatively small and illiquid compared to securities exchanges in major financial centers. In addition, a small number of issuers represent a disproportionately large percentage of market capitalization and trading volume on the Colombian Securities Exchange. A liquid trading market for the Bank's securities might not develop on the Colombian Securities Exchange. A limited trading market could impair the ability of an ADR holder to sell preferred shares (obtained upon withdrawal of such shares from the ADR facility) on the Colombian Securities Exchange in the amount and at the price and time such holder desires, and could increase the volatility of the price of the ADRs.\n\n## Changes in Colombia's tax regime may affect ADRs tax treatment.\n\nADRs  do  not  have  the  same  tax  benefits  as  other  equity  investments  in  Colombia.  ADRs  represent  Bancolombia's preferred shares and are held through a fund of foreign capital in Colombia which is subject to a specific tax regulatory regime. Accordingly, the regulations applicable in Colombia to equity investments, in particular those relating to dividends and profits from sale, are not applicable to ADRs, including the Bank's ADRs.",

HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\n\nBancolombia is one of the biggest Colombian financial institution, with presence in other jurisdictions such as Panama, El Salvador, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Barbados and the Cayman Islands, providing a wide range of financial products and services to a diversified individual, corporate, and government customer base throughout Colombia, Latin America and the Caribbean region.\n\nBancolombia is a stock company (' sociedad an\u00f3nima' ) domiciled in Medellin, Colombia and operates under Colombian laws  and  regulations,  mainly  the  Colombian  Commercial  Code,  Decree  663  of  1993  and  Decree  2555  of  2010. Bancolombia was incorporated in Colombia in 1945, under the name Banco Industrial Colombiano S.A. or 'BIC', and is incorporated  until  2044.  In  1998,  the  Bank  merged  with  Banco  de  Colombia  S.A.,  and  changed  its  legal  name  to Bancolombia S.A. On July 30, 2005, Conavi Banco Comercial y de Ahorros S.A. and Corporaci\u00f3n Financiera Nacional y Suramericana S.A. merged with and into Bancolombia, with Bancolombia as the surviving entity. Through this merger, Bancolombia gained important competitive advantages in retail and corporate banking which materially strengthened Bancolombia's multi-banking franchise.\n\nIn May 2007, Bancolombia Panama acquired Banagr\u00edcola, which controls several subsidiaries, including Banco Agr\u00edcola in El Salvador, and is dedicated to banking, commercial activities, consumer activities and brokerage. Through its first international acquisition, Bancolombia gained a leadership position in the Salvadorian market.\n\nIn October 2013, Bancolombia acquired a 100% interest in the ordinary voting shares of Banistmo.\n\nAlso, in October 2013, Bancolombia Panama acquired a 40% interest in Grupo Agromercantil, the parent company of BAM, and certain other companies dedicated to securities brokerage and other financial businesses. On December 30, 2015, Bancolombia Panama acquired an additional 20% interest, resulting in control of Grupo Agromercantil.\n\nOn September 29, 2020, the Bank acquired the remaining 40% of the shareholdings of Grupo Agromercantil Holding (GAH); the purchase price paid to the seller, BFC BAM Financial Corporation, was USD 289,144,606 (COP 1,117,680). For this transaction, the Bank has recognized a financial liability to BAM Financial Corporation (BFC) in the amount of USD 290,4 million, due to its future obligations to purchase for cash the non-controlling shares of Grupo Agromercantil Holding (GAH).\n\nSince 1995, Bancolombia has maintained a listing on the NYSE, where its ADSs are traded under the symbol 'CIB', and on the Colombian Securities Exchange, where its preferred shares are traded under the symbol 'PFBCOLOM'. Since 1981 Bancolombia's  common  shares  have  been  traded  on  the  Colombian  Securities  Exchange  under  the  symbol 'BCOLOMBIA'. See 'Item 9. The Offer and Listing'.\n\nBancolombia has grown substantially over the years, both through organic growth and acquisitions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Bancolombia and its consolidated subsidiaries had:\n\nCOP 255,569 billion in total assets;\n\nCOP 191,410 billion in total loans and advances to customers and financial institution;\n\nCOP 180,821 billion in total deposits by customers; and",

During the last 5 years he served as Chief Internal Auditor for Banco Agricola.\n\n## Bancolombia announced resolution of general shareholders meeting to increase the Bank's legal reserve\n\nOn July 31, 2020 during an extraordinary general shareholders meeting, Bancolombia's shareholders adopted a resolution to increase the Bank's legal reserve, transferring the existing amount in the appropiated reserve for the equity reinforcement and future growth with a value of COP $3,672,419. This decision allowed Bancolombia to maintain regulatory capital levels above the required regulatory minimums.\n\n## Bancolombia closed  the  transaction  for  the  acquisition  of  40%  of  the  common  stock  of  Grupo  Agromercantil Holding\n\nOn September 29, 2020 Bancolombia announced, after obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals, the closing of the transaction for the acquisition of an additional 40% of the common stock of Grupo Agromercantil Holding (GAH), a company that owns the Conglomerado Financiero Agromercantil of Guatemala, which  includes among others Banco Agromercantil of Guatemala (BAM). Having consumated the acquisition, grupo bancolombia now owns 100% of the common stock of GAH. The purchase price paid to the seller, BFC BAM Financial Corporation, amounts to USD 289,145 thousand. For this transaction, the Bank has recognized a financial liability to BAM Financial Corporation (BFC) in the amount of USD 290,4 million, due to its future obligations to purchase for cash the non-controlling shares of Grupo Agromercantil Holding (GAH).\n\n## Bancolombia announced gradual cease of its Bancolombia Cayman operations\n\nOn October 5, 2020 Bancolombia announced that the Board of Directors of its subsidiary Bancolombia Panama had approved the gradual cessation of its Cayman operations.

The interaction is conducted by our virtual assistant, Tabot. We have been expanding the offer of services through this channel, such as allowing customers to access the locations of our channel's distribution, registration of cash expenses in the Bancolombia personal financial manager 'Gestionar mi Dia a Dia' and the generation of tax certificates and statements of different banking products.\n\nCivica metro card Recharge Service: Between August 2020 and November 2020, we enabled the Recharge Service for the Civica Metro card through our apps for individual clients, benefiting more than 35,000 customers who use the card to access Medellin Metro network.

Operating and Financial Review and Prospects A. Operating Results - Results by Segment'.\n\n## B.2            OPERATIONS\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of the principal markets in which the Bank competes, including a breakdown of total interest and valuation income by category of activity and geographic market for each of the last three fiscal years.\n\n## B.3            SEASONALITY OF DEPOSITS\n\nHistorically, the Bank has experienced some seasonality in its demand deposits, with higher average balances at the end of the year and lower average balances during the first months of the year. This behavior is explained primarily by the increased liquidity provided by the Central Bank and the Colombian National Treasury at year end, as economic activity tends to be higher during this period resulting in a greater number of transactions.\n\nDuring 2020, the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic had an important impact on the Bank's deposits. From March 2020, demand deposits showed significant growth as investors found Bancolombia a solid and reliable bank for their savings, and  used  demand  deposits  as  hedges  against  the  higher  stock  market  volatility  and  the  uncertainty  of  the  economic situation. In addition, the national government and the Central Bank of Colombia implemented different measures in order to provide liquidity to the system through transfer payments and open market operations.\n\nHowever, we do not consider the seasonality of demand deposits to have a significant impact on our business, since the excess/shortage of liquidity has been managed through the treasury portfolio.\n\n## B.4            RAW MATERIALS\n\nThe Bank is not dependent on sources or availability of raw materials.\n\n## B.5            DISTRIBUTION NETWORK\n\nBancolombia provides its products and services through a traditional branch network, sales and customer representatives as well as through mobile branches (or 'Puntos de Atenci\u00f3n M\u00f3viles' ), an ATM network, online and computer banking, telephone  banking,  mobile  phone  banking  services  and  points  of  sale  (or  ' Puntos  de  Atenci\u00f3n  Cercano '),  among others. Transactions performed through electronic channels represented more than 94.63% of all transactions in 2020, up from  93.19%  of  all  transactions  in  2019.  In  addition,  as  of  December  31,  2020,  Bancolombia  had  a  sales  force  of approximately 12,508 employees.",

More specifically, several mergers and acquisitions were announced in 2007, mainly due to the global economic situation. Colombian banks made several investments allowing some entities to  become  big  players  in  the  Latin  American  market;  Bancolombia,  completed  the  acquisition  of  Banagr\u00edcola  in  El Salvador and Davivienda merged with Granbanco S.A. Bancaf\u00e9, which allowed Davivienda to have operations in Panama. In 2010, Banco de Bogot\u00e1 acquired BAC-Credomatic, which operates in several countries in Central America; and, in October 2011, Canadian Scotiabank purchased a stake in Colpatria. In 2012, the most relevant event regarding the presence of foreign banks in Colombia was the acquisition of Banco Santander Colombia S.A. in July 2012 by Corpbanca (Chile). Also, Davivienda acquired the subsidiaries of HSBC in Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nIn  2013,  Bancolombia  continued  its  internationalization  process  with  the  acquisition  of  the  banking  and  insurance operations of HSBC in Panama for USD 2,234 million. In addition, Bancolombia Panama acquired 40% of the common shares of Grupo Agromercantil for USD 217 million. In 2013, Grupo Aval acquired 100% of the Guatemalan Reformador Financial Group (the transaction was valued at USD 411 million) and acquired BBVA Panama for USD 490 million. In 2013, some competitors started operations in Colombia: Itau BBA entered the market with an investment bank, as did BNP Paribas; Credicorp acquired Correval (a local brokerage firm); Brazilian broker-dealer BTG Pactual acquired Bolsa y Renta; Banco Santander returned to the Colombian market with a bank; and the Chilean company Larrain Vial started operations with a brokerage firm. During 2014, the entry of new entities continued as the financing company Hipotecaria, specialized in mortgage loans, which began operations in March 2014; also, in June, Corpbanca completed the acquisition of Helm Bank, keeping Corpbanca's brand. During the same year, the bank GNB Sudameris acquired 99.9% of the capital of HSBC Colombia and started to operate under the brand GNB Colombia, while an agreement was signed to operate in Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. In 2015, the Chilean group CorpBanca merged with the Ita\u00fa of Brazil and Bancolombia sold 50% of its shares in Tuya SA to Grupo Exito. In December 2015, Bancolombia also acquired an additional 20% interest in  Grupo  Agromercantil,  bringing  its  interest  to  60%  in  total.  Until  January  2019,  the  Serfinansa  company  was  a commercial financing company and on February of that year it began to operate as the 26th bank in the financial system.\n\nIn 2020, four financing companies went through changes in their shareholdering structures: in January, Credifinanciera acquired Procredit Bank rebranding it Banco Credifinanciera; in April, Coltefinanciera acquired the rights and obligations of  Multibank which ceased to act as a bank; Leasing Bancoldex merged with Arco Bancoldex in August; and Pagos Internacional was acquired by Banco W in November.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  according  to  the  SFC,  the  main  participants  in  the  Colombian  financial  system  were  25 commercial banks (15 domestic private banks, 9 foreign banks, and 1 domestic state-owned bank), 5 financial corporations and 11 financing companies (2 leasing companies and 9 traditional financing companies). In addition, trust companies, cooperatives, insurance companies, insurance brokerage and  securities intermediaries, special state-owned institutions, and severance payments and pension funds also participate in the Colombian financial system.\n\n## Market and Credit Institutions' Evolution in 2020\n\nIn  2015,  Colombian  financial  institutions  began  reporting their  consolidated  financial  results  under  IFRS  framework. However, in the case of credit institutions (including banks, financial corporations, financing companies and 38 financial cooperatives), the SFC has allowed the presentation of stand-alone financial statements under Colombian Banking GAAP basis, following Decree 1851 of August 2013, which regulates the Law 1314 of 2009 concerning the technical regulatory",

The agencies vested with the authority to regulate the financial system are the board of directors of the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (the 'Ministry of Finance'), the SFC, the Superintendency of Industry and Commerce (the 'SIC') and the Self-Regulatory Organization (' Autoregulador del Mercado de Valores ' or 'AMV').\n\n## Central Bank\n\nThe Central Bank exercises the customary functions of a central bank, including price stabilization, monetary policy, regulation  of  currency  circulation,  regulation  of  credit,  exchange  rate  monitoring  and  management  of  international reserves. Its board of directors is the regulatory authority for monetary, currency exchange and credit policies, and is responsible for the direction of the Central Bank's duties. The Central Bank also acts as lender of last resort to financial institutions.\n\n## Ministry of Finance\n\nOne of the functions of the Ministry of Finance is to regulate all aspects of financial and insurance activities. As part of its duties, the Ministry of Finance issues decrees relating to financial matters that may affect banking operations in Colombia. In  particular,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is  responsible  for  regulations  relating  to  capital  adequacy,  legal  lending  limits, authorized operations, disclosure of information and accounting of financial institutions on a high level, which matters are then regulated in detail by the SFC.\n\nDecree 4172 of 2011, established the Unit of Financial Regulation ('URF'), an affiliated unit of the Ministry of Finance. The URF is responsible for preparing and drafting any new financial, credit, securities, foreign exchange and insurance regulation to be issued by the Colombian Government.\n\n## Superintendency of Finance\n\nThe SFC is the authority responsible for supervising and regulating financial institutions, including commercial banks such as the Bank, finance corporations, financing companies, financial services companies and insurance companies, all",

The SFC has broad discretionary powers to supervise financial institutions, including the authority to impose fines on financial institutions and their directors and officers for violations of applicable regulations. The SFC can also conduct on-site inspections of Colombian financial institutions.\n\nThe SFC is also responsible for monitoring and regulating the market for publicly traded securities in Colombia and for monitoring and supervising securities market participants, including the Colombian Securities Exchange, brokers, dealers, mutual funds and issuers.\n\nViolations of the financial system rules and regulations are subject to administrative and, in some cases, criminal sanctions.\n\n## Other Colombian regulators\n\n## Self- Regulatory Organization\n\nThe AMV is a private entity responsible for the regulation of entities participating in the Colombian capital markets. The AMV may issue mandatory instructions to its members and supervise its members' compliance and impose sanctions for violations.\n\nAll capital market intermediaries, including the Bank, must become members of the AMV and are subject to its regulations.\n\n## Superintendency of Industry and Commerce\n\nThe SIC is the authority responsible for supervising and regulating competition in several industrial sectors, including financial institutions. The SIC is authorized to initiate administrative proceedings and impose sanctions on banks, including the Bank, whenever the financial entity behaves in a manner considered to be anti-competitive.\n\n## Regulatory Framework for Colombian Banking Institutions\n\nThe basic regulatory framework of the Colombian financial sector is set forth in Decree 663 of 1993, as modified by among others, Law 510 of 1999, Law 546 of 1999, Law 795 of 2003, Law 1328 of 2009, Law 1870 of 2017, Decree 2555 of 2010, External Resolution 1 of 2018, (exchange control regulation statute), and External Resolution 4 of 2006 issued by the board of directors of the Central Bank, as well as by External Circulars 29 of 2014 (' Circular B\u00e1sica Jur\u00eddica ') and  100  of  1995  ( 'Circular  B\u00e1sica  Contable  y  Financiera' )  issued  by  the  SFC,  in  each  case  as  amended  and supplemented.\n\nDecree 663 of 1993 defines the structure of the Colombian financial system, establishes a set of permitted activities within the system and defines several forms of business entities, including: (i) credit institutions (' establecimientos de cr\u00e9dito' ) (which  are  further  categorized  into  banking  institutions,  such  as  the  Bank,  finance  corporations,  (' corporaciones financieras' ), financing  companies ('compa\u00f1ias  de  financiamiento' ) and  finance  cooperatives  (' cooperativas financieras' );  (ii)  financial  services  entities  (' sociedades  de  servicios  financieros' );  (iii)  capitalization  corporations (' sociedades de capitalizaci\u00f3n' ); (iv) insurance companies (' entidades aseguradoras' ); and (v) insurance intermediaries ('intermediarios de Seguros' ). Furthermore, Decree 663 of 1993 sets forth (i) the procedure applicable for mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs, and other corporate reorganizations of the aforementioned entities, (ii) specific regulations that apply to the issuance and sale of shares and other securities by such entities, and (iii) certain rules regarding the activities of officers and directors of such institutions, among others. Finally, Decree 663 of 1993 provides that no financial, banking or credit institution may operate in Colombia without the prior approval of the SFC.\n\nLaw 510 of 1999 improved the solvency standards and stability of Colombia's financial institutions by providing rules for their  incorporation  and  regulating  permitted  investments  of  credit  institutions,  insurance  companies  and  investment companies.\n\nLaw 546 of 1999 was enacted to regulate the system of long-term home loans.",

        "page_content": "Law 795 of 2003 broadened the scope of permitted activities for financial institutions, to update regulations with some of the then-latest principles of the Basel Committee and to increase the minimum capital requirements in order to incorporate a financial institution (for more information, see 'Minimum Capital Requirements' below). Law 795 of 2003 also provided authority to the SFC to take preventive measures, consisting mainly of preventive interventions with respect to financial institutions whose capital falls below certain thresholds.\n\nLaw 1328 of 2009 provided a set of rights and responsibilities for customers of the financial system and a set of obligations for financial institutions in order to minimize disputes. This law also gives foreign banks more flexibility to operate in Colombia through 'branches'. Following its adoption, credit institutions were allowed to operate leasing businesses and banks were allowed to extend loans to third parties so that borrowers could acquire control of other companies.\n\nLaw  1870  of  2017  ('Law  1870')  implemented  the  legal  framework  for  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  financial conglomerates in areas such as regulatory capital, related party transactions, corporate governance principles, conflicts of interest and risk management, among others. According to Law 1870, a financial holding company may acquire that status by either (i) having significant influence over a financial institution or (ii) controlling a financial institution. A financial holding company (1) has significant influence over a financial institution when it directly or indirectly, has more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting capital of the financial institution, excluding from the calculation voting capital held by entities that under their regulations are not allowed to control a financial institution (such as pension funds), and (2) controls a financial institution, when it has (i) more than 50% of the voting capital of the financial institution, (ii) the majority of the votes in the Board of Directors of the financial institution or the right to elect a majority of its members or (iii) a dominant influence over the decisions made by the financial institution as a result of an agreement with the financial institution or its shareholders as established in articles 260 and 261 of the Colombian Code of Commerce. The Government and the SFC must take into consideration the  structure,  complexity,  and  individual  features  of  each conglomerate  when  regulating financial conglomerates. Additionally, regarding risk management and exposure limits, the new requirements applicable to financial conglomerates must consider the requirements that currently apply to financial institutions. Furthermore, when financial institutions fulfill capital adequacy requirements and solvency ratios on their own, authorities may not impose solvency ratios on the financial conglomerate as a whole. The Government has issued several decrees pursuant to its authority under Law 1870, including Decree 774 of 2018, which regulates capital adequacy requirements for financial conglomerates, and Decree 1486 of 2018, which regulates the criteria to determine related parties, risk concentration limits and conflicts of interest.\n\nThe  law  also  reinforced  the  mechanism  for  the  resolution  of  credit  institutions  -  deposit-taking  institutions  under Colombian Law - by establishing the concept of the bridge bank, an entity used to facilitate the purchase of assets and transfer of liabilities from failing institutions.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Law 1870 of 2017 and the Decrees mentioned above, Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana S.A. has significant influence and, therefore, is the financial holding company of Bancolombia only for the purposes of the financial conglomerates framework. These new regulations require Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana S.A. to: (i) continue  strengthening  the  Bank's  Corporate  Governance  System  as  a  Financial  Conglomerate;  (ii)  review  the  risk management and capital adequacy models; and (iii) strengthen the internal control and information reporting systems of the  companies that make up the conglomerate under this framework. The SFC has authority to implement applicable regulations and, accordingly, from time to time issues administrative resolutions and circulars. By means of External Circular 029 of 2014, the SFC compiled the rules and regulations applicable to financial institutions and other entities under  its  supervision.  Likewise,  by  means  of  External  Circular  100  of  1995  (the  'Basic  Accounting  and  Financial Circular'), it compiled all accounting rules applicable to financial institutions and its other supervised entities.\n\nThis new regulatory framework will not represent a negative impact on Bancolombia's business and its affiliates. Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana S.A. will determine policies and procedures on the matter as the Decree 1486 establishes.\n\nThe SFC have introduced reforms for the implementation of Basel III in the country. For this, it has issued Decrees 1477 of 2018 and 1421 of 2019 (integrated into Decree 2555 of 2010). After the signing of these decrees, it was necessary for the SFC to adjust the instructions and formats introducing new chapters to the SFC's Basic Accounting and Financial Circular and creating a series of reporting formats through the External Circular 20 of 2019. For further details regarding the regulation please see 'Item 4.B.8 Supervision and Regulation - Capital adequacy requirements'. In addition to the",

For further information please see 'Item 4.B.8 Supervision and Regulation - Risk Management Systems'.\n\nFinancial institutions are subject to further rules if they engage in additional activities. Law 964 of 2005 (securities market law) regulates securities intermediation activities, which may be performed by banks, and securities offerings. External Resolution 1 of 2018 (foreign exchange regulations), and External Resolution 4 of 2006 issued by the board of directors of the Central Bank, defined the different activities that banks, including the Bank, may perform as foreign exchange market intermediaries, including lending in foreign currencies and investing in foreign securities.\n\nAdditionally, Decree 2555 of 2010 compiled regulations that were dispersed in separate decrees, including regulations regarding banking, insurance and securities market activities, capital adequacy requirements, principles relating to the determination, dissemination and publication of rates and prices of products and financial services, and lending activities.\n\nViolations of any of the above statutes and their relevant regulations are subject to administrative sanctions and, in some cases, criminal sanctions.\n\n## Key interest rates\n\nColombian commercial banks, finance corporations and consumer financing companies are required to provide the Central Bank, on a weekly basis, with data regarding the total volume (in pesos) of certificates of deposit issued during the prior week and the average interest rates paid for certificates of deposit with maturities of 90 days. Based on such reports, the Central Bank computes the DTF, which is published at the beginning of the following week, for use in calculating interest rates payable by financial institutions. For the week of April 22, 2021, the DTF was 1.76%.\n\nArticle 884 of the Colombian Commercial Code provides for a limit on the amount of interest that may be charged in commercial transactions. The limit is 1.5 times the current banking interest rate, or inter\u00e9s bancario corriente, certified and calculated by the SFC as the average rate of interest ordinarily charged by banks for loans made during a specified period. The current banking interest rate for small business loans and for all other loans is certified by the SFC. As of December 31, 2020, the banking interest rate for small business loans was 37.72% and for all other loans was 17.46%.\n\n## Capital adequacy requirements\n\nCapital adequacy requirements for Colombian financial institutions (as set forth in Decree 2555 of 2010, as amended) are based on applicable Basel Committee standards. Decree 1477 of 2018 (as amended by Decree 1421 of 2019) introduced into  the  Colombian banking regulation  several  Basel  III  reforms,  mainly  relating  to  the  (i)  implementation of  capital buffers, (ii) alignment with Basel III solvency ratio definitions, (iii) quality of the regulatory capital base and (iv) update of the measurement of the Risk Weighted Assets and (v) the alignment of the standardized approach for credit risk. This regulation establishes a gradual implementation plan beginning in 2021 and ending in 2024 for requirements regarding solvency ratios and capital buffers, as further established in Decree 1421 of 2019. The SFC issued External Circular 020 of 2019 which defines the applicability of conditions of Decree 1477 of 2018 in relation to capital adequacy requirements for credit institutions and information reporting to the SFC.\n\nSome of the highlights of this regulation are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The technical capital ('Technical Capital' ) is calculated as the sum of Common Equity Tier 1 One Capital (the ' patrimonio b\u00e1sico ordinario' ),the Additional Tier One Capital ('patrimonio b\u00e1sico adicional' ) and the Tier Two Capital (' patrimonio adicional' ).\n- \u00b7 Revised criteria for debt and equity instruments to be considered Common Equity Tier One Capital , Additional Tier One Capital, and Tier Two Capital were established. Additionally, the SFC must review whether a given instrument adequately complies with these criteria in order for an instrument to be considered Tier One Capital or Tier Two Capital, upon request of the issuer. Debt and equity instruments that have not been classified by the",

These ratios apply to credit institutions individually and on a consolidated basis. Credit institutions includes banks (including Bancolombia.), financial corporations, and financing companies.\n- \u00b7 Credit establishments must comply with a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, which is defined as the sum of the Common Equity Tier OneCapital after deductions and the Additional Tier One Capital, divided by the leverage value. The leverage value is the sum of all net assets, the net exposures in all repo, simultaneous transactions and temporary transfer of securities, the credit exposures in all derivative instruments, and the exposure value of all contingencies.\n- \u00b7 Decree 415 of 2018, requires that as of the year 2019, non-depository financial institutions, such as asset managers and fiduciary entities under Colombian law, comply with a 9% minimum solvency ratio on an individual basis.\n- \u00b7 Decree 1421 of 2019, introduced minimum capital requirements for operational risk to credit establishments adopting the Basel III standardised approach. This new capital requirement will be determined by the product of the  Business  Indicator  (' indicador  de  negocio '),  the  Operational  Risk  Coefficient  ( coeficiente  de  riesgo operacional ) and the Internal Loss Multiplier ( indicador de p\u00e9rdida interna ). The operational risk coefficient will be 12% of the Business Indicator, but if the Business Indicator exceeds COP 3 billion, the coefficient will be 15% for the exceeded amount. Each entity must comply with the requirement as of January 1, 2021.\n\nIn 2014, the Ministry of Finance issued Decree 1648 of 2014 and Decree 2392 of 2015 establishing criteria for hybrid instruments to be considered additional basic capital (Additional Tier 1).\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Bank's capital adequacy ratio was 14.74%, exceeding the requirements of the Colombian government and the SFC by 574 basis points. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank's capital adequacy ratio was 12.82%.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - B1 Liquidity and Funding. Capital Adequacy.'\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for banks on an unconsolidated basis is established in Article 80 of Decree 633 of 1993. The minimum capital requirement for banks, including Bancolombia S.A., for 2019 is COP 96,813 million. Failure to meet such requirement can result in the taking of possession (toma de posesi\u00f3n) of the Bank by the SFC (see Item 4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8 -Supervision and Regulation - Bankruptcy Considerations').\n\n## Capital Investment Limit\n\nFor entities incorporated in Colombia, all investments in subsidiaries and other authorized capital investments, excluding those made in order to abide by legal requirements, may not exceed 100% of the total aggregate capital, equity reserves",

The amount of these mandatory investments is calculated by applying a fixed percentage (ranging from 4.3% to 5.8%, depending on the type of liability) to the quarterly average of the end of day balances of certain liabilities, primarily, deposits and short-term debt. The investment balance is computed at the end of each quarter. Any required adjustment (due to a change in the quarterly average between periods) results in the purchase of additional securities or may result in redemption by Finagro at of securities in excess of the requirement. The purchase of additional securities takes place during the month following the date as of which the computation was performed.\n\n## Foreign Currency Position Requirements\n\nAccording  to  External  Resolution  1  of  2018  issued  by  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Central  Bank  as  amended  or supplemented ('Resolution 1 of 2018'), a financial institution's foreign currency position  (posici\u00f3n propia en moneda extranjera) is the difference between such institution's foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities (including any off-balance sheet items), actual or contingent, including those that may be converted into Colombian legal currency.\n\nAdditionally,  in  the  case  of  foreign  exchange  market  intermediaries  that  consolidate  financial  statements  and  have controlled foreign investments, such as the Bank, the foreign exchange market intermediary shall exclude from its foreign currency position: (i) the value of controlled foreign investments, and (ii) the value of derivatives and other liabilities designated by the intermediary as hedging instruments for the controlled foreign investments.\n\nResolution 1 of 2018 provides that the average of a bank's foreign currency position for three business days cannot exceed the equivalent in Colombian pesos of 20% of the bank's technical capital. Foreign exchange market intermediaries such as the Bank are permitted to hold a three business days' average negative foreign currency position not exceeding the equivalent in foreign currency of 5% of its technical capital (with penalties being payable after the first business day).\n\nResolution 1 of 2018 also defines the foreign currency position in cash (posici\u00f3n propia de contado en moneda extranjera) as the difference between all foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.\n\nFinally, Resolution 1 of 2018 requires banks to calculate a gross position of leverage (posici\u00f3n bruta de apalancamiento) as  it  relates  to  its  foreign  currency  position.  Gross  position  of  leverage  is  defined  as  (i)  the  value  of  term  contracts denominated in foreign currency, plus (ii) the value of transactions denominated in foreign currency to be settled in a term equal or greater than one day in cash, plus (iii) the value of the exchange rate risk exposure associated with exchange rate options and derivatives.\n\n## Reserve Requirements\n\nCredit institutions are required to satisfy reserve requirements with respect to deposits and other cash demands which are held by the Central Bank in the form of cash deposits. According to Resolution 11 of 2008 issued by the board of directors of the Central Bank, as amended, the reserve requirements for Colombian banks are measured bi-weekly and the amount depends on the class of deposits.\n\nCredit institutions must maintain reserves of 8.00% over private demand deposits, government demand deposits, other deposits and liabilities and savings deposits; of 3.50% over term deposits with maturities fewer than 540 days and 0% over term deposits with maturities equal to or more than 540 days.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign Currency Loans\n\nAccording to  External  Resolution  1  of  2018,  residents  of  Colombia  may  obtain  foreign  currency  loans  from  foreign residents, and from Colombian foreign exchange market intermediaries (such as the Bank) or by placing debt instruments abroad. Foreign currency loans must be either disbursed through a foreign exchange intermediary or deposited in special purpose international banking accounts.\n\nColombian residents who borrow funds in foreign currency may be required to post with the Central Bank non-interest bearing deposits for a specified term, although currently the size of the required deposit is currently zero. Such deposits would not be required in certain cases, including foreign currency loans aimed at financing Colombian investments abroad, or  for  short-term  exportation  loans,  provided  that  these  loans  are  disbursed  against  the  funds  of  Banco  de  Comercio Exterior - Bancoldex.\n\nExternal Resolution 1 of 2018 sets forth a number of restrictions and limitations as to the use of proceeds in the case of foreign currency loans obtained by Colombian foreign exchange market intermediaries for the purpose of avoiding the deposit requirement described above. Such foreign currency loans may be used, among others, for lending activities in a foreign currency with a tenor equal to, or shorter than, the tenor of the foreign financing, provided that such foreign currency loans are hedged with a derivative in foreign currency that has a tenor equal to the term between the disbursement and the final maturity of the loan.\n\nFinally,  pursuant  to  Law  9  of  1991,  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Central  Bank  is  entitled  to  impose  conditions  and limitations on the incurrence of foreign currency indebtedness, as an exchange control policy, in order to avoid pressure in the currency exchange market.\n\n## Non-Performing Loan Allowance\n\nThe SFC maintains rules on non-performing loan allowances for financial institutions. These rules apply to Bancolombia's financial statements on a stand-alone basis for Colombian regulatory purposes. Non-performing loan allowances in the Consolidated Financial Statements are calculated according to IFRS.\n\n## Lending Activities\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010, as amended, sets forth the legal lending limits, which provide for the maximum amounts that a financial institution may lend to a single borrower (including for this purpose all related fees, expenses and charges). These maximum amounts may not exceed 10% of a bank's technical capital. However, there are several circumstances under which the limit may be raised. In general, the limit is raised to 25% when amounts lent above 5% of technical capital are secured by guarantees that comply with the financial guidelines provided in Decree 2555 of 2010, as amended.\n\nAlso, a bank may not make loans to any shareholder that holds directly more than 10% of its capital stock for one year after such shareholder reaches the 10% threshold. In no event may a loan to a shareholder holding directly or indirectly 20% or more of the Bank's capital stock exceed 20% of the Bank's technical capital. In addition, no loan to a single financial institution may exceed 30% of the Bank's technical capital, with the exception of loans funded by Colombian development banks which are not subject to such limit.\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010 also sets a maximum limit of 30% of the Bank's technical capital for single-party risk, the calculation of which includes loans, leasing operations and equity and debt investments.\n\nThe Central Bank also has the authority to establish maximum limits on the interest rates that commercial banks and other financial  institutions  may  charge  on  loans.  However,  interest  rates  must  also  be  consistent  with  market  terms  with  a maximum limit certified by the SFC.",

        "page_content": "## Ownership and Management Restrictions\n\nThe Bank is organized as a stock company (sociedad an\u00f3nima). Its corporate existence is subject to the rules applicable to commercial companies, principally the Colombian Commercial Code which requires stock companies (such as the Bank) to have a minimum of five shareholders at all times and provides that no single shareholder may own 95% or more of the Bank's subscribed capital stock. Article 262 of the Colombian Commerce Code prohibits the Bank's subsidiaries from acquiring stock of the Bank.\n\nPursuant to Decree 663 of 1993, as amended, any transaction resulting in an individual or entity holding 10% or more of the outstanding shares of any Colombian financial institution, including, in the case of the Bank, transactions resulting in holding ADRs representing 10% or more of the subscribed capital stock of the Bank, is subject to the prior authorization of the SFC. For that purpose, the SFC must evaluate the proposed transaction based on the criteria and guidelines specified in Decree 663 of 1993. Transactions entered into without the prior approval of the SFC are null and void and cannot be recorded in the institution's stock ledger. These restrictions apply equally to Colombian and foreign investors.\n\n## Bankruptcy Considerations\n\nColombian banks and other financial institutions are not subject to the laws and regulations that generally govern the insolvency, restructuring and liquidation of industrial and commercial companies, but rather are subject to special rules, the most important details of which are summarized below.\n\nPursuant to Colombian banking law, the SFC has the power to intervene in the operations of a bank in order to prevent it from, or to control and reduce the effects of, a bank failure. The SFC also conducts periodic visits to financial institutions and  may  impose  capital  or  solvency  obligations  on  financial  institutions  without  taking  control  of  such  financial institutions.\n\nThe SFC may intervene in a bank's business: (i) prior to the liquidation of the bank, in order to prevent the bank from entering into a state where the SFC would need to take possession by taking one of the following recovery measures (institutos  de  salvamento):  (a)  submitting  the  bank  to  a  special  supervision  regime;  (b)  issuing  a  mandatory  order  to recapitalize the bank; (c) placing the bank under the management of another authorized financial institution, acting as trustee;  (d)  ordering  the  transfer  of  all  or  part  of  the  assets,  liabilities  and  contracts  of  the  bank  to  another  financial institution; (e) ordering the bank to merge with one or more financial institutions that consent to the merger; (f) ordering the adoption of a recovery plan by the bank pursuant to guidelines approved by the government; (g) ordering the exclusion of certain assets and liabilities by requiring the transfer of such assets and liabilities to another institution designated by the SFC; or (h) ordering the progressive unwinding (desmonte progresivo) of the operations of the bank; or (ii) at any time, by taking possession of the bank to either administer the bank or order its liquidation, depending on how critical the situation is found to be by the SFC.\n\nThe following grounds for a taking of possession are considered to be 'automatic' in the sense that, if the SFC discovers their existence, the SFC must step in and take over the financial institution: (i) if the financial institution's technical capital falls below 40% of the legal minimum; or (ii) upon the expiration of the term of any then-current recovery plans or the non-fulfillment of the goals set forth in such plans.\n\nAdditionally, and subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance and the opinion of its advisory council (Consejo Asesor del Superintendente), the SFC may, at its discretion, initiate intervention procedures against a bank under the following circumstances: (i) suspension of payments; (ii) failure to pay deposits; (iii) refusal to submit its files, accounts and supporting documentation for inspection by the SFC; (iv) refusal to be interrogated under oath regarding its business; (v) repeated failure to comply with orders and instructions from the SFC; (vi) repeated violations of applicable laws and regulations or of the bank's by-laws; (vii) unauthorized or fraudulent management of the bank's business; (viii) reduction of the bank's net worth below 50% of its subscribed capital; (ix) existence of serious inconsistencies in the information provided to the SFC that, at its discretion, impedes the SFC to accurately understand the situation of the bank; (x) failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements set forth in Decree 663 of 1993; (xi) failure to comply with the recovery plans that were adopted by the bank; (xii) failure to comply with the order of exclusion of certain assets and liabilities to",

The decision is to be made with the purpose of permitting depositors, creditors and  investors  to  obtain  full  or  partial  payment  of  their  credits  and  must  be  submitted  to  the  Fondo  de  Garant\u00edas  de Instituciones Financieras' (Fogafin) previous opinion.\n\nUpon the taking of possession of a bank, depending on the bank's financial situation and the reasons that gave rise to such measure, the SFC may (but is not required to) order the bank to suspend payments to its creditors. The SFC has the power to determine that such suspension will affect all of the obligations of the bank, or only certain types of obligations or even obligations up to or in excess of a specified amount.\n\nAs a result of a taking of possession, the SFC must appoint as special agent the person or entity designated by Fogafin to administer the affairs of the bank while such process lasts and until it is decided whether to liquidate the bank.\n\nAs part of its duties following the taking of possession by the SFC, Fogafin must provide the SFC with the plan to be followed by the special agent in order to meet the goals set for the fulfillment of the measures that may have been adopted. If the underlying problems that gave rise to the taking of possession of the bank are not resolved within a term not to exceed two years, the SFC must order the liquidation of the bank.\n\nDuring a taking of possession (which period ends when the liquidation process begins), Colombian banking laws prevent any creditor of the bank from: (i) initiating any procedure for the collection of any amount owed by the bank; (ii) enforcing any judicial decision rendered against the bank to secure payment of any of its obligations; (iii) constituting a lien or attachment over any of the assets of the bank to secure payment of any of its obligations; or (iv) making any payment, advance or compensation or assuming any obligation on behalf of the bank, with the funds or assets that may belong to it and are held by third parties,  except  for  payments  that  are  made  by  way  of  set-off  between  regulated  entities  of  the Colombian financial and insurance systems.\n\nIn the event that the bank is liquidated, the SFC must, among other measures, provide that all term obligations owed by the bank are due and payable as of the date when the order to liquidate becomes effective.\n\nDuring the liquidation process bank deposits and certain other types of saving instruments will be excluded from the liquidation process and paid prior to any other liabilities. The remainder of resources will be distributed among creditors whose claims are recognized in accordance with the following rank: (i) the first class of claims includes the court expenses incurred in the interest of all creditors, wages and other obligations related with employment contracts and tax authorities' credits regarding national and local taxes; (ii) the second class of claims comprises the claims secured by a security interest on movable assets; (iii) the third class of claims includes the claims secured by real estate collateral, such as mortgages; (iv) the fourth class of claims contains some other claims of the tax authorities against the debtor that are not included in the first class of claims and claims of suppliers of raw materials and input to the debtor and (v) finally, the fifth class of claims includes all other credits without any priority or privilege, provided, however, that among credits of the fifth class, subordinated debt will be ranked junior to the external liabilities (pasivos externos) and senior only to capital stock. Each category of creditors will collect in the order indicated above, whereby distributions in one category will be subject to the full satisfaction of claims in the prior category.\n\n## Deposit insurance-Troubled Financial Institutions\n\nSubject  to  specific  limitations,  Fogafin  is  authorized  to  provide  equity  (whether  or  not  reducing  the  par  value  of  the recipient's shares) and/or secured credits to troubled financial institutions, and to insure deposits of commercial banks and certain other financial institutions.\n\nTo protect the customers of commercial banks and certain financial institutions, Resolution 1 of 2012 of the board of directors of Fogafin, as amended, requires mandatory deposit insurance. Banks must pay an annual premium of 0.30% of total funds received on saving accounts, checking accounts, certificates of deposit and other deposits, which is paid in four",

If a bank is liquidated, the deposit insurance will cover the funds deposited by an individual or corporation with such bank up to a maximum of COP 50 million regardless of the number of accounts held.\n\n## Risk Management Systems\n\nCommercial banks must have risk administration systems to meet the SFC minimum standards for compliance and to avoid and mitigate the following risks: (i) credit; (ii) liquidity; (iii) market; (iv) operational; (v) money laundering and terrorism; and (vi) counterparty.\n\nCommercial banks generally have several risk measurement methods, including the risk weighted assets measurement which is calculated according to weight percentages assigned to different types of assets, which may be 0%, 20%, 50% and 100%. There are some exceptions in which the weight percentage is higher and is calculated based on the associated risk perception of the evaluated asset. Provisions, which are calculated on a monthly basis, are another risk measurement method.  For  commercial  and  consumer  loans,  the  SFC  issues  a  provision  reference  model,  according  to  which  the probability of default depends on an assigned rating (AA, A, BB, B, CC and default). For mortgage loans and small business loans, provisions are calculated based on ratings (A, B, C, D and E) assigned depending on the time elapsed since the client's default.\n\nWith respect to market risks, commercial banks must follow the provisions of the Basic Accounting Circular, which defines criteria and procedures for measuring a bank's exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks. Under such regulations, banks must submit to the SFC information on the net present value, duration, and interest rate of its assets, liabilities,  and  derivative  positions.  Colombian  banks  are  required  to  calculate,  for  each  position  on  the  statement  of financial position, a volatility rate and a parametric value at risk ('VaR'), which is calculated based on net present value, modified duration and a risk factor computed in terms of a basis points change. Each risk factor is calculated and provided by the SFC.\n\nWith respect to liquidity risk, financial entities must meet a liquidity coverage test that ensures their ability to hold liquid assets  sufficient  to  cover  potential  net  cash  outflows  for  a  period  of  30  days.  Net  cash  outflows  for  this  purpose  are contractual maturities of assets (interbank borrowings, financial assets investments, loans and advances to customers, derivative financial instruments) minus contractual maturities of liabilities (demand deposits, time deposits, interbank deposits borrowings from other financial institutions, debt instruments, derivative financial instruments) occurring within a  period of 30 days. For purposes of this calculation, liabilities do not include projections of future transactions. The maturity  of  the  loan  portfolio  is  affected  by  the  historical  default  indicator  and  the  maturity  of  deposits  is  modeled according to the regulation.\n\nWith respect to operational risk, commercial banks must assess, according to principles provided by the Basic Accounting Circular, each of their business lines (such as corporate finance, purchases and sales of securities, commercial banking, asset management, etc.) in order to record the risk events that may occur and result in fraud, technology problems, legal and reputational problems and problems associated with labor relations at the bank.\n\nIn order to implement Basel III liquidity standards and complement the measure and management of short-term liquidity risk, the SFC issued the External Circular 019 of 2019 which introduced the Net Stable Funding Ratio (Coeficiente de Fondeo Estable Neto or 'CFEN'). The CFEN will require credit institutions, such as Bancolombia S.A., to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets. The CFEN is a ratio that seeks  to limit excessive dependency on unreliable  financing  sources  for  strategic  assets  which  are  often  illiquid.  The  way  this  ratio  works  is assigning a value to each deposit by type of investor, establishing a percentage value for each deposit. The implementation of this new ratio intends to aid companies in maintaining an appropriate stable funding profile, in relation to its assets. The CFEN is defined as the amount of Available Stable Funding, includes equity and liabilities that will remain with the credit institution  for  more  than  one  year.  This  ratio  should be  equal  to  at  least  100%  on  an ongoing  basis  ( Fondeo Estable Disponible or 'FED') relative to the amount of Required Stable Funding ( Fondeo Estable Requerido ). The ratio will start being reported on March 31, 2020.",

Colombia, as a member of the GAFI-SUD (a FATFstyle regional body), follows all of FATF's 40 recommendations and eight special recommendations. External Circular 029  of  2014  requires  the  implementation  by  financial  institutions  of  a  system  of  controls  for  money  laundering  and terrorism financing. These rules emphasize 'know your customer' policies and knowledge of customers and markets, and other customer identification and monitoring processes that include screening against international lists.\n\nFinancial  institutions  must  cooperate  with  the  appropriate  authorities  to  prevent  and  control  money  laundering  and terrorism financing. Finally, the Colombian Criminal Code introduced criminal rules and regulations to prevent, control, detect, eliminate and adjudicate all matters related to financing terrorism and money laundering, including the omission of reports on cash transactions, mobilization or storage of cash, and the lack of controls.\n\n## Regulatory Framework for Subsidiaries that are Non-Participants in the Financial Sector\n\nAll  of  Bancolombia's  Colombian  subsidiaries  that  do  not  provide  financial  services  are  governed  by  the  laws  and regulations embodied in the Colombian Civil Code and the Colombian Commercial Code as well as any regulations issued by the Colombian Superintendency of Industry and Commerce and the Superintendency of Corporations or any other type of special regulations that may be applicable to the commercial and industrial activities carried out by such subsidiaries.\n\n## International regulations applicable to Bancolombia and its subsidiaries\n\n## FATCA\n\nFATCA, a U.S. federal tax law enacted in 2010, imposes a 30% withholding tax on 'withholdable payments' made to nonU.S. financial institutions that do not participate in the FATCA program or that fail (or, in some cases, that have affiliates in which they hold an interest of more than 50% and which are also non-U.S. financial institutions that fail) to provide certain information regarding their U.S. accountholders and/or certain U.S. investors (such U.S. accountholders and U.S. investors, 'U.S. accountholders') to the IRS.\n\nAmong the countries where Bancolombia operates, Colombia, the Cayman Islands, and Panama have signed an IGA Model 1.  In  addition,  certain  subsidiaries  of  Bancolombia  located  in other  countries have  transmitted directly to  the  IRS the information required pursuant to FATCA, since they have not entered into an IGA.\n\n## CRS\n\nThe CRS, approved by the OECD Council in 2014, is applicable to signatory countries of the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement ('MCAA') and requires signatory countries to obtain information from their financial institutions and  automatically  exchange  that  information  with  other  jurisdictions  on  an  annual  basis.  The  CRS  defines  (i)  which financial institutions are required to report; (ii) the types of accounts covered; and (iii) the due diligence procedures that financial institutions must follow to identify the reporting information.\n\nAmong the countries where Bancolombia operates, Colombia, Panam\u00e1 and Cayman Island, have entered into the MCAA.\n\nCompliance with the terms the international conventions signed for the exchange of information under CRS, the laws or any other regulations enforced in the relevant jurisdictions may increase Bancolombia's compliance costs.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Regulation in Panama\n\nThe banking business in Panama is regulated by the Law Decree 9 of 1998, subsequently amended by Law Decree 2 of 2008. In accordance with the Law Decree, as amended, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama, as the banking supervisor, has the power to issue agreements and resolutions to regulate the banking system. These regulations are mainly focused on matters such as licensing of banks, corporate governance, banking supervision (consolidated and individual or sub-consolidated), capital requirements, capital adequacy, liquidity requirements, risk management (credit, market, liquidity, country, asset and liability, operational, information technology, electronic banking), external audit, onsite inspections, reporting, compliance, change of control, mergers and acquisitions, confidentiality, money laundering, voluntary wind up, administrative and operational control, reorganization, bankruptcy, penalties, customers protection and dispute resolution.\n\nIn order to implement Basel III capital standards, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama issued in January 2015 an agreement on Capital Adequacy. This agreement sets forth the new composition of a banking institution's capital base, as well as the new capital adequacy ratio, including tier 1 core capital ratio and tier 1 capital ratio, all consistent with Basel III standards. This agreement became effective in June 2016 and as of January 1, 2019 the new standards are fully applicable. With respect to liquidity, banks operating under a general banking license, or General License Banks, are currently required to maintain 30% of their global deposits in liquid assets (which include short-term loans to other banks and other liquid assets) of the type prescribed by the Superintendency of Banks. Additionally, General License Banks are required to maintain assets in Panama of no less than 60% of their local deposits or any other percentage fixed by the Superintendency of Banks. Under the Banking Law, deposits from central banks and other similar depositories of the international reserves of sovereign states are immune from attachment or seizure proceedings. However, in 2018, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama, moving forward with the implementation of Basel III liquidity standards, issued an agreement on Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), also requiring General License Banks to maintain high quality liquid assets in relation to its short-term net cash outflows. Daily compliance with the LCR (High Quality Liquid Assets as a percentage of net cash outflows) are being implemented progressively, beginning on December 2018 with a compliance percentage of 25%, until achieving a 100% compliance percentage on 2022.\n\nThe Superintendency has also issued regulations, consistent with Basel III standards, regarding capital requirements for market risk on the trading book; and regulations to improve country risk management and operational risk management, as well as governance and controls regarding investment in securities.\n\nPanamanian  regulations  also  require  all  financial  institutions  to  maintain  a  legal  reserve  for  certain  obligations.  The Superintendency of Banks may require additional marginal reserves. The exact level and method of calculation of these reserve requirements is set by the Superintendency of Banks.\n\nAs for credit risk, in March 2016, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panam\u00e1 issued Accord No.3-2016, which sets forth new risk weights applicable to on and off-balance sheet credit exposures, which are more risk sensitive in line with Basel II. The Accord introduces the treatment of counterparty exposures in derivatives transactions, as well as credit risk mitigation techniques, such as the treatment of financial collaterals.\n\nIn Panama, banks are prohibited from granting, directly or indirectly, to any individual or legal person, including any entity that is part of the economic group of a bank, any loan or credit facility, guarantee or any other obligation (other than credit facilities  fully  secured  by  deposits  in  the  bank)  ('Credit  Facilities')  in  favor  of  said  person  exceeding  at  any  time, individually or jointly, 25% of the total regulatory capital of the bank. Obligations to related parties (as such term is defined in the applicable regulations) that exceed (i) 5% of its total capital, in the case of unsecured transactions, and (ii) 10% of its total capital, in the case of secured transactions (other than loans secured by deposits in the bank), are prohibited.\n\nBanks and banking groups (defined as the holding company and all direct and indirect subsidiaries of the holding company) are subject to inspection by the Superintendency of Banks, which must take place at least once every two years. The Superintendency of Banks is empowered to request from any bank or any company that belongs to the economic group of which  a  bank  in  Panama  is  a  member,  the  documents  and  reports  pertaining  to  its  operations  and  activities.  The Superintendency of Banks can assume the administrative and operating control of a bank, including possession of its assets and seizure of its management in order to defend the best interest of the bank's depositors and creditors, under any of the",

Upon expiration of the period of administrative control, the Superintendent will decide whether to proceed with the reorganization of the bank, the compulsory liquidation of the bank or the return of administrative and operating control to the directors or legal representatives of the bank, as the case may be.\n\nThe Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama is also in charge of the supervision and oversight of the trust business,  regulated  by  Law  1  of  1984,  which  set  forth  aspects  such  as  minimum  requirements  of  trust  agreements, characteristics of trusts, rights and responsibilities of grantors, trustees and beneficiaries.\n\nIn 2017, the Panamanian congress issued Law No.21 of 2017, which strengthens the oversight and regulation capabilities of the Superintendency of Banks, regarding the trust business. The Law imposes higher standards and provides for more detailed supervision, with respect to matters such as licensing, prudential regulation, corporate governance, reporting and customer protection, amongst others.\n\n## Other Regulations in Panama\n\nSecurities market activities in Panama are subject to the supervision, control and oversight of the Superintendency of the Securities Market. These activities are primarily regulated by Law Decree 1 of 1999, as amended by several laws, which established important changes in order to strengthen the regulatory framework of the Panamanian securities market and increase  investors'  confidence.  Among  the  most  important  changes  introduced  by  these  recent  amendments  are  the following:\n\n- 1. The establishment of a coordination and cooperation system between the financial supervisors. This system also enables a more comprehensive supervision of financial conglomerates operating in multiple areas of the financial industry.\n- 2. The establishment of the Superintendency of the Securities Market, as the supervising entity replacing the previous National Securities Commission.\n- 3. The authority given to the Superintendency of the Securities Market to carry the consolidated supervision, as home supervisor,  of  intermediaries  having  agencies  abroad,  and  to  enter  into  cooperation  agreements  with  foreign supervisors to facilitate the consolidated supervision.\n- 4. The regulation of foreign currency exchange as a securities activity and the regulation of certain actors of the securities market, such as securities price suppliers, risk rating agencies and Administrative Service Suppliers of the securities market.\n- 5. The introduction of provisions regarding clearing and settlement of securities and financial instruments, which will bring more stability and security to transactions.\n- 6. The  creation  of  new  participants  to  promote  over-the-counter  transactions,  such  as  entities  acting  as  central counterparties, and infrastructure providers for the over-the-counter market.\n\nThe principal aspects of the securities business covered by the Law-Decree 1 of 1999 as amended, and the agreements and resolutions  issued  by  the  Superintendency  of  the  Securities  Market  of  the  Republic  of  Panama  are  (i)  licensing requirements  of  securities  brokers,  investment  advisors,  fund  administrators  and  self-regulated  organizations,  (ii) registration  requirements  of  risk  rating  agencies,  securities  price  suppliers,  securities,  public  offerings,  funds  and administrative  service  suppliers  of  the  securities  market,  (iii)  authorization  for  requesting  voting  powers  regarding registered securities, (iv) notification requirements of public offerings for the acquisition of registered shares, (v) options, futures contracts and derivatives, (vi) custody, clearing and settlement of securities, (vii) penalization procedures and",

In Panama, anti-money laundering requirements are primarily regulated by (i) Executive Decree No. 136 of June 9, 1995, which created a Financial Analysis Unit ('UAF') for the Prevention of Money Laundering, and (ii) Law No. 23 of April 27, 2015 ('Law 23'), regulated by Executive Decree No. 363 of August 13, 2015, whereby banks and trust corporations, among other  financial  institutions,  are  required  to  perform  their  operations  with  due  diligence  and  due  care  conducive  to preventing  said  operations,  to  be  performed  with  funds,  or  over  funds,  generated  from  activities  related  to  money laundering.\n\nLaw 23 and Accord No. 7- of 2015 provide that the following entities are deemed to be 'supervised entities' for purposes of money laundering, financing of terrorism or any other illicit activity: (i) banks; (ii) bank groups; (iii) trust corporations; (iv) leasing companies; (v) factoring companies; (vi) credit, debit or pre-paid card processing entities; (vii) companies engaged in remittances or wire transfers; and (viii) companies that provide any other service related to trust companies. These entities must take necessary measures to prevent their operations and/or transactions from being used for money laundering, financing of terrorism or any other illicit activity, including tax evation. Non-compliance with Law 23, or those dictated by the pertinent authorities of supervision of each activity for which there is no specific sanction established, is subject  to  fines  ranging  from  US$5,000  to  US$1,000,000.  Recently,  following  recommendations,  from  the  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)Law No.70 of 2019 was enacted, to include tax evasion as an offense precedent to money laundering.\n\nPanama has also moved forward with the adoption of international standards on transparency and  cooperation on tax matters,  through  the  approval  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Agreement  for  the  implementation  of  FATCA  in  2016,  the commitment regarding the automatic exchange of information on a bilateral basis and under the Common Reporting Standard, beginning in September, 2018, and the ratification of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance on Tax Matters in 2017. All of the above will enable the exchange of information for tax matters between the Panamanian tax authorities, and a broader set of countries to implement these commitments. Regulations were adopted in 2016 and 2017 setting forth the obligations and responsibilities of banking institutions, regarding due diligence procedures in order to identify reportable accounts under FATCA and CRS, as well as responsibilities regarding control measures and reporting  requirements  necessary  to  comply  with  such  international  standards  and  agreements.  The  laws,  rules  and regulations issued for these purposes include: Law No.47 of 2016, Law No.51 of 2016, Law No.5 of 2017, Executive Decree  No.124  of  2017,  Executive  Decree  No.461  of  2017  and  the  Resolution  No.201-3931  of  2017  amended  by Resolution No.201-4488 of 2017.\n\n## Financial Regulation in El Salvador\n\nIn 2011, Decree 592, entitled 'Supervision and Regulation of the Financial System' ( Ley de Supervisi\u00f3n y Regulaci\u00f3n del Sistema Financiero ) was enacted in order to strengthen the State's organization, adapting all supervision and regulatory institutions to the economic reality of the financial system. Decree 592 states that the Superintendency of the Financial System and the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador are mandated to supervise all members of the financial system and to approve the necessary regulation for the adequate application of Decree 592.\n\nDecree  592's  main  objectives  are  to  maintain  stability  in  the  Salvadorian  financial  system,  to  guarantee  efficiency, transparency, security and solidity within the system, and to bring all its members in compliance with this law, and other applicable laws and regulations, all in accordance with best international practices.\n\nThe Superintendency of the Financial System is responsible for the supervision of the individual and consolidated activities of all the members in the Salvadorian financial system, as well as the people, operations and entities described in the law.",

In  2016  another amendment to Decree 592 was enacted in order to define the requirements that must be met by valuation experts when elaborating valuation reports in connection with guarantees of loans granted by financial entities.\n\n## Banking Law of El Salvador\n\nIn  1999,  Salvadorian  congress  enacted  Decree  697,  which  regulates  the  financial  intermediation  activities  and  other operations  performed  by  banks.  Banks  are  required  to  establish  the  regulatory  reserve  requirements  set  by  the Superintendency of the Financial System in accordance with the deposits and liabilities of each bank.\n\nAccording to the Salvadorian Superintendency of Financial System's regulations, the reserve requirements for Salvadorian banks as of December 31, 2020 are:\n\n|                               | Ordinary Reserve Requirements   %*   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Checking accounts             | 15%                                  |\n| Saving accounts               | 12%                                  |\n| Time deposits                 | 12%                                  |\n| Borrowings from foreign banks | 3%                                   |\n| Long-term debt (1)            | 5%- 15%                              |\n| Checking accounts             | 15%                                  |\n\n## Monetary Integration Law of El Salvador\n\nThe Monetary Integration Law adopted the U.S. dollar as the legal currency, establishing a fixed exchange rate of 8.75 Colones per USD 1.00.

        "page_content": "The following are some of the main considerations taken into account by the Superintendency of Banks in determining compliance with applicable regulations:\n\n- a) Minimum Reserve Requirements: Banking institutions are subject to a minimum reserve requirement of 14.6% over the deposits received by the institution, which must be kept in the form of immediately available deposits with the Banco de Guatemala. To verify compliance with the regulation, banking institutions must provide the Superintendence of Banks with a daily report detailing the minimum reserve requirement.\n- b) Loan Loss Reserves: In accordance with limitations specified by Decree 19 of 2002,(Banks and Financial Groups Law) and regulations issued by the Monetary Board, banking institutions, financial service entities, international banking entities and other financial institutions must carry out quarterly delinquency assessments of their credit and record reserves based on estimates of non-recoverability. Banking institutions and financial corporations must  provide  to  the  Superintendence  of  Banks  monthly  reports  concerning  outstanding  credits  in  effect  and movements and appraisals  of  credit  portfolios  in  accordance  with  criteria  specified  by  the  Monetary  Board. Additionally, the Superintendence of Banks carries out on-site reviews in which it evaluates payment ability and payment fulfillment of debtors and requests the institutions to record that necessary reserves be based on the nonpayment risk.\n- c) Capital  Requirements:  As  specified  in  regulations  issued  by  the  Monetary  Board,  banking  institutions  in Guatemala  must  have  a  minimum  capital  adequacy  ratio  (risk-weighted  assets  to  equity)  of  10%,  which  is consistent with the Basel I guidelines. Banks must submit a weekly report to the Superintendence of Banks for monitoring compliance with this requirement.\n- d) Related Party Transactions: In its on-site reviews the Superintendence of Banks verifies that financial institutions are in compliance with Monetary Board regulations limiting transactions between related parties. Related parties may conduct business with one another provided they do so in accordance with their normal standards of business. Article 47 of the Banks and Financial Groups Law establishes the limitations to carry out operations that imply direct and indirect financing of any nature, regardless of the legal form they take, such as, but not limited to, bonds, promissory notes, obligations and/or credits, or grant guarantees or endorsements, which together exceed the following thresholds:\n- 1. 15% of the assets computable to a single individual or legal person, of a private nature; or one State or autonomous company or entity.\n- 2. 30% of the assets computable to two or more related persons who are part of a risk unit.\n\nIn addition, when a bank has a deficit in its regulatory capital ( deficiencia patrimonial ), it must immediately report it to the Superintendence of Banks. The Monetary Board will immediately order the suspension of operations of a bank that has suspended payment of its obligations and has a deficit in regulatory capital that exceeds 50% of equity, or if it has not submitted to the Superintendence of Banks a recovery plan, or if such plan has been rejected or has not been complied with. In such a case, the Monetary Board will name an Assets and Liabilities Exclusion Board which will be responsible for suspending the obligations of the entity and closing its operations. If, after suspension of operations, the Board of Assets and Liabilities Exclusion reports to the Monetary Board that dissolution is inevitable, the Monetary Board must then instruct the Superintendence of Banks to request a judicial declaration of bankruptcy. Once bankruptcy proceedings commence, the Savings Protection Fund participates as the entity in charge of the recovery of depositor funds.\n\nThe Law for Banks and Financial Groups provides within a regularization plan, and if deemed convenient, at the discretion of the Monetary Board, limiting distributions to shareholders of a bank as well as the possibility of placing a member on the Board of Directors.\n\nDecree  No.  19-2002  regulates  the  creation,  organization,  merging,  activities,  operations,  functioning,  suspension  of operations  and  winding  up  of  banks  and  financial  entities,  as  well  as  the  establishment  and  closure  of  branches  and representation offices of foreign banks in Guatemala.",

In order to form such financial group conglomerates, it is necessary that the financial group has a bank.. The identification as a financial group does not entail that the financial group becomes a separate legal entity. Rather , the purpose of such identification is to allow the Superintendency of Banks to perform its supervision tasks on a consolidated basis.\n\n## Other Regulations in Guatemala\n\nDecree No. 94- 2000 permits and regulates the use, transfer and payment in foreign currencies, as well as the use of foreign currency accounts and deposits within the Guatemalan financial system. Corporations and other entities that wish to offer securities denominated in foreign currencies must obtain prior authorization from the Monetary Board.\n\nDecree No.67-2001 regulates the Anti-Money Laundering Law ( Ley Contra el Lavado de Dinero u Otros Activos ). The law was enacted to prevent and control money laundering in connection with criminal activities. Regulations issued by the Superintendency of Banks in accordance with this law went into effect on April 26, 2002. Among other things, the law and regulations created the Financial Intelligence Unit within the Superintendence of Banks under the name of Special Verification Intendancy ( Intendencia de Verificaci\u00f3n Especial - IVE ). The Special Verification Intendancy has developed a  national  network  for  the  prevention,  control  and  surveillance  of  money-laundering  activities.  Penalties  for  noncompliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations are set forth in the Superintendence of Banks Resolution 432002 and include fines for bank directors or employees and the suspension or cancellation of a financial institution's license.\n\n## B.9        CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK\n\nWith  cyber  security  incidents  in  the  financial  industry  growing  exponentially  in  terms  of  frequency  and  damage  to organizations' reputation, users and organizations must adequately deploy defenses to discourage would-be attackers' plans.  Materialization  of  cyber-security  risks  may  result  in  the  unauthorized  access  to  confidential  information, technological breaches of the infrastructure of the Bank with the aim of stealing information, fraud due to exploitation of vulnerabilities and the interruption of the Bank's services. The Bank's internal policies define cyber-security risk as the possibility of an economic or non-economic loss arising from a violation to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information that the Bank processes excluding damages caused directly in the information systems of our customers, because these are not managed by the Bank. Therefore, any materialization of a cyber risk in the systems of our customers cannot be attributable to the Bank whenever at least one of the following events occurs: (i) intentional interruption of the Bank's  informational  and  technological  infrastructure,  excluding  technological  or  operative  failures;  (ii)  successful unauthorized access to information or to a system; and (iii) unauthorized change in the Bank's hardware, firmware or software.\n\nOver recent years, the Bank has implemented a cyber-security management and control system that is designed to identify and protect critical assets, anticipate, identify and protect from cybersecurity threats, and respond and recover capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cyber-security event. This management system leverages the implementation of controls, which includes a governance framework to define policies, standards and architecture that provide assurance that information security strategies are aligned with and support business objectives, are consistent with applicable regulations, and provide assignment of responsibility, in an effort to manage risk, assets, user access control and identity management, secure software development lifecycle, IT infrastructure and business operations security, human resources security, data loss  prevention, information lifecycle management, third-party risk management, penetration testing and vulnerability management, cyber threat intelligence, security event monitoring, business resilience and cloud security. On the other hand, our cybersecurity teams strive to educate, support, and equip our employees with the knowledge and the tools to prevent, mitigate, and report cyber-attacks and incidents, and keep the Bank and customer's data protected.

        "page_content": "a series of awareness and sensitization activities were carried out for all our employees and third parties, in some cases with the support of experts in the field.\n\nThe Bank, as part of its strategy to be agile, flexible, and increasingly automated, has been implementing solutions in the cloud and cybersecurity and information security is also part of the strategy . The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic forced the organization to accelerate its digital transformation, using more cloud solutions, which create new challenges to protect information and the organization itself. The pandemic brought significant changes in Bancolombia's ways of working, forcing us to transition the work-from-home model, which was already implemented in specific and controlled organization roles, to a more massive expansion of this model in a short time. This transition brought with it additional challenges with new threats and increased the probability that existing ones might occur. Before the pandemic, work was done from corporate facilities, protected by the perimeter controls of the network and corporate workstations. In this new reality, this perimeter is extended with the remote work of employees and allies outside the organization, working from any  device  from  anywhere  in  the  world  and  accessing  information  and  services  of  the  organization.  In  this  context, Bancolombia implemented a strategy that made it possible to protect and maintain the operation of the organization's business processes, mitigating the security risks to which the organization was exposed by the new conditions, including those related to interruption, exposure, leakage or damage to the integrity of critical business information as well as the unavailability of resources and customer service.\n\nActions that we took that allowed the business to continue safely included: testing contingency scenarios enabling remote work schemes with a multiple factor authentication, the security evaluation of selected allies / third parties, the deployment of cybersecurity controls and information security in users' workstations as well, such as the implementation of data loss prevention  solutions,  the  strengthening  of  access  controls  and  identity  management,  strengthening  applications development based on best practices and cloud application authentication, actions to mitigate phishing, smishing and identity theft, protection of emails and collaborative tools, the adjustment of rules regarding safe browsing, as well as a strengthening  of  actions  to  maintain  and  improve  employees  and  clients'  culture  by  increasing  the  circulation  of newsletters and publications of recommendations and good practices training our employees to be the first firewall against cyber-attacks.\n\nThe framework used to manage cyber-security risks is designed under practices of international frameworks and standards issued  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  in  NIST  SP  800-30  and  NIST  Cybersecurity Framework,  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  in  ISO/IEC-27032,  as  well  as  the  definitions established by the Bank.\n\nThe cyber-security and information security division of the Bank is responsible for cyber-security risk management, a function performed together with the business processes, technology, risk and internal audit teams, considering the nature of the Bank, its risk appetite, customer needs, business strategy and the environment of the financial industry.\n\nThe  framework  seeks  to  ensure  that  the  risks  are  identified,  measured,  controlled  and  monitored,  and  considers  the international and regional best practices and regulations. The cyber-security risk management system is designed as a three lines model, distinguishing between three groups involved in effective risk management: (i)  a first line of action, which is responsible for defining information security strategy and the preventive detection and isolation of advanced threats, (ii) a second line of action that establishes the risk management framework to provide timely information that supports upper management in their decision making process, and (iii) a third line of action that supports regulatory compliance, the strengthening of good practices in information security and the independent supervision of the of the implementation of the first two lines of action.\n\nThe Bank's senior management is committed to cybersecurity risk management, through a clear strategy which includes the allocation of human, technical and financial resources and a clear definition and disclosure of responsibilities regarding to cybersecurity. Senior management has stablished a cybersecurity and information security committee, responsible for: approving and promoting the most important policies, strategies and projects, being informed and making decisions about associated  controls,  periodically  evaluating  the  strategic  and  tactical  plans  of  compliance,  the  review,  approval  and prioritization of initiatives or decisions as well as the prioritization of the use of the allocated budget. This Committee is formed by seven vice presidents of the following vice presidencies: Bancolombia's Corporate Services Vice-presidency, Banistmo's Corporate Services Vice-presidency, BAM's Corporate Services Vice-presidency, Banco Agr\u00edcola's Corporate",

The Risk Corporate Vice Presidency is responsible for proposing the methodology, procedures and tools for cyber-security related risks management and the management policies which is approved by the Board of Directors; ensuring that an appropriate cyber-security risk management process is maintained and keeping the Board of Directors informed of its effectiveness according to the approved guidelines and methodologies; and analyzing periodically the reports that are submitted  by  the  senior  management  on  cyber-security  risk  exposure,  exposures  substantial  changes,  tolerance  level compliance and mitigation and management measures adopted by the Bank. All members of the Board of Directors receive periodic reports on the level of compliance with the approved policies and procedures for cyber-security risk management, as well as relating to the causes of any breaches and the measures adopted to address the gaps identified by the cybersecurity and Information Security Committee, to consider any corrective actions required.\n\nIn 2020, Bancolombia invested 31.6 million USD in activities related to preventive, detective and corrective efforts for cybersecurity  management,  including:  insurance  policies,  human  resources  costs,  security  solutions  licensing  and  the administration and maintenance of cybersecurity controls for the Bank. In 2020, Bancolombia had no cybersecurity and information security incidents that could have materially affected the Bank in an economic or non-economic manner, in accordance with the definition and criteria defined by the Bank for that purpose. Therefore, no costs are associated with its  remediation or consequences.  Additionally, cybersecurity and information security reports are generated every six months  for  the  review  by  the  members  of  Bancolombia's  board  of  directors,  where  the  status  of  cybersecurity  and information security  is  reported.  Bancolombia  did  not  experience  direct  cybersecurity  impacts  due  to  the  COVID  19 pandemic, however in 2020 there was an increase in phishing attacks on our clients in which the Bank identified and dismantled 6,292 fraudulent sites, making 2020 the period with the greatest cybersecurity impacts in during the last 10 years.\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the Bank has not faced a cyber-attack with a material impact on its business or customers. However, we can give no assurance that the previously described measures, initiatives and procedures will be effective to prevent or mitigate potential future attacks or threats to our technology infrastructure. Any failure by the Bank to  detect  or  prevent  cyber-security  risk  in  a  timely  manner  could result  in  a  negative  impact  on  the  Bank's  results  of operations  and  financial  position,  or  in  problems  with  information,  including  data  related  to  customers  being  lost, compromised, or delivered to the Bank's customers with delays or errors. The public perception that a cyber-attack on its systems may be successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage the Bank's reputation with customers and third parties with whom it does business.\n\n## B.10        COVID-19 CONSIDERATIONS\n\nSince the beginning of March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 impacted the Bank's operations, customers, suppliers, and employees. This circumstance affected the Bank's Colombian and Central American operations. Despite a better trend since the third quarter of 2020, at the start of 2021 the number of cases of COVID-19 has increased. It remains unclear at this time how the developments in relation to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of the ongoing vaccination plan will evolve through 2021.  The Bank will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nAs a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 17, 2020 the Colombian government declared the social, economic and ecological emergency. Pursuant to such declaration, the government issued Decree 457 of 2020, which includes a mandatory shelter-in-place order within Colombia, as well as the suspension of international and domestic flights.  In June 2020, the Colombian government issued External Circular 022 with instructions regarding the debtor support program (PAD), requiring that lending institutions, such as  the Bank, adopt a program that allows to re-define the conditions of the credits of those debtors that were affected by the outbreak of COVID-19.  In December the Colombian government issued the External Circular 039 that extended the program (PAD) until June 30, 2021.  Also, new measures were adopted in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency procedures in order to preserve the continuity and viability of business affected by the pandemic.",

        "page_content": "The Colombian Central Bank reduced the reserve requirements of Credit institutions for demand deposits and deposits with maturities fewer than 180 days, as an additional response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These surpluses were ordered to be temporarily invested in debt instruments issued by the Government (T\u00edtulos de Solidaridad - TDS) to address the liquidity needs of the pandemic.\n\nDuring 2020, many countries, including those where the Bank operates directly or through its subsidiaries (Panam\u00e1, El Salvador and Guatemala) imposed similar measures, such as mandatory shelter-in-place and the closing of borders or travel prohibitions, in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These restrictions adversely affected the economies of the jurisdictions where the Bank operates and its ability to conduct businesses as usual in those jurisdictions.\n\nTo mitigate the negative effects caused by COVID-19 the Colombian government enacted measures to provide liquidity to the economy, to financially assist vulnerable populations and to provide funding to companies in sectors that are of national  importance,  including  the  banking  sector.  With  the  same  purpose,  Bancolombia  adopted  actions  to  help  its customers and the national economy overall, by offering special credit lines and conditions such as deadline extensions to facilitate clients's fulfillment of their obligations, and establishing special interest rates for the acquisition of basic goods such as food and medication through Bancolombia's credit cards.\n\nSimilar  measures  were  adopted  by  the  governments  of  the  jurisdictions  where  the  Bank  operates.  For  instance,  the Panamanian government, in the absence of a central bank, implemented an assistance plan for vulnerable populations and small  business  through  direct  financial  assistance  and  tax  benefits,  the  Salvadorian  government  adopted  measures  to preserve market liquidity through approval of additional national funding and the Guatemalan government created the 'Capital Protection Fund' which sought to grant loans with special interest rates for both individuals and businesses.\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the Bank invoked business continuity plans in these subsidiaries and so far, it has been able to maintain an acceptable level of service with minimal disruption to its customers. Since the outset of COVID19, the Bank reacted very quickly to protect the health of its employees and customers, to continue its operations and to support its clients, as well as to work with governments in order to define and implement strategies.\n\nThe Bank implemented special attention protocols, establishing a limit on customer capacity in its physical branches to avoid crowds, limited hours of service, provided exclusive times for elderly customers, provided free digital account opening for pensioners and implemented self-manage solutions.  The Bank also increased the number of advisers assigned to customer service and promoted flexible remote working solutions for employees. Digital channels were enhanced, so that most of our customers' needs could be attended virtually, and daily payment caps and digital transfer amounts were increased.\n\nFor its employees, the Bank established psychological support, a special support line for women, and a health prevention and promotion strategy which consisted mainly in, communications to reinforce the biosafety protocol and correct use of face masks for all employees, promoting a culture of self-care, use of apps and technology to control the pandemic which updated the employees daily with a proactive alert of cases, special support options designed to provide tools to employees to deal with the different situations generated by the pandemic such as, meditation workshops, yoga workshops, talks on managing emotions, talks on managing anxiety, and talks with experts on topics such as cabin syndrome, anxiety, and stress.\n\nBecause of the outbreak of the COVID-19 the Banks deposits increased and remained high throughout the year.  Another impact of COVID-19 was the significant increase in provision charges driven by the deterioration in credit conditions of the  loan  portfolio  and  the  risk  profile  of  our  customers.  The  Bank,  through  its  different  operating  entities,  such  as Bancolombia,  Banistmo  in  Panama,  Banco  Agr\u00edcola  in  El  Salvador  and  BAM  in  Guatemala,  has  adopted  different measures according to the conditions and needs of each jurisdiction.\n\nIf the COVID-19 outbreak continues to cause disruption to economic activity in Colombia and Central America through 2021, there could be adverse impacts on other assets, such as the Bank's investment portfolio, joint ventures and associates, as well as impacts on its income due to lower lending and transaction volumes, and fee revenue, which may impact the Bank's profitability and capital position.",

        "page_content": "In response to these challenges, during 2020 the Bank has taken additional prudential measures to evaluate any potential impact  on  the  carrying  value  of  goodwill  and  long-lived  assets,  performing  interim  impairment  test,  that  showed  no additional impacts to those already recognized in the financial statements.  Currently, it is still difficult to determine the impacts on the Bank's impairment assessment of long-lived assets, loans and financial leases, associates, investments, among other assets. However, the Bank must continue to consider both internal and external sources of information to determine  the  recoverable  amounts  and  fair  value  of  the  assets.  Likewise,  changes  in  economic  conditions  will  be monitored by the Bank as new information becomes available as to reflect in macroeconomic scenarios when assessing impairment of assets.\n\nThe  Bank  put  in  place  a  strategy  to  closely  monitor  its  liquidity  levels,  considering  loan  commitments,  maturity  of liabilities, and withdrawals of deposits, among other factors, in order to enhance the cash position and liquid assets. In addition, the Central Bank of Colombia took measures to offer liquidity lines to financial institutions that needed extra support and avoid disruptions in inter-bank borrowings.\n\nNevertheless, despite the measures instated by the government and the Bank, the progression of COVID-19 may continue to cause negative impacts on the economy and the Bank's performance such as the above-mentioned consequences.\n\nFor more information on the Bank's risks associated to COVID-19, refer to Item 3.D.

Volume and rate variances have been calculated based on movements in average balances over the period and changes in nominal interest rates on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities. Net changes attributable to changes in both volume and interest rate have been allocated to the change due to changes in volume.\n\n|

OPERATING RESULTS\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 3.A 'Selected Financial Data' of this Annual Report and the Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included in this Annual Report.\n\nThe following  discussion  includes  information  regarding  future  financial  performance  and  plans,  targets,  aspirations, expectations, and objectives of management, which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is possible that the Bank's actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the  forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. In addition, please refer to the discussion in Item 3. 'Key Information - D. Risk Factors' for a description of risks and uncertainties affecting the Bank's business and financial results and to Item 4 B. 'Business Overview, B.9 Cybersecurity Framework', for a description of the Bank's cybersecurity framework.\n\nThe following  discussion does  not  address  certain  items  in  respect  of  2018  in  reliance  on  amendments  to  disclosure requirements adopted by the SEC in 2019. A discussion of these items may be found in the Bank's Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on April 27, 2020.\n\n## IMPACT OF ECONOMIC AND MONETARY POLICIES ON BANCOLOMBIA'S RESULTS\n\nBancolombia's results of operations are affected by macroeconomic factors principally in Colombia, but also in the other countries where the Bank operates. The most important variables include GDP growth, unemployment rate, interest rates, inflation and exchange rates, principally the COP/USD exchange rate. The following discussion summarizes the trends of these measures in Colombia in 2020.\n\n## Economic activity\n\nConsistent with what happened in other parts of the world, Colombia's GDP contracted during 2020 with a real GDP contraction of 6.8%, compared with 3.3% growth reached in 2019. The deterioration in the economic condition is mainly due  to  the  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  resulting  restrictive  measures  imposed  in  Colombia,  which severely affected the economy.\n\nThe  changes  in  key  GDP  components  in  2020  compared  with  2019  were  as  follows:  investment  decreased  21.2%, consumption decreased 4.1%, imports decreased 18.0% and exports decreased 17.4%. In 2020, gross capital formation represented  18.83%  of  GDP,  household  consumption  represented  69.73%,  government  consumption  17.72%,  exports 13.68% and imports 19.97%.\n\nThe sectors that showed most contraction during the year were construction (27.7% decrease), retail sales (6.6% decrease) and mining (19.3% decrease).\n\nThe unemployment rate for 2020 in Colombia was 15.9%, higher than the 10.5% registered in 2019.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nConsistent with what happened in other parts of the world, interest rates remained low during 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, the Colombian Central Bank's benchmark interest rate stood at 1.75%, after a 250 basis points cut during 2020. Considering the current circumstances, it is expected that interest rates may remain stable at low yields.\n\nThe Central Bank aims to maintain long term inflation rates within the long-term targeted range (between 2% and 4%), and in order to do so, it may increase interest rates when the economy recovers and begins to grow again.",

        "page_content": "## Inflation\n\nThe year-end inflation rate for 2020 was 1.61%, lower than the 3.80% recorded for 2019. The components that led inflation in 2020 were food and nonalcoholic beverages (4.80% increase), education (7.02% decrease), alcoholic beverages and tobacco (2.61% increase) and restaurants and hotels (3.43% increase).\n\nInflation  levels  recorded  a  historical  low  point  below  the  Central  Bank's  target,  which  would  indicate  no  significant changes to monetary policy in the short term, as a result of lower economic activity due to COVID-19.\n\n## Exchange rate\n\nThe Colombian Peso depreciated 4.74% versus the U.S. dollar during 2020, compared to a depreciation of 0.84% in 2019. The increase in depreciation is explained by the high volatility that the exchange rate experienced throughout 2020 with a maximum of 4,153.91 and a minimum of 3,253.89.\n\n## Outlook\n\nFuture prospects for the Colombian financial sector in general, and for Bancolombia in particular, are expected to depend primarily on the factors listed below:\n\n| Favorable factors for the Colombian economy - medium-term                                                            | Unfavorable factors for the Colombian economy - medium term                                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Strength of private consumption, because of tax relief for low-income  households and increase of spending capacity. | Underdeveloped infrastructure that continues to constrain growth.                                                    |\n| Better  perspective  on  investment  from  private  sector  and  main  infrastructure projects.                      | Oil and gas dependent export activity.

While  Bancolombia  maintained  its  strong  competitive  position  and  full-service  financial  model,  this situation meaningfully negatively impacted the Bank's operations, customers, suppliers and employees. For the year 2020, net income attributable to equity holders of the parent company totaled COP 276 billion (COP 347 per share, including both common and preferred shares, and USD 0.40 per ADR), which represents a decrease of 91.15% as compared to COP 3,118 billion of net income attributable to equity holders of the parent company for the fiscal year 2019.\n\nBancolombia's average return on stockholders' equity for 2020 was 1.02%, down from 12.09% in 2019.",

        "page_content": "The net interest and valuation income margin decreased in 2020 and stood at 4.91% for the year, down from 5.67% in 2019.\n\nCredit impairment charges, net of recoveries, totaled COP 7,527 billion for 2020, up 120.64% from COP 3,411 billion in 2019. The higher amount of provisions was the result of general deterioration in the portfolio quality because of the impact of COVID-19 and the imposition of restrictive measures, which severely affected our customers.\n\nLoans and advances to customers and financial institutions net grew 2.01% during the year. This performance was driven primarily by commercial and mortgages loans, as well as a result of COP depreciation against the USD. The total loan book denominated in COP grew 5.80% while USD-denominated loans declined 1.30% for the year.\n\nAllowance for loans and lease losses represented 8.13% of total loans and 164.95% of 30-day past-due loans (excluding accrued interest) at the end of 2020 compared with 5.71% of total loans and 133.94% of past-due loans (excluding accrued interest) at the end of December 31, 2019.\n\nThe Bank expects that the existing level of coverage will provide adequate coverage for expected credit losses. Capital adequacy was 14.74% (Tier 1 ratio of 11.24%) under Basel III, higher than the 12.82% (Tier 1 ratio of 9.57%) reported at the end of 2019, principally due to the early implementation of Basel III standards in 2020.\n\nDeposits by customers increased 15.02% during 2020, while the ratio of net loans to deposits was 96.7% at the end of the year, down from 109% in December 31, 2019.\n\n## Net interest margin and valuation income on financial instruments before impairment on loans and financial leases and off-balance sheet credit instruments\n\nFor 2020, net interest income and valuation was COP 10,826 billion, down 3.35% from COP 11,201 billion in 2019.  Net interest  margin  from  continuing  operations  decreased  76  basis  points  from  5.67%  to  4.91%  during  the  year.    This performance is the result of the combined effect of the 250 basis points cut in the Central Bank's reference rate, lower accrued interest income from costumers that experienced a credit rating deterioration and a lower net present value of the loan book as a consequence of the reliefs measures offered to some customers.\n\nThe weighted average nominal interest rate on loans and financial leases ended at 8.3% in 2020 down from 9.4% in 2019. At the same time, interest income, which is the sum of interest on loans, financial leases, overnight funds and interest and valuation income from investment securities, totaled COP 16,689 billion in 2020, down 3.98% as compared to COP 17,381 billion in 2019 because of lower interest income on loans and financial leases.\n\nInterest on investment securities, which includes, among other items, the interest paid or accrued on debt instruments and mark-to-market valuation adjustments, totaled COP 215 billion in 2020, 59.03% lower than 2019. The securities portfolio was larger, on average, in 2020 as compared to 2019, because of the increase in liquidity during 2020.\n\nThe strategy implemented by Bancolombia in recent years has consisted of increasing the proportion of consumer loans in the overall portfolio.  However, during 2020 the Bank maintained a relatively stable market share in the segments where it operates as compared to 2019.  During the year in review, the Bank focused on addressing needs of its customers and strengthening its capital and liquidity position as a result of the breakout of COVID-19.\n\nBancolombia  was  active  in  the  deposit  markets  to  secure  necessary  funding.  Interest  rates  declined  during  the  year, releasing pressure from the cost of this funding source. Interest rate cuts tend to put pressure on margins because of the asset-sensitive nature of the Bank's balance sheet. Nevertheless, management's goal has been to maintain a low sensitivity of the balance sheet in order to avoid potential pressures on margins due to decreases in reference rates.\n\nInterest expenses totaled COP 5,863 billion in 2020, down 5.13% as compared to COP 6,180 billion in 2019. The decrease in interest expenses is mainly due to the increase in deposits in saving and checking accounts that helps reduce deposit costs, the decrease in outstanding debt securities and the decrease in borrowings with other financial institutions. Overall, the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 2.7 % in 2020, lower than the 3.3% of 2019.",

This increase was driven primarily by an increased level in fees and commissions income, higher than the increase in  fees  and  commissions expenses. An increase in fees and commissions derived from bancassurance was one of the determining factors in the increase in income, partially offset by the negative impact on the other banking services as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nThe strategy of Bancolombia in relation to fee and commission income is to promote financial services and other revenue lines that complement the lending business. Activities related to cash management, payment methods and bancassurance are the main components of this strategy.\n\nThe Bank continued to promote and increase the volumes of credit and debit card transactions through initiatives with retailers as well as commercial incentives. This strategy involved advertising campaigns as well as enhanced use of reward and loyalty schemes relating to the use of Bancolombia-issued credit cards and debit cards, which contributed to a faster expansion of this revenue line. The growth in consumer loans and credit card outstanding also contributed to the growth in fees related to these products.\n\nIn the commercial area, efforts have been focused on the small and medium size business, mainly through the promotion of comprehensive banking, cash management services and electronic platforms for treasury management. The pace of growth in these business lines was slow in 2020, due to the slowdown in economic activity.",

Such increase is due to higher volumes in assets under leasing.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nThe following table summarizes the principal components of Bancolombia's operating expenses for the last two fiscal years:\n\n|                                           | For the years ended December 31,   | For the years ended December 31,   | Growth  2020-2019   | Growth  2020-2019               |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                           | 2020                               | 2019                               |                     |                                 |\n|                                           | In millions of COP                 | In millions of COP                 | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP              |\n| Operating expenses                        |                                    |                                    |                     |                                 |\n| Salaries and employee benefits            | 3,044,730                          | 3,366,824   (322,094)    (9.57) %  |                     |                                 |\n| Other administrative and general expenses | 3,140,789                          | 3,069,058                          | 71,731              | 2.34 %                          |\n| Taxes other than income tax               | 765,766                            | 757,820                            | 7,946               | 1.05 %                          |\n| Impairment, depreciation and amortization | 837,790                            | 824,590                            | 13,200              | 1.60 %                          |\n| Other operating expenses                  | 206,070                            |                                    |                     | 235,525    (29,455)   (12.51) % |\n| Total operating expenses                  | 7,995,145                          | 8,253,817   (258,672)    (3.13) %  |                     |                                 |\n\nThe following table summarizes the principal components of Bancolombia's operating expenses for the years ended:\n\n|                                           | For the years ended December 31,   | Growth                           | Growth                           |                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                           | 2018  2019-2018  InmillionsofCOP   | 2018  2019-2018  InmillionsofCOP | 2018  2019-2018  InmillionsofCOP | 2018  2019-2018  InmillionsofCOP |\n| Operating expenses                        |                                    |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Salaries and employee benefits            | 3,366,824                          |                                  | 3,004,054   362,770    12.08 %   |                                  |\n| Other administrative and general expenses | 3,069,058                          | 3,024,769    44,289              | 1.46 %                           |                                  |\n| Taxes other than income tax               | 757,820                            | 692,666    65,154                | 9.41 %                           |                                  |\n| Impairment, depreciation and amortization | 824,590                            |                                  | 493,902   330,688    66.95 %     |                                  |\n| Other operating expenses                  | 235,525                            |                                  | 267,507   (31,982)   (11.96) %   |                                  |\n| Total operating expenses                  | 8,253,817                          |                                  | 7,482,898   770,919    10.30 %   |                                  |\n\nFor 2020, operating expenses totaled COP 7,995 billion, down 3.13% as compared to COP 8,254 billion in 2019, as a result of measures aimed at controlling costs and gains in efficiency and automation of processes.\n\nSalaries and employee benefits totaled COP 3,045 billion in 2020, down 9.57% as compared to 2019. Such decrease was primarily driven by Bancolombia's decision to decrease the incentive compensation plan in Colombia.\n\nOther administrative and general expenses totaled COP 3,141 billion in 2020, up 2.34% as compared to 2019,\n\nAs a result of the changes in expenses and revenues, the cost to income ratio of Bancolombia for 2020 was 50.51%, compared to 51.13% in 2019.\n\n## Provision Charges and Credit Quality\n\nFor the year 2020, credit impairment charges on loans and advances and financial leases (net of recoveries) totaled COP 7,527 billion (or 3.9% of average loans), which represents an increase of 120.64% as compared to COP 3,411 billion (or 1.9% of average loans) in 2019. The significant increase in provision charges was driven by the deterioration in credit",

        "page_content": "conditions of the loan portfolio and the risk profile of our customers due to the impact of COVID-19.  Provision charges as a result of an update of macroeconomic scenarios as a result of COVID-19, as well as the effect of COVID-19 on our customers were the main reasons for the increase in credit impairment charges on loans for the year.\n\nNet loan charge-offs totaled COP 2,600 billion in 2020, down 30.29% from the 3,730 billion in 2019. The decline in charge-offs is due to the write-off of Electricaribe, a large corporate client during 2019.  The impact of COVID-19 is still not materially reflected in charge-offs because of the relief and support programs granted to some of our customers during the year. A portion of the reliefs ended during the second half of 2020, and some of these became past-due.\n\nPast-due loans amounted to COP 10,467 billion as of December 31, 2020, up 23.98% as compared to COP 8,443 billion as of December 31, 2019.  As long as the relief and support programs continue to be effective, the impact of COVID-19 will not be fully reflected in past-due loans.\n\nThe past-due loan ratio (loans overdue more than 30 days divided by total loans) reached 5.47% as of December 31, 2020, up from 4.63% as of December 31, 2019. The increase in this ratio is mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting restrictive measures imposed in the different countries where the Bank has presence.\n\n## Income Tax Expenses\n\nFor fiscal year 2020, we recovered COP 6,5 billion in income tax, compared with an income tax expense of COP 1.263 billion in 2019. The effective tax rate for 2020 was 2.13%.\n\nThe income tax recovery in 2020 was mainly due to the tax impacts on operations in Colombia. Some of the specific factors were related to tax principles that do not depend on accounting net income such as tax discounts corresponding to the  payment  of  local  taxes  in  Colombia,  and  exemptions  related  to  the  mortgage  portfolio  for  social  housing  and investments in productive fixed assets.\n\n## RESULTS BY SEGMENT\n\nThe Bank manages its business through 9 main operating segments: Banking Colombia, Banking El Salvador, Banking Panama, Banking Guatemala, Trust, Investment Banking, Brokerage, International Banking and All Other.\n\nDuring 2018, the investments in Leasing Per\u00fa S.A, Capital Investment Safi S.A. and Fondo de Inversi\u00f3n en Arrendamiento Operativo Renting Per\u00fa were wound-up. The investment in Arrendamiento Operativo CIB S.A.C. was classified as Asset held for sale and was sold on March 29, 2019.\n\nDuring 2020, Bancolombia faced one of the most challenging years of its recent history due to the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic. While Bancolombia maintained its strong competitive position and full-service financial model, including the diversity of its leading franchises, this situation meaningfully negatively impacted the Bank's operations, customers, suppliers and employees.\n\nBanking Colombia: this segment provides retail and corporate banking products and services to individuals, companies and national and local governments in Colombia. The Bank's strategy in Colombia is to grow with these clients based on value added and long-term relationships. In order to offer specialized services to individuals, small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) and big size enterprises, the Bank's retail sales force targets the clients classified as: Personal, Plus and Entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Bank's corporate and government sales force targets and specializes in companies with more than COP 100,000 million  in  revenue  in  twelve  economic  sectors:  Agribusiness,  Commerce,  Manufacturing  of  Supplies  and  Materials, Consumer  Goods,  Financial  Services,  Health,  Education,  Construction,  Government,  Infrastructure,  Real  Estate,  and Natural Resources.\n\nThis segment is also responsible for the management of the Bank's proprietary trading activities, liquidity and distribution of treasury products and services to its client base in Colombia.",

However, during 2020 the Bank maintained relatively stable market share in the segments where it operates.

decreased to a loss of COP (394) billion from profit of COP 2,906 billion in 2019 due to the reasons described below.\n\nTotal interest and valuation decreased by 7.91% to COP 11,944 billion despite the moderate growth in the loan portfolio of 4.64%,  mainly due to the economic environment in Colombia including the 250 basis points reduction in the central bank's reference rate, lower accrued interest income derived from clients that experienced a credit rating deterioration and lower present value of the loan portfolio as a consequence of the relief granted to our clients in light of the effects of COVID-19.  This  decrease  was  mainly  reflected  in  the  interest  income  decline  from  commercial  loans  by  11.76%, mortgages by 10.19%, and leasing by 5.94%.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net increased by 129.67% to COP 5,890 billion. This increase is mainly due to higher provisions  recorded  during  2020  due  to  the  deterioration  of  the  consumer  portfolio,  COVID-19  and  the  update  of macroeconomic variables in our expected losses models.\n\nTotal fees and commission net, increased by 0.28% to COP 1,978 billion, due to the better performance of credit and debit cards, which increased by 17.12% and because the Bancassurance and Insurance business increased by 12,84%.

        "page_content": "increases were partially offset by the decreases in banking services by 22.15% and merchant acquiring services & ATM fees by 196.26%.\n\nOther operating income increased 88.45% during 2020 to COP 818 billion from COP 434 billion in 2019, mainly explained by higher income from derivatives foreign exchange contracts due to higher volatility levels on the FX market caused by the uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher income from operating lease contracts as a result of higher volumes of operations and delivered assets.\n\nDividends received and share of profits of equity method investees decreased to COP 43 billion from COP 131 billion in 2019, due to less performance and less income generation from equity investments because of COVID-19.\n\nTotal operating expenses decreased by 4.23% to COP 5,373 billion. This decrease was mainly due to a 12.92% reduction in staff costs, 93.09% reduction in bonuses, 31.04% reduction in severance payments, 17.48% reduction in advertising and 73.71% reduction in travel expenses.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Colombia grew by 8.10% during the year, mainly driven by growth in the loan book.\n\nBanking El Salvador through Banco Agr\u00edcola S.A. : this segment provides retail and commercial banking products and services  to  individuals,  companies  and  national  and  local  governments  in  El  Salvador  through  Banco  Agr\u00edcola  S.A.

Interest income from commercial loans, consumer loans and leasing operations grew by 11.29%, 28.41% and 4.17%, respectively.\n\nTotal interest and valuation expressed in COP increased by 12.04% to COP 1,226 billion as an effect of FX variation. In USD,  net  interest  income  declined  during  the  year  in  line  with  the  contraction  in  the  loan  book.  Consumer  loans denominated in USD decreased 1.19%, commercial 3.94% and mortgages 3.48%.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net was COP 367 billion, an increase of 341.21% from 2019, caused by higher provisions expenses during 2020 as a result of COVID-19, increased to cover the higher credit risk represented by the operation of some clients.\n\nTotal fees and commissions, net increased by 3.50% to COP 215 billion mainly due to a growth in fees from banking services, credit and debit cards and remittances.\n\nTotal operating expenses remained relatively stable, increasing 0.51% to COP 494 billion, mainly due to the reduction in bonus plan payments and the annual increase in salaries and social security contributions. Expenses related to impairment, depreciation and amortization were significant during 2019 because of the implementation of IFRS16, but they were not reflected in 2020.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking El Salvador grew by 12.17% during the year, mainly driven by growth in loans and by the depreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD dollars.\n\nBanking  Panama: this  segment  provides  retail  and  commercial  banking  products  and  services  to  individuals  and companies in  Panama  through  the  Banistmo  operation.

valuation increased in COP terms mainly as a result of the depreciation of such currency. When measured in USD, net interest income dropped during 2020, despite a modest growth in the overall loan book. By segments, the consumer portfolio increased 4.51% and mortgages 3.44% whereas commercial loans reported a decrease of 1.84%.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net were COP 908 billion, increasing by 122.45% compared with COP 408 billion for 2019. This increase is explained by higher provision charges as a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the higher credit risk represented by the operation of some clients.\n\nTotal fees and commission, net decreased by 6.63% to COP 193 billion, due to lower income generated by merchant acquiring services and ATM fees.\n\nTotal operating expenses decreased in USD by 7.88%, despite a growth in COP as a result of the FX effect. Such reduction is  mainly  related  to  a  reduction  of  2.39%  in  staff  costs  and  by  100%  in  bonus  plan  payments.  Expenses  related  to impairment, depreciation and amortization were significant during 2019 as a result of the implementation of IFRS16.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Panama increased by 5.62% during the year, mainly driven by growth in the loan book and by the depreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD dollars.\n\nBanking  Guatemala :  this  segment  provides  retail  and  commercial  banking  and  insurance  products  and  services  to individuals, companies and national and local governments in Guatemala through Banco Agromercantil de Guatemala S.A..

2019 due to the reasons described below.\n\nTotal interest and valuation increased by 12.64%, to COP 1,102, billion due to a better performance of the loan book. Commercial loans grew by 7.44%, consumer by 10.57% and mortgages by 10.48%. Interest income from commercial loans grew by 16.01% and consumer by 10.93%, whereas interest from mortgages decreased by 10.54%.\n\nTotal interest and valuation experienced a slight decrease in USD during 2020. Lower accrued interest income from clients who experienced a credit rating deterioration due to a combination of relief granted to the client and restructured loans is principally responsible for such decrease, despite a growth when measured in COP because of the FX depreciation. The credit portfolio expressed in USD grew, with commercial loans increasing by 2,58%, consumer by 5.56% and mortgages by 5.48%.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net decreased by 10.88% to COP 297 billion. This decrease is mainly due to a higher reversal in loan portfolio provisions during 2020, primarily on commercial loans, due to certain changes made in the expected loss models with respect to macro variables projections such as GDP to reflect Guatemala economic recovery pace. The pandemic has affected the Guatemalan economy, although not as much as other countries in the region. The good performance of the agricultural sector has partially offset the negative effects of other industries; in recent months, the economy has started to show signs of recovery. In addition, in 2019 there was a deterioration of specific clients that",

Administration and general expenses increased by 12.71% due to expenses associated with data processing, insurance and maintenance work.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Guatemala increased by 13.75% during the year, mainly due to the growth in the loan book and by the depreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD dollars.\n\nTrust : this segment provides trust and asset management services to clients in Colombia through Fiduciaria Bancolombia S.A.

banking segment decreased to COP 87 billion from COP 461 billion in 2019, mainly due to lower income from loans and operations with derivatives.\n\nTotal interest and valuation decreased by 43.35% to COP 348 billion, driven by lower revenues from commercial loans, overnight and market funds and derivatives instruments.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net increased by 392.77%, to COP 56 billion from COP (19) billion in 2019, primarily due to higher provision charges in terms of commercial loans and financial leases, and the absence of reversals in the loan portfolio provisions reflected in 2019. These reversals of provisions charges in 2019 were mainly due to some customer prepayments of financial leasing operations in Panama.\n\nTotal fees and commission, net increased by 11.05%, to COP 24 billion, mainly due to higher fees from banking services, acceptances, guarantees and standby letters of credits.",

        "page_content": "Other operating income decreased to COP 887 billion in 2020 compared to COP 986 billion in 2019. This decrease is mainly due to the reduction from operating leases and the decline from gains on sale of subsidiaries.\n\nDividends and net income on equity investments decreased from COP 270 billion to COP 54 billion, because of a lower net income generated from equity method investments, and the sale of several companies accounted as equity investments at both amortized cost and fair value through OCI during 2019.\n\nAssets attributable to All Other increased by 4.89% to COP 10,408 billion.\n\n## B.          LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## B.1        LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING\n\n## Liquid Assets\n\nOne of the main guidelines of the Bank is to maintain a solid liquidity position, therefore, the ALCO Committee, has established a minimum level of liquid assets, based on the funding needs of each subsidiary, to ensure, as far as possible, that  it  will  always  have  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  its  liabilities  when  they  are  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Bank's reputation.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Bank seeks the optimum level of liquid assets to assure not only the proper operation under normal conditions but also to operate under stress market scenarios. During 2020, the Bank maintained a solid liquidity position, with high liquidity levels affected by the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and stock market volatility have resulted in a significant expansion of the Bank's deposits, and therefore its liquidity, as investors have used demand deposits as hedges against higher stock market volatility and lower asset prices.\n\nThe following table shows the composition of the liquid assets in the last two years:\n\n| Liquid Assets  (1)             |            | December 31, 2020    December 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|\n| High quality Liquid Assets *   |            |                                          |\n| Cash                           | 18,356,375 | 16,594,906                               |\n| High quality liquid securities | 16,729,107 | 12,054,474                               |\n| Other Liquid Assets            |            |                                          |\n| Other securities **            | 2,672,337  | 1,982,308                                |\n| Total Liquid Assets            | 37,757,819 | 30,631,688                               |\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, liquid assets showed a significant growth of COP 7,126 billion, mainly due to the increase in cash and high-quality liquid securities. This change is a consequence of higher demand deposits, resulting in higher reserve requirements (cash) and excess liquidity, which has been managed through the treasury portfolio with purchases of highquality liquid securities.",

        "page_content": "The Bank measures liquid assets on a daily basis and compares this result to an objective target set by the Risk Committee. Under this rule, daily liquid assets must be equal to or higher than such target. In the event the limit is not reached, there is a five-day period to increase liquidity levels.\n\nCash is important to guarantee branch and ATM operations. The Bank's expansion across the Colombian territory requires considerable levels of cash; however, cash levels are daily monitored in order to minimize opportunity costs. Additionally, cash is considered in the mandatory bank reserve established by the Central Bank.\n\nSecurities that comprise liquid assets are reviewed by the ALCO considering the Bank's liquidity objective. Even though available for sale and held to maturity debt securities cannot be sold, they can be pledged as collateral in repurchase agreements. Some of them are mandatory investments that can be posted to the Central Bank as collateral.\n\nSFC requires financial entities to have liquid assets greater than the contractual liquidity accumulative one-month gap. This contractual gap reflects the maturity of the current positions of assets and liabilities and does not reflect projections of future operations. The maturity of the loan portfolio for this purpose is affected by the historical default indicator and the maturity of deposits is modeled according to the regulation.\n\nThe Bank's management believes that the current level of liquidity is adequate and will seek to maintain its solid deposit base and the access to alternative sources of funding such as borrowings from domestic and international development and commercial banks, repurchase agreements, bond issuances, overnight funds and Central Bank funds, considering market conditions, interest rates and the desired maturity profile of liabilities.\n\n## Funding Structure\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Bank's liabilities reached COP 227,453 billion, a 9.73% increase compared to December 31, 2019. Liabilities denominated in Colombian Pesos increased by 14.72%, and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars increased by 2.83%. This change is principally the result of the increase in both COP and USD denominated checking and saving accounts, offset by a decline in COP denominated time deposits and USD denominated borrowings from other institutions. However, although USD denominated liabilities increased by 2.83%, this increase was mainly due to the depreciation of the USD/COP exchange rate (4.74% in 2020), as USD denominated liabilities decreased by USD 483 million.\n\n|                     | As of December 31,                     | As of December 31,                     |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                     | 2020                                   | 2019                                   |\n|                     | In millions of COP, except percentages | In millions of COP, except percentages |\n| Total funding       |                                        |                                        |\n| Peso-denominated    | 138,014,643                            | 120,308,003                            |\n| Dollar-denominated. | 89,438,649                             | 86,974,491                             |\n| Total Liabilities   | 227,453,292                            | 207,282,494                            |\n\nIn 2020, the Bank experienced a growth in deposits which reached COP 180,820 billion at year-end, an increase of COP 23,615 billion, or 15.02% compared to the level at December 31, 2019. COP denominated deposits increased by 15.37%, explained  mainly  by  the  rise  in  COP  denominated  saving  and  checking  accounts,  while  USD  denominated  deposits increased by 14.41% as a result of the rise in USD denominated saving accounts, checking accounts and time deposits, affected by the exchange rate as mentioned earlier. The ratio of deposits to total assets was 70.75%, increasing by 416 basis points compared to 2019.\n\n|                | As of December 31,        | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                | 2020  2019                | 2020  2019           |                      |\n|                | In millions of COP        | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Total Deposits | 180,820,793   157,205,312 |                      |                      |",

This change is primarily explained by the increase in deposits, that rose from COP 171,164 billion in 2019 to COP 192,022 billion in 2020, which was higher compared with the growth in net loans and advances to customers (the increase was COP 3,440 billion reaching an amount of COP 174,793 billion in 2020). It is important to highlight that, at the end of the first quarter of the year, the Bank established some restrictions on loans due to the high uncertainty and the risks of the pandemic, that could have ended in a financial stress. These restrictions were focused on the credit growth and loan terms for each type of loans, following various risk indicators and monitoring liquidity levels. As economic activity started to recover and government restrictions were 'relaxed', the Bank started to remove some restrictions according to liquidity levels and credit demand.\n\nAs a result, an important growth of deposits and a low increase in loans led to a decrease in the Net Loan to Deposits ratio in 2020.\n\n|                       | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                       | 2020                 | 2019                 |\n| Net Loans to Deposits |                      | 91.03 %  100.11 %    |\n\nThe bank also funds its operations with borrowings from financial institutions. Nevertheless, in order to maintain a lower cost of funds, the growth of loans was financed mainly by deposits, as a result of which USD denominated borrowings decreased by COP 4,010 billion (USD 1,298 million) in 2020. Additionally, Bancolombia's borrowings from financial institutions are linked to different market rates/indexes like the IBR, (a short-term benchmark interest rate of Colombian money market liquidity that reflects the price at which banks are willing to lend or borrow funds from financial market), DTF, IPC  and LIBOR.\n\nIn 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of the Libor benchmark after 2021. This announcement has resulted in uncertainty about the future of  Libor  which  is  used  as  interest  rate  benchmark.  On  December  31,  2020,  Bancolombia  had  USD  1,763  million  of liabilities linked to LIBOR, which represents 2.66% of total liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\n\nDuring 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and stock market volatility have resulted in a significant expansion of the Bank's deposits, and therefore its liquidity, as investors have used demand deposits as hedges against higher stock market volatility and lower asset prices. As a result, deposits have been the main source of funding during 2020, allowing the bank to lower its cost of funds and reach high levels of liquidity at year-end. It is important to highlight that both the Central Bank and the Colombian Government implemented measures in order to provide liquidity to the system and avoid a liquidity stress, which led to a generalized increase in deposits in the banking system. In adittion to this, the successive reduction of Central Bank interest rate reflected a greater preference for liquidity, encouraging loans and economic activity as price levels decreased below the target inflation.",

However, the carrying amount of debt securities in issue decreased by COP 795 billion, explained mainly by the repurchases of a portion of Bancolombia securities due 2021 and the maturity of USD 300 million senior notes by Banco Agricola, which were partially replaced by a borrowing from IFC (USD 287 million). At the beginning of the year, Citigroup Globlal Markets Inc., as offeror, settled its tender offer to purchase any and all of Bancolombia's outstanding 5.95% Senior Notes due 2021, under the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase dated January 8, 2020.

The repayment of borrowings used COP 14,919 billion in 2020, compared with COP 14,365 used in 2019 and COP 14,472 used in 2018; and the payments of debt securities in issue used COP 5,382 billion during 2020, COP 2,561 billion during 2019 and COP 1,886 during 2018. Cash was also used to pay dividends to stockholders in the amount of COP 1,555 billion, while in 2019 and 2018 this amount was COP 1,032 billion and COP 735 billion, respectively. The net cash provided relating to debt securities is due to redemptions and repurchases of a portion of Bancolombia securities.\n\nThe decrease in repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing provided cash of COP 903 billion, compared with the COP 1,002 billion used in 2019 and the COP 922 billion used in 2018.",

This decrease reflects the net effect of dividend payments, lower generation of profits during the year 2020 and the acquisition of 40% of BAM in Guatemala.\n\nThe Bank's capital adequacy ratio on a consolidated basis was 14.74% as of December 31, 2020, up from 12.82% in 2019. It is important to note that in 2020 Bancolombia adopted the Basel III standard for the capital adequacy. This was done in advance of the compulsory date of adoption. The main changes of the new regulation regarding the calculation of the solvency ratios cover: the inclusion of a greater portion of the shareholders equity, the risk weighted assets density, the deduction of goodwill and intangible assets, and the inclusion of operational risk, among others.\n\nThe Bank's capital adequacy ratio exceeded the requirements of the Colombian government and the SFC by 574 basis points above the minimum 9% required by the Colombian regulator. The basic capital ratio (Tier 1) was 11.24% and the tangible capital ratio, which is equal to the ratio of the difference between equity and goodwill and intangible assets to tangible assets, was 7.5% at the end of 2020. For a full description of the Bank's capital adequacy requirements, please see Item 4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8 -Supervision and Regulation'.",

It is accountable for the execution of all transactions in domestic and foreign currencies legally authorized in Colombia and in all the countries where the Bank has presence. These includes Derivatives transactions, Fixed Income and Indexed securities trading, repurchase or resale transactions, short sales, temporary securities transfers, as well as FX trading.\n\nThe Bank monitors treasury division activities through policies regarding the management of liquidity, market, legal, credit and operational risks. Such policies are monitored by the Vice-President of Risk Management. With the aim to control market and liquidity risks,  the  Bank  sets  limits  intended  to  keep  its  exposure  levels  and  losses  within  certain  ranges determined by the Bank's Board of Directors. The Bank's investment policies do not include restrictions regarding the maturity of the securities held in the portfolio, except for those related to the liquidity portfolio and over the counter ('OTC') derivatives transactions held by Bancolombia and Banistmo.",

'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk', the market risk stated in the treasury  book  is  measured  with  value  at  risk  (VaR)  metrics,  and  the  position  limits  are  based  on  the  results  of  these methodologies. The Bank has defined VaR limits that follow a hierarchical structure, which avoids the concentration of market risk in certain groups of assets and also takes advantage of portfolio diversification. In addition to VaR limits, the Bank uses stop loss signals, except for GFA, to inform senior management when accumulated losses are close to certain pre-defined thresholds in the trading book. Moreover, for the options portfolio in Bancolombia, the Bank has set limits based on the sensitivity of the portfolio to the underlying volatility, underlying currency and interest rates.\n\nAs  part  of  its  operations,  the  Bank  holds  cash  and  cash  equivalents  primarily  in  Colombian  pesos,  U.S.  dollars  and Guatemalan quetzals. These positions, as well as any other currency position, are determined by the treasury division in connection with the Bank's currency risk assessment and  management. Specifically, the Bank's exposure to FX risk primarily arises from changes in the USD/COP exchange rate. The exposure to currency risk is managed by the Bank's Treasury Division. The Bank estimates VaR metrics to limit the exposure to foreign currency risk of its balance sheet in Bancolombia,  Valores  Bancolombia  and  Banistmo.  These  limits  are  supervised  daily  by  the  Bank's  Market  Risk Management Office. The Bank's Treasury Division manages a derivative portfolio in Bancolombia and Banistmo, which includes forward in FX with the purpose, among others, of hedging its overall currency exposure.\n\nColombian Chief Treasury Officer (CTO), centralize all the reports from the Treasury Directors in the subsidiaries in all geographies, in which they are responsible for FX, investment and risk taking.\n\nThere  are  several  communications  channels  between  the  Treasury  divisions  and  the  CTO,  which  are:  Investment Committee; the participants in this meeting, which is held monthly, are: CTO, Proprietary Trading Director, Market Risk Director, Treasury Directors from each Bank, and the Head of each desk in Colombia (Fixed Income, FX and Derivatives). This committee reviews the investment strategy portfolios, profit and loss figures, VaR levels, Benchmark portfolios, based on the framework and risk appetite, defined by the Board of Directors.\n\nPerformance is measured against the 'Benchmark' approved for each treasury, which includes a target position for each asset and limits for every product and market, in which the treasury operation can invest. There is a continuous follow up of the portfolios in the investment committee, which runs monthly.\n\n## B.3       COMMITMENT FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\n\nSee Item 4. 'Information on the Company - A.

TREND INFORMATION\n\nAmid a scenario of uncertainty in the macroeconomic perspective, during 2020, net interest and valuation income fell 57.65% as a result of high deterioration in the credit quality and a reduction in net interest margins. Total credit impairment charges had a significant impact to results over the past year. The evolution of the loan portfolio and the recovery on the credit cycle will be key drivers of the Bank's performance going forward.

        "page_content": "## Loan Volume Performance\n\nGross loans and financial leases (i.e., before allowance for loans and financial lease losses) increased 5.01% in 2020. Despite the difficult conditions presented by the COVID-19 pandemic that have reduced the appetite of companies for growth, commercial loans presented a better dynamic when compared to 2019, mainly driven by the Colombian operation portfolio in pesos. Demand was moderately weak for consumer loans, decelerating from previous years when the bank gained market share while reshaped the portfolio mix. During 2020, commercial loans increased 5.00%, consumer loans grew 3.38%, mortgages increased 8.24%, and Small Business Loans contracted 3.72%.\n\nBanco Agr\u00edcola's loan book decreased 2.72% in dollar terms during 2020. Lower demand for credit coupled with increased liquidity in the system have contributed to the negative performance on portfolio growth, while the bank continues to have a conservative approach in terms of risk appetite.\n\nCredit demand in Banistmo decelerated and the loan book grew just 0.76%. The slowdown in the Panamanian economy in the last year explain a modest dynamic in lending activity.\n\nLoan growth in Guatemala expanded 3.26% in 2020. The consumer book continues to be the main driver, presenting a positive  variation  of  5.56%  during  the  last  year.  Out  of  the  three  Central  American  countries  in  which  Bancolombia operates, Guatemala was the least impacted economy by the COVID-19 pandemic, offering a better outlook as well for growth in 2021.\n\nForeign-denominated loans decreased 1.29% during 2020. The performance of the book in El Salvador, the international banking operation of Bancolombia Panama, Puerto Rico and the USD denominated loans in Colombia mainly explain the contraction in the dollar denominated portfolio for the consolidated figures.\n\nThe  Colombian  economy  contracted  by  6.8%  in  2020  mainly  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  outbreak  and  the  severe confinements that affected domestic demand. Growth trends for 2021 and the medium term are still uncertain due to unemployment rates, and the ambiguous dynamics of the pandemic. However, commercial lending activity should benefit from  a  low  interest  rates  environment  and  stimulus  programs  planned  by  the  Government  in  different  sectors  of  the economy. Consumer loans on the other hand, are expected to show a gradual recovery when compared to the slow growth observed in the last year.\n\n## Net Interest Margin and Valuation\n\nMost of the Bank's loan book has a variable rate and the re-pricing pace of our assets tends to be faster than that of the Bank's liabilities.\n\nThe annualized net interest margin of the loan portfolio was 4.91% for 2020, decreasing when compared to the ratio of 5.67% reported in 2019. Such reduction is explained by lower interest recognized as a result of the increase in clients in stage 3 under IFRS 9, the effect of reference rate cuts by Colombian Central Bank, as well as, lower net present value from loans under relief programs.\n\nCost of funding has been reduced in the last year as deposits increased their share in the total mix, offsetting partially the compression on margins. The bank benefits from a well-diversified and low-cost deposit base, taking advantage of its high deposit  market  share  in  Colombia  across  all  major products,  including  demand,  savings  and  time  deposits.  Customer deposits account for more than 83% of the bank's funding needs, offering a cost-competitive and stable source of funding.\n\nFor 2021 the Group's net interest margin is expected to remain relatively stable, foreseeing an environment of low interest rates in the local financial system.\n\n## Cost of credit\n\nFor the year 2020, the cost of credit was 3.85% of average loans, which represents a significant increase when compared to the 1.91% and 2.34% shown in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The higher provision charges reflected the deterioration of",

Bancolombia maintains a strong balance sheet supported by an adequate level of loan loss reserves. Asset quality could remain under pressure in 2021, due to the current economic conditions, and weaker consumer demand.\n\n## E.       OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nThe following are the off-balance sheet arrangements in which the Bank is involved: standby letters of credit, letters of credit and bank guarantees.\n\nLetters of credit and bank guarantees are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The Bank typically has recourse to recover from the customer any amounts paid under these guarantees. In addition, the Bank may hold cash or other highly liquid collateral to support these guarantees. We include these guarantees in our impairment loss allowance assessment with other forms of credit exposure amounting to COP (190.694), COP (25,940) and COP 8,553, for the years ended as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nThose off-balance  sheet  arrangements  are  required  to  be  considered  into  the  total  solvency  ratio  computation.

Refer to Notes 15, 16, 20 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these liabilities.\n\n## G.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe Bank's results reflect the choice of accounting policies and use of estimates, which underlie the preparation of the Consolidated financial Statements. The Bank's most significant accounting estimates require the management's judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.\n\nThe significant accounting policies, including the policies which include critical accounting estimates and judgements, are described in Note 2 Significant accounting policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies listed below involve a high degree of uncertainty, especially considering the impact of COVID-19, and have a material effect on the financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit  risk  impairment:  Expected  credit  losses  are  calculated  using  individual  and  collective  models  and methodologies based on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current borrower situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The impact of COVID-19 has increased the uncertainty around expected credit losses impairment calculations and has required management to make additional judgements and accounting estimates that affect the reported amount of assets and expenses regarding provisions.\n- \u00b7 Impairment  testing  of  cash  generating  units  ('CGUs')  including  goodwill:  The  impairment  test  for  goodwill involves estimates and significant judgments, including the identification of cash generating units, the allocation of goodwill based on the expectations of which operating segments of the Bank will benefit from the acquisition, estimating the future cash flows of the cash generating units and the rates used to discount these cash flows. The COVID-19 has increased the uncertainty around impairment calculations and has required management to make additional judgements and accounting estimates for assessing the expected future cash flows for each CGU and taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 Deferred tax: Due to the changing conditions of the political, social  and economic environment, the constant amendments to tax legislation and the permanent changes in the tax principles and changes in interpretations by tax  authorities  determining  the  tax  bases  for  the  deferred  tax  items,  involves  difficult  judgments  including estimates of future gains, offsets or tax deductions.\n- \u00b7 Provisions and contingent liabilities: Significant judgement may be required due to the high degree of uncertainty associated with determining whether a present obligation exists and estimating the probability and amount of any outflows that may arise.\n- \u00b7 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities: The measurement of the fair value of financial instruments generally involves a higher degree of complexity and requires the application of judgments especially when the models use unobservable inputs (level 3) based on the assumptions that would be used in the market to determinate the price for  assets  or  liabilities.  Determination  of  these  assumptions  includes  consideration  of  market  conditions  and",

        "page_content": "liquidity levels. The COVID-19 has increased the uncertainty generated by the actions taken by governments to contain the epidemic in markets and financial instrument valuations.\n\n- \u00b7 Measurement of Employee benefits: The measurement of post-employment benefit obligations and long-term employee benefits consider a range of inputs and it is dependent upon a series of assumptions of future events.\n- \u00b7 Leases: The measurement of the right-of-use asset and of the lease liabilities requires a series of judgments, among which are the determination of the term of the lease and the rate used in discounting the cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Impairment of interests in associates and investment property: Impairment testing involves significant judgement in determining the value in use, and in particular estimating the present values of cash flows expected to arise from continuing to hold the investment, based on a number of management assumptions.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties of the items above, the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if assumptions and conditions change.\n\n## ITEM 6         DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES\n\n## A.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS\n\nIn 2020 the Bank paid each director a fee of approximately COP 10 million per month for sitting on the Board, and another fee of approximately COP 10 million for attending each session of the committees. 70% of the fee is paid in cash each month and the other 30% is paid in stock annually. The stock component represents shares of Bancolombia, which are purchased in the secondary market and are vested after two years.\n\nThe directors received no other compensation or benefits. There is no stock option plan for directors. Consistent with Colombian law, the Bank does not publish information regarding the compensation of the Bank's individual officers. The Bank's stockholders may request that information during the period preceding the annual general stockholders' meeting. The aggregate amount of remuneration paid by the Bank and consolidated subsidiaries to all directors, alternate directors and senior management during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 was COP 71.47 billion. Additionally, the bank has established a retirement bonus for senior management, and at the end of 2020 the provision to this effect was COP 29.37 billion.  In 2020 was paid COP 9.09 billion of retirement bonus for some senior managers who retired during the year.\n\nThe  Bank's  senior  managers  (including  the  Bank's  CEO)  are  paid,  in  addition  to  a  fixed  compensation,  a  variable compensation to be approved by the shareholders at the General Meeting.

In determining the amount of any bonuses, the Bank takes into consideration the overall return on equity of the Bank and its executives' achievement of established goals. Bonuses are paid in cash and stock. The stock component represents shares of Bancolombia, which are purchased in the secondary market and are vested after three years.\n\nThe Bank paid in 2020 a total of COP 1,870.39 billion for salaries of personnel employed directly by the Bank and senior management  of  its  affiliates.  Such  amount  does  not  include  accounting  provision  in  2020  regarding  the  incentive compensation plan in Colombia because of a corporate decision for that year.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Bank had provisioned 100% of its actuarial obligation corresponding to retirement pension's payable by the Bank, which amounted to COP 127.13 billion, in accordance with Decree 2496 of December 23, 2015.\n\n## C.

MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\n\nSet forth below is certain information concerning the Bank's capital stock and a brief summary of certain significant provisions of the Bank's bylaws and Colombian corporate law. This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the Bank's bylaws (an English translation of which is attached as Exhibit 1 to this Annual Report) and to Colombian corporate law.\n\n## Bancolombia's Corporate Purpose\n\nPursuant to Article 4 of its bylaws, Bancolombia's corporate purpose consists of all kinds of banking operations, business, acts and services. Subject to applicable law, Bancolombia may carry out all the activities and investments authorized to banks. Bancolombia is also authorized to participate in the capital stock of other companies, subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nAs of the date of filing of this Annual Report, Bancolombia's board of directors is composed of seven directors, elected for a two-year term, with no alternate directors. For additional information regarding Bancolombia's current directors please see Item 6.A, 'Directors and Senior Management'.\n\nAfter being designated, all of the members of the Board of Directors need an authorization from the Superintendency of Finance. The SFC assesses whether the director has an adequate profile for the position according to the requirements under Colombian Law.\n\nAccording to Decree 3923 of 2006, the election of independent directors must be in a separate ballot from the ballot to elect the rest of directors, unless the reaching of the minimum number of independent directors required by law or by the by-laws is assured, or when there is only one list that includes the minimum number of required independent directors.\n\nAccording to Law 964 of 2005, 25% of the members of the board of directors shall be independent. An 'independent director' is a director who is NOT: (i) an employee or director of the issuer or any of its parent or subsidiary companies, including  all  those  persons  acting  in  said  capacity  during  the  year  immediately  preceding  that  in  which  they  were appointed, except in the case of an independent member of the board of directors being re-elected; (ii) shareholders, who either  directly  or  by  virtue  of  an  agreement  direct,  guide  or  control  the  majority  of  the  entity's  voting  rights  or  who determine the majority composition of the administration, the board of directors or other corporate bodies of this same entity; (iii) a partner or employee of any association or firm that provides advisory or consultancy services to the issuer or to companies who belong to the same economic group to which the issuer in question belongs, in the event that income obtained from such services represent for said association or firm twenty percent (20%) or more of its total operating income; (iv) an employee or director of a foundation, association or institution that receives significant donations from the issuer.  The  term  'significant  donations'  is  quantified  as  being  twenty  percent  (20%)  or  more  of  the  total  amount  of donations received by the respective institution; (v) an administrator of any entity on whose board of directors a legal representative  of  the  issuer  participates;  and  (vi)  any  person  who  receives  from  the  issuer  any  kind  of  remuneration different from fees as a member of the board of directors, of the audit committee or any other committee set up by the board of directors.\n\nElections are made under a proportional representation voting system. Under that system: (i) each holder of common shares is entitled at the annual general shareholders' meeting to nominate for election one or more directors; (ii) each nomination of one or more directors constitutes a group for the purposes of the election; (iii) each group of nominees must be listed in the order of preference for nominees in that group to be elected; (iv) once all groups have been nominated, holders of common shares may cast one vote for each common share held in favor of a particular group of nominees. Votes may not be cast for particular nominees in a group; they may be cast only for the entire group; (v) the total number of votes casted in the election is divided by the number of directors to be elected. The resulting quotient is the quota of votes necessary to elect particular directors. For each time that the number of votes cast for a group of nominees is divisible by the quota of votes, one nominee from that group is elected, in the order of the list of that group; and (vi) when no group has enough remaining votes to satisfy the quota of votes necessary to elect a director, any remaining board seat or seats",

For such purposes, the directors shall provide the shareholders' meeting with all the relevant information necessary for the shareholders to reach a decision. If the director is a shareholder, his or her vote shall be excluded from the respective decision  process.  In  any  case,  the  general  shareholders  meeting  could  only  grant  its  authorization  if  the  act  does  not adversely affect Bancolombia's interests.\n\nIn  the  general  annual  shareholders meeting the shareholders are responsible for determining, the compensation of the members of the board of directors.\n\nPursuant to the by-laws of Bancolombia, the board of directors has the power to authorize the execution of any agreement, within the corporate purpose of Bancolombia, and to adopt the necessary measures in order for the Bank to accomplish its purpose.

Pursuant to Article 8 of the bylaws, all shares issued shall have the same nominal value.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Bancolombia had 509,704,584 common shares and 452,122,416 preferred shares outstanding and a shareholders' equity of COP 26,545 billion divided into 961,827,000 shares.\n\n## Voting Rights\n\n## Common Shares\n\nThe holders of common shares are entitled to vote on the basis of one vote per share on any matter subject to approval at a general shareholders' meeting. These general meetings may be ordinary meetings or extraordinary meetings.\n\nOrdinary general shareholder's meetings occur at least once a year but no later than three months after the end of the prior fiscal year, for the following purposes: (i) to consider the approval of Bancolombia's annual report, including the financial statements for the preceding fiscal year; (ii) to review the annual report prepared by the external auditor; (iii) to determine the compensation for the members of the board of directors, and the external auditor (the external auditor compensation is determine  every  two  years)  (iv)  to  elect  directors,  the  external  auditor  and  the  client  representative  (' defensor  del consumidor financiero' ).  The  client  representative's  primary  duty  is  to  solve  the  individual  complaints  submitted  by clients and users and serve as their spokesman, the directors and the external auditor (each for a two-year term); and (v) to determine the dividend policy and the allocation of profits, if any, of the preceding fiscal year, as well as any retained earnings from previous fiscal years.\n\nExtraordinary general shareholders' meetings may take place when duly called for a specified purpose or purposes, or, without prior notice, when holders representing all outstanding shares entitled to vote on the issues presented are present at the meeting.\n\nQuorum for both ordinary  and  extraordinary  general  shareholders'  meetings  to  be  convened  at  first  call  requires  the presence of two or more shareholders representing at least half plus one of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the relevant meeting. If a quorum is not present, a subsequent meeting is called at which the presence of one or more holders of shares entitled to vote at the relevant meeting constitutes a quorum, regardless of the number of shares represented. General shareholders' meetings may be called by the board of directors, the CEO or the external auditor of Bancolombia.",

Notice of other extraordinary meetings, must be published in one newspaper of wide circulation at Bancolombia's principal place of business at least 15 calendar days prior to such meeting listing the matters to be addressed at such meeting.\n\nExcept  when  Colombian  law  or  Bancolombia's  bylaws  require  a  special  majority,  action  may  be  taken  at  a  general shareholder's meeting by the vote of two or more shareholders representing a majority of common shares present.

If the total amount segregated in all reserves of a company exceeds its outstanding capital, this percentage is increased to 70%. The minimum common stock dividend requirement of 50% or 70%, as the case may be, may be waived by a favorable vote of the holders of 78% of a company's common stock present at the meeting.\n\nUnder Colombian law and Bancolombia's bylaws annual net profits are to be applied as follows: (i) first, an amount equivalent  to  10%  of  net  profits  is  segregated  to  build  a  legal  reserve  until  that  reserve  is  equal  to  at  least  50%  of Bancolombia's paid-in capital; (ii) second, payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares; and (iii) third, allocation  of  the  net  profits  is  determined  by  the  holders  of  a  majority  of  the  common  shares  entitled  to  vote  on  the recommendation of the board of directors and the President and may, subject to further reserves required by the by-laws, be distributed as dividends. Under the Bank's bylaws, the dividends payable to the holders of common shares cannot exceed the dividends payable to holders of the preferred shares. Bancolombia's bylaws requires to maintain a reserve fund equal to 50% of paid-in capital. All common shares that are fully paid in and outstanding at the time a dividend or other distribution is declared are entitled to share equally in that dividend or other distribution. Common shares that are only partially-paid participate in a dividend or distribution in the same proportion than the shares that have been fully paid in at the time of the dividend or distribution.\n\nThe general shareholders' meeting may allocate a portion of the profits to welfare, education or civic services, or to support economic organizations of the Bank's employees.\n\n## Preferred Shares\n\nHolders of preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends based on the net profits of the preceding fiscal year, after deducting losses affecting the capital and once the amount that shall be legally set apart for the legal reserve has been deducted, but before creating or accruing for any other reserve, of a non-cumulative minimum preferred dividend equal to one percent (1%) yearly of the subscription price of the preferred share, provided this dividend is higher than the dividend assigned to common shares. If this is not the case, the dividend shall be increased to an amount that is equal to the per share dividend on the common shares. The dividend received by holders of common shares may not be higher than the dividend assigned to preferred shares.\n\nPayment of the preferred dividend shall be made at the time and in the manner established in the general shareholders' meeting and with the priority indicated by Colombian law.\n\nIn the event that the holders of preferred shares have not received the minimum dividend for a period in excess of two consecutive fiscal years, they will acquire certain voting rights. See Item 10. 'Aditional Information - B. Memorandum and  Articles  of  Association  -  Description  of  Share  Rights,  Preferences  and  Restrictions  -  Voting  Rights  -  Preferred Shares'.\n\n## General Considerations Relating to Dividends\n\nIn the general shareholders' meeting, shareholders will determine the effective date, the system and the place for payment of dividends, including payment in installments.",

Nonetheless, Shareholders at the general shareholders' meeting may authorize the payment in common shares to all shareholders.\n\nAny dividend in shares requires the approval of 80% or more of the shares present at a shareholders' meeting, which will include  80%  or  more  of  the  outstanding  preferred  shares.  In  the  event  that  such  voting  majority  is  not  obtained, shareholders may individually elect to receive a stock dividend or a cash dividend.\n\n## Liquidation Rights\n\nBancolombia will be dissolved if certain events take place, including the following: (i) its term of existence, as stated in the by-laws, expires without being extended by the shareholders prior to its expiration date; (ii) losses cause the decrease of its shareholders' equity below 50% of its outstanding capital stock, unless one or more of the corrective measures described in the Colombian Commercial Code are adopted by the shareholders within six months, (iii) by decision at the general shareholders' meeting; and (iv) in certain other events expressly provided by law and in the by-laws.\n\nUpon dissolution, a liquidator must be appointed by the general shareholders' meeting to wind up its affairs.

The issuance of preferred shares must always be first approved at the general shareholders' meeting, which shall determine the nature and extent of any privileges, according to the bylaws and Colombian law.\n\nThe Bank's bylaws and Colombian law require that, whenever the Bank issues new shares of any outstanding class, it must offer the holders of each class of shares the right to purchase a number of shares of such class sufficient to maintain their existing percentage ownership of the aggregate capital stock of the Bank. These rights are called preemptive rights. See  Item  3.  'Key  Information  -  D.  Risk  Factors  -  Preemptive  rights  may  not  be  available  to  holders  of  American Depositary Receipts ('ADRs') evidencing ADSs'.\n\nShareholders at a general meeting of shareholders may suspend preemptive rights with respect to a particular capital increase by a favorable vote of at least 70% of the shares represented at the meeting. Preemptive rights must be exercised within the period stated in the share placement terms of the increase, which cannot be shorter than 15 business days following the publication of the notice of the public offer of that capital increase. From the date of the notice of the share placement terms, preemptive rights may be transferred separately from the corresponding shares.\n\nThe  Superintendency  of  Finance  will  authorize  decreases  in  the  outstanding  capital  stock  decided  by  the  holders  of common shares only if: (i) Bancolombia has no liabilities; (ii) Bancolombia's creditors consent in writing; or (iii) the outstanding capital stock remaining after the reduction represents at least twice the amount of Bancolombia's liabilities.",

For the dividends coming from profits that did NOT paid the tax in the company, that is, levied, the following rule will be followed:\n\nDividends will be levied at the rate of 25% and the retention rate of 10% will be applied to the remnant.\n\nFor purposes of Colombian taxation, an individual is considered as a resident if he or  she meets any of the following conditions:\n\n- -Continuous or discontinuous presence in Colombia for more than 183 calendar days including entry and departure days from the country, within any period of 365 consecutive calendar days, provided that, when the  continuous  or  discontinuous  presence  in  the  country  is  exercised  in  more  than  one  fiscal  year,  the individual would be considered as a resident in the second fiscal year.\n- -Those persons working for the Colombian Foreign Service or those serving the Colombian Foreign Service and which, by virtue of the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations, are exempt from taxation on all or part of their income and occasional earnings in the country in which they are serving during the respective tax year or period.",

These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. There is currently no comprehensive income tax treaty between the United States and Colombia. In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nIf an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the preferred shares or ADSs, the United States federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership.

        "page_content": "You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state and local and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of preferred shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\n\n## Taxation of Distributions\n\nUnder the United States federal income tax laws, if you are a U.S. holder, the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes), other than certain pro-rata distribution of the Bank's preferred shares, including the amount of any Colombian tax withheld, will be treated as a dividend that is subject to United States federal income taxation. If you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, dividends paid to you that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided that you hold the preferred shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date (or, if the dividend is attributable to a period or periods aggregating over 366 days, provided that you hold the preferred shares or ADSs for more than 90 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date) and meet other holding period requirements. Dividends we pay with respect to the ADSs generally will be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. The Bank believes that its ADSs, which are listed on the NYSE, are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States; however, there can be no assurance that the Bank's ADSs will continue to be readily tradable on an established securities market. Because the preferred shares are not listed on any United States securities market, it is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to the preferred shares will also be qualified dividend income. If dividends we pay with respect to the Bank's preferred shares  are  not  qualified  dividend  income,  then  the  U.S.  dollar  amount  of  such  dividends  received  by  a  U.S.  holder (including dividends received by a non-corporate U.S. holder) will be subject to taxation at ordinary income tax rates.\n\nYou must include any Colombian tax withheld from the dividend payment in this gross amount even though you do not in fact receive it. The dividend is taxable to you when you, in the case of preferred shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs,  receive  the  dividend,  actually  or  constructively.  The  dividend  will  not  be  eligible  for  the  dividends-received deduction  generally  allowed  to  United  States  corporations  in  respect  of  dividends  received  from  other  United  States corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income as a U.S. holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the Colombian Peso payments made, determined at the spot Colombian Peso / U.S. dollar rate on the date the dividend distribution is includible in your income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date you include the dividend payment in income to the date you convert the payment into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally  will  be  income  or  loss  from  sources  within  the  United  States  for  foreign  tax  credit  limitation  purposes. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in the preferred shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not expect to calculate earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to generally treat distributions with respect to preferred shares or ADSs as dividends.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the  Colombian tax withheld and paid over to Colombia will be creditable or deductible against your United States federal income tax liability. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to preferential rates. To the extent a refund of the tax withheld is available to you under Colombian law, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against your United States federal income tax liability. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances.\n\nFor  foreign  tax  credit  purposes,  dividends  will  generally  be  income  from  sources  outside  the  United  States  and  will generally be 'passive' income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you.\n\nThe rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.",

        "page_content": "## Taxation of Capital Gains\n\nIf you are a U.S. holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your preferred shares or ADSs, you will recognize capital gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount that you realize and your tax basis, determined in U.S. dollars, in your preferred shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the property is held for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\n## PFIC Rules\n\nWe believe that preferred shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes, and we do not expect to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. It is therefore possible that we could become a PFIC in a future taxable year. If we were to be treated as a PFIC, unless you elect to be taxed annually on a mark-tomarket basis with respect to your preferred shares or ADSs, the following rules would apply. With certain exceptions, your preferred shares or ADSs would be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during your holding period in your preferred shares or ADSs.\n\nAny 'excess distributions,' which would include any distributions during a taxable year that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by you in respect of the preferred shares or ADSs during the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, your holding period for the preferred shares or ADSs that preceded the taxable year in which you receive the distribution, and any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of your preferred shares or ADSs would be allocated ratably over your holding period for the preferred shares or ADSs and would generally be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. Any gain recognized would not be treated as capital gain.\n\nIf you own preferred shares or ADSs in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, you may make a mark-to-market election. If you make this election, you will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above. Instead, in general, you will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of your preferred shares or ADSs at the end of the taxable year over your adjusted basis in your preferred shares or ADSs. These amounts of ordinary income will not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital gains. You will also be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of your preferred shares or ADSs over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). Your basis in the preferred shares or ADSs will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts.\n\nIn addition, notwithstanding any election you make with regard to the preferred shares or ADSs, dividends that you receive from us would not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income if we are treated as a PFIC with respect to you either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead would be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.\n\n## Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets\n\nOwners  of  'specified  foreign  financial  assets'  with  an  aggregate  value  in  excess  of  USD  50,000  (and  in  some circumstances, a higher threshold) may be required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. 'Specified foreign financial assets' include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are held for investment and not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-United States persons (including the preferred shares and ADSs), (ii) financial instruments and contracts that have non-United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign entities. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of this reporting requirement to their ownership of the preferred shares or ADSs.",

To avoid becoming subject to the 30% withholding tax on payments to  them,  we  and  other  non-U.S.  financial  institutions  may  be  required  to  report  information  to  the  IRS regarding the holders of preferred shares or ADSs and to withhold on a portion of payments under the preferred shares or ADSs to certain holders that fail to comply with the relevant information reporting requirements (or hold preferred shares or  ADSs  directly  or  indirectly  through  certain  non-compliant  intermediaries).  However,  under  proposed  Treasury regulations, such withholding will not apply to payments made before the date that is two years after the date on which final  regulations  defining  the  term  'foreign  passthru  payment'  are  enacted.  The  rules  for  the  implementation  of  this legislation have not yet been fully finalized, so it is impossible to determine at this time what impact, if any, this legislation will have on holders of the preferred shares and ADSs.\n\nFATCA is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, the intergovernmental agreement between the United States and Colombia and official guidance, which are subject to change, and the provisions described above may be implemented in a materially different form.

SUBSIDIARY INFORMATION\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM 11        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe following section describes the market risks to which Bancolombia is exposed and the tools and methodology used to measure these risks as of December 31, 2020. Bancolombia faces market risk as a consequence of its lending, trading and investments businesses. Market risk represents the potential loss due to adverse changes in market prices of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and other risk factors, such as sovereign risk.\n\nBancolombia's risk management strategy, called the Integrated Risk Management Strategy, is based on principles set by international bodies and by Colombian regulations, and is guided by Bancolombia's corporate strategy. The main objective of the Integrated Risk Management Strategy is to identify measure, coordinate, monitor, report and propose policies for market and liquidity risks of the Bank, which in turn serve to facilitate the efficient administration of Bancolombia's assets and  liabilities.  Bancolombia's  Board  of  Directors  and  Senior  Management  have  formalized  the  policies,  procedures, strategies and rules of action for market risk administration in its 'Market Risk Manual'. This manual defines the roles and responsibilities within each subdivision of the Bank and their interaction to ensure adequate market risk administration.",

        "page_content": "The Bank's Market Risks Management Office is responsible for: (a) identifying, measuring, monitoring, analyzing and controlling the market risk inherent in the Bank's businesses, (b) analyzing the Bank's exposure under stress scenarios and confirming compliance with Bancolombia's risk management policies, (c) analyzing the methodologies design by the official  price  vendor  for  valuation  of  the  market  value  securities  and  financial  instruments,  (d)  reporting  to  senior management and the board of directors any violation of Bancolombia's risk management policies, (e) reporting to the senior management on a daily basis the levels of market risk associated with the trading instruments recorded in its treasury book (the 'Treasury Book'), and (f) proposing policies to the board of directors and to senior management that ensure the maintenance of predetermined risk levels. The Bank has also implemented an approval process for new products across each of its subdivisions. This process is designed to ensure that every subdivision is prepared to incorporate the new product into their procedures, that every risk is considered before the product is incorporated and that approval is obtained from the board of directors before the new product can be sold.\n\nThe Bank's assets include both trading and non-trading instruments. Trading instruments are recorded in the Treasury Book and include fixed income securities, foreign exchange (FX) and bond futures, and over-the-counter plain vanilla and exotic derivatives. Trading in derivatives includes forward contracts on foreign currency operations, forward contracts on fixed income securities, plain vanilla options on foreign currency, Asian options on U.S. dollar/COP, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Non-trading instruments are recorded in the Bank's banking book (the 'Banking Book'), which includes primarily loans, time deposits, checking accounts and savings accounts.\n\nThe Bank uses a value at risk ('VaR') calculation to limit its exposure to the market risk of its Treasury Book. The board of directors is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR based on its assessment of the appropriate level of risk for Bancolombia. The Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR by type of investment (e.g., local government  debt)  and  by  type  of  risk  (e.g.,  currency  risk).  These  limits  are  supervised  daily  by  the  Market  Risk Management Office.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet items denominated in different currencies, either as a result of trading or in the normal course of business. Our principal foreign currency exposure is the U.S. dollar, which is managed by Treasury Division and monitored by measuring positions, VaR and daily results.\n\nFor managing the interest rate risk from banking activities, the Bank analyzes the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, the foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the Banking Book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## Trading Instruments Market Risk Measurement\n\nThe Bank currently measures the Treasury Book exposure to market risk (including over-the-counter derivatives positions) as well as the currency risk exposure of the Banking Book, which is provided to the Treasury Division, using a VaR methodology established in accordance with 'Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular', issued by the SFC.\n\nThe  VaR  methodology  established  by  'Chapter  XXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular'  is  based  on  the  model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee of 2005, which focuses on the Treasury Book and excludes investments measure under amortized cost which are not being given as collateral  and  any  other  investment  that  comprises  the  Banking  Book,  such  as  non-trading  positions.  In  addition,  the methodology aggregates all risks by the use of correlations, through an allocation system based on defined zones and bands, affected by given sensitivity factors.\n\nThe total market risk for the Bank is calculated by the arithmetical aggregation of the VaR calculated for each subsidiary. The aggregated VaR is reflected in the Bank's Capital Adequacy (Solvency) ratio, in accordance with Decree 2555 de 2010.\n\nFor purposes of VaR calculations, a risk exposure category is any market variable that is able to cause potential changes in the portfolio value. Taking into account a given risk exposure, the VaR model assesses the maximum loss not exceeded",

The fluctuations in the portfolio's VaR depend on volatility, modified duration and positions changes relating to the different instruments that are subject to market risk.\n\nThe  relevant  risk  exposure  categories  for  which  VaR  is  computed  by  Bancolombia  according  to  the  'Chapter  XXI, appendix 1 of the Basic Accounting Circular' are: (i) interest rate risks relating to local currency, foreign currency and UVR; (ii) currency risk; (iii) stock price risk; (iv) fund risk and (v) credit default swaps.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk (Treasury Book)\n\nThe interest rate risk is the probability of decrease in the market value of the position due to fluctuations in market interest rates. Bancolombia calculates the interest rate risk for positions in local currency, foreign currency and UVR separately, in accordance with Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular issued by the Financial Superintendence. The calculation of the interest rate risk begins with determining the net position in each instrument and estimating its sensitivity, which is calculated by multiplying its net present value ('NPV') by its 'modified duration' and by the interest rate's estimated fluctuation (as defined by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia.). The interest rate's fluctuations are established by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia according to historical market performance, as shown in the following table:\n\nFigure 1.

within its corresponding band. A net sensitivity is then calculated for each band, by determining the difference between the sum of all long-positions and the sum of all short-positions. Then a net position is calculated for each zone (which consists of a series of bands) determined by the Financial Superintendence. The final step is to make adjustments within each band, across bands and within each zone, which results in a final number that is the interest rate risk VaR by currency. Each adjustment is performed following the guidelines established by the Financial Superintendence.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to interest risk primarily arises from investments in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES) and other securities issued by the Colombian government.\n\nThe interest rate risk VaR increased from COP 359 billion on December 31, 2019 to COP 402 billion on December 31, 2020, due to the increase in the position in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES)  and United States government's treasury bonds. During the year 2020, the average interest rate risk VaR was COP 340 billion, the maximum value COP 402 billion, and the minimum value COP 286 billion.",

        "page_content": "## Currency (Treasury and Banking Book), Equity (Treasury Book) and Fund Risk (Treasury Book)\n\nThe VaR model uses a sensitivity factor to calculate the probability of loss due to fluctuations in the price of stocks, funds and currencies in which the Bank maintains a position. As previously indicated, the methodology used in this Annual Report to measure such risk consists of computing VaR, which is derived by multiplying the position by the maximum probable variation in the price of such positions ('\u0394p'). The \u0394p is determined by the Financial Superintendence, as shown in the following table:\n\nFigure 2. Sensitivity Factor for Currency Risks, Equity Risks and Fund Risks\n\n| USD                  | 12.49 %   |\n|----------------------|-----------|\n| Euro                 | 11.00 %   |\n| Other currencies     | 13.02 %   |\n| Equity and Fund Risk | 14.70 %   |\n\nThe currency risk VaR decreased from COP 1,016 billion as of December 31, 2019 to COP 96 billion as of December 31, 2020 due to the adoption of External Circular 016 of 2020 issued by the SFC, within the calculation of the VaR excludes currency  risk  position  stemming  from  investments  in  affiliates  but  not  consolidated  entities  denominated  in  foreign currencies from the bank book positions. The foregoing was approved by the Board of Directors of Bancolombia on May 19, 2020 and became effective as of May 31, 2020.\n\nBetween December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, the average currency risk VaR was COP 422 billion, the maximum value was COP 1,345 billion, and the minimum value was COP 422 billion. Current currency risk primarily arises from the USD exposure of Bancolombia in foreign exchange derivatives.\n\nThe equity risk VaR decreased from COP 110 billion as of December 31, 2019 to COP 98 billion as of December 31, 2020 mainly due to the reduction in the brokerage firm's trading position, This exposure comes mainly from investment in Proteccion, a pension and severance fund, which represents 50% of the equity risk VaR.\n\nBetween December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, the average equity VaR was COP 99 billion, the maximum value was COP 131 billion and the minimum value was COP 89 billion.\n\nThe fund risk, which arises from investment in mutual funds, increased from COP 207 billion as of December 31, 2019 to COP 214 billion as of December 31, 2020. Between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, the average fund risk VaR was COP 214 billion, the maximum value was COP 218 billion and the minimum value was COP 209 billion.\n\n## Total Market Risk VaR\n\nThe total market risk VaR is calculated as the algebraic sum of the interest rate risk, the currency risk, the stock price risk, fund risk and the credit default swaps risk which are calculated as the algebraic sum of the Parent Company and each of its subsidiaries' exposure to these risks. Currently Bancolombia Group does not present exposure to credit default swaps risk.\n\nThe total market risk VaR, decline 52%, going from COP 1,692 billion in December 31, 2019 to COP 811 billion as of December 31, 2020, mainly due to a decrease in the currency risk mentioned above.\n\nAssumptions and Limitations of VaR Models: Although VaR models represent a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as predictive of future results. The Bank may incur in losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by the Bank's VaR models. A VaR model does not calculate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the reasonable judgment of the Bank's risk management personnel.",

Changes in interest rates affect Bancolombia's earnings as a result of timing differences on the repricing of the assets and liabilities. The Bank manages the interest rate risk arising from banking activities in non-trading instruments by analyzing the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities. The foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the Banking Book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## Interest Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nThe Bank has performed a sensitivity analysis of market risk sensitive instruments estimating the impact on the net interest income of each position in the Banking Book, using a repricing model and assuming positive parallel shifts of 50 basis points (bps).\n\nThe table 1 provides information about Bancolombia's interest rate sensitivity for the statement of financial position items comprising the Banking Book:\n\nThe  chart  below  provides  information  about  Bancolombia's  interest  rate  risk  sensitivity  in  local  currency  (COP)  at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| Interest Rate Risk                     | Interest Rate Risk   | Interest Rate Risk   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                        | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|                                        | 2020                 | 2019                 |\n|                                        | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Assets sensitivity 50 bps              | 379,953              | 377,918              |\n| Liabilities sensitivity 50 bps         | 199,554              | 200,650              |\n| Net interest income sensitivity 50 bps | 180,399              | 177,268              |",

A negative sensitivity denotes a higher sensitivity of liabilities than of assets and implies that a rise in interest rates will negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. In the event of a decrease in interest rates, the impacts on net interest income would be opposite to those described above.\n\n## Total Exposure\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the net interest income sensitivity in local currency for the banking book instruments, entered for other than trading purposes with positive parallel shifts of 50 basis points was COP 180,399 million, The change in the net interest income sensitivity between 2020 and 2019 was due to the increase in the sensitivity of float loans and the decrease in the sensitivity of float time deposits.\n\nOn the other hand, the net interest income sensitivity in foreign currency, assuming the same parallel shift of 50 basis points, was USD 5 million at December 31, 2020, compared with USD 1 million at December 31, 2019, The increase in net interest income sensitivity to interest rate risk between 2020 and 2019 occurred due to the reduction in the sensitivity of float borrowings from other financial institutions.\n\n## Assumptions and Limitations\n\nNet interest income sensitivity analysis is based on the repricing model and is based on the following key assumptions: (a) does  not  consider  prepayments,  new  operations,  defaults,  etc.,  (b)  the  fixed  rate  instruments  sensitivity,  includes  the amounts with maturity lower than one year and assumes these will be disbursed at market interest rates and (c) changes in interest rate occur immediately and parallel in the yield curves from assets and liabilities for different maturities.\n\n## Structural Equity Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nBancolombia's investment banking affiliate, in its role of financial corporation, has, directly and through its affiliated companies, structural equity investments. These positions are maintained mostly in Industrial and financial sectors. The market value of those investments increased by 5% during the year, going from COP 38 billion as of December 31, 2019 to COP 40 billion as of December 31, 2020 mainly driven by the increase in the market value of the investments in Enka Shares.\n\nThe structural equity positions are exposed to market risk. Sensitivity calculations are made for those positions:\n\n|              | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|              | 2020                 | 2019                 |\n|              | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Market Value | 40,502               | 38,428               |\n| Delta        | 14.7 %               | 14.7 %               |\n| Sensitivity  | 5,954                | 5,649                |\n\nA negative impact of 14.7%, applied to the market value, produces a decrease of COP 2 billion in the structural equity investments market value, from COP 40 billion to COP 38 billion.",

As a result, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information  required  to  be  disclosed  in  the  reports  the  Bank  files  and  submits  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations of the SEC and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\n\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Bank's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe Bank's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank;\n- \u00b7 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Bank's management and directors; and",

Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework version). On this assessment, management concluded that the Bank's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PwC Contadores y Auditores S.A.S., an independent registered public accounting firm, which report is included on page F-5 of this annual report.\n\nIn addition, there were no changes in Bank's internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected or is reasonable likely to materially affect the bank's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## ITEM 16       RESERVED\n\n## A.                  AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT\n\nThe  board  of  directors  of  Bancolombia  appointed  Sylvia  Escovar  Gomez  as  the  audit  committee  financial  expert  in accordance with SEC rules and regulations.\n\nThe Bank's audit committee financial expert, along with the other members of the Bank's Audit Committee, is considered to be independent according to applicable NYSE criteria.\n\nMrs. Escovar has served as the Bank's audit committee financial expert since January 2021, following the resignation of Mr. Hernando Jose Gomez who held this position until December 31, 2020. There is no business relationship between her and the Bank, except for standard personal banking services. Further, there is no fee arrangement between Mrs. Escovar and the Bank, except in connection with his capacity as a member of the Bank's board of directors and as a member of the Audit Committee. Mrs. Escovar is considered an independent director under Colombian law and the Bank's Corporate Governance Code, as well as under NYSE's director independence standards. The Audit Committee and the financial expert  also  have  an  independent  advisor,  who  provides  advice  on  financial  reporting  and  auditing  matters.

Whenever  this  approval  is  not  obtained  at  a  meeting  held  by  the  audit committee, the approval will be obtained through the Legal Vice Presidency, who will be responsible for soliciting the consent from each of the audit committee members. The approval will be obtained with the favorable vote of the majority of its members.\n\nEvery  request  of  approval  of  additional  services  must  be  adequately  supported,  including  complete  and  effective information regarding the characteristics of the service that will be provided by the external auditors. Pursuant to the Bank's Good Governance Code, the external auditor cannot provide additional services to Bancolombia and its subsidiaries that are not directly or indirectly related to the audit.\n\nDuring 2020, there were no services approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraph (c) (7) (i) (C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.\n\n## D.

Therefore,  neither Bancolombia nor any of its Subsidiaries that are under supervision of such Superintendency may repurchase securities issued by them.\n\n## F.                  CHANGE IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## G.                  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nBancolombia, as a listed company that qualifies as a foreign private issuer under the NYSE listing standards in accordance with the NYSE corporate governance rules, is permitted to follow home-country practice in some circumstances in lieu of the provisions of the corporate governance rules contained in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual that are applicable to U.S. companies. The Bank follows corporate governance practices applicable to Colombian companies and those described in the Bank's Corporate Governance Code, which in turn follows Colombian corporate governance rules. An  English translation of the Corporate Governance  Code  is  available at Bancolombia's website at www.grupobancolombia.com.co. The Spanish prevails for all legal purposes.\n\nIn Colombia, a series of laws and regulations set forth corporate governance requirements. External Circular 028 of 2014, issued by the SFC, contains the corporate governance standards to be followed by companies issuing securities that may be  purchased  by  Colombian pension funds, and determines that entities under supervision of the SFC, when making investment decisions, must take into account the recommendations established by the 'Country Code' (' C\u00f3digo Pa\u00eds' ) and the corporate governance standards followed by the entities who are beneficiaries of the investment.\n\nAdditionally, Law 964 of 2005 established mandatory corporate governance requirements for all issuers whose securities are publicly traded in the Colombian market, and Decree 2555 of 2010 regulates the information disclosure requirements for the Colombian securities market SIMEV (' Sistema Integral de Informaci\u00f3n del Mercado de Valores' ). Bancolombia's corporate  governance  standards  comply  with  these  legal  requirements  and  Bancolombia  has  implemented  additional corporate governance measures pursuant to regional recommendations including the OECD White Paper on Corporate Governance for Latin America and the Andean Development Corporation's (CAF) Corporate Governance Code.\n\nThe  following  is  a  summary  of  the  significant  differences  between  the  corporate  governance  practices  followed  by Bancolombia and those applicable to domestic issuers under the NYSE listing standards:\n\n- \u00b7 Independence of Directors. Under NYSE corporate governance rules, a majority of a U.S. company's board of directors must be composed of independent directors. Regarding Colombian legislation, Law 964 of 2005 requires that at least 25% of the members of the Bank's board of directors are independent directors, and Decree 3923 of 2006  regulates  their  election.  Additionally,  Colombian  law  requires  that  all  directors  exercise  independent judgment under all circumstances. Bancolombia's Corporate Governance Code includes a provision stating that directors shall exercise independent judgment and requires that Bancolombia's management recommend to its shareholders lists of director nominees of which at least 25% are independent directors. As of December 31, 2020, the  Bank's  board  of  directors  included  a  majority  of  independent  members  (5  members  of  7).  For  the independence  test  applicable  to  directors  of  Bancolombia,  see  Item  10.  'Additional  Information.  -  B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Board of Directors'.\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Director Meetings . Pursuant to the NYSE listing standards, non-executive directors of U.S. listed companies must meet on a regular basis without management present. There is no prohibition under Colombian regulations  for  officers  to  be  members  of  the  board  of  directors;  however,  it  is  customary  for  Colombian companies to maintain separation between the directors and management. Bancolombia's board of directors does not include any management members; however, the CEO attends the monthly meetings of the Bank's board of directors, and members of senior management may attend the meetings of the board of directors and committees to guarantee an adequate flow of information between employees, management and directors; in both cases, the CEO and members of senior management are not allowed to vote.

A.\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position Bancolombia S. A. and its subsidiaries (the 'Bank') as of December 31 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). We also have audited the Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as of December 31 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Bank maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Bank's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and on the Bank's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Bank in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nPwC Contadores y Auditores S.A.S.., Calle 7 Sur No. 42-70, Torre 2, Piso 11, Edificio Forum,  Medell\u00edn, Colombia, Tel: (57-4) 325 4320, Fax: (57-4) 325 4322, www.pwc.com/co",

        "page_content": "## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Allowance for loans, advances and lease losses\n\nAs  described in Notes 2 (section D.7.4.5, E.1 and E.10), 6 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on evaluations of the loan portfolio utilizing objective and subjective criteria. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses was COP$16,616,043 million on total loans of COP$191,409,730 million. As disclosed by management, Expected Credit Losses (ECL) are calculated using individual and collective models and methodologies based on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current borrower situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios and the adjustments made by management, including the macroeconomic impacts, originated by the outbreak of COVID-19 over the aforementioned parameters in the model of ECL. In addition, for loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, information on the credit behavior, the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence, and when the fundamental source of collection of the loan is a guarantee the market value of such collateral, estimated through appraisals.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Bank's allowance for loans, advances and lease losses is a critical audit matter are, (i) the significant judgment used by management in determining the expected credit losses, in particular the assumptions used in determining: probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios and the adjustments made by management, including the macroeconomic impacts, originated by the outbreak of COVID-19 over the aforementioned parameters in the model of ECL. In addition, for loans individually assessed in Stage 3 analysis of the debt profile of each debtor, information on the credit behavior and the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence and the market value of collateral, estimated through appraisals if applicable, which in turn led to a high",

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Bank's allowance for loans, advances and leasing losses estimation process, which included controls over the data, models and assumptions used in the estimation process. These procedures also included, among others: testing management's process for estimating the allowance for loan, advances and lease losses by (i) evaluating the appropriateness of  the models utilized for the estimation of the expected loss parameters and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions, such as default at 12 months and lifetime, loss given default and exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios, and evaluating the adjustments, including the macroeconomic impacts, originated by the outbreak of COVID19 over the aforementioned parameters in the model of ECL. , (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the estimate and the mathematical accuracy of the impairment calculation for the credit portfolios; and (iii) evaluating individual credit files to determine the reasonableness of management's estimation of the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios and the market value of collaterals, estimated through appraisals if applicable, estimated by management in the impairment for the credit portfolios. The procedures included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the models utilized by management, methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the credit loss estimates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessment\n\nAs described in Notes 2 (sections D.13, E.2 and E.10) and 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank's consolidated goodwill balance was COP$7.011.715. as of December 31, 2020. The Bank tests goodwill recognized upon business combinations for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the cash generating units may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined by management by reference to market value, if available, by pricing models, or with the assistance of a valuation specialist. Determination of recoverable amount requires management to make assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flows for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting, including the macroeconomic impacts originated by the outbreak of COVID-19 on such cash flows for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment of the appropriate discount rate and growth rate, estimation of the recoverable amount of cash generation units and the valuation of the separable assets of each business whose goodwill is being reviewed.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of all reporting units is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the recoverable amount measurement of the cash generating units. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management's cash flow projections and significant assumptions, including discount rate and growth rate, and the impact of COVID-19, in  the economic budgets, forecasts and other assumptions commonly used to determine the recoverable value of the goodwill. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.",

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Bank's cash generating units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the recoverable amount estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering: (i) the current and past performance of the cash generating unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit and the impact of COVID-19, in  the economic budgets, forecasts and other assumptions used to determine the recoverable value of the goodwill.

REPORTING ENTITY\n\nBancolombia S.A., hereinafter the Parent Company or the Group, is a credit establishment, listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange (BVC), as well as on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), since 1981 and 1995, respectively. The Parent Company's main location is in Medellin (Colombia), main address Carrera 48 # 26-85, Avenida Los Industriales, was originally constituted under the name  Banco Industrial Colombiano (BIC) according to public deed number 388, date January 24, 1945, from the First Notary's Office of Medellin, authorized by the Superintendence of Finance of Colombia ('SFC'). On April 3, 1998, by means of public deed No. 633, BIC merged with Bank of Colombia S.A., and the resulting organization of that merger was named Bancolombia S.A.\n\nBancolombia S.A.'s business purpose is to carry out all operations, transactions, acts and services inherent to the banking business  through  banking  establishments  that  carry  its  name  and  according  to  all  applicable  legislation.  The  Parent Company may own interests in other corporations, wherever authorized by law, according to all terms and requirements, limits or conditions established therein.\n\nThe duration of the Parent Company contemplated in the bylaws is until December 8, 2044, but it can be dissolved or renewed before the conclusion of that period. The operating license was authorized definitively by the SFC according to Resolution number 3140 on September 24, 1993.\n\nThrough public  deed number  1,124  of  September 30,  2016,  from  the  fourthteenth  Notary's  Office  of  Medellin,  duly registered in the Camara de Comercio de Medell\u00edn, a merger was completed between the Parent Company (absorbing entity) and Leasing Bancolombia S.A.

As a result of the merger, the Parent Company became the holder of all the rights and obligations of Leasing Bancolombia S.A. and continues to offer its clients the portfolio of leasing products and services under the brand \"Leasing Bancolombia, una marca Bancolombia\".\n\nIn March 2019, the subsidiaries Renting Colombia S.A.S and Inversiones CFNS S.A.S. closed the sale to Arval Relsa of 100% of the shares of Arrendamiento Operativo CIB S.A.C. - Renting Per\u00fa, an operational leasing company incorporated and with operations in Peru, and in July 2019 the Bank's subsidiaries Fiduciaria Bancolombia and Banca de Inversion Bancolombia closed the sale to TMF Group Americas B.V. of  100% of the shares of FiduPeru S.A, a trust services company incorporated and with operations in Peru.\n\nOn September 29, 2020, the Bank acquired an additional 40% of the shareholdings of Grupo Agromercantil Holding (GAH), a company that owns the financial conglomerate Agromercantil of Guatemala, integrated among others, by Banco Agromercantil of Guatemala (BAM).

On October 5th, 2020, the Board of Directors of Bancolombia Panam\u00e1 (Parent Company of Bancolombia Cayman) decided to wind-down the business and operations of its subsidiary in Cayman. This decision was mainly based on the Bank's current financial strategy, seeking greater efficiencies and delivering a better value proposition to clients in its international operations. The wind-down is expected to be completed before the end of the year 2021. As a result of this process, Bancolombia Panama will become the holder of all the rights and obligations of Bancolombia Cayman and continue to offer its clients the portfolio of credit cards and related services.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the subsidiary Bancolombia Cayman recognized in its statement of financial position the assets and liabilities at their carrying value, including the credit card portfolio loans amounting to COP 6,539, debt investments amounting to COP 241,154, cash and cash equivalents amounting to COP 170,454 and other assets amounting to COP 622, and also including the liabilities in deposits from customers amounting to COP 299,253 and other liabilities amounting to COP 4,411. As of December 31, 2020, no guarantees, pledges or commitments have been given or received in respect of the aforementioned transaction between Parent Company (Panam\u00e1) and subsidiary (Cayman).\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Bank  has  30,633  employees,  and  operates  through  951  offices,  18,631  banking correspondents and 6,124 ATMs.\n\n## NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## A.    Basis for preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Bank are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (hereinafter, IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (hereinafter, IASB), as well as the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (hereinafter, IFRS-IC).\n\nThe preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  IFRS  requires  the  use  of  accounting  estimates  which,  by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. Therefore, the estimates and assumptions are constantly reviewed. Any revision is recognized in the same period if it affects the reviewed period; or in the reviewed period and future periods if it affects all the current and future periods.\n\n## Impacts COVID-19 in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe coronavirus 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) has affected the global economy during 2020. Virtually all industries faced challenges associated with liquidity concerns and specific sectors such as oil, air transportation and freight, entertainment, retail,  restaurant,  hospitality and tourism experienced a significant operational decline due to the quarantine measures adopted in the countries where the Group operates; however, at the end of 2020 these adverse effects have begun to diminish due to the economic reactivation that has allowed the resumption of the development of productive activity, achieving an improvement in the levels of employment, household income, and contained inflation, among others. This situation was evaluated periodically during 2020 by management to take all appropriate measures. The effects on the performance and financial position of the Bank are included in the accompanying notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Notes 3 to 31). Likewise, the Bank considered the current economic environment, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, on its businesses in preparation of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, taking into account the best available reliable information and estimates made as of the date of preparation and issuance of the consolidated financial statements, related to a pandemic of this magnitude. For further information, see section 'E. Use of estimates and judgments' paragraph '10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's judgements and estimates' set out below.\n\n## Preparation of the consolidated financial statements under going concern basis\n\nManagement has also assessed the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern and confirms that the Bank has adequate liquidity and solvency to continue operating the business for the foreseeable future, which is at least, but is not limited to, 12 months from the end of the reporting period. Based on the Bank's liquidity position at the date of financial statements authorization, and understanding the uncertainty about the development of the virus, management maintains a reasonable",

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise those classified as assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, debt instruments and equity securities measured at fair value through  other  comprehensive  income  ('OCI')  and  derivative  instruments.  Likewise,  the  carrying  value  of  assets  and liabilities recognized as a fair value hedge are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are stated in Colombian pesos and, except earnings per share, diluted earnings per share and the market exchange rate, which are stated in units of Colombian pesos, its figures are stated in millions or billions (when indicated), while other currencies (dollars, euro, pounds, etc.) are stated in thousands.\n\nThe Parent Company's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with 'Normas de Contabilidad e Informaci\u00f3n  Financiera'  (NCIF)  applicable  to  separate  financial  statements,  are  those  that  serve  as  the  basis  for  the distribution of dividends and other appropriations by the shareholders.\n\nThe separate financial statements are those presented by the Parent Company in which the entity elected to account for its investments in joint ventures and associates at cost, and the recognition and measurement of impairment for credit risk through allowances for loans losses are accounted for as required by the SFC.\n\n## B.    Presentation of financial statements\n\nThe Bank presents the consolidated statement of financial position ordered by liquidity and the consolidated statement of income is prepared based on the nature of expenses. Revenues and expenses are not offset, unless such compensation is permitted or required by any accounting standard or interpretation and are described in the Bank's policies.\n\nThe statement of comprehensive income presents net income and items of other comprehensive income (OCI) classified by nature and grouped into those that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and those that will be reclassified when specific conditions are met. The Bank discloses the amount of income tax relating to each item of OCI.\n\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows was prepared using the indirect method, whereby net income is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, changes during the period in operating assets and liabilities, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows.\n\n## C.    Consolidation\n\n## 1.     Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Bancolombia S.A. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Parent Company consolidates the financial results of the entities over which it exerts control.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, a subsidiary is an entity controlled by any of the entities that comprise the Bank, as long as the controlling entity has:\n\n- \u00b7 Power  over  the  investee  that  give  it  the  ability  to  direct  their  relevant  activities  that  significantly  affect  the investee's returns.\n- \u00b7 Exposure or rights to variable returns for its involvement with the investee.",

This equity securities are considered as a business, because of its capacity to generate income.\n- (3) The decrease in the shareholding is due to the repurchase outstanding stock carried out by the subsidiary during 2018 and 2019.\n- (4) Investments effected in 2019.\n- (5) Investment not consolidated during 2019 because it does not meet control requirements.\n- (6) Investment consolidated by Banistmo during 2019.\n- (7) Investments in non-operational stage.\n- (8) On September 29, 2020, Grupo Bancolombia acquired 40% of the shareholdings of Grupo Agromercantil Holding (GAH), a company that owns the financial conglomerate Agromercantil of Guatemala.\n- (9) Companies sold during 2019.\n- (10) Companies in liquidation.\n- (11) On October 5, 2020, the Board of Directors of Bancolombia Panam\u00e1 (parent company of Bancolombia Cayman), authorized the decision to wind-down the business and operations of its subsidiary in Cayman. The wind-down would be completed before the end of the year 2021. For further information, see Note 1. Reporting entity.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the accounting principles in the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Bank's accounting policies.\n\nAll intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Bank are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling  interests  in  controlled  entities  are  presented  in  profit  or  loss  and  equity  separately  from  the  Parent Company shareholders equity and profit or loss. When the Bank loses control over a subsidiary, any residual interest remaining on the Bank's balances is measured at fair value; gains or losses arising from this measurement are recognized in net income.\n\nThere  are  restrictions  on  the  ability  of  the  Parent  Company  to  obtain  distributions  of  capital,  due  to  the  regulatory requirements of its  subsidiaries  in  Panama.  Banistmo  and Bancolombia  Panama  have  net  assets  before  intercompany eliminations amounting to COP 10,256,417 and COP 9,487,725 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe loans and financial leases granted by those subsidiaries are subject to prudential regulation in Panama issued by the Panamanian Superintendency of Banks including a requirement to maintain minimum reserves as a countercyclical capital buffer. For the years ended as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the reserves recognized amounted to COP 1,232,033 and COP 684,698.

Transactions between entities under common control\n\nCombination of entities under common control, i.e. transactions in which all the combining entities are under the control of the Bank both before and after the combination, and that control is not transitory, are outside the scope of the IFRS 3Business combinations. Currently, there is no specific guidance for these transactions under IFRS, therefore, as permitted by IAS 8, the Bank has developed an accounting policy considering the pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies. The assets and liabilities recognized as a result of transactions between entities under common control are recognized at the carrying value of the acquirer's financial statements. The Bank presents the net assets received prospectively from the date of the transfer.",

        "page_content": "## 3.     Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nA joint venture is an entity that the Bank controls jointly with other participants, where the parties maintain a contractual agreement that establishes joint control over the relevant activities of the entity (which only exists when decisions about those activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control) and the parties have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the excess of the acquisition cost of the associate or joint venture shares exceeding the Bank's share of the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognized as goodwill and it is included in  the  carrying  amount of  the  investment  and  it  is  not  amortized.  When  necessary,  the  entire  carrying  amount  of  the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment a single asset in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Impairment losses are recognized in net income and are calculated as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture, using the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal, and its carrying value.\n\nThe results and assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5. When an investment in an associate or joint venture is held by, or is held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organization, or a mutual fund, unit trust or similar entities, and  such  investment  is  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  in  that  entity,  the  Bank  may  elect  to  measure investments  in  those  associates  and  joint  ventures  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  in  the  consolidated  financial statements. This election is applied on an investment by investment basis.\n\nUnder the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Bank's share of the profits or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or join venture after the date of acquisition, less any impairment loss on the investment. When the Bank's share of losses of an associate or joint venture exceeds the Bank's interest in that associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Bank's net investment in the associate or joint venture), the Bank discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognized only to the extent that the Bank has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nWhen the equity method is applicable, adjustments are considered in order to adopt uniform accounting policies of the associate or joint venture with the Bank. The portion that corresponds to the Bank for changes in the investee's other comprehensive income items is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as 'Unrealized gain/ (loss) on investments in associates and joint ventures using equity method' and gains or losses of the associate or joint venture are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as 'Dividends received and share of profits of equity method investees', in accordance with the Bank's participation. Gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Bank and its associate or joint venture are recognized in the Bank's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the unrelated investor's interest in the associate or joint venture. The equity method is applied from the acquisition date until the significant influence or joint control over the entity is lost.\n\nThe unrealized gain or loss of an associate or joint venture is presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, net of tax. Changes in the investment's participation that arise from changes in other comprehensive income of an associate or joint venture are recognized directly in the investor's statement of other comprehensive income.\n\nThe dividends received from the associate or joint venture reduce the investment carrying value.\n\nWhen the significant influence on the associate or the joint venture is lost, the Bank measures and recognizes any residual investment that remained at its fair value. The difference between the associate or joint venture carrying value (taking into account the relevant items of other comprehensive income), the fair value of the retained residual investment and any",

The currency translation adjustments recognized in equity are reclassified to net income at the moment of disposal.\n\nFor further information, please see Note 8 Investments in associates and joint ventures.\n\n## 4.     Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\nThe Bank recognizes and measures assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in relation to its interest in joint operations in accordance with the applicable IFRS for the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\n\nIf  the  Bank acquires an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations or when an existing business is contributed to the joint operation on its formation by one of the parties that participate in the joint operation, the Bank will apply all of the principles of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. In this case the Bank recognizes goodwill in the event that consideration transferred exceeds the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nWhen the Bank transacts with a joint operation in which the Parent Company or its subsidiaries is a joint operator (such as a sale or contribution of assets), the Bank is considered to be conducting the transaction with the other parties to the joint operation, and gains and losses resulting from the transactions are recognized in the Bank's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of other parties' interests in the joint operation.\n\nWhen the Bank transacts with a joint operation in which the Parent Company or its subsidiaries is a joint operator (such as a purchase of assets), the Bank does not recognize its share of the gains and losses until it resells those assets to a third party.\n\n## 5.

Bancolombia Panama S.A. (the Bank's subsidiary domiciled in Panama) in accordance with the preexisting agreements. On September 29,  2020,  the  regulatory  authorizations  were  obtained  to  complete  the  acquisition  of  the  remaining  40.00%  of  the shareholding  of  the  GAH.  With  those  authorizations,  the  100.00%  acquisition  operation  is  completed.  Therefore,  in accordance with IFRS 10, changes in the parent's ownership interest in the subsidiary are considered as equity transactions.",

The consideration paid was based on the estimated consolidated net income of GAH as of December 31, 2015. As part of the modification of the agreement, the Bank entered into a put agreement to acquire the remaining 40.00% shares in GAH at a contractually determined future date and value.\n\nThe puttable non-controlling interest liability was recognized in the Bank's statement of financial position and recognized the non-controlling interest at fair value within equity until the BFC's non-controlling interest put option was exercised. In this latter case, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest changed due to the purchase transaction performed in 2020, which modifies the portion of non-controlling interest in the subsidiary.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the portion of ownership in Grupo Agromercantil Holding by the non-controlling interest was 40.00%, which was considered as a significant non-controlling interest for the Bank and its subsidiaries.

        "page_content": "## D.    Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe significant accounting policies that the Bank uses in preparing its consolidated financial statements are detailed below:\n\n## 1.     Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Bank's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Colombian pesos, which is the functional currency for the Parent Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. All transactions and balances in other currency than pesos are considered as foreign currency.\n\n## 2.     Transactions and balances in foreign currency\n\nForeign  currency  transactions  are  translated  into  the  functional  currency  using  the  exchange  rates  at  the  dates  of  the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are generally recognized in net income. They are deferred in equity (other comprehensive income) if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured at cost are held at the exchange rate at the transaction date, while those which are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in the statement of other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in net income, any exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognized in net income.\n\n## 3.     Foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the Bank's presentation currency is translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position,\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses for each statement of income and statement of other comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates, and\n- \u00b7 All  resulting  exchange  differences  are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  in  Translation  adjustment reserve.\n\nAs part of the consolidation process, exchange differences arising from debt securities in issue and the portion of other financial securities designated as hedges of foreign operations that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income in Translation adjustment reserve. When a foreign operation is sold or any debt securities in issue forming part of the net investment are repaid, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to net income, as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing exchange rate.",

Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Bank considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash and balances at banks and the Central Bank, interbank assets and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending that have original maturities up to 90 days, as shown in Note 4 Cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## 5.     Security deposits\n\nSecurity deposits are assets pledged as collateral that correspond to cash guarantees made by the Bank to other financial institutions. The carrying amount is increased when a margin call is issued or when it is necessary to increase the trading quota; conversely, it is decreased when the aim is to lower that quota. The security deposits are recognized as other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position at the amount paid in favor of the counterpart and these assets are subject to interest recognition. These assets are included in the statement of financial position as 'Other assets, net'.\n\n## 6.     Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  those  transactions  where  an  acquirer  obtains  control  of  a  business  (e.g.  an  acquisition  or merger).\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as follows: a) Identifiable acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the acquisition are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition; b) Acquisition costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received; c) and goodwill is recognized as an asset in the consolidated statement of financial position or a gain from a bargain purchase.\n\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Bank (if any).\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the value of any non-controlled interest and, when applicable, the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity, over the net fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.\n\nFor  each  business  combination,  at  the  date  of  acquisition,  the  Bank  measures  the  non-controlling  interest  by  the proportional share of the identifiable assets acquired, as well as liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed by the acquired company, or by their fair value.\n\nAny contingent consideration in a business combination is classified as a liability or as equity and is recognized at fair value  at  the  date  of  acquisition,  the  liability  is  remeasured  at  subsequent  reporting  dates  in  accordance  with  IAS  37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, and the consideration classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.\n\nThe goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at the date of acquisition, to the Bank's cash-generating units (or group of cash generating units) which are expected to benefit from the combination, regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units or group of units.\n\nFor business combinations achieved in stages, any previous equity interest held by the Bank in the acquiree is remeasured at its fair value at the date of acquisition and any resulting gain (or loss) is reported in the consolidated statement of income",

Amounts  related  to  such  investments  previously  recognized  in  other comprehensive income that must be recycled through net income are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income, as if such investment had been sold. When the associate had other comprehensive income, which was not reclassified to profit or loss, the amounts were reclassified within equity to retained earnings once the investment was sold.\n\nWhen the Bank enters into an option contract to acquire totally or partially the amount of shares in a subsidiary held by non-controlling  interest,  that  entitles  the  non-controlling  interest  to  sell  its  interest  in  the  subsidiary  to  the  Bank  (put option), the Bank analyzes whether the ownership risks and rewards remain with the non-controlling interest or have been transferred to the Bank. The non-controlling interest is recognized to the extent the risks and rewards of ownership of those shares remain with them. Irrespective of whether the non-controlling interest is recognized, a financial liability is recorded for the present value of the redemption amount. Subsequent changes to the liability are recognized in net income. The Bank will reclassify the liability to equity if the put option expires unexercised.\n\n## 7.     Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\n## 7.1.  Recognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position when the Bank becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way purchases and sales, which are those purchases and sales of financial assets that require the delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the  marketplace.  The  Bank  uses  settlement  date  accounting  for  regular  way  contracts  when  recording  financial  asset transactions.\n\n## 7.2.  Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are reported on a net basis on the statement of financial position if and only if (i) there is currently a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and (ii) there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Bank does not offset income and expenses, unless required or permitted by an IFRS.\n\n## 7.3.  Fair value\n\nThe fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the statement of financial position date, for recognition or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nTo  determine  fair  value,  characteristics  of  the  asset  or  liability  are  taken  into  account  in  the  same  way  that  market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date; the following items are taken into consideration to assess the estimates:\n\n- \u00b7 Based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to which the Bank can access at the measurement date (level 1).\n- \u00b7 Based on inputs of valuation methodologies commonly used by the market participants, these inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly; considering inputs as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  inputs  other  than quoted  prices  that  are  observable  for  the  assets  or liabilities like interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities and credit spreads, and market-corroborated inputs (level 2).\n- \u00b7 Based on internal valuation techniques of discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies, where one or more inputs are unobservable and therefore estimated by the Bank for the assets or liabilities, in the absence of observable inputs (level 3).",

        "page_content": "The accounting judgments used in determining fair value relate to matters such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. The changes in estimates related to these factors could affect the recognized fair value of the financial instruments.\n\nIn Note 30 Fair Value of assets and liabilities an analysis is provided of the fair values of financial instruments and nonfinancial assets and liabilities, including further details about the measurement of fair value, hierarchy levels and transfers between levels, if any.\n\n## 7.4.  Financial assets\n\nAt initial recognition, the Bank measures financial assets at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets. Financial assets are then classified considering their subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss, fair value through OCI or amortized cost on the basis of the business model  for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. In addition, for particular investments in equity instruments, in accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank made the irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.\n\n## 7.4.1 Money market operations\n\n## Interbank assets and interbank deposits\n\nThese are funds that the Bank lends to other financial institutions or borrows from the Central Bank and other financial institutions. The transactions in an asset position with maturity of up to ninety days are classified as cash equivalents as long as they are not impacted by market fluctuations. The operations in an asset position with maturity greater than ninety days and all the operations in a liability position are measured at amortized cost and presented as 'Other assets, net' or 'interbank deposits', respectively.\n\n## Repurchase agreements and other similar secured transactions\n\n## \u00b7 Asset Position\n\nAsset position refers to transactions accounted for as collateralized lending in which the Bank purchases securities with an agreement to resell them back to the seller at a stated price plus interest at a specified date, not exceeding one year. Repos in asset position are initially recognized at the consideration paid and they are subsequently measured at amortized cost. The difference between the purchase value and resale price is recorded in net interest income and accrued over the life of the agreement using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## \u00b7 Liability Position\n\nLiability position refers to transactions accounted for as collateralized borrowing in which the Bank sells debt securities with an agreement to repurchase them back from the buyer at a stated price plus interest at a specified date, not exceeding one year.\n\nThe securities sold under those agreements are not derecognized from the statement of financial position when the Bank substantially retains all of the risks and rewards of the securities. However, the securities are disclosed as pledged assets. The amounts received are initially recognized, at fair value, as a financial liability and subsequently measured at amortized cost. The difference between the sale value and the repurchase value is treated as interest expense and accrued over the life of the agreement by the effective interest rate method.",

        "page_content": "## 7.4.2 Debt and equity securities\n\n## Securities at amortized cost\n\nDebt securities are classified at amortized cost only if the asset is maintained within a business model whose objective is to hold it in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the security give rise on specified dates to cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal  amount  outstanding.  The  subsequent measurement of its interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method used to calculate the amortized cost of an asset and to assign the income or cost in interest during the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the discount rate at which the present value of future estimated cash payments or those received through the expected life of the financial instrument, or, when appropriate, in a shorter time frame, are equal to the net carrying value at the beginning. To calculate the effective interest rate, the Bank estimates cash flows considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument, including transaction costs and premiums granted minus commissions and discounts, but without considering future credit losses.\n\n## Securities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThese are equity securities and debt securities that are not subsequently measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The difference between the current fair value and the immediately preceding fair value of the respective security is recorded as a higher or lower value of the asset, affecting the statement of income.\n\n## Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nInvestments in debt securities are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are maintained under a business model whose objective is achieved by both obtaining the contractual cash flows and selling the instruments and, in addition, the instruments give rise, on specific dates to cash flows that correspond only to payments of capital and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nChanges in fair value of the investment are recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is written off, the accumulated gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the statement of income. Interest income from these financial assets is recognized in the statement of income as 'Interest and valuation on financial instruments' using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## 7.4.3 Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nThe Bank has made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income, subsequent changes in fair value of some equity instruments that are not held for trading; dividends from this type of instrument are recognized in net income only when the entity's right to receive payment of the dividend is established.\n\n## 7.4.4 Loans and advances to customers and financial institutions, leases and other receivables\n\nThese are financial assets that consist primarily of corporate loans, personal loans (including mainly consumer finance and overdrafts), residential mortgage loans and financial leases. The Bank established that loans, advances to customers and other receivables are held within a business model whose objective is to hold them in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. They are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs and origination fees that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition.  They  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective interest rate method.",

Use of estimates and judgments' paragraph '1. Credit risk Impairment' and Note 6. Loans and advances to customers, net, management assessed the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on evaluations of the  loan  portfolio based on objective and subjective criteria. As disclosed by management, expected credit losses are calculated using individual and collective models and methodologies based on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current borrower situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the prospective approach that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios. In addition, for loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, the fair value of guarantees granted, information on the credit behavior and the future cash flows expected from the client.\n\nAt the end of each period, the Bank assesses the impairment model based on the expected loss of a financial asset or a group of them measured at amortized cost, or at fair value through other comprehensive income, where the impairment loss  will  be  measured from 'day 1' after its initial recognition. The model is structured in three phases in which the financial asset can be categorized, from its initial recognition, considering the degree of credit risk, and the circumstances that have produced a significant increase in it, as described below:\n\n| Stage 1                         | Stage 2                              | Stage 3  (Credit-impaired assets)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| (Initial recognition)           | (Significant increase in credit risk |                                     |\n| 12-month expected credit losses | since initial recognition)           | Lifetime expected credit losses     |\n\nThe expected loss is based on estimates of losses, including reasonable information about past events, current situations and forecasts about future economic conditions. During 2020, some adjustments were implemented in the methodology, in order to determine the appropriate risk of the portfolio that presents  relief and lockdowns generated by the spread of the COVID-19. Among the main adjustments are:\n\n- 1. New criteria to classify the portfolio in stage 2 of the financial assets with active loan's repayment schedule as a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis\n- 2. The Bank records a general Overlay provision adjustment on the population with financial relief caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- 3. Moving averages comprising both observed and forecasted economic variables were introduced, as a way of adjusting models to the unexpected changes generated by the pandemic.\n- 4. Probability  of default  models  (PD  models)  do  not  include  information  for  the  period  in  which  SFC  allowed supervised entities to reprofile all loans including grace periods or extended deadlines as a policy response to the pandemic.\n\nThese adjustments are explained in detail later\n\nThe Bank has determined that the measurement of impairment of the loan portfolio and financial leasing operations can be made through a collective or individual assessment in accordance with the amount of and characteristics of the loan.\n\nCollective models include 12-months probability of default parameters (12-month PD), the lifetime probability of default (lifetime PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) with the inclusion of the prospective approach. The individual analysis methodology is applied to significant exposures and includes the evaluation of weighted loss scenarios, considering the macroeconomic forecasts and the special conditions of each debtor for the future generation of the cash flow.",

For stage 1, a 12-month ECL will be calculated which will acknowledge the expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date, while for stage 2 and 3 a Lifetime ECL will be calculated which contains the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument.\n\n## Significant increase in risk\n\nTo establish whether an asset presents a significant increase in risk since the initial recognition, the Bank performs an assessment of quantitative and qualitative factors and reviews for each portfolio the rebuttable presumption of more than 30 days of default. The way in which the Bank determines whether the credit risk of financial instruments has increased significantly since the initial recognition is as follows:\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nLifetime PD assessment: the Bank has defined that the most suitable quantitative way to establish the significant increase in credit risk is by comparing the residual lifetime PD at the initial recognition and the current lifetime PD. In order to measure this difference, two thresholds are defined:\n\n- \u25aa Absolute  threshold:  is  the  absolute  difference  between  the  value  of  the  residual  lifetime  PD  at  the  initial recognition and the current lifetime PD. This threshold determines the value from which a positive absolute variation identifies an increase in the risk of the instrument.\n- \u25aa Relative  threshold:  it  is  a  percentage  variation  between  the  value  of  the  residual  lifetime  PD  at  the  initial recognition and the current lifetime PD. This threshold determines the value from which a positive percentage variation identifies an increase in the instrument risk.\n\nIn the event the comparison of PD's results in the surpassing of one threshold but not the other, it is not considered that there is a significant increase in the risk for the instrument.\n\nIf the instrument does not exceed the threshold, other qualitative criteria are assessed, which can identify a significant increase credit risk even when the obligation is very close to expiration, this criterion are the following:\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\n- \u25aa The assets restructured by risk, where the client is experiencing financial difficulties, are classified in stage 2 and provisioned by lifetime expected credit loss until the instrument is canceled, or cured, or it is transferred to stage",

Clients identified with greater risk through the implementation of expert models and crisis forums are classified in stage 2.\n- 2. Clients with payment modifications that in the last year presented a default greater than 30 days are classified in stage 2.\n- 3. Clients with payment concessions cannot upgrade a stage for a period of 3 months after the payment concession was granted.\n- 4. Clients identified as affected by their ability to pay due to COVID-19 are classified in stage 2.\n\n## Refutable presumption of more than 30 days of default\n\nThe Bank has reviewed for each portfolio the presumption of a significant increase in 30 days past due and finds historical evidence that there is a relationship between this presumption and default, except for Banistmo's mortgage portfolio, where the Bank has refuted the presumption. The basis for refuting this presumption is that there is reasonable and sustainable information that shows that when the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, this does not represent a significant increase in the credit risk of a financial instrument, the main causes being:\n\n- Banistmo has a percentage of the mortgage portfolio that remain in the delinquency range of 31-60 days for operational issues due to the collection of checks (which generate a high operational burden), so that the payment usual practice exceeds 30 days, in accordance with IFRS 9.B5.5.20, when a non-payment is an administrative oversight, instead of a financial difficulty of the borrower it is possible to refute this presumption.\n- There is no relationship between mortgages whose payments are past due for more than 30 days and the default.\n\nIn accordance with the previous paragraph, the significant increase in credit risk for Banistmo's mortgage portfolio is defined at 60 days past due.",

In Colombia and Panama, the rating system for the consumer portfolio is assessed using random forest methodology, mathematical models which allow for a greater number of variables related to the client and  have  more  precise  rating  consistent  with  the  level  of  risk.  These  methodologies  have  a  fundamental  role  in  the evaluation and monitoring of credit risk.\n\nFor companies, the level of risk is measured based on an internal rating model, which uses qualitative and quantitative variables as financial indicators of the client and then ranked on a scale between 8 and 19 levels. The qualification programs of the region, factors of the local market and the knowledge of the client in the market, beyond their financial figures, are involved in this process. In Colombia, a random forest methodology model is used for rating the SME portfolio; these are mathematical models which allows to use a greater number of variables related to the client and have more precise rating consistent with the level of risk. These methodologies have a fundamental role in the evaluation and monitoring of credit risk.\n\nThe Bank implemented the following measures in the assignment of the score as a consequence of the reprofile of the loan's repayment schedule due to COVID-19:\n\n- 1. Commercial Clients are individually analyzed trough crisis forums and the portfolio rating process carried out at the end of 2020.\n- 2. Minimum score for modified or restructured clients.\n- 3. Individual clients with consumer loans portfolio with active loan's repayment schedule at closing is assigned the highest impairment rating between the current month and the rating before COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the region (February 2020).\n- 4. Individual clients with consumer loans portfolio whose reprofile of the loan's repayment schedule ended in a less than 4 months period and did not make any payments are impaired to the highest rating.\n\nFor further details, please see Note 31 Risk management, section: Description of Loans and Financial Leases. To estimate the expected credit losses (ECL) under the collective methodology, the following formula is used:\n\n## ECL = Probability of Default * Loss Given Default * Esposure At Default\n\nThe factors are estimated using statistical models developed from internal historical information of the  entity and then adjusted with forward-looking information as described below:\n\n- \u00b7 Probability of Default (PD). Estimated probability of occurrence of a default of an instrument. IFRS 9 proposes the specification of this parameter and its application according to the classification of stages 1, 2 and 3.\n- o PD 12 months: The estimated probability of occurrence of a default in the next 12 months of the instrument's life as of the date of analysis. The Bank defines the use of PD 12 months for current portfolio that does not present a significant increase in credit risk or any impairment evidence (portfolio classified in stage 1). To estimate  the  probability  of  default  for  12  months,  the  Bank  uses  traditional  techniques  such  as  logistic regression, modeling the behavior of the portfolio by level of risk for each of the segments.",

The Bank defines the use of lifetime PD for portfolio with a significant increase in credit risk (portfolio classified in stage 2). The Bank estimates this factor using survival models which propose a statistical analysis to quantify the survival rate of a portfolio for a given period. One of the advantages of the model is the inclusion of censored data within the analysis, that  is,  those  instruments  that  leave  the  portfolio  during  the  observation  period  for  various  reasons (cancellations, sales, etc.).\n- o PD stage 3: The customers evaluated by the collective methodology in stage 3 have an associated probability of default of 100%.\n- \u00b7 Loss Given Default (LGD): The severity or Loss Given Default is the percentage of exposure that the entity ultimately expects to lose in the event of a default in a financial instrument. The general formulation for the calculation of the LGD is = 1- Recovery Percentage, where the recovery percentage refers to the sum of the flows received from the transaction discounted at the rate for the client on the date of analysis on the total of the exposure at the time of default, including contractual debt sales and other recovery strategy. For secured products, this is primarily based on collateral type and projected collateral values, the use of appraisals to determine the value of the collateral and time to repossession and recovery costs observed.\n- \u00b7 Exposure at Default: The exposed value of the asset valued at amortized cost (includes the balance of capital, interest  and  accounts  receivable),  this  is  based  on  the  contractual  repayments  owed  by  the  borrower  over  a 12month or lifetime basis.\n- For revolving products and those with an available quota that is likely to be used in its entirety, the Exposure At Default (EAD) estimate considers the use of the CCF (risk conversion factor), in order to find a relationship corresponding to the used and unused component of the instrument. To estimate the expected credit losses (ECL) it's considered a component of probability of revolving products becoming loan.\n\nIn  order  to  estimate  the  lifetime  expected  credit  loss,  the  exposed  balance  is  projected  annually,  taking  into account the discount of contractual payments agreed with the client for each year. The discount of the flows is made at the effective interest rate or an approximation of it.\n\n## Forward-looking information incorporated in the ECL models\n\nTo incorporate the prospective information to the factors defined for the estimation of the expected loss, the Bank uses methodologies that correlate the historical behavior of the portfolio with certain economic variables. The Bank has made the projection of three macro scenarios (base, pessimistic and optimistic); each scenario has a plausible probability of occurrence to evaluate the best estimate of the expected loss under possible future economic conditions.\n\nTo make the projections, the Corporate Economic Research team has defined a process for the generation of estimates under two perspectives: thematic and analytical.\n\nThematic Perspective: in the first instance, a series of external variables are defined, which are those whose values are established at a global level and in whose definition the idiosyncratic dynamics of the analyzed country have no incidence. As these are issues whose detailed study is beyond the scope of the Corporate Economic Research team, the Bank take as reference the estimates made by external analysts.\n\nAnalytical Perspective: this consists in the compilation of the historical information for the most important economic and financial variables of the country. The information bases are compiled from official sources, which mostly correspond to official authorities, such as the Superintendency or Central Bank of each country. The Bank estimates forecasts based on time series models widely used in econometrics.\n\nAs a result, projections are obtained for the economic variables of interest, which are formulated monthly in a time horizon that includes the current year and five subsequent years.

        "page_content": "uncertainty, the projection of the economic variables for the total remaining useful life of each instrument corresponds to the value of the last projection.\n\nThe Bank considers that keeping the five years onwards of projection results in the better estimate, taking into account that the average economic cycle is approximately between 4 and 4.5 years (referenced by the Bank's  economic research area, with historical data between 1906 and 2018). Therefore, five years of projection are enough to reflect the economic cycle dynamics, because the last year already has the equilibrium tendency immersed.\n\n## Economic scenario weightings\n\nTo incorporate  not  only  a  perspective,  but  also  to  recognize  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  short  and  medium-term economic context that the country will experience, the projection work incorporates three scenarios: base, optimistic and pessimistic.\n\nIt  is  intended that each one of them contains reasonable expectations and that each has a relevant level of probability associated with it. In other words, we seek to formulate possible, not extreme, scenarios. The projections of the base scenario correspond to the average estimate of the analysts (60%), while for the pessimistic scenario the observation of the 20th percentile is taken and for the optimistic scenario the 80th percentile.\n\nThe base scenario corresponds to the one with the highest probability of occurrence and comes directly from the results of the projection models developed for each indicator, this scenario had a weighting of 60% in 2019. On the other hand, both the optimistic and the pessimistic scenarios are determined based on the values of the base scenario adjusted according to the standard error of the projections (each scenario has a weighting of 20%).\n\nHowever, due to economic events and risks related to COVID-19, at the closure of 2020 these weights were modified. In particular, the weights were distributed as follows: base scenario with a weighting of 60%, pessimistic scenario with a weighting of 30%, and finally optimistic scenario with a weighting of 10%.\n\nThe change in weights is mainly based on the impact that the crisis had throughout the year on the distribution of GDP growth forecasts. With the support of the Bank's transactional information, it was possible to recognize early the impact of the consecutive extensions of the measures to contain the spread of the virus on the forecasts of GDP growth. Since the shock generated by the pandemic led to a severe deterioration of real and financial variables, probabilities assigned to economic scenarios were adjusted in order to incorporate a higher like hood of negative outcomes.\n\nThe  current  situation  due  to  COVID-19  represents  significant  challenges  for  expected  loss  models  (ECL).  The  first challenge  stems  from  the  radical  change  in  a  country's  economic  prospects.  Default  probability  models  incorporate between  five  and  seven  years  of  recent  history  for  their  estimation.  This  recent  history  is  characterized  by  good performance  for  most  of  the  indicators.  These  indicators  are  characterized  by  stable,  albeit  moderate,  GDP  growth, contained inflation, and stable or declining unemployment rates. However, the new macroeconomic projections include a rapid contraction of GDP for 2020 and in some cases 2021 and 2022, rising unemployment and significant volatility in consumer prices.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  above,  one  of  the  main  impacts  on  the  provision  is  due  to  the  update  of  the  macroeconomic scenarios. This update considered the duration of the suggested or forced lockdowns, and the  measures announced by national governments to reestablish the economy. To the extent that the severity of the economic shock depends on the actions of governments, as well as the evolution of the health situation, different probabilities of occurrence have been assigned to the base, pessimistic and optimistic scenarios. These probabilities reflect the expectations that the Bank has regarding economic developments and have been updated using the best available and reliable information on past events, current conditions and economic forecasts.\n\nA moving average of the macroeconomic variables was performed by the Bank, following the recommendations made by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), in order to consider the guidelines issued by international regulators regarding the application of the IFRS 9 standard in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic as a means to avoid excessively procyclical assumptions when determining the provisions caused by the volatility of the macroeconomic forecasts that",

loss.",

Significant financial assets are considered in default when, based on current or past information and events, it is probable that the entity will not be able to recover all the amounts described in the original contract, including the interest and commissions agreed to in the contract. When a significant financial asset has been identified as being in default, the amount of the loss is measured as the balance due minus the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence.\n\nCustomers classified as individual net present value (NPV) will be evaluated at least twice a year and additionally each time a relevant event occurs that reflects in significant changes in their level of  risk and that leads to a change in the scenarios previously analyzed. The relevant events can be:\n\n- \u00b7 Significant changes in the value of the guarantee.\n- \u00b7 Expected or adverse changes in the business.\n- \u00b7 Potentially shocking regulatory changes for the business.\n- \u00b7 Changes they make in their commercial and operational dynamics.\n- \u00b7 Significant amount of payments made by the client.\n\nTo establish the future cash flows expected from the client, two approaches are presented, which may be via cash flow generation or via execution of some type of guarantee or liquidation of assets, that is, 'Going Concern' or 'Gone Concern' approach.\n\nApproach via cash flow: This refers to an analysis under the premise of \"GOING CONCERN\", that is, it is assumed that the payment of the obligation will be made through the client's cash flow. The expected NPV calculation with a cash flow approach includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial projections of the client.\n- \u00b7 Debt simulator.\n- \u00b7 Expected NPV calculation.\n\nApproach via guarantee recovery: This refers to the \"GONE CONCERN\", that is, it is assumed that the payment of the obligation will be given through the execution of guarantees, liquidation of assets, the execution of personal guarantees and adjudication of assets through judicial processes. The calculation of the NPV with guarantee approach includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the guarantee.\n- \u00b7 Future value of the guarantee.\n- \u00b7 NPV calculation.\n- \u00b7 Recovery times.\n\nFuture cash flows are estimated based on two scenarios (base and alternative) that can be affected by the aforementioned variables.\n\n## Additional provision for COVID-19\n\nThe Bank recorded a general provision adjustment (called overlay) on the population subject to relief arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of the methodology is to replicate in the loans subject to relief the behavior that the portfolio normally presents through historical behavior factors and to estimate the additional expense that is no longer being recognized due to the masking of the behavior of the portfolio as a result of the applied relief.",

To establish whether a security has a significant increase in risk since the initial recognition, an assessment of the deterioration of the rating in the current date is made against the rating granted at the time of purchase, according to the origin classification there may be an increase with 1, 2 or 3 notches as shown in the following table:\n\n| EXTERNAL RATING ORIGIN   | SIGNIFICANT INCREASE  IN RISK   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Ba1/BB+                  | 3 Notches                       |\n| Ba2/BB                   | 3 Notches                       |\n| Ba3/BB-                  | 3 Notches                       |\n| B1/B+                    | 2 Notches                       |\n| B2/B                     | 2 Notches                       |\n| B3/B-                    | 1 Notch                         |\n| Caa/CCC                  | 1 Notch                         |",

The loan restructuring is implemented through amendments to the contractual terms, resulting in changes of rates and payment terms. However, at the time of restructuring, the Bank seeks to retain and enhance the collateral available if possible.\n\nIn the restructuring, real and personal property can be received as foreclosed assets to cancel partially the receivables. The terms are reviewed in each negotiation to determine if the client should continue in the portfolio and if so, the terms to restore the business relationship after a certain time.\n\nRestructuring due to customer's credit risk difficulties is typically assessed as a non-substantial modification and therefore it does not lead to derecognition. When a financial asset is restructured, the difference between the original contractual cash flow and the new cash flow of the restructured asset discounted at the original effective interest rate is recognized as a gain or loss in the income statement as 'interest income', and the costs and fees are deferred and will be amortized by the remaining life of the modified asset.\n\n## Modifications\n\nFor other commercial modifications, the Bank assess whether the modification is substantial, given the fact that the changes in  contractual  terms  differ  substantially  from  the  original  contract,  based  on  the  analysis  of  qualitative  variables  and quantitative assessments in some cases. When the modifications result in a derecognition, the renegotiated contract is a new loan and the impairment is evaluated in accordance with the Bank's risk policy, initially recognizing the loan in stage 1, and evaluating the significant increases on credit risk from the date of modification onwards. Likewise, the costs and fees are written off, which are recognized immediately in the income statement. New credit-impaired loans purchased or originated are not recognized.\n\nModifications that do not result in derecognition are assessed as non-substantial modifications, and the carrying amount is  recalculated  as  the  present  value  of  the  modified  contractual  cash  flows  discounted  at  the  original  interest  rate, recognizing the effect of modification in the income statement as 'interest income'. Similarly, costs and fees are deferred and will be amortized for the remaining life of the modified asset.",

Use of estimates and judgments' paragraph '10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's judgements and estimates' set out below and Note 31. Risk management.\n\n## 7.4.7 Leasing\n\n## 7.4.7.1 The Bank as lessee\n\n## Application since January 1, 2019:\n\nOn entering a new lease contract, the Bank recognizes a right-of-use asset and a liability. Both the right-of-use asset and the  lease  liability  are  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  remaining  lease  payments,  discounted  using  the  lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Additionally, the right-of-use asset includes 1) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability; 2) lease payments made or cost incurred by the lessee at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; and 3) costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required.\n\nSubsequently, the Bank measures the right-of-use asset at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The Bank measures the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability; reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any new expectation or lease modifications. Each lease payment has been allocated between the liability and interest expenses. The accrued interest on the lease liability for each period over the lease term will be the amount that produces a constant periodic rate of interest (incremental borrowing rate) on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\n\nThe Bank does not recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for 1) leases for a period of less than 12 months that do not contain a purchase option; and 2) leases in which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments related to these exemptions are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Accounting policy applied until December 31, 2018:\n\nThe assets leased under financial leases are recognized at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Such assets are recognized as premises and equipment in the statement of financial position.\n\nThe assets leased under financial leases are depreciated throughout their life using the straight-line method. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Bank will obtain the property at the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated throughout its  life  or  the  lease  term,  whichever  is  shorter.  The  lease  payments  are  divided  between  interest  and  debt reduction. The finance charges are recorded in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe payments for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease as expenses in the statement of income during the lease term. Lease incentives received are recognized as an integral part of the total lease expenses over the term of the lease.\n\n## 7.4.7.2 The Bank as lessor\n\nThe lease agreements entered into by the Bank are classified at the initial recognition as financial or operating leases.\n\nThe Bank classifies a lease as a financial lease when according to the agreement substantially all the inherent risks and benefits are transferred to the lessee. Financial leases are recognized as the sum of the minimum payments to be received and any unguaranteed residual value, discounted at the lease interest rate. Otherwise, the lease is classified as an operating lease, which is classified in the statement of financial position as premises and equipment. The initial direct costs incurred in the negotiation of an operating lease are added to the carrying value of the leased assets and recorded as a cost during",

Among the benefits derived from the use are the expectation of profit over the economic life of the asset and eventually, the appreciation of the changes of its residual value or realization of the asset.\n\nThe following are indications of transfer of risk and rewards of ownership to the lessee:\n\n- \u00b7 The agreement indicates that the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be equal to or less than 10% of the fair value of the asset upon termination of the lease.\n- \u00b7 The term of the lease covers most of the economic life of the asset even when the lease does not transfer the ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the end of the lease term, i.e. when the minimum lease term represents 75% or more of the economic life of the leased asset.\n- \u00b7 At the inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least 90% of the fair value of the leased asset.\n- \u00b7 The leased assets are of such a specialized nature that only the lessee has the possibility of using them without making significant modifications.\n\nIf during the lease term, the lessor and the lessee decide to modify the initial conditions, and the agreed changes result in a different classification, then the modified agreement will be considered a new lease with new clauses that will lead to the classification of a financial or operating lease, as appropriate.\n\n## 7.5. Financial liabilities\n\nAt  initial  recognition,  the  Bank  measures  its  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value.  The  transaction  costs  that  are  directly attributable to the financial liability are deducted from its fair value if the instruments are subsequently recognized at amortized cost or will be recognized in the statement of income if the liabilities are measured at fair value.\n\nDerivative liabilities are measured at fair value through profit and loss and the gains or losses of those liabilities are recognized in the statement of income for subsequent measurements. Non-derivative financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate. Interest expenses are recognized in the statement of income unless the financial liability is designated as at fair value through profit or loss, for which is required to present the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income.\n\n## 7.5.1 Compound instruments\n\nCompound financial instruments  that  are  comprised  of  both  a  liability  and  equity  component  must  be  separated  and accounted for separately. Therefore, for initial measurement, the liability component is the fair value of a similar liability which doesn't have an equity component (determined by discounting future cash flows using the market rate at the date of the issuance). The difference between the fair value of the liability component and the fair value of the compound financial instrument considered as a whole is the residual value assigned to the equity component. Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition. The liability component corresponds to the preferred dividend related to 1% of the subscription price, which is the payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares for each period in accordance with the Bank's bylaws.\n\n## 7.5.2 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nIn order to meet the needs of its customers, the Bank issues financial standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and loan commitments. Loan commitments are those agreements under which the Bank has an irrevocable obligation to grant the loan. The financial guarantee contracts issued by the Bank are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments",

In this case, the amortized cost of the modified liability is adjusted to the present value of the estimated contractual cash flows which are discounted at the original effective interest rate of the financial instrument and a gain or loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Incremental costs and commissions adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortized over the remaining life of the modified liability; its subsequent measurement continues at amortized cost. In debt exchanges where the new instrument is considered substantially different, the liability is derecognized with charged to the income statement, and a new financial liability arises.",

When default conditions are present, it is initially necessary to evaluate whether the collateral that supports the loan generates a reasonable expectation of recovery; if so, the necessary steps are taken to realize on the collateral prior to writing-off the loan. In cases where the collateral net fair value indicates that there are no reasonable expectations of recovery, loans are written-off in the financial statements.\n\n## 7.7. Derivatives financial instruments\n\nA financial derivative is an instrument whose value changes in response to changes in a variable such as an interest rate, exchange rate, the price of a financial instrument, a credit rating or a credit index. This instrument requires no initial payment, or a smaller investment than would be required for other financial instruments with a similar response to changes in market conditions, and it is generally settled at a future date. The Bank recognizes its derivatives financial instruments at fair value based on the prices and methodologies provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia). Counterparty credit-risk adjustments are applied to derivatives when the Bank's position is a derivative asset and the Bank's credit risk is incorporated when the position is a derivative liability. For further information, see Note 30. Fair value of assets and liabilities, section d. Credit valuation adjustment.\n\nThe Bank carries out derivative transactions to facilitate the business of clients related to the management of their market and credit risk; managing the exposure in its own position to changes in interest rates and risks in exchange rates; or to obtain benefits from changes in valuations experienced by these instruments in the market. Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value through profit or loss, unless such derivatives are designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges or as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. In those cases, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.\n\n## 7.7.1 Hedge accounting\n\nFair value hedges are used by the Bank, through its Panamanian subsidiary, Banistmo, to protect against changes in the fair value of investment securities that are attributable to interest rate variability. The Bank applied the hedge accounting provisions required by IFRS 9 prospectively from January 01, 2019 and assessed that all qualifying criteria under IFRS 9 were met at the date when it ceased to apply hedge requirements of IAS 39. When the hedging relationship is considered to be highly effective, the changes in value of the hedging derivative are accounted for according to their classification as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of net investment in foreign operations, as set out in the paragraph below.\n\nThe Bank assesses at the inception of the hedge and on a monthly basis during the life of the instrument, whether the hedge used in the transaction is expected to be aligned with the hedge effectiveness requirement (prospective effectiveness):\n\n- \u00b7 Economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.",

Consequently, the item no longer complies with the hedge accounting conditions or the hedging relationship no longer complies with the risk management objective. When hedge accounting for a fair value hedge is terminated, the previous adjustments related to the changes in fair value of the hedged item are subsequently recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of that asset. When hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge is terminated, the accumulated gains and losses recorded in equity will be reclassified to the Statement of Income in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows are realized.\n\nBefore the establishment of hedge accounting, the Bank documents the relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments, as well as its risk management objectives and hedging strategies, which are approved by the Risk Management Committee as the body designated by the Board of Directors.\n\nHedge relationships are classified and accounted for in the following ways:\n\nFair  value  hedges  are  designated  to  protect  against  the  exposure  to  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  recognized  assets  or liabilities or unrecognized firm commitments.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments in fair value hedges are recognized in the statement of income as interest and valuation on financial instruments. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is included as part of the carrying value of the hedged item, and it is also recognized in the aforementioned item of statement of income.\n\nFor fair value hedges that are related to items accounted for at amortized cost, the adjustments to the carrying value are amortized through the statement of income during the remaining term until their expiry.\n\nThe amortization of the effective interest rate shall begin as long as there is an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged  item  and  shall  begin  no  later  than  when  the  hedged  item  ceases  to  be  adjusted  for  changes  in  its  fair  value attributable  to  the  risk  being  hedged.  The  adjustment  is  based  on  a  recalculated  effective  interest  rate  at  the  date amortization begins. If the hedged item is derecognized, the non-amortized fair value is recognized immediately in the statement of income. If the hedge instrument expires or it is sold, terminated or exercised, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the Bank discontinues prospectively the hedge accounting. For the items hedged at amortized cost, the difference between the carrying value of the item hedged at the termination of the hedge and the nominal value are amortized using the effective rate method during the time beyond the original terms of the hedge. If the hedged item is derecognized, the remaining value to amortize is recognized immediately in the statement of income.\n\nWhen an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income.\n\nCash flow hedges are used mainly to manage the exposure to variability related to the cash flow attributable to a specific risk associated with an asset or liability recognized on statement of financial position or to a highly probable forecast transaction.\n\nThe portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in the statement of income.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, without replacement or rollover into another hedging instrument, or if the hedging designation no longer meets the criteria provided for the hedge effectiveness requirements",

When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in net income.\n\nHedges of a net investment in a foreign operation: In accordance with IFRS 9 'Financial instruments' and IFRIC 16 'Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation', the Bank has decided to apply the hedge accounting of the foreign currency risk arising from currency translation of financial statements and goodwill of its net investment in Banistmo, designating  as  a  hedging  instrument  of  certain  debt  securities  issued  by  the  Parent  Company.  The  hedge  accounting requires that the Bank accounts for the gain or loss derived from the foreign exchange differences related to the debt securities that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income, as is the currency translation adjustment of the Banistmo operation into the presentation currency as required by IAS 21 as detailed in 2.

However, the fair value of the financial asset or financial liability can be different from the transaction price at initial recognition. When the amounts are not equal, the asset or liability should be measured at fair value and the difference between the transaction price and fair value is required to be recognized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 If the fair value is assessed as Level 1 based on the inputs or the valuation technique applied uses only data from observable markets, therefore Bank recognizes the difference as a gain or loss on initial recognition.\n- \u00b7 In all other circumstances, the Bank defers day one gain or loss recognition in the statement of income over the life of the transaction.\n\n## 8. Premises and equipment\n\nPremises and equipment include tangible items that are held for use, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and are expected to be used for more than one period.\n\nItems of premises and equipment are expressed at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, in order to derecognize the depreciable amount of promises and equipment over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The depreciable amount is the cost of an asset less its residual value. The estimated useful lives for each asset group are:\n\n| Asset group             | Useful life range   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Buildings               | 10 to 75 years      |\n| Furniture and fixtures  | 5 to 20 years       |\n| Computer equipment      | 3 to 20 years       |\n| Equipment and machinery | 3 to 40 years       |\n| Vehicles                | 3 to 6 years        |\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. When there is a significant change, the depreciation and the charge to the statement of income are adjusted based on the new estimation.",

If there is any indication of impairment, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of the assets and then recognizes the impairment loss in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount and is recognized in the statement of income as 'impairment, depreciation and amortization'.\n\nWhen the carrying value exceeds the recoverable value (the greater of fair value less the costs of sale and value in use), the carrying value is adjusted to its recoverable value, modifying the future charges for depreciation, according to its new remaining useful life.\n\nIn a similar way, when indications exist that the value of an asset has been recovered, reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the statement of income and consequently the future charges for the asset's depreciation are adjusted. In any case, the reversal of the impairment loss of assets cannot increase it carrying value above the amount that it would have if impairment losses in previous periods had not been recognized.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the smallest identifiable group that generates cash inflows that  are  largely  independent  of  the  cash  inflows  from  other  assets  or  groups  of  assets  (cash-generating  units).  The evaluation can be carried out at individual asset level when the fair value less the cost of sale can be reliably determined and the value in use is estimated to be close to its fair value less costs to sell and fair value less costs to sell can be determined.\n\nMaintenance expenses of the premises and equipment are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred and are registered in the consolidated statement of income as administrative and general expenses .\n\nGains and losses in the sale of premises and equipment are registered in the consolidated statement of income as other operating income or other expenses.\n\n## 9. Investment properties\n\nLand and buildings that the Bank holds to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both rather than for their use in the supply of services or sale in the ordinary course of business are recognized as investment properties.\n\nThe investment properties are measured initially at cost, including the transaction costs. The carrying value includes the cost of replacement or substitution of a part of an investment property at the time the cost is incurred, if the cost meets the recognition criteria; and it excludes the daily maintenance costs of the investment property which are included in the statement of income as 'Other operating expenses'.\n\nAfter the initial recognition, the investment properties are measured at fair value which reflects the market conditions at the statement of financial position date. The gains and losses that arise from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in the statement of income as 'Other operating income'.\n\nThe  investment  properties  are  derecognized,  either  at  the  moment  of  their  disposal  or  when  they  are  permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of the investment properties and the carrying value is recognized in net income in the period the disposal occurs.\n\nTransfers of an asset to or from the investment properties are only made when there is a change in its use. For a transfer from an investment property to premises and equipment, the cost taken into account for its subsequent accounting is the fair value at the time of the change in use.

Separately acquired intangible assets are measured initially at their cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is their fair value at the date of acquisition. After the initial recognition, the intangible assets are accounted for at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment loss. The costs of internally generated intangible assets, excluding the costs from development that meet the recognition criteria, are not capitalized and the expense is reflected in the statement of income as it is incurred.\n\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are determined as finite or indefinite. The intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at least annually. The expected changes in the useful life or in the pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits of the asset are accounted for when changing the period or amortization method, as appropriate, and they are treated as changes in the accounting estimates. The amortization expense of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in the statement of income. The useful lives of the intangible assets with finite life ranges between 1 and 10 years.\n\nWhen intangible assets with finite useful life are written-off, the expected of the future economic benefits period is reduced to increase the amount of amortization, resulting in the derecognition of the intangible asset in a shorter period than initially estimated.\n\nThe Bank assesses annually its intangible assets with finite life in order to identify whether any indications of impairment exist, as well as possible reversal of previous impairment losses.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization but are periodically tested in order to identify any impairment, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of the indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine if it continues being supportable. In the event that the assessment was not valid, the change from indefinite useful life to finite useful life is recognized prospectively.\n\nThe gain or loss that arises when an intangible asset is derecognized are measured as the difference between the disposal value and the carrying value of the asset and is recognized in the statement of income.\n\nThe Bank's intangible assets comprise mainly intangibles of finite useful life: licenses, software and computer applications, client relationships and the legal stability agreement signed with the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (See Note 9. Goodwill  and  intangible  assets,  net),  customer  relationships  and  patents.  Intangibles  of  indefinite  useful  life  include Goodwill.\n\nFor  further  information  on  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  see  section  'E.

These are controlled by the Bank and are expected to generate future economic benefits.\n\nThe inventories of returned property are recognized as an asset from the date on which the Bank assumes the risks and benefits of the inventories, provided that the cost of the asset can be reliably measured, and it is  probable that it will generate future economic benefits.\n\nThe inventories of returned property are valued using the specific identification method and their costs include the carrying value at the time the asset is returned.\n\nThe carrying value of returned property is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to sell. The adjustment in the carrying value to reflect the NRV is recognized in the statement of income for the period in which the goods are returned. The value of any reversion that comes from an increase in the NRV in which the increase occurs is recognized as a lower expense in the period.\n\nOther new inventories are measured initially at acquisition cost which comprises the sum of the purchase price, the import costs (if applicable), the non-recoverable taxes paid, the storage, the transport costs, and other attributable or necessary costs for their acquisition, less discounts, reductions or similar items. Those inventories do not include selling costs.\n\nThe Bank must review the NRV of its inventories at least annually or whenever necessary if indicated by market conditions. Any write-down adjustment must be recognized directly in the statement of income.\n\n## 12. Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nA non-current asset or a disposal group of assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use. These assets or groups of assets are shown separately in the statement of financial position at the lower of their carrying value and their fair value less costs to sell and they are not depreciated nor amortized from the date of their classification.\n\nThe held for sale condition is met if the assets or group of assets are available, in their current condition, for immediate sale and the sale transaction is highly probable and is expected to be completed within the year following the date of classification.\n\nThe Bank performs the measurement of the assets held for sale at the statement of financial position date. However, these assets  are  evaluated  quarterly  if  impairment  indicators  exist  that  imply  review  of  the  carrying  value  recorded  in  the accounts. If those indications are identified, impairment losses are recognized for the difference between the carrying and recoverable amount of an asset as 'Impairment, depreciation and amortization' in the statement of income.",

In the absent of particular standards, a line of business below the threshold of 5% of net assets in the statement of financial position is not considered material.\n\n## 13. Impairment of non-financial assets and cash-generating units and goodwill\n\nThe Bank evaluates at the end of each period whether there is any indication that on a stand-alone basis non-financial assets  and  cash-generating  units  are  impaired.  If  some  indication  of  impairment  does  exist,  the  Bank  estimates  the recoverable amount of the assets and the loss by impairment, the impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the  carrying  amount  of  the  cash  generating  unit  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount.  Regardless  of  whether  impairment indicators exist, impairment of goodwill is assessed annually.\n\nRecoverable amount is determined by management by reference to market value, if available, by pricing models, or with the  assistance  of  a  valuation  specialist.  Determination  of  the  recoverable  amount  requires  management  to  make assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flow for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment of the appropriate discount rate and growth rate, estimation of the recoverable amount of cash generation units and the valuation of the separable assets of each business whose goodwill is being reviewed.\n\nIf an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from the rest of the assets or group of assets, the recoverable amount is determined by the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nA cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.\n\nThe amount of impairment losses recognized in net income during the period are included in the Statement of income as 'Impairment, depreciation and amortization'.\n\n## 14. Other assets\n\nThe Bank presents as other assets, among other things, (a) the expenses paid in advance incurred in the development of its business, in order to receive future services, which are amortized during the period in which services are received or the costs or expenses are recorded and (b) foreclosed assets that do not comply with the requirements to be recognized as assets held for sale and where there are no plans to use them in the supply of services or for administrative purposes.\n\nForeclosed assets are  initially  recognized  at  the  lower  of  net  amount  of  the  charged-off  financial  assets  to  which  the foreclosed assets relate and net realizable value of the foreclosed asset (the net realizable value will be the estimated selling price of the asset or its awarding value, less the estimated costs necessary to carry out its sale), pending obtaining a plan for  its  commercialization.  If  net  amount  of  the  charged-off  financial  assets  is  greater  than  net  realizable  value  of  the foreclosed asset, an adjustment for impairment of credit risk of the financial asset is recorded in the results for the period.",

In the case of events that arise that are beyond the control of the Bank and that make remote the realization of these assets, they are identified as \"non-tradable\" and a complete impairment is carried out.\n\n## 15. Employee benefits\n\n## 15.1 Short term benefits\n\nThe Bank grants to its employee's short-term benefits such as bonuses based on added value to clients and the Bank's results  (which  was  not  applicable  for  the  year  2020),  salaries,  accrued  performance  costs  and  social  security  that  are expected to be wholly settled within 12 months. Expenses related to these benefits are recognized over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate. For further information, see Note 19. Employee benefit plans.\n\n## 15.2 Other long-term employee benefits\n\nThe Bank grants to its employee's seniority bonuses as long-term employee benefits whose payment is not expected within the 12 months following the end of the annual period in which the employees have rendered their services. These benefits are projected up to the date of payment and are discounted through the Projected Unit Credit method. The cost of longterm employee benefits is allocated across the period from the time the employee was hired the Bank and the expected date of obtaining the benefit.\n\n## 15.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\n- -     Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Bank pays contribution monthly to pension funds, due to legal requirements and it will have no legal obligation to pay further contributions.\n\nThe Bank recognizes contributions in the statement of income, once the contribution is accrued. Any contributions unpaid at the statement of financial position date are included as a liability.\n\n## -     Defined benefit plans\n\nThey are post-employment benefit plans in which the Bank has the legal or constructive obligation to take responsibility for the payments of benefits that have agreed, for example severance obligation, retirement pension premium plan and senior management pension plan premium and pension plan. The Bank makes an actuarial valuation on the basis of the projected unit credit method and a risk-free rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money in each country, related to the characteristics and the benefit flows weighted average, to discount such obligation.\n\n## 16.   Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nProvisions are recorded when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nProvisions are determined by the management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  which  estimate  is  discounted  using  a  risk-free  rate  which  reflects  current  market assessments of the time value of money in each country, which for Colombia is the interest rate on treasury bonds (TES) 1 .",

When the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.\n\n## 17.   Customer loyalty program\n\nThe Bank maintains a credit card loyalty program to provide incentives to its customers. The program allows customers to purchase goods and services, based on the exchange of awards points, which are awarded based on purchases using the Bank's credit cards and the fulfillment of certain conditions established in such program. The redemption of points for prizes is carried out by a third party. According to IFRS 15, the expenses of the Bank's commitments with its clients arising from this program are recognized as a lower value of the fees and commission income, considering the total number of points that can be redeemed over the accumulated prizes and taking into account the probability of redemptions.\n\n## 18.   Revenue recognition\n\nThe Bank recognizes revenue from ordinary activities, which represent the transfer of goods or services committed with customers in exchange for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such assets or services. The recognition and measurement of interest income and dividend income from debt and equity instruments are not within the scope of IFRS 15. Instead, they are within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nThe Bank evaluates the contracts and commitments established with customers, identifying compliance with the five steps established in IFRS 15 as follows:\n\n- 1. Identifying  the  contract: the  parties'  rights,  payment  conditions,  evaluation  of  the  commercial  basis  and characteristics  of  the  consideration  are  identified,  and  the  Bank  evaluates  if  there  are  modifications  or combinations that apply.\n- 2. Identifying performance obligations: The Bank evaluates the commitments included in the entity's contracts to identify when the customer makes use of the service and whether the obligations are identifiable separately.\n- 3. Determining the transaction price: The  characteristics  of  the  amounts  for  which  the  agreed  services  were exchanged are reviewed in the Bank's contracts, to estimate the effect of the variable consideration in kind, or others payable to the customer.",

Allocating the transaction price to performance obligations: In the evaluation of prices to the Bank's contracts, these are designated individually to the services provided by the Bank, even for products where there are packaged commitments.\n- 5. Satisfaction of performance obligations: The obligations established in contracts with customers are satisfied when the control of the service is transferred to the customer and the recognition is performed as established in IFRS 15 over time or at a point in time.\n\nThe Bank satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\n- a) The Bank's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use for the entity, and it has an enforceable right to receive payment for the performance completed to date.\n- b) The  Bank's  performance  creates  or  enhances  an  asset  that  the  customer  controls  as  the  asset  is  created  or enhanced.\n- c) The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Bank's performance as the Bank performs.\n\nFor  performance  obligations  where  none  of  the  indicated  conditions  is  fulfilled,  the  Bank  satisfies  the  performance obligation at a point in time, at which the customer obtains control of the promised services and the entity satisfies a performance obligation.  When  the  Bank  fulfills  a  performance  obligation  through  the  delivery  of  promised  goods  or services, it creates a contractual asset for the consideration amount obtained with the performance.\n\nA contract asset is the right of the Bank to receive a payment in exchange for goods or services that the Bank has transferred to a customer, when that right is dependent on another thing different than the passage of time (for example, billing or delivery of other elements part of the contract). The Bank recognizes the contractual assets as current assets, as they are expected to be realized within the normal operating cycle.\n\nThe  costs  of  contracts  eligible  for  capitalization  as  incremental  costs  when  obtaining  a  contract  are  recognized  as  a contractual asset. Contractual costs are capitalized when incurred if the Bank expects to recover those costs. Contractual costs constitute non-current assets to the extent that the Bank expects to receive the economic benefits of those assets in a period greater than twelve months. The contractual costs are amortized systematically and consistently with the transfer of the services to the customer once the corresponding revenue has been recognized. The capitalized contractual costs are impaired if the customer withdraws or if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projection of the discounted cash flows that are related to the contract.\n\nWhen the amount of consideration received from a customer exceeds the amount of the recognized revenue, this creates a contractual liability. Contract liabilities constitute the Bank's obligation to transfer goods or services to a  customer, for which the Bank has received a payment from the end customer or if the amount is past due. They also include deferred income related to goods or services that shall be delivered or provided in the future, which will be billed to the customer in advance, but which are not yet past due.\n\nRevenue  is  measured  based  on  the  consideration  specified  in  the  contract  with  the  customer,  and  excludes  amounts received on behalf of third parties when the Bank is an agent. The Bank recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer. Revenue is presented net of reimbursements and discounts and after eliminating intergroup sales. The Bank evaluates its revenue categories will based on specific criteria in order to determine whether it acts as principal or agent. Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Bank and it is possible to reliably measure the related revenues and costs.\n\n## 18.1. Interest income and expenses\n\nFor all financial instruments measured at amortized cost, interest income and interest expenses are recognized using the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts future estimated cash flows payments",

Fees and commission income\n\nThe Bank charges fees for the services it provides to its customers. Fee income can be divided into the following three categories:\n\n## Income from fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument:\n\nCommissions for loan commitments that have a high probability of being used are deferred (together with any incremental cost) via the effective interest rate once the loan is granted (in accordance with section 18.1). If the commitment expires and no loan is made, the fee is recognized as income at the time of termination.\n\nThe opening fees received for the issuance of a financial liability measured at amortized cost are included in the effective interest rate of the financial instrument and its recognition as income is generated during the estimated life of the asset.\n\n## Income from fees obtained from the services that are provided during a certain period of time:\n\nThese payments include income from commissions and asset management, custody and other administration and advisory commissions. In loan commitments when it is not possible to demonstrate the probability that a loan will be  used, the opening fees of the loan are recognized in income statement during the commitment period on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Income from the provision services:\n\nFees arising from the negotiation or participation in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party, such as the acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses, are recognized at the closing of the underlying transaction. Commissions or fee components that are linked to a specified performance are recognized after the corresponding criteria are met.\n\n## 18.3. Dividend revenue\n\nFor the investments that are not associates or joint ventures, dividends are recognized when the right to payment of the Bank is established, which is generally when the shareholders declares the dividend. These are included in the statement of income as dividends received and share of profits of equity method investees.\n\n## 18.4. Total operating income, net\n\nThe income derived from commercial operations (trading) includes all profits and losses from variations in the fair value and revenue or expenses for related interests from financial liabilities or assets. This includes any ineffectiveness registered in the hedging transactions.\n\n## 19. Income tax\n\nThe Bank recognizes, when appropriate, deferred tax assets and liabilities by estimating the future tax effects attributable to differences between book values of assets, liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rate that, in accordance with the valid tax laws in each country where the Bank has operations, must be applied in the year in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.

Paid-in capital\n\nPaid in capital represents the amount paid by the shareholders in excess of the nominal value of the shares.\n\n## E.    Use of estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Bank's management make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the recognized amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\n\nThe  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgments or changes in assumptions are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if assumptions and conditions change.\n\nThe significant accounting estimates that the Bank uses in preparing its consolidated financial statements are detailed below:\n\n## 1.     Credit risk impairment\n\nAs disclosed by management and described in section 'D. Significant Accounting Policies' paragraph 7.4.5 Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 'FVTOCI', expected credit losses are calculated using individual and collective models and methodologies based on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current borrower situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the prospective approach that  include  assumptions  of  future  macroeconomic  conditions  in  plausible  future  scenarios.  In  addition,  for  loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, the fair value of guarantees granted, information on credit behavior and the future cash flows expected from the client.\n\nExpected  credit  losses  ('ECL')  are  calculated  using  individual  and  collective  models  and  methodologies  based  on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of  future  economic  conditions.  The  impact  of  COVID-19  has  increased  the  uncertainty  around  ECL  impairment calculations and has required management to make additional judgements and accounting estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  and  level  of  expenses  regarding  provisions.  For  further  information,  see  section  '10.  Effects  of  the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's judgements and estimates' set out below.",

Assumptions are constructed from historical data to consider whether a customer has a significant increase in risk or is in default; these are reviewed by expert panels. Other assumptions such as future economic conditions, the simulation of reasonable  future  economic  scenarios  and  the  likelihood  of  those  scenarios  have  a  high  impact  on  lifetime  default probability models. These scenarios are determined and leveraged by the Direction of Economic Research, which operates independently of the Bank's risk management division.\n\nThe main factors considered in collective estimations of credit losses are the definition of significant increase in credit risk, definition of default, collateral values, loan maturity and macroeconomic forecast of variables such as unemployment, GDP, interest rates, among others. It is also important to consider and any other variable that could influence a client's willingness to pay.\n\nIn addition, individual credit losses models consider assumptions on how the financial performance and future cash flow of a client could be affected the client's expected future operational and commercial activity, if generate sufficient cash to pay debt obligations and trends and regulatory changes in the economic sector in which the client operates, changes in the collateral value, as well as other internal or external factors.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the assessment of three following factors, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from the expectations on which management's estimates are based:\n\n- o Exposure at default: It is understood as the exposed balance of assets to the current capital balance, interest and receivable accounts. In the case of products whose nature is revolving and that have an available quota that is susceptible to be used in its entirety according to loan contracts subscribed with clients, this parameter includes an estimation of the use of those products after the client's default.\n- o Probability of default (PD): This is the probability that the debtor fails to fulfill their obligations of capital and/or interest payment over a period of 12 months. This is linked to the rating/scoring of each debtor/operation.\n- o Loss given default (LGD): This is defined as the economic impairment that the entity would incur in the event of any instance of default. This depends mainly upon the characteristics of the debtor and upon the valuation of guarantees or collateral associated with the operation. This parameter has been assessed as a critical estimate due to the effects caused by COVID-19 in the real economy. For further information, see section '10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's judgements and estimates' set out below.\n\nImpairment loss models and methodologies, and the related assumptions, are assessed by the Bank's Risk vice-president on a regular basis, using robust validation procedures in order to assure a reasonable coverage of effective losses.\n\nThis process enables management to periodically determine whether assumptions and models used to measure credit risk impairment should be adjusted to achieve more precise estimations.\n\nInternal  controls,  data  governance  standards  and  approval  processes  have  been  implemented  by  the  Bank  to  make estimations more accurate.\n\nFor further details, please see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies, section  7.4.5 Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 'FVOCI'.",

The impairment test for goodwill  involves  estimates  and  significant  judgments,  including  the  identification  of  cash  generating  units  and  the allocation of goodwill based on the expectations of which operating segments of the Bank will benefit from the acquisition. The fair value of the acquired companies is sensitive to changes in the valuation models' assumptions.

See Note 9 Goodwill and intangible assets, net for  further  information  related  to  carrying  amount,  valuation  methodologies,  key  assumptions,  sensitivities  and  the allocation of goodwill. Having considered the extraordinary uncertainty created by COVID-19 and its potential impact on the carrying value of goodwill, management performed multiple weighted scenarios for assessing the expected future cash flows for each CGU and taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19. For further information, see section '10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's judgements and estimates' set out below.\n\n## 3.     Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on deductible or levied temporary differences originating between tax and accounting bases, taking into account the tax rules applicable in each country where the Bank has operations. Due to the changing conditions of the political, social and economic environment, the constant amendments to tax legislation and the permanent changes in the tax principles and changes in interpretations by tax authorities determining the tax bases for the deferred tax items involves difficult judgments including estimates of future gains, offsets or tax deductions.\n\nAccordingly, the determination of the deferred tax is considered a critical accounting policy.\n\nFor more information relating to the nature of deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized by the Bank, please see Note 12 Income tax.\n\n## 4.     Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Bank is subject to contingent liabilities, including those arising from judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings, tax and other claims arising from the conduct of the Bank's business activities. These contingencies are evaluated based on management's best estimates and provisions are established for legal and other claims by assessing the likelihood of the  loss  actually  occurring  as  probable,  possible  or  remote.  Contingences  are  provisioned  and  recorded  when  all  the information  available  indicates  that  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be required  to  settle  the  obligation  before  the  statement  of  financial  position  date  and  the  amounts  may  be  reasonably estimated. The Bank engages internal and external experts in assessing probability and in estimating any amounts involved.\n\nThroughout the life of a contingency, the Bank may learn of additional information that can affect assessments regarding probability or the estimates of amounts involved; changes in these assessments can lead to changes in recorded provisions.\n\nThe Bank considers the estimates used to determine the provisions for contingent liabilities are critical estimates because the probability of their occurrence and the amounts that the Bank may be required to pay are based on the Bank's judgment and  those  of  its  internal  and  external  experts,  which  will  not  necessarily  coincide  with  the  future  outcome  of  the proceedings. For further information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and their carrying amounts, see Note 21 Provisions and contingent liabilities.\n\n## 5.     Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the Bank's statement of financial position include debt, equity securities  and  derivatives  classified  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  debt  classified  at  fair  value  through  other",

In accordance with this standard, financial instruments are classified as follows:\n\n- Level  1: Assets  and  liabilities  are  classified  as  Level  1  if  there  are  observable  inputs  that  reflect  quoted  prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nInstruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions.\n\n- Level 2: Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2 if in the absence of a market price for a specific financial instrument, its fair value is estimated using models whose input data are observable for recent transactions of identical or similar instruments.\n- Level 3: Assets and liabilities are classified as level 3 if unobservable input data were used in the measurement of fair value that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of these assets or liabilities. The fair value of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.\n\nTransfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. All transfers between the aforementioned levels are assumed to occur at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe measurement of the fair value of financial instruments generally involves a higher degree of complexity and requires the application of judgments especially when the models use unobservable inputs (level 3) based on the assumptions that would be used in the market to determinate the price for assets or liabilities. Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.\n\nWhen developing fair value measurements, the Bank maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with the Bank's policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, the Bank uses third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internally developed prices. Thirdparty price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements.\n\nFor further details regarding carrying amount and sensitivity disclosures, please see Note 30 Fair value of assets and liabilities.\n\nAs a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on markets and financial instrument valuations, there was not a significant impact on the value of financial assets such as debt securities, equities, etc. For further information, see section '10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's judgements and estimates' set out below.\n\n## 6.     Measurement of Employee benefits\n\nThe measurement of post-employment benefit obligations and long-term employee benefits takes into account a range of inputs and it is dependent upon a series of assumptions of future events. The projected unit credit method is used to determine the present value of the obligation for the defined benefits and its associated cost. Future measurements of obligations  may  differ  to  those  presented  in  the  financial  statements,  among  others,  due  to  changes  in  economic  and demographic assumptions and significant events.

        "page_content": "## 7.     Transaction price determination\n\nWith respect to contracts with the Bank's customers, for the determination of the transaction price, the Bank allocates to each one of the performance obligations under the contract the price which represents the value expected to be received to each such performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. Such price is determined based on the cost of each service, related tax and associated risks to the operation and inherent to the transaction,  plus the margin expected to be received for the services, considering in each case the market price for the service, the conditions agreed with the customer and the customer's segment. The bank has fixed and variable prices considering the characteristics of each service, future events, discounts, returns and other variables that may influence the selling price. No significant financing components are factored in the determination of the selling price.\n\n## 8.     Leases\n\nThe measurement of the right-of-use asset and of the lease liabilities requires a series of judgments, among which are the determination of the term of the lease and the rate used in discounting the cash flows. The term of the lease is defined according to the historical information of the contracts and the period over which an asset is expected to be economically usable, which involves a high degree of uncertainty due to the use of relevant information about past events. For the Bank's case, it was not possible to determine or obtain an interest rate implicit of the leasing contracts; therefore, the weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate was used to discount the cash flows associated with the leasing contracts. The Bank performs analyses take into account the currency, lease term, economic environment and class of underlying assets as to determinate the weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate. During the lockdown that took place in 2020 to stem the COVID-19 outbreak, the Bank did not receive substantial rent concessions as lessee in the payment terms of its lease contracts. For further information, see section '10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's judgements and estimates' set out below.\n\n## 9.     Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments\n\nIn the process of determining the current and deferred tax for periods subject to review by the tax authority, the applicable rules have been applied and interpretations have been made to take positions, on which different interpretations could arise from those made by the entity. Due to the complexity of the tax system, the continuous modifications of the fiscal rules, the accounting changes with implications in the tax bases and in general the legal instability of the country, at any time the tax authority could have different criteria from the Bank. Therefore, a dispute or inspection by the tax authority on a specific tax treatment may affect the deferred or current tax asset or liability bank's accounting, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12.\n\nManagement and its advisors believe that their decisions concerning the estimates and judgments made in each fiscal period are in accordance with those required by the current tax regulations, and therefore have not considered it necessary to recognize any additional provisions to those indicated in Note 12 Income tax.\n\n## 10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's judgements and estimates\n\nSince the beginning of the year 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread throughout the world, causing the closure of  production  and  supply  chains  and  interrupting  local  and  international  trade,  which  has  caused  a  global  economic slowdown and negative impacts on several industries. The world authorities, including those in Colombia and the other countries  where  the  Bank  operates,  have  adopted  measures  to  combat  the  outbreak,  including  travel  restrictions, quarantines in several areas and temporary closure of establishments, which has resulted in the inability of  employees, suppliers and customers to carry out their activities for periods of time. In responding to these challenges, the Bank has taken additional prudential measures to evaluate (a) whether uncertainties exist regarding the ability to continue generating revenues  from  contracts  with  customers  and  commissions,  (b)  going  concern  considerations  in  relation  to  liquidity, regulatory capital requirements and concentrations of market risk, (c) whether fair value adjustments are necessary for financial instruments, (d) the measurement of the impact of changes in loan terms agreed with customers, (e) whether a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) has occurred for its financial assets, and (f) any potential impact on the carrying value of goodwill and long-lived assets, performing interim impairment test for all cash-generating units (CGUs), among others:",

        "page_content": "- * Relevant uncertainties or analysis regarding to the ability to continue generating revenues from contracts with customers and  commissions:  Management  assessed  the  estimates  of  variable  consideration  to  determine  the  amount  of  income expected  to  be  generated  from  its  commission  contracts,  taking  into  account  that  the  uncertainties  relating  to  the coronavirus outbreak could result in modification to contracts with customers or reassessments whether it is probable that the Bank will collect substantially all the consideration to which is entitled. The Bank has concluded that there were no significant impacts on its ability to collect the amount that reflect the consideration to which the Bank expects to be entitled in  exchange  for  providing financial  services  despite  the  detrimental  impact upon  the  economy  due  to  the  COVID-19 outbreak.\n- * Assessment of changes in business strategies and business model: Management has not made changes or considered making significant changes in business strategy, which would lead to any significant impact in the Bank's ability to continue  as  a  business,  or  affect  the  classification  and  valuation  of  its  assets  and  liabilities.  Considering  the  Bank's objective of supporting its clients during the months of the coronavirus outbreak, the Bank has offered relief and support programs which are detailed below under the 'Credit risk impairment assessment' label in the section 'Use of judgments and estimates'. Furthermore, management does not consider that temporary disruption of general economic activities will be prolonged indefinitely and result in diminishing demand for financial products or services offered by the Bank or that any material uncertainty may occur on the Bank's liquidity and solvency. For further information, see Note 31. Risk management.\n- * Assessment of significant changes in fair value measurements of financial instruments: Management has determined as of the end of the reporting period of these consolidated financial statements that the fair value measurements of financial instruments  reflect  market  participant  expectations  and  market  data  at  the  measurement  date  under  current  market conditions, ensuring that observable market data was incorporated even if the depressed prices are considered temporary due  to  the  coronavirus  outbreak.  Furthermore,  for  fair  value  measurements  based  on  unobservable  inputs  (level  3), management has ensured that the unobservable inputs used reflect how market participants would incorporate the effect of coronavirus outbreak in their expectations of future cash flows, discount rates and other significant valuation inputs related to the asset or liability at the reporting date, if any, so that all fluctuations in current market conditions have been considered in the fair value hierarchy of valuation and disclosures, as shown in Note 30. Fair value of assets and liabilities. During the year 2020, the valuation effects on fair value of financial instruments were recognized in the consolidated statement of income and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, given the contraction in financial markets due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the uncertainty generated by the actions taken by governments to contain the epidemic. For further information, see Note 5. Financial assets investments and derivatives.\n- * Assessment of changes in credit conditions: The COVID-19 outbreak has developed rapidly in 2020. Measures taken to contain the virus have affected economic activity. As a result, some governments in the countries where the Bank operates have requested private banks to make more flexible principal payments, reductions in interest rates and certain other concessions. In this regard, the Bank has adopted special temporary measures in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama to support our customers who took a payment holiday and help them resume payment during this extraordinary situation.\n\nTherefore, the Bank granted relief and support programs to understand the individual situation of each customer and help customers  resume  payments during 2020.  The  key  characteristics  of  such  programs  offered  by  the  Bank  include  the following:\n\n- -Principal and interest payments holidays across mortgage, credit cards, consumer and small business loans, for customers with no more than 30 or 60 days in arrears as of February 29, 2020.\n- -We have also provided support to mortgage customers with initial payment holiday terms of up to two, three or six installments, where the principal was deferred until the maturity of the loan, and consequently the contractual terms were modified extending the loan's maturity.\n- -The Bank has also offered customers affected by the crisis extensive support, including an extension, where appropriate, of the term of loans up to a maximum of 30 years for mortgage and housing leasing loans.",

        "page_content": "- -During the lockdown, similar to other banks, we reduced interest rates for credit card purchases of basic consumer goods in certain establishments such as supermarkets and pharmacies.\n- -The Bank provided a business line of credit amounting to COP 500,000 to support its business and corporate customers for easing the payroll payment charge during the lockdown period with a maturity term of 12 months, and payment holidays of principal and interest of up to six months.\n\nSince July 01, 2020 and by means of national regulation, the SFC requires credit establishments to adopt a program to support customers that helps them to resume payments, by means of the modification of loan terms when the debtors have been financially affected due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Therefore, the Parent Company established a segmentation of clients in specific groups based on their capability to resume payments (customers will be in a position to resume payments once the payment holiday arrangements expire and those who might need additional short or longer term support), for which the entity offers: i) reduction in the installment amounts without increasing the initially agreed interest rate and ii) periods of payment holidays or additional extensions. In this regard, management has evaluated each of these relief efforts and  granted  and  applied  the  corresponding  judgment  to  assess  in  each  case  whether  a  modification  is  considered 'substantial' or 'non-substantial'. Therefore, the Bank has an accounting policy of applying the '10% test' for modified loans. Consequently, the terms are substantially different if the net present value of the cash flows under the new terms (including any fees paid net of any fees received) discounted using the original effective interest rate ('EIR'), is at least 10 per cent different from the net present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial asset. If the relief results in a substantial modification, the financial asset should be derecognized. When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset, the Bank adjusts the gross carrying amount of the existing loan to reflect the revised estimated cash flow payments discounted using the original EIR. The adjustment is recognized as a modification gain or loss in accordance with IFRS 9:5.4.3. The adjustment is recognized in the consolidated statement of income under the line \" Interest income on loans and financial leases\".\n\nThe  aforementioned  relief  provided  by  the  Bank  to  company  and  individual  customers  in  some  cases  result  in  the renegotiation of the contractual terms. The impact of the relief provided to clients due to the holiday payments and loan modification amounted to COP 150,958 and was recognized as a lower value in the line 'Interest on loans and financial leases' in the consolidated statement of income.\n\n* Credit risk impairment assessment: The Bank faced important challenges relating to selecting appropriate assumptions to assess and develop reliable estimates required by the expected loss models (ECL) due to the level of uncertainty derived from the current situation triggered by the lockdowns forced by governments to stem the COVID-19 outbreak and the radical change in economic forecasts in all the countries where the Bank operates. Indeed, default probability models incorporate between five and seven years of history for their estimation, which have been historically characterized by good performance of most of the indicators in the countries where the Bank operates. These indicators were characterized by stable, although moderate, growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), contained inflation and stable or decreasing unemployment. However, the new macroeconomic projections for all the regions where the Bank operates include a rapid contraction of GDP by 2020 and then a sharp recovery in 2021. Accordingly, there is a significant impact on the expected loss estimation derived from the updated macroeconomic scenarios and the expected projection of these variables in the next periods in which the portfolio is expected to be recovered. The Bank updated its macroeconomic projections for all the countries in which it operates. This update considered the duration of the lockdowns suggested or required by each government and the measures announced by the central banks and governments of each country to support the economy. To the extent that the severity of the economic downturn depends on the actions taken by governments and central banks, as well as on the evolution of the pandemic, different probabilities of occurrence have been assigned to the base, pessimistic and  optimistic  scenarios.  These  probabilities,  which  reflect  the  expectations  that  the  Bank  has  set  for  the  future macroeconomic conditions, have been updated during 2020 using the best available and reliable information based on past events, current conditions and forecasts information assessed, in order to identify the increase in risk of debtors and to incorporate the economic perspectives in the expected loss models, which, despite having a high degree of uncertainty, present scenarios that show more deteriorated economic conditions compared to those included in previous periods. In order  to  avoid  excessively  procyclical  assumptions  when  determine  the  provisions  caused  by  the  volatility  of  the macroeconomic  forecasts  which  induce  significant  constitution  of  provisions  followed  by  releases  of  comparable magnitudes and given the high uncertainty associated with the economic behavior due to the COVID-19, macroeconomic",

For  further  information,  see  'Economic  Scenario  Weightings'  label in  the  section  'D.  Significant Accounting Policies'.\n\nOn the other hand, the government support measures put into place in the countries in which the Bank operates may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it remains unclear how these will evolve and how they might impede the decrease in the risk deterioration metrics of our customers. For example, the governmental support measures may negatively impact the identification of customers that are in a difficult financial situation but that are not reaching the level of default to be considered customers with a significant risk increase. To address this situation of masking customer risk, the Bank has resorted to creating expert panels that evaluate which industries and sectors of the economy are most affected by the situation and make recommendations regarding the deterioration of the internal rating of those customers linked to these sectors. The incorporation of these recommendations has the effect of increasing loan allowances, even when customers are current in their obligations.\n\nAdditionally, in order to identify the increase in risk of debtors for which financial relief was granted, the Bank has also added a management overlay adjustment to the scenario weighting so as to reflect a level of provisioning commensurate with the current situation in the portfolio once the aforementioned relief efforts expire. This methodology seeks to replicate in the loans subject to relief the behavior that the portfolio normally presents, through historical behavior factors, and thus recognize the expected losses. In some cases, this provision is recorded globally given the uncertainty in the portfolio subject to payment deferrals; in others, it is possible to record it client by client through expert models, which allow increasing  the  risk  rating  through  the  client's  transactional  variables.  On  the  other  hand,  individual  significant  client analyses have been carried out in sectors affected by the pandemic, in order to determine adjustments in the level of risk of these, by reviewing expected cash flows.\n\nThese changes in estimates generate as of December 31, 2020, a significant increase in provisions for impairment  of financial  assets  due  to  the  change  in  macroeconomic  perspectives  and  due  to  the  impact  of  the  overlay  adjustment (individual and global) discussed above. For further information, see Note 6. Loans and advance to customers, net and Note 31. Risk management.\n\n* Impairment of non-financial assets: The effects on the financial markets due to the restrictions imposed to stem the COVID-19 outbreak have negatively impacted in the economic sectors and have been reflected in the main macroeconomic variables, such as the decrease of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - see 'Economic Scenario Weightings' label in the section 'D. Significant Accounting Policies'. Further, the effects on the financial markets have negatively impacted in high volatility and devaluation in financial assets and foreign exchange rate and an increase in unemployment figures, which have recently decreased due to the economic reactivation. In this regard, based on the estimation of discount rates that  best  reflect  current  economic  conditions,  management developed the respective analyses on the determination of multiple scenarios given the updating of macroeconomic variables for the process of estimating the recoverable value of the most significant investments in associates companies and joint ventures. Management did not identify the existence of an impairment in associates companies and joint ventures at the date of this report.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak triggered exceptional volatility in financial markets; accordingly the Bank has considered all macroeconomic impacts when developing the economic budget assessments, forecasts and other underlying assumptions commonly used to determine  the  recoverable  value  of  non-financial  long-lived  assets,  such  as  goodwill,  intangibles, investment property, plant and equipment, among others. The total amount of the long-lived assets was concluded to be recoverable  based  on  the  assessments  carried  out  by  the  management.  However,  for  assets  held  for  sale,  the  Bank recognized an impairment adjustment amounted to COP 1,339 as of December 31, 2020, which consisted mainly of the vehicles held for sale by the company Renting Colombia; likewise, for foreclosed assets, it has been necessary to recognize an impairment adjustment in the amount of COP 48,257 as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## * Other issues:\n\n- -Recognition  of  provisions: As  of  December  31,  2020,  management  has  assessed  the  recognition  of provisions without having identified any circumstances that would have implied the recognition of present",

Therefore, in accordance with this law, the Bank invested for an amount of COP 2,552,042 in TDS as of December 31, 2020, which were classified as investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI); for further information on this matter, see Note 5.

The  Conceptual  Framework  sets  out  a comprehensive set of concepts for financial reporting, standard setting, guidance for preparers in developing consistent accounting policies and assistance to others in their efforts to understand and interpret the standards. Also, the Conceptual Framework includes some new concepts, provides updated definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities and clarifies  some  concepts.  These  amendments  to  the  Framework  had  not  a  material  impact  on  the  Bank's  consolidated financial statements or an accounting policies.\n\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Changes to the definition of a business: The IASB amended IFRS 3 in October 2018 to provide additional guidance on the definition of a business, effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2020. The amendment aims to help entities when determining whether a transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition. The amendments are in line with the Bank's current accounting policy and therefore did not affect the Bank's accounts.\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial  Statements  and  IAS  8  Accounting  Policies,  Changes  in  Accounting Estimates and Errors - Definition of material: The IASB clarified the definition of 'material' and aligned the definition of material used in the Conceptual Framework and in other IFRS standards, effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2020.

The Bank applied these amendments as of January 01, 2020.\n\nIn this way, taking into account that in 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021, a corporate project was put in place by the management in January of 2020, as to carry out the analysis of the impacts and create a work plan to face the challenges related to the discontinuation of the LIBOR and to migrate towards risk-free rates.\n\nThe project is currently at implementation stage, it has an allocated budget at corporate level and counts on a work team comprised  of  several  divisions  of:  products,  legal,  processes,  technology,  project  management,  who  address  the discontinuation of LIBOR from different work fronts focused on structuring and executing work plans.\n\nThe project has achieved the following milestones:\n\n- -The project Steering Committee was formed by Bank's key senior management executives, which supervises the progress of the project and carries out the corresponding approvals.\n- -The scope of the project, together with its impacts, progress and approvals for the necessary implementations, has been presented in Management Assets and Liabilities Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n- -An internal communication scheme has been implemented, which consists of sending quarterly newsletters with releases about the project progress and action plans to keep all the people involved informed, as well as communications to the  Bank's  staff  in  order  to  provide  them  training  on  the  discontinuation  of  LIBOR. Additionally, a communication plan has been settled to customers, which includes the publication of articles in specialized media and emails with information, sent directly to clients. It also includes one-to-one meetings with clients.\n- -A work plan has been set up. It includes exposure measurement, impact assessment, systems adjustments. It also  includes  analyzing  and  implementing  appropriate  \"fallback  language\"  and  designing  a  strategy  to approach customers. Monitoring and adjustments to the implementation plan are carried out periodically.\n- -Activities have been carried out to mobilize the Colombian Banking Association, in order to make financial entities aware of the importance of the discontinuation of LIBOR and the impact the process may have on the financial system.\n- -The current exposure to USD LIBOR is being identified in LIBOR indexed loans, bonds, factoring, leasing and derivatives.\n\nFor further information regarding the quantification of the contracts subject to LIBOR, please see Note. 5.2 Derivative financial instruments.",

        "page_content": "Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases - COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions: On May 28, 2020, the Board ('IASB') issued the amendment to IFRS 16 Leases related to leases concessions, which proposes as a practical expedient to allow lessees to opt not to assess whether rent concessions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are a contract modification as set out in the standard.\n\nThe amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after June 01, 2020.\n\nManagement  evaluated  the  impact  of  the  changes  that  the  amendment  to  IFRS  16  would  have  on  the  Bank  and  its consolidated  financial  statements  and  disclosures,  and  opted  not  to  adopt  the  application  of  the  practical  expedient; therefore, no significant impact is expected, due to the fact that the Bank has not received substantial rent concessions as lessee in the payment terms of its lease contracts as a result of the health emergency declared to stem the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nAmendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: In determining whether to derecognize a financial liability that has been modified or exchanged, an entity is required to assess whether the terms are substantially different. The Board clarified the fees that should be included by an entity when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. Based on this amendment, the entity shall include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf. According to IASB, this amendment is mandatory for the annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022. Earlier application is permitted. The Bank applied this amendment to financial liabilities that were modified or exchanged on the periods beginning on after January 01, 2020.\n\n## b)    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Applicable in Future Periods\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (the amendments) to clarify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. More specifically:\n\n- - The amendments specify that the conditions which exist at the end of the reporting period of an obligation are those which will be used to determine if a right to defer settlement of a liability exists.\n- - Management expectations about events after the balance sheet date, for example on whether a covenant will be breached, or whether early settlement will take place, are not relevant.\n- - The amendments clarify the situations that are considered settlement of a liability.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 1 are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2023. The amendments must be applied retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8. Early application is permitted.\n\nManagement is evaluating the impact of the modification in the Bank's consolidated statement of financial position and disclosures.\n\nAmendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: In May 2020, the amendment to IAS 37 about Onerous Contracts - Costs of performing a contract was issued, with the purpose of evaluating whether the contract is onerous. IAS 37 provides the definition of an onerous contract, defined as one in which the costs of fulfilling the contract exceed the economic benefits received. The amendment clarifies that the costs of fulfilling a contract are those directly related to the contract, that is, the following: a) the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract; and (b) an allocation of other costs directly related to the fulfilling the contract.\n\nIn addition, this amendment clarifies that before recognizing the provision for loss on the onerous contract, impairment losses on the assets held to comply with the contract must be recognized, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.\n\nThis amendment is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022 and early application is permitted.",

This amendment clarifies the compliance requirements of assets and liabilities  restrictions  for  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  by  applying  the  acquisition  method  in  a business combination. More specifically:\n\n- -The IASB may add an additional exception to the recognition principle in IFRS 3. This exception indicates that on the acquisition date the acquirer will account for contingent liabilities and liabilities within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets or IFRIC 21 Levies if incurred separately, rather than assumed in a business combination.\n- -Explicitly  incorporate  the  prohibition  of  the  recognition  of  contingent  assets  acquired  in  a  business combination,  clarifying  that  the  reference  to  the  2018  Conceptual  Framework  does  not  change  the requirement for these assets.\n\nThe amendment to IFRS 3 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022. Early application is permitted if the Bank also applies all the modifications made by the amendments to the references to the Conceptual Framework in the IFRS Standards, issued in March 2018. Management evaluated the impact of the changes that the amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combination would have on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures, and no impact is expected.\n\nAmendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 16 Leases: In August 2020, the IASB published amendments to issues that might affect financial reporting due to the reform of the interest rate benchmark, including changes to contractual cash flows of financial instruments; hedging relationships, insurance and lease contracts. The Bank shall apply these amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. Earlier application is permitted.\n\nManagement is evaluating the impact of the modification in the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\n## Annual improvements to IFRS Cycle 2018-2020\n\nDuring 2020, the following amendments have been evaluated by the Bank without identifying significant impacts on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards: The Board proposes to require a subsidiary that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by the parent, based on the parent's date of transition to IFRSs.\n\nThis proposed amendment would also apply to an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16 (a) of IFRS 1.\n\n- \u00b7 Illustrative  Examples  accompanying  IFRS  16  Leases:  The  Board  proposes  to  amend  Illustrative  Example  13 accompanying  IFRS  16  Leases  to  remove  the  illustration  of  payments  from  the  lessor  relating  to  leasehold improvements.  The  proposed  amendment  would  remove  potential  for  confusion  regarding  the  treatment  of  lease incentives applying IFRS 16. These improvements apply from January 01, 2022.",

Futures  and  option  contracts  are  standardized agreements for future delivery, traded on exchanges that typically act as a platform.\n\nFor further information related to the objectives, policies and processes for managing the Bank's risk, please see Note 31 Risk management.\n\nThe following table sets forth the carrying values of the Bank's derivatives by type of risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| Derivatives                |             | December 31, 2020    December 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Forwards                   |             |                                          |\n| Assets                     |             |                                          |\n| Foreign exchange contracts | 975,125     | 715,365                                  |\n| Equity contracts           | 1,688       | 2,143                                    |\n| Subtotal assets            | 976,813     | 717,508                                  |\n| Liabilities                |             |                                          |\n| Foreign exchange contracts | (880,614)   | (768,015)                                |\n| Equity contracts           | (15,333)    | (4,346)                                  |\n| Subtotal liabilities       | (895,947)   | (772,361)                                |\n| Total forwards             | 80,866      | (54,853)                                 |\n| Swaps                      |             |                                          |\n| Assets                     |             |                                          |\n| Foreign exchange contracts | 947,053     | 757,296                                  |\n| Interest rate contracts    | 840,042     | 372,553                                  |\n| Subtotal assets            | 1,787,095   | 1,129,849                                |\n| Liabilities                |             |                                          |\n| Foreign exchange contracts | (615,625)   | (652,610)                                |\n| Interest rate contracts    | (803,153)   | (377,341)                                |\n| Subtotal liabilities       | (1,418,778) | (1,029,951)                              |\n| Total swaps                | 368,317     | 99,898                                   |\n| Options                    |             |                                          |\n| Assets                     |             |                                          |\n| Foreign exchange contracts | 36,811      | 55,598                                   |\n| Subtotal assets            | 36,811      | 55,598                                   |\n| Liabilities                |             |                                          |\n| Foreign exchange contracts | (66,601)    | (58,500)                                 |\n| Subtotal liabilities       | (66,601)    | (58,500)                                 |\n| Total options              | (29,790)    | (2,902)                                  |\n| Derivative assets          | 2,800,719   | 1,902,955                                |\n| Derivative liabilities     | (2,381,326) | (1,860,812)                              |",

However, the fair value of the financial asset or liability at the time of initial recognition may be different from the transaction price, because the fair value includes variables in its valuation technique that include market information, such as interest rate yield curves, currencies rates, indicators, default factors among others. When the  values  are  not  equal,  the  asset  or  liability  must  be  measured  at  fair  value  and  the  difference  between  the transaction price and the fair value must be recognized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 If fair value is evidenced by Level 1 inputs or is based on a valuation technique that uses only observable market data,  the  Group  must  recognize  the  difference  as  a  gain  or  loss  on  initial  recognition  directly  in  the  income statement.\n- \u00b7 In all other circumstances, the entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and is recognized in the income statement over the life of the transaction.",

The decrease in the portfolio in this stage is mainly due to the migration of the portfolio to stage 2, mainly of individuals, due to the measures implemented to recognize the risk associated with the COVID-19 crisis. In the commercial portfolio, a rolling to stages 2 and 3 has occurred, generated by the clients who were identified as being at higher risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the Special Client Administration Forums SCA  (AEC,  by  its  acronym  in  Spanish).  The  increase  in  the  loss  allowance  is  a  consequence  of  the  change  in macroeconomic projections and the effects of the COVID-19 crisis in the economy.\n\nStage 2 (Lifetime expected credit losses): the exposure at default in stage 2 increased by COP 8,778,330, and the loss allowance decreased by COP 1,446,766. The increase in exposure at default is mainly explained by the migration from stage 1 to stage 2 of commercial and consumer customers, who were identified as being at higher risk due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the loss allowance is consistent with the stage migration of the portfolio.\n\nStage 3 (Lifetime expected credit losses): the exposure at default in stage 3 increased by COP 3,865,229 and the loss allowance increased by COP 2,900,548. Both, the increase in exposure at default and loss allowance, is mainly associated with the migration of the portfolio of individuals with 90 days past due delinquency, the Impairment of the corporate clients loans through the Special Client Administration Forums - SCA (AEC, by its acronym in Spanish), and the new default events of significant customers in different sectors and subsectors of the economy severely challenged by the COVID-19 crisis identified mainly by the following variables:\n\n- -Level of impact: ability to operate in the medium term.\n- -Expectation of slow recovery: recovery in a period greater than 12 months.\n- -Impact  on  transactionality:  variable  that  measures  how  much  transactional  information  has  decreased  for  each subsector since the first lockdowns to date.\n- -High degree of uncertainty regarding the future of the sector or subsector.\n\n## Charges-off\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019 the loans that were written off amounted to COP 2,600,403 and COP 3,730,380, respectively.",

Likewise, the calculation  of  residuals  was  updated  to  reflect  the  effect  of  the  new  macroeconomic  conditions.  Moreover,  the  Bank performs a detailed review process at the time of return of the asset by the lessees in order to guarantee their operating conditions. Additionally, the Bank employs experts apart from the sales force, who constantly monitor the conditions of the second-hand market, and carry out back-testing in order to determine the consistency of the residual value model, and periodically  review  the  results  together  with  key  managers.  All  of  the  above  is  complemented  by  agreements  with suppliers,  which  allow  the  exchange  of  information,  knowledge  and,  in  some  cases,  the  structuring  of  residual  risk mitigation mechanisms.\n\nIn order to manage the risks associated with the assets, the Bank also employs an insurance department, and engages an international broker and insurance companies. They all serve as support to design and define the strategies for the different types of protection that cover the lessor's risks, assets and customers.\n\nAdditionally, in Renting Colombia's vehicle rental business, assets are managed with the goal of preserving commercial value through necessary maintenance, which avoids deterioration beyond that generated by regular use. Service indicators with suppliers are periodically reviewed in order to ensure their quality and compliance with the expected levels. Safe mobility strategies are also defined based on the permanent analysis of the road safety indicators. These strategies aim at ensuring the status and useful life of the asset.\n\n## 7.2.

This standard establishes the principles of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all their leases under the same balance sheet model similar to the accounting under IAS 17 of the Finance leases. The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees: leasing of low-value assets (for example, personal computers) and short-term leases (that is, leases with a term of less than 12 months). At the beginning of the lease, the lessee recognizes a liability for lease payments (liability for lease) and an asset that represents the right to use the underlying asset during the term of the lease (right to use the asset). The Bank used the modified retrospective adoption method, where the right-of-use assets are measured as if IFRS 16 had always been applied, using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate known at the date of transition.  The change in accounting policy affected the following items in the consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2019:",

These costs were the result of the analysis and design and implementation of the transformation projects, the most representative of which are: change in core collections, transactional switch and technology modernization project. The expenses were recorded mainly as fees paid in the line 'Other administrative and general expenses' of the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Intangibles which did not meet the criteria to be recognized as assets\n\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Bank has recognized in the statement of income the amount of COP 86,168, COP 48,584 and 41,690, respectively, related to expenditures which were not recognized as intangible assets. These expenses were not recorded as assets due to the lack of characterists to be reliably identifiable, and those assets do not support critical processes to be recognized as intangible assets.\n\n## 9.2   Goodwill\n\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of the activity in the goodwill account:\n\n|                                               | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| In millions of COP                            | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP  |\n| Balance at beginning of the year, net         | 6,694,354           | 6,638,403           |\n| Effect of change in foreign exchange rate (1) | 317,361             | 55,951              |\n| Balance at end of the year, net               | 7,011,715           | 6,694,354           |\n\nThe Bank tests goodwill recognized as a result of business combinations for impairment at least annually using a process that begins with an estimation of the recoverable amount of a group of cash-generation units equal to the operating segment. Recoverable amount is determined by management by reference to market value, if available, by pricing models, or with the assistance of a valuation specialist. Determination of recoverable amount requires management to make assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flow for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment  of  the  appropriate  discount  rate;  estimation  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  cash-generation  units;  and  the valuation of the separable assets of each business whose goodwill is being reviewed.\n\nThe key assumptions used by management in determining the recoverable amount are:\n\n| Operating segment    | Goodwill 2020      | Valuation Methodology   | Key Assumptions    | Discount Rate  (real)   | Growth rate  (real)   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                      | In millions of COP | In millions of COP      | In millions of COP | In millions of COP      | In millions of COP    |\n| Banking El  Salvador | 968,223            | Discounted Cash flow    | 5 years plan       | 14.50 %                 | 3.70 %                |\n| Banking Panama       | 5,242,361          | Discounted Cash flow    | 5 years plan       | 8.60 %                  | 5.80 %                |\n| Banking Guatemala    | 801,131            | Discounted Cash flow    | 5 years plan       | 10.80 %                 | 5.10 %                |\n\nIn  2020  and  2019,  the  Bank  tested  the  aforementioned  goodwill  for  impairment  purposes  at  the  following  operating segment levels: Banking Panama, Banking El Salvador and Banking Guatemala.

The  appraisers  are  either  approved  by  the  Property  Market  Auctions  of Colombia or foreign appraisers, who are required to provide a second signature by a Colombia appraiser accredited by the Property Market Auctions.\n\nFair value appraisals are carried out in accordance with IFRS 13. The reports made by the external consulting company contain the description of the valuation methodologies used, and key assumptions such as: discount rates, calculation of applied  expenses  and  income  approach,  among  others.  The  fair  value  of  the  investment  properties  is  based  on  the comparative  market  approach,  which  reflects  the  prices  of  recent  transactions  with  similar  characteristics.  Upon determining the fair value of these investment properties, the greater and best use of these investment properties is their present use.

These additional points will only be applicable to said institutions when they generate a taxable liquid income in the respective year, equal to or greater than 120,000 UVT.\n\nLikewise, the presumptive income rate on liquid equity is gradually reduced, as follows: to 1.5% for the year 2019, to 0.5% for the year 2020 and to 0% as of the year 2021.\n\nThe deduction to income tax of 100% of the taxes, rates and contributions effectively paid during the tax year or period, which have a causal relationship, is established as a general rule, and it is not possible for tax deductions such as: income, equity and tax normalizations.

These  estimates  start  from  the  financial  projections  that  were  prepared considering information from the Bancolombia Group's economic research records, the expected economic environment for the next five years. The main indicators on which the models are based are GDP growth, loans growth and interest rates. In addition to these elements, the long-term Group's strategy is considered.\n\n|                                                         | December 31,    2019           | Effect on     Income    Statement   | Effect on OCI    and Equity    Exchange   |          | Adjustments for   purposes   | Foreign     consolidation   December 31,   2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                         | In millions of Colombian pesos | In millions of Colombian pesos      | In millions of Colombian pesos            |          |                              |                                                   |\n| Asset Deferred Tax:                                     |                                |                                     |                                           |          |                              |                                                   |\n| Property and equipment                                  | 7,338                          | (3,610)                             | -

In the case of Colombian companies, dividends will be subject to the application of Articles 48 and 49 of the Tax Statute and consequently will be subject to withholding at source at the established rates, in accordance with the tax characteristics of each shareholder.\n\n## 12.8.2   Dividends received from Subsidiary Companies\n\nConsidering the historical tax status of the dividends received by the Bank from its affiliates and national subsidiaries, it is expected that in the future dividends will be received on the basis of non-income tax; Likewise, they will not be subject to withholding tax, taking into account that the Bank, its affiliates and national subsidiaries belong to the same business group.\n\n## 12.9      Tax contingent liabilities and assets\n\nIn  the  determination  of  the  effective  current  and  deferred  taxes  subject  to  review  by  the  tax  authority,  the  relevant\n\nregulations have been applied in accordance with the interpretations made by the Group Bancolombia.\n\nIn Colombia due to the complexity of the tax system, ongoing amendments to the tax regulations, accounting changes with implications on tax bases and in general the legal instability of the country, the tax authority may at any time have different criteria to that of the Bancolombia Group. Consequently, a dispute or inspection by the tax authority on a tax treatment may affect the Group Bancolombia accounting of assets or liabilities for deferred or current taxes, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12. In the other countries where the Group is present, uncertain tax positions were not recognized.\n\nFor Colombia, the Group recognizes the uncertain tax positions according to the criteria established in the interpretation of IFRIC 23. Additionally, these positions were updated in the course of 2020.

Assets held for sale\n\nThe assets recognized by the Bank as assets held for sale correspond to machinery, equipment, motor vehicles, technology, and investment property, among others that have been received as foreclosed assets.\n\nThe Bank's assets are subject to a current plan for their sale, which contains the details of the selling price allocation and the advertising and marketing plan. Furthermore, the plan specifies the conditions to proceed with the selling process.",

As of December 31, 2020, 603 participants were covered by this plan, and as of December 31, 2019, 623 participants.\n\nFor purposes of the projected assessment of the pension plan obligation, in the absence of an extensive market for highquality corporate debt, the sovereign bond curve of the Colombian government is used, with maturity similar to the residual",

This benefit accumulates and is paid to the employees upon their termination or retirement from the Bank, calculated based on the employees' last salary base; however, employees may request advances against this benefit at any time. In 1990, the Colombian government revised its labor regulations for new employees to permit companies, subject to the approval of the employees, to transfer this severance obligation annually to private pension funds (this scheme of employee benefits is known as the current severance obligation). The Bank's severance obligations relate to employees hired before 1990.\n\nAs of December 2020 and 2019, 287 and 353 participants, respectively, were covered by this plan.\n\nThe balances recognized in the statement of financial position are listed below:\n\n| Defined benefit severance obligation plan                        | 2020               | 2019               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| In millions of COP                                               | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| Present value of the obligation as of January 1                  | 26,547             | 30,732             |\n| Current cost of service                                          | 716                | 862                |\n| Interest cost                                                    | 1,490              | 1,952              |\n| Benefits paid                                                    | (6,214)            | (8,414)            |\n| Net actuarial loss due to assumption changes and plan experience | (311)              | 1,415              |\n| Defined obligation, unfunded as of December 31                   | 22,228             | 26,547             |\n| Current severance regimen (1)                                    | 87,022             | 83,584             |\n| Total                                                            | 109,250            | 110,131            |\n\n## 19.3 Retirement Pension Premium Plan and Senior Management Pension Plan Premium\n\n## Colombia\n\nUnder Colombian labor regulations, employers and employees are entitled to negotiate private agreements.

In the opinion of management, after receiving pertinent legal advice, the payments that will be made by these processes will not generate significant losses in addition to the provisions recognized as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank does not expect to obtain any kind of reimbursement from judicial proceedings raised against it and, therefore, has not recognized any assets for that purpose, see Note 21.2 Contingent liabilities.\n\n## Loan commitments\n\nIn order to meet the needs of its customers, the Bank issues loan commitments, letters of credit and bank guarantees. Loan commitments are those approved irrevocable loans, in which, despite having acquired a commitment to grant them, due to the contract or agreement or for any other reason they are still pending disbursement. See Note 2.D Significant Accounting Policies (7.5.2 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments).\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe Bank grants bank guarantees on behalf of its customers. A bank guarantee represents an irrevocable commitment pursuant to which the Bank will cover to the maximum amount guaranteed, the breach of the client's contractual obligations to third parties for a certain period of time. These are commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and are mainly issued to guarantee agreements established between parties from the energy sector, hydrocarbons sector, private sector and public procurement contracts. The Bank expects most of those guarantees provided to expire before they are used. See Note 2.D Significant Accounting Policies (7.5.2 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments).\n\nThe events or circumstances that would require the Bank to perform under a guarantee are determined by the type of guarantee:",

Contingent liabilities\n\nContingencies with an individual claimed amount against the Bank higher than USD 5,000, with significant importance to the financial statements as of December 31, 2020 are presented below:\n\n## BANCOLOMBIA\n\n## Constitutional Public Interest Action of Carlos Julio Aguilar, et al.\n\nThis constitutional public interest action (acci\u00f3n popular) was filed by the plaintiff contending that the restructuring of the Departamento del Valle's financial obligations and the performance plan executed, allegedly violates the collective rights of the public administration's morality and of the public funds of the Departamento del Valle.\n\nThis action was on hold due to its consolidation with the constitutional public interest action filed by Carlos Aponte against various financial institutions. As of December 31, 2020, this proceeding is in the discovery stage, specifically in respect of expert opinion, and no provisions have been made.\n\n## Fiscal  Responsibility  Lawsuit  (proceso  de  responsabilidad  fiscal)  between  Contralor\u00eda  Departamental  de Cundinamarca vs. GEHS, Bancolombia, et al.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatments Plant Ch\u00eda I Delicias Sur of the Municipality of Ch\u00eda's development was documented through a leasing agreement entered on September 28, 2015 by and between the Municipality of Chia (tenant) and Bancolombia S.A., valued at USD 5,535. The purpose of such agreement was the financing, optimization, design and construction of the wastewater treatment plant PTAR Ch\u00eda I Delicias Sur; as of December 31, 2018, the agreement was in the stage of advances (with payment of interest on the disbursements made to the supplier), which refers to the contractual stage in which the resources  are delivered for the execution of the project in advance of the final payment. The current Mayor of the Municipality of Ch\u00eda has conveyed anomalies he has found in the execution of the aforementioned project and, as a consequence of the aforementioned anomalies, the Contralor\u00eda de Cundinamarca initiated a fiscal responsibility lawsuit for an alleged patrimonial detriment in public funds of the amount of USD 5,535 against GEHS Global Environment and Health Solutions of Colombia (provider), Guillermo Varela Romero, Rafael Antonio Ballesteros G\u00f3mez, Luis Alejandro Prieto Gonz\u00e1lez and Bancolombia S.A.",

The allegations' stage has not started yet. For this matter, we have established provision of COP 3,910.\n\n## BANISTMO\n\n## Ordinary claim filed by Melenao Mora and Said Diaz:\n\nThe plaintiffs in this matter claim material and moral damages resulting from a criminal proceeding filed by Banistmo (28-10-2004) against them for alleged criminal acts that caused damage to the bank because of the unauthorized use of credit lines to enterprises where plaintiffs acted as legal representatives.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek the payment of material and moral damages which according to their valuation amounts to USD 20,000. The trial court ordered Banistmo to pay material damages, product of the criminal process imposed against the plaintiffs, as well as to pay the sum of USD 2,300 to each of the plaintiffs for moral damages.\n\nBanistmo filed an appeal against the judgement made by the trial court on the basis of allegded errors made by the court in the analysis of the evidence and legal grounds in which the decision was based on. The external counsel has labeled this contingency as eventual.\n\n## Ordinary claim filed by Deniss Rafael Perez Perozo, Carlos P\u00e9rez Leal and others.\n\nPromotora Terramar (an HSBC client) received USD 299 in payments through Visa gift cards issued by U.S Bank, as partial payment for two apartments in Panama City.\n\nThe Credit Card Securities and Fraud Prevention department of HSBC bank detected an irregular activity promoted by Promotora Terramar, when a deposit monitoring alert was activated due to the high number of cards with the same BIN and  Bank.  Therefore,  pursuant  to  the  Business  Establishments  Affiliate  Agreement,  HSBC  withheld  USD  287  from Promotora Terramar's accounts. After further investigations, the money was refunded.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim USD 5,252 as result of material and moral damages as a result of such withholding. As of December 31, 2020, the process is suspended and pending the initiation of discovery. External counsel has advised that any contingent liability is remote.\n\n## BANCO AGR\u00cdCOLA\n\n## Superintendencia de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria\n\nThe El Salvadorian taxing authority, in accordance with a resolution dated as of October 2018, determined that Banco Agr\u00edcola failed to pay and declare income taxes related to fiscal year 2014 for a total of USD 11,116 and sanctions.\n\nThe Bank filed an appeal against such decision. The process is awaiting issuance of a final resolution by the court of appeals of internal taxes and customs, which in the event of a possible contentious-administrative process would result in the exhaustion of administrative procedures.\n\nIn the Bank's opinion, the General Directorate of Internal Tax made certain factual and legal errors. External counsel has advised that any contingent liability is remote.\n\n## ARRENDADORA FINANCIERA S.A. ARFINSA SUBSIDIARY OF BANCO AGR\u00cdCOLA\n\n## Corporaci\u00f3n de Alimentos S.A. de CV\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a claim for alleged damages derived from funds wrongfully delivered to third parties that were not entitled to the receipt of such funds. The claim seeks USD 6,654. As of December 31, 2020, the process is in the discovery",

External counsel has advised that any contingent liability is remote.\n\n## BANCO AGROMERCANTIL\n\n## Superintendence of Tax Administration\n\nThe Superintendence of Tax Administration of Guatemala (SAT) made a tax adjustment on the Income Tax return duly paid by BAM for 2014 fiscal year for a value of USD 13.617 (USD 6.808 tax plus a fine of USD 6.808). This adjustment was not reserved for during the administrative pleading phase, since BAM argued that the tax was correctly paid and presented a contentious administrative procedure against the SAT before the Court to oppose the alleged collection. This trial is currently on the Court of Justice and as of December 31, 2020 it was in the discovery stage. In the opinion of the external counsel, any contingent is remote.\n\n## Delicarnes, Sociedad An\u00f3nima\n\nDelicarnes, Sociedad An\u00f3nima, acquired a mortgage loan from BAM and defaulted in payment at maturity, so BAM filed a collection lawsuit. Delicarnes, in addition to opposing the collection lawsuit, filed against BAM, an ordinary claim for reputational damages caused (estimated is USD 70,379), since it believes that Delicarnes did not breach the contract and therefore, should not have been sued. The Bank opposed the demand and as of December 31, 2020 this process was in the discovery phase. In the opinion of external counsel, the realization of any contingent liability is remote.\n\n## Dany Ward Mcnab Valladares\n\nNorth Shore Development Company, S.A (NSDC) acquired several loans from BAM and  Mercom Bank Ltd. (Grupo Agromercantil Holdings' subsidiary company), which were not paid in the agreed manner. To pay the debts, NSDC gave to BAM and Mercom Bank Ltd., with the express authorization of its shareholders (including the shareholder Dany Ward Mcnab Valladares), certain properties and other assets of the company valued at USD 23,800.\n\nAfter granting the properties as payment to BAM and Mercom Bank Ltd, Dany Ward Mcnab Valladares filed before the 'Court of Roat\u00e1n, Islas de la Bahia', an ordinary claim of annulment of the 'Things in lieu of Payment contracts' of the assets given in payment.  Dany Ward Mcnab Valladares based his claim on the fact that when North Shore Development Company, S.A, paid with its properties and assets to BAM and Mercom Bank [NSDC.] was left without enough assets to pay him a debt in the amount of USD 18,200. Dany Ward Mcnab Valladares's claim was answered by BAM and Mercom Bank Ltd in August 2018. As of December 31, 2020, the process is on the notification stage. In the opinion of external counsel, the realization of any content liability is remote.\n\n## NOTE 22.

Dividends must be approved at the ordinary annual shareholders' meeting upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors. Under the Colombian Commercial Code, after payment of income taxes and appropriation of legal and other reserves, and after setting off losses from prior fiscal years, Bancolombia must distribute to its stockholders at least 50% of its annual net income or 70% of its annual net income if the total amount of reserves exceeds its outstanding capital, unless such minimum percentages are waived by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least 78% of the shares present at the  stockholders' meeting. Such dividend distribution must be made to all stockholders, in cash or in issued stock of Bancolombia,  as  may  be  determined  by  the  stockholders,  and  within  a year  from  the  date  of  the  ordinary  annual stockholders' meeting in which the dividend was declared.\n\nThe payment of dividends must be made in cash during the year following the date of applicable the Annual Meeting and for all the stockholders. If the payment is made in the Bank's own equity securities instead of cash, that must be approved by 80% of the outstanding common shareholders and 80% of the outstanding preferred shares.\n\nThe annual net profits of Bancolombia must be applied as follows: (i) first, an amount equal to 10% of Bancolombia's net profits to a legal reserve until such reserve is equal to at least 50% of the Bank's paid-in capital; (ii) second, to the payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares; and (iii) third, as may be determined in the ordinary annual stockholders' meeting by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote.\n\n|   Dividends declared with respect to  net income earned in: | Cash dividends per share  (Stated in COP)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                                        2020 | 260                                         |\n|                                                        2019 | 1,638                                       |\n|                                                        2018 | 1,092                                       |\n|                                                        2017 | 1,020                                       |\n|                                                        2016 | 950                                         |\n\n## Common shares\n\nThe holders of common shares are entitled to vote on any matter subject to approval at a general shareholders' meeting. Within 15 calendar days prior to such meeting, such holders are entitled to inspect the books and records of the Company.\n\nAlso, the holders of common shares will receive a proportion of the profits subject to the provisions of law, statutes and established at general shareholders' meeting. The dividend received by holders of common shares may not be higher than the dividend assigned to preferred shares.\n\n## Preferred shares\n\nHolders of preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends based on the net profits of the preceding fiscal year, after deducting losses affecting the capital and once the amount that shall be legally set apart for  the legal reserve has been deducted, but before creating or accruing for any other reserve, of a non-cumulative minimum preferred dividend equal to one percent (1%) yearly of the subscription price of the preferred share, provided this dividend is higher than the dividend assigned to common shares. If this is not the case, the dividend shall be increased to an amount that is equal to the per share dividend on the common shares.\n\nPayment of the preferred dividend shall be made at the time and in the manner established in the general shareholders' meeting and with the priority indicated by Colombian law.\n\nAny dividend in shares requires the approval of 80% or more of the shares present at a shareholders' meeting, which will include 80% or more of the outstanding preferred shares. In the event of absence of such holders of preferred shares, a stock dividend only has can be payable to the holders of common shares that aprove this payment.",

        "page_content": "For the determination of the transaction price, the Bank assigns to each one of the services the amount which represents the value expected to be received as consideration for each independent commitment, which is based on the relative price of independent sale. The price that the Bank determines for each performance obligation is done by defining the cost of each service, related tax and associated risks to the operation and inherent to the transaction plus the margin expected to be received in each one of the services, taking as references the market prices and conditions, as well as the segmentation of the customer.\n\nIn the transactions evaluated in the contracts, changes in the price of the transaction are not identified.\n\n## Contract Assets\n\nThe Bank receives payments from customers based on the provision of the service, in accordance to that established in the contracts. When the Bank incurs costs for providing the service prior to the invoicing, and if these are directly related with a contract, they improve the resources of the entity and are expected to recuperate, these costs correspond to a contract asset. Currently, the Group does not have assets related to contracts with customers.\n\nAs a  practical  expedient,  the  Bank  recognizes  the  incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  as  an  expense  when  the amortisation period of the asset is one year or less.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nThe contract liabilities constitute the obligation of the Bank to transfer the services to a customer, for which the Group has received a payment on the part of the final customer or if the amount is due before the execution of the contract. They also include deferred income related to services that shall be delivered or provided in the future, which will be invoiced to the customer in advance, but which are still not due.\n\nThe  contract  liabilities  increased  COP  3,208  in  2020.  The  changes  in  contract  liabilities  are  due  to  performance circumscribed in the contract.\n\nThe following table shows the detail of accounts receivable, and contract liabilities balances as at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\n|                                                            | 2020               | 2019               | 2018               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                            | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| Accounts receivable from contracts with customers, net (1) | 177,991            | 203,198            | 86,759             |\n| Contract liabilities                                       | 64,071             | 60,791             | 75,845             |\n\n## Fees and Commissions Expenses\n\n| Fees and Commissions Expenses   | 2020               | 2019               | 2018                                      |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                 | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP                        |\n| Banking services                | (513,122)          | (630,583)          | (542,628)                                 |\n| Call center and web page        | (558,038)          | (423,630)          | (309,403)                                 |\n| Others                          | (490,425)          | (499,026)          | (361,025)                                 |\n| Expenses for commissions        |                    |                    | (1,561,585)    (1,553,239)    (1,213,056) |\n\nDuring 2020, the fees and commissions expenses were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

EARNING PER SHARE ('EPS')\n\nBasic EPS is calculated by reducing the income from continuing operations by the amount of dividends declared in the current period for each class of stock and by the contractual amount of dividends that must be paid for the current period, considering the allocation of remaining earnings to common stock and participating securities to the extent that each security may share in earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. EPS is determined by dividing the total earnings allocated to each security by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\n\nDiluted EPS assumes the issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The Bank had no dilutive potential common shares as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.",

In accordance with IFRS the financial instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability being measured take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. Level 2 generally includes: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 : Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair  value  requires  significant  management  judgment  or  estimation.  This  category  generally  includes  certain  retained residual interests in securitizations, asset-backed securities (ABS) and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts where independent pricing information was not able to be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.",

        "page_content": "## \u00b7 Valuation process for fair value measurements\n\nThe valuation to fair value prices is performed using prices, methodologies and inputs provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia) to the Bank. All methodologies and procedures developed by the pricing services provider are supervised by the SFC, which has not objected to them.\n\nOn a daily basis, the back-office Service Valuation Officer (SVO) verifies the valuation of investments, and the Credit and Financial Risk Manager area reports the results of the portfolio's valuation.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\n## Assets and liabilities\n\n## a. Debt instruments\n\nThe Bank assigns prices to those debt investments, using the prices provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia) and assigns the appropriate level according to the procedure described above. For securities not traded or overthe-counter such as certain bonds issued by other financial institutions, the Bank generally determines fair value utilizing internal valuation and standard techniques. These techniques include determination of expected future cash flows which are discounted using curves of the applicable currencies and the Colombian consumer price index (interest rate in this case), modified by the credit risk and liquidity risk. The interest rate is generally computed using observable market data and reference yield curves derived from quoted interest in appropriate time bandings, which match the timings of the cash flows and maturities of the instruments.\n\n## b. Equity securities\n\nThe Bank performs the market price valuation of its investments in variable income using the prices provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia) and classifies those investments according to the procedure described above (Hierarchy of fair value section). Likewise, the fair value of unlisted equity securities is based on an assessment of each individual  investment  using  methodologies  that  include  publicly-traded  comparables  derived  by  multiplying  a  key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, and if necessary considered, are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Interests in investment funds, trusts and collective portfolios are valued using the investment unit value determined by the fund management company. For investment funds where the underlying assets are investment properties, the investment unit value depends on the investment properties value, determined as described below in 'i. Investment property'.\n\n## c. Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe  Bank  holds  positions  in  standardized  derivatives,  such  as  futures  over  local  stocks,  and  over  the  representative exchange rate (TRM). These instruments are evaluated according to the information provided by Precia, which perfectly matches the information provided by the Central Counterparty Clearing House - CCP.\n\nAdditionally, the Bank holds positions in OTC derivatives, which in the absence of prices, are valued using the inputs and methodologies provided by the pricing services provider.\n\nThe key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, the spot price of the underlying volatility, credit curves and correlation of such inputs.\n\n## d. Credit valuation adjustment\n\nThe Bank measures the effects of the credit risk of its counterparties and its own creditworthiness in determining fair value of the swap, option and forward derivatives.",

        "page_content": "Counterparty credit-risk adjustments are applied to derivatives when the Bank's position is a  derivative asset and the Bank's credit risk is incorporated when the position is a derivative liability. The Bank attempts to mitigate credit risk to third parties which are international banks by entering into master netting agreements. The agreements allow to offset or bring net amounts that are liabilities, derivates from transactions carried out by the different agreements. Master netting agreements take different forms and may allow payments to be made under a variety of other master agreements or other negotiation agreements between the same parties; some may have a monthly basis and others only apply at the time the agreements are terminated.\n\nWhen assessing the impact of credit exposure, only the net counterparty exposure is considered at risk, due to the offsetting of certain same-counterparty positions and the application of cash and other collateral.\n\nThe Bank generally calculates the asset's credit risk adjustment for derivatives transacted with international financial institutions by incorporating indicative credit related pricing that is generally observable in the market ('CDS'). The creditrisk adjustment for derivatives transacted with non-public counterparties is calculated by incorporating unobservable credit data derived from internal credit qualifications to the financial institutions and corporate companies located in Colombia. The Bank also considers  its  own  creditworthiness  when  determining  the  fair  value  of  an  instrument,  including  OTC derivative instruments if the Bank believes market participants would take that into account when transacting the respective instrument. The approach to measuring the impact of the Bank's credit risk on an instrument transacted with international financial institutions is done using the asset swap curve calculated for subordinated bonds issued by the Bank in foreign currency. For derivatives transacted with local financial institutions, the Bank calculates the credit risk adjustment by incorporating credit risk data provided by rating agencies and released in the Colombian financial market.\n\n## e. Impaired loans measured at fair value\n\nThe Bank measured certain impaired loans based on the fair value of the associated collateral less costs to sell. The fair values were determined as follows using external and internal valuation techniques or third party experts, depending on the type of underlying asset.\n\nFor vehicles under leasing arrangements, the Bank uses an internal valuation model based on price curves for each type of vehicle. Such curves show the  expected price of the vehicle at different points in time  based on the initial price and projection  of  economic  variables  such  as  inflation,  devaluation  and  customs.  The  prices  modelled  in  the  curves  are compared  every  six months  with  market  information  for  the  same  or  similar  vehicles  and  in  the  case  of  significant deviation; the curve is adjusted to reflect the market conditions.\n\nOther vehicles are measured using matrix pricing from a third party. This matrix is used by most of the market participants and is updated monthly. The matrix is developed from values provided by several price providers for identical or similar vehicles and considers brand, characteristics of the vehicles, and manufacturing date among other variables to determine the prices.\n\nFor real estate assets, a third-party qualified appraiser is used. The methodologies vary depending on the date of the last appraisal available for the property (the appraisal is estimated based on either of three approaches: cost, sales comparison and income approach, and is required every three years). When the property has been valued in the last 12 months and the market  conditions  have  not  shown  significant  changes,  the  most  recent  valuation  is  considered  the  fair  value  of  the property.\n\nFor all other cases (for example, appraisals older than 12 months) the value of the property is updated by adjusting the value in the last appraisal for weighted factors such as location, type and characteristics of the property, size, structural conditions and the expected sales prices, among others. The factors are determined based on current market information gathered from several external real estate specialists.\n\n## f. Assets held for sale measured at fair value less cost of sale\n\nThe Bank measures certain impaired foreclosed assets and premises and equipment held for sale based on fair value less costs to sell. The fair values were determined using external and internal valuation techniques, depending on the type of",

Those assets are comprised mainly of real estate properties for which the appraisal is conducted by experts considering factors such as the location, type and characteristics of the property, size, physical conditions and expected selling costs, among others. Likewise, in some cases the fair value is estimated considering comparable prices or promises of sale and offering prices from auctions process.\n\n## g. Mortgage-backed securities ('TIPS') and Asset-Backed securities\n\nThe Bank invests in asset-backed securities for which underlying assets are mortgages and earnings under contracts issued by  financial  institutions  and  corporations,  respectively.  The  Bank  does  not  have  a  significant  exposure  to  sub-prime securities. The asset-backed securities are denominated in local market TIPS and are classified as fair value through profit or loss. These asset-backed securities have different maturities and are generally classified by credit ratings.\n\nTIPS are part of the Bank portfolio and its fair value is measured with published price by the official pricing services provider. These securities are leveled by margin and are assigned level 2 or 3 based on the Precia information.\n\nResidual TIPS have their fair value measured using the discounted flow method, taking into account the amortization tables of the Titularizadora Colombiana, the betas in COP and UVR of Precia (used to construct the curves) and the margins; when they are residual TIPS of subordinated issues, a liquidity premium is applied. These securities are assigned level 3.\n\n## h. Investments in associates measured at fair value\n\nThe Bank recognizes its investment in PA Viva Malls as an associate at fair value. The estimated amount is provided by the fund manager as the variation of the units according to the units owned by the Fondo Colombia Inmobiliario. The associate's assets are comprised of investment properties which are measured using the following techniques: comparable prices,  discounted  cash  flows,  replacement  cost  and  direct  capitalization.  For  further  information  about  techniques methodologies  and  inputs  used  by  the  external  party  see  'Quantitative  Information  about  Level  3  Fair  Value Measurements'.\n\n## i. Investment property\n\nThe Bank's investment property is valued by external experts, who use valuation techniques based on comparable prices, direct capitalization, discounted cash flows and replacement costs.",

        "page_content": "## Short-term financial instruments\n\nShort-term financial instruments are valued at their carrying amounts included in the consolidated statement of financial position, which are reasonable estimates of fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity of the instruments. This approach was used for cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable, customers' acceptances, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest payable and bank acceptances outstanding.\n\n## Deposits from customers\n\nThe fair value of time deposits was estimated based on the discounted value of cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Fair value of deposits with no contractual maturities represents the amount payable on demand as of the statement of financial position date.\n\n## Interbank deposits and repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowings\n\nShort-term interbank borrowings and repurchase agreements have been valued at their carrying amounts because of their relatively short-term nature. Long-term and domestic development bank borrowings have also been valued at their carrying amount because they bear interest at variable rates.\n\n## Borrowings from other financial institutions\n\nThe fair value of borrowings from other financial institutions were determined using discounted cash flow models. The cash flows projection of capital and interest was made according to the contractual terms, considering capital amortization and interest bearing. Subsequently, the cash flows were discounted using reference curves formed by the weighted average of the Bank's deposit rates.\n\n## Debt instruments in issue\n\nThe fair value of debt instruments in issue, comprised of bonds issued by Bancolombia S.A. and its subsidiaries, was estimated substantially based on quoted market prices. The fair value of certain bonds which do not have a public trading market, were determined based on the discounted value of cash flows using the rates currently offered for bonds of similar remaining maturities and the Bank's creditworthiness.\n\n## Preferred shares\n\nIn the valuation of the liability component of preferred shares related to the minimum dividend of 1% of the subscription price, the Bank uses the Gordon Model to price the obligation, taking into account its own credit risk, which is measured using  the  market  spread  based  on  observable  inputs  such  as  quoted  prices  of  sovereign  debt.  The  Gordon  Model  is commonly used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock based on a future series of dividends that are estimated by the Bank and growth at a constant rate considering the Bank's own perspectives of the payout ratio.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nEstimating the fair value of loans and advances to customers is considered an area of considerable uncertainty as there is no observable market. The loan portfolio is stratified into tranches and loans segments suchs as commercial, small business loans, mortgage and consumer. The fair value of loans and advances to customers and financial institutions is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, considering each credit's principal and interest projected cash flows to the prepayment date. The projected cash flows are discounted using reference curves according to the type of loan and its maturity date.\n\n## Items Measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\n\nThe Bank measures assets held for sale based on fair value less costs to sell. This category includes certain foreclosed assets and investments in associates held for sale. The fair values were determined using external and internal valuation",

Changing one or more of the inputs to the valuation models to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would change the fair values and therefore a valuation adjustment would be recognized in profit or loss. Favorable and unfavorable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable input as described in the table below. The following table sets forth information about significant unobservable inputs related to the Bank's material categories of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and the sensitivity of these fair values to reasonably possible alternative assumptions.",

Credit Risk Management - Loans and Advances\n\nCredit risk management during 2020 was focused to allow our customers respond to the economic effects caused by the spread  of  Covid-19.  This  situation  characterized  by  extraordinary  decisions  of  governments,  behaviors  of  markets, customers  and  general  population,  arisen  new  strategies  and  policies  to  avoid  impairment  and  maintain  the  portfolio quality.\n\nAmong the main actions that Bancolombia adopted, the following stand out:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial Relief in some products for Personal segment customers.\n- \u00b7 Reliefs tailored for SME, Business and Corporate segments customers.\n- \u00b7 Structured analysis groups for the design of credit risk management strategies in customers with a high-risk level.\n- \u00b7 Analysis and manage of the portfolio focused on most affected sectors.\n- \u00b7 Relevance of behavior in our customers transactions for credit risk management.\n- \u00b7 New ways of portfolio segmentation based on typical risk characteristics of the current situation.\n- \u00b7 Origination processes were intervened, adapting them to market and customers changes.\n- \u00b7 Design of recovery strategies based on portfolio segmentation methodologies.\n\nLikewise, modifications were made to some credit policies associated mainly with origination processes, use of credit limits, monitoring, extension mechanisms, sectoral analysis, restructuring, and recovery for clients affected by Covid-19 context,  developing  temporary  measures  and  others  permanently,  always  considering  regulatory  framework  and  risk appetite defined by Bancolombia Group and determining appropriate mitigating actions.\n\nAs usual, Grupo Bancolombia actively responds to regulatory challenges; during 2020, precisely the group had to face the implementation of financial relief strategies established by each government of the markets where we have presence. For Colombia, the measures of circular 022 were adopted, developing the debtor support program (PAD), which facilitated solutions of capital installments deferments, changes in the amortization plan and structured solutions for customers with credit difficulties; Similarly, at the end of 2020, the government ordered by the circular 039 extending the term of facilities disposed in circular 022 until June 2021.\n\nIn Panama, we adopted the measures defined by the local Superintendence of Banks, highlighting Agreement No. 2 -2020 of March 16 and its subsequent modifications made during the year up to Agreement No. 13-2020. Those regulations established  additional  measures,  exceptional  and  temporary  conditions  modifying  original  ones  for  commercial  and consumer loans in order to provide financial relief to customers whose payment capacity was affected by the effects of COVID-19, extending term facilities until June 2021.",

In  addition,  the  credit  risk  department  has  developed  methodologies  and  manuals  that  specify  the  policies  and procedures for different products and segments managed by the Bank\n\nTo maintain credit quality and manage the risk arising from its lending activities, the Bank has established general loan policies, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit exposure limits: It contains guidelines with regards to the establishment of credit exposure limits. It is set in fulfillment of legal requirements and according to the Bank's internal guidelines.\n- \u00b7 Origination policies: These policies aim to acquire ample and sufficient knowledge of the characteristics of potential borrowers and to select them properly. The riskiness of the borrowers is determined using credit rating models. These models  use  information  such  as  the  credit  history  of  the  borrower,  sociodemographic  particularities,  the  type  of business the borrower engages in, the borrower's ability to repay the loan, and information received from the credit risk bureaus. In addition, sectorial and macroeconomic behavior will be look at.loan applications, depending on their amount and risk level, are presented for approval at the level of management authority required.\n- \u00b7 Collaterals policies: For the purpose of mitigating risk associated with non-fulfillment of obligations agreed upon by the borrower, the Bank has established policies for the valuation of collateral received as well as for the determination of the maximum loan amount that can be granted against the value of the collateral.\n- \u00b7 Allowance policies: The objective of this policy is to fulfil legal requirements and the Bank's business policies. In addition, this policy is meant to provide the guidelines to perform client's status analysis and take the necessary actions in order to mitigate credit risk the Bank is exposed to. For further information please see Note 2.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring  policies: Contains  various  monitoring  procedures,  portfolio  reports  and  policies  for  the  purpose  of overseeing, in an adequate and timely manner, the evolution of credit risk. These procedures include a continuous process  of  classification  and  reassessment  of  credit  operations  and  they  maintain  consistency  with  the  policies implemented for granting loans.\n- \u00b7 Portfolio recovery policies: Through the definition of these policies, the Bank aims to establish those mechanisms that allow it to anticipate the action to be taken in the event of possible delays and minimize the impact resulting from non-fulfillment of payment or delays by the borrower. Additionally, the aspects established in this policy delimit what the  Bank  has  defined  as  collection  management  and  that  make  it  possible  to  obtain  information  to  improve  the origination policies and the allowances for loans and advances and lease losses models.\n\nManagement of credit risk is carried out in all the credit life cycle. These processes are defined in the following way:\n\n- \u00b7 Origination: Knowing the borrower, payment capacity analysis, payment behavior and credit approval and structure.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring: Knowing the borrower's situation during the life of the credit.\n- \u00b7 Recovery: Collection management during the different stages of the same credit.\n\nIn  order  to  support  the  credit  origination  processes,  the  Bank  develops  scoring  and rating  models based on statistical information or criteria  from  experts,  which  differentiate  the  risk  levels of  potential  borrowers  in  order  to  support  the decision-making process.\n\nThe Risk Corporate Vice Presidency is in charge of defining and documenting the specific characteristics of the models being utilized, as well as the parameters, variables to use in each case and the cut-off points that are applied per situation in the process of issuing credit. On an annual basis at the minimum, the Risk Corporate Vice Presidency must perform backtesting  of  the  scoring  and  rating  models  used  in  the  granting  process  in  order  to  evaluate  their  effectiveness. Additionally, on a periodically basis, the entire credit portfolio will be rated considering the established internal models",

Collective evaluation of the portfolio applies the following parameters for measuring risk: probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). For further details please see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies, section 7.4.5 Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost.\n\nFor the evaluation of individual risk, parameters such as recovery rates estimated by score sheets that include financial, behavioral  information,  collaterals  and  qualitative  variables,  serve  as  elements  for  measuring  risk  and  defining  an allowance for loans and advances and lease losses for that borrower.\n\nAnnual backtesting must be performed on the allowances for loans and advances and lease losses models for the purpose of maintaining suitable hedge levels in accordance with the Bank's risk appetite.\n\nThe Bank is continuously monitoring the concentration of the risk groups, as well as carrying out a daily control of the exposure to different economic groups, evaluating the legal limits of indebtedness in order to fulfill the norms established about the concentration limits.\n\nThe  Bank  performs  international  references  determined  by  the  rankings  of  external  risks  that  allow  the  analysis  of concentration levels in different geographic areas.

They  take information on the financial statements, profit and loss statement, historical payment behavior both with the Bank and with other entities, and qualitative information on variables that are not explicit in the financial statements. The rating model is applied at the origination of the loan and is updated by a central qualification office to undertake a periodical evaluation of the loan portfolio, during the months of May and November each year. In 2019, a new rating model for SME portfolio in Colombia was implemented, using a random forest methodology, these are mathematical models which allows to use a greater number of variables related to the client, and have more precise rating consistent with the level of risk. These methodologies have a fundamental role in the evaluation and monitoring of credit risk.\n\nIn  the  case  of  a  retail  customer,  granting  and  behavior  scoring  models  are  used  in  order  to  identify  the  level  of  risk associated with the borrower. These models include information such as personal details, financial information, historical behavior, the total number of credit products and external information from credit bureaus.

The 30-day past due loan ratio (consolidated) stood at 5.47% in December 2020 compared to 4.63% in December 2019, driven by an adverse impact on customers financial situation due to COVID19 effects.\n\n- \u00b7 Commercial loans and finance lease amounted to COP 123,163 billion, which represented an increase of 4.98% with respect to 2019. Its 30-day past due loan ratio was 4.90%.\n- \u00b7 Consumer loans stood at COP 41,056 billion, which represented an increase of 3.41% with respect to 2019. Its 30day past due loan ratio was 6.76%.\n- \u00b7 Mortgage loans came to COP 25,959 billion, which represented an increase of 8.24% with respect to 2019. Its 30-day past due loan ratio was 5.71%.\n- \u00b7 Small Business loans ended at COP 1,232 billion, which represented a decrease of 3.70% with respect to 2019. Its 30day past due loan ratio was 14.09%.\n\nIn order to monitor credit risk associated with clients, the Bank has established regular meetings conducted by a committee to identify events that can lead to a reduction in borrowers' ability to pay. Generally, clients with good credit behavior could be included in the watch list in case of detecting any event that can lead to future financial difficulties to repay their loans;  for  instance,  internal  factors  such  as  the  economic  activity,  financial  weakness,  impacts  of  macroeconomic conditions,  changes  in  corporate  governance  and  other  situations  that  could  affect  clients'  business.  The  amount  and allowance of clients included in the described watch list, as of December 31, 2019 and December 2020 is shown below.",

Collateral is considered in the determination of the allowance for loans and advances and lease losses when it complies with the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 Its fair value was established according to technical and objective criteria.\n- \u00b7 The Bank is granted a preference or an improved right to obtain the payment of the obligation, becoming an effective collateral.\n- \u00b7 Its performance is reasonably possible.\n- \u00b7 It is a payment source that attends to the credit as per the requirement of the Bank.\n\nThe Bank has defined the criteria for the collateral enforceability, which are established according to the classification of loan portfolio. In addition, the Bank has set guidelines to value collaterals and the frequency of such valuations, as well as those guidelines related to the legalization, registry and maintenance of the collateral. Likewise, the Bank has defined the criteria for insurability, custody and the necessary procedures for their cancellation.\n\nThe update of the fair value of mortgages and vehicles collaterals for the loan portfolio is made between one and three years of agreement with the policy. The methodology used to estimate the fair value of the properties is applied by external and independent entities. Updating the fair value of the vehicles is done through guides and valid values commonly used as reference to set the value of a vehicle. The fair value of real state and vehicles are classified in levels 2 and 3 depending",

Credit Risk Management - Other Financial Instruments:\n\nEach one of the positions that make up the portfolio complies with the policies and limits that seek to diminish credit risk exposure. Those policies are, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Term Limits: Each borrower is evaluated by the Risk Committee, in which the result of the authorized model for this type of borrower is reviewed (quantitative and qualitative variables), which allows the Committee to establish the maximum term for which the Bank wishes to have exposure.\n- \u00b7 Credit Limits: Limits approved under the model and with authorization from the Risk Committee, as well as the exposure, are monitored in line or batch, in such a way that the presentation of excesses is mitigated.\n- \u00b7 Counterparty Limits: These limits, derived from the credit limits or from allocation models and are verified by the Front Office prior to the close of operations.\n- \u00b7 Master Agreement: These bilateral agreements describe the handling of operations between the counterparties in accordance with good international practices and that limit the legal and financial risk under the occurrence of events of default (failure to pay or delivery). Mitigation mechanisms, procedures to be carried out in the case of this events of default, special conditions by type of operation and that are applied to OTC derivatives, Repos and other securities financing transactions, are all agreed upon.\n- \u00b7 Margin Agreements: For OTC derivatives operations and other securities financing transactions, agreements that regulate the administration of guarantees, haircuts, adjustment periods, minimum transfer amounts, etc., and that limit risk for a period of time (one day, one week, etc.), are established for counterparties involved in the operation.\n- \u00b7 Counterparty Alerts: There are financial, qualitative and market indicators that allow the Bank to establish damages to the credit quality of an issuer or counterparty.\n\n## f.     Credit Quality Analysis - Other Financial Instruments:\n\nIn order to evaluate the credit quality of a counterparty or issuer (to determine a risk level or profile), the Bank relies on two rating systems: an external one and an internal one, both of which allow to identify a degree of risk differentiated by segment and country and to apply the policies that have been established for issuers or counterparties with different levels of risk, in order to limit the impact on liquidity and/or the income statement of the Bank.\n\nExternal credit rating system is divided by the type of rating applied to each instrument or counterparty; in this way the geographic location, the term and the type of instrument allow the assignment of a rating according to the methodology that each examining agency uses.\n\nInternal credit rating system: The 'ratings or risk profiles' scale is created with a range of levels that go from low exposure  to  high  exposure  ( this  can  be  reported  in  numerical  or  alphanumerical  scales ),  where  the  rating  model  is sustained by the implementation and analysis of qualitative and quantitative variables at sector level, which according to the relative analysis of each variable, determine credit quality; in this way the internal credit rating system aims to establish adequate margin in decision-making regarding the management of financial instruments.",

This company acts on behalf of Bancolombia for making international margin calls and providing a better management of the collateral.\n\nCollateral adjustments for margin agreements: The adjustments will be determined by the criteria applied by both the external and internal regulations in effect, and at the same time, mitigation standards are maintained so that the operation fulfills the liquidity and solidity criteria for settlement. Among the main characteristics by product or market, we have:\n\n- -With respect to the derivative operations, these are carried out daily, with threshold levels of zero for the majority of counterparties, which reduces the exposure to a term that does not exceed 10 days, according to Basel.",

A reduction in the country's rating would impact investment flows, there would be a massive adjustment of international ratings of the country's companies, therefore, they would incur higher costs making their instruments less attractive.\n\nSectoral risk: The lengthening of quarantine measures, together with market restrictions in 2020 affected industries such as: airlines, oil and gas, hospitality and tourism, automotive, metals and mining, building materials, consumption, diverse manufacturing, housing, infrastructure,  real  estate,  among others.  Negative  impacts  were  felt  in  reduced  revenue  and increased business leverage to meet short-term needs. In 2021, the performance of the economy is expected to continue to be conditioned on further closures by renewed outbreaks of the virus, which is why companies that do not adapt to this reality will face liquidity pressures and possible defaults on their financial obligations.",

On the public debt side, the COLTES index achieved an annual increase of 12.27% from 288.51 on 31/12/2019 to 323.91 31/12/2020 and private debt achieved better dynamism in the second half of 2020 to end the year with an emissions value of COP 12.9 trillion.\n\nThe local stock market was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, the COLCAP stock index as of 31/12/2020 accumulated an annual decrease of -13.51% declining from 1662.42 from 31/12/2019 to 1437.89 at the end of 2020, however, December presented a monthly variation of 14.30% increasing from 1258 units on 31/11/2020, this is explained by increased risk appetite and better negotiating volumes, which increased from April and May due to confidence in a possible Covid-19 vaccine and the stimulus provided by large economies for economic revival.\n\nBy 2020, the buyer flows of local shares, for the most part, were from foreign investors, however, this is a risk factor because it is not capital that is established in the long term within the country. This had implications for the exchange rate during the months of the start of the pandemic by the exit of investments, reversal of operations and profit-taking. The best year-end performance in the local market is due to returns in companies in cyclical sectors such as finance or infrastructure that, despite maintaining latent risks on the credit side, agents see potential for valorization.\n\nConsumer confidence improved as of December 2020 and recorded a balance sheet of -10.4%, representing a 3.2% increase over November, explained by improvements in consumer expectations and a better willingness for households to buy durable goods. In turn, the labour market at the national level achieved improvements over the course of the year following the start of restrictions and, as of November 2020, the unemployment rate stood at 13.3%. By 2021, in the face of better employability, domestic consumption is likely to improve and boost positive financial performance in companies that are part of COLCAP\n\n## 31.2 Market risk\n\nMarket risk refers to the risk of losses in the Bank's treasury book due to changes in equity prices, interest rates, foreignexchange rates and other indicators whose values are set in a public market. It also refers to the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income and equity economic value as a result of a change in market interest rates.\n\nMarket risk stems from the following activities at the Bank:\n\n- a)    Trading: Includes purchase - sale and positioning mainly in fixed income securities, equities, currencies and derivatives, as well as the financial services provided to customers, such as brokerage. Trading instruments are recorded  in  the  treasury  book  and  are  managed  by  the  Treasury  Division  which  is  also  responsible  for  the aggregated management of exchange rate exposures arising from the banking book and treasury book.\n- b)    Balance sheet management: Refers to the assets and liabilities management, due to mismatches in maturities and  repricing  of  them.  The  Assets  Liability  Management  Division  is  responsible  for  the  balance  sheet management, preserving the stability of the financial margin and the equity economic value, maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and solvency. Non-trading instruments are recorded in the Bank's banking book (the 'Banking Book'), which includes primarily loans, time deposits, checking accounts and savings accounts.\n\nIn the Bank, the market risks are identified, measured, monitored, controlled and reported in order to support the decisiontaking process for their mitigation, and to create greater shareholder value added.\n\nThe guidelines, policies and methodologies for market risks management are approved by the Board of Directors, thus guaranteeing the congruence and consistency in the risk appetite among subsidiaries. Each country has a local Market and Liquidity  Risk  Management  Office  that  applies  at  an  individual  level  the  principles  of  the  Bank's  Market  Risks Management Strategy. The Board of Directors and senior management have formalized the policies, procedures, strategies and  rules  of  action  for  market  risk  administration  in  its  'Market  Risk  Manual'.  This  manual  defines  the  roles  and responsibilities within each subdivision of the Bank and their interaction to ensure adequate market risk administration.",

        "page_content": "The Bank's Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office, responsible for monitoring and permanently controlling compliance with the limits established, is set up with clear independence from the trading and businesses units, ensuring enforcement authority. This independent control function is complemented by regular reviews conducted by the Internal Audit.\n\nThe Bank's Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office is responsible for: (a) identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling the market risk inherent in the Bank's businesses: (b) the Bank's exposure under stress scenarios and confirming compliance with the Bank's risk management policies: (c) designing the methodologies for valuation of the market value of certain securities and financial instruments: (d) reporting to senior management and the Board of Directors any violation of the Bank's risk management policies: (e) reporting to the senior management on a daily basis the levels of market risk associated with the trading instruments recorded in its treasury book, and (f) proposing policies to the Board of  Directors  and  to  senior  management  that  ensure  the  maintenance  of predetermined risk  levels.  The  Bank  has  also implemented an approval process for new products across each of its subdivisions. This process is designed to ensure that each subdivision is prepared to incorporate the new product into its procedures, that every risk is considered before the product is incorporated and that approval is obtained from the Board of Directors before the new product can be sold.\n\nMarket  risks  arising  from  trading  instruments  are  measured  at  the  Bank  using  two  different  Value  at  Risk  (VaR) methodologies: the standard methodology required by the SFC, and the internal methodology of historical simulation. The standard  methodology  is  established  by  'Chapter  XXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular',  based  on  the  model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee of 2005. The internal methodology of historical simulation uses a confidence level of 99%, a holding period of 10 days, and a time frame of one year or at least 250 days from the reference date of the VaR calculation is used, obtained from the reference date  of  calculating  the  VaR.  The  standard  methodology  is  used  to  report  the  market  risk  exposure  to  the  Financial Superintendency and is also used to measure the capital requirements for the Bank, therefore the analysis below is based on information obtain from this model.\n\nThe Bank's VaR limits structure for trading activities, is sufficiently granular to conduct an effective control of the various types of market risk factors on which an exposure is held. It ensures that the market risk is not concentrated in certain asset classes and maximizes the portfolio diversification effect. These limits are defined by companies, products or by risk takers. The majority of the limits are based on the maximum VaR values to which a certain portfolio can be exposed, nevertheless, loss triggers, stop loss and sensitivity warning levels are also set, especially in the derivatives portfolios. The limits are approved by the Board of Directors, and set based on factors such as tolerance for losses, capital resources and market's complexity and volatility. They are monitored daily, and their excesses or violations are reported to the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee.\n\nAdditional measurements like stress tests are done, to identify extreme unusual situations that could cause severe losses. Stress simulations include historical events and hypothetical scenarios. Back testing or model validation technics through comparison of predicted and actual loss level are applied on a regular basis to analyse and contrast the accuracy of the VaR calculation methodology in order to confirm its reliability, and make adjustments to the models if necessary.\n\nWithin the control and monitoring processes of market risks, reports are elaborated on a daily and monthly basis. They include an analysis of the most relevant risk measures and allow for monitoring the exposure levels to market risks and to the legal and internal limits established for each one of the levels of the Bank. These reports are taken as an input for the decision-taking process in the different Committees and management of the Bank.\n\n## Market Risk Management\n\nThe following section describes the market risks to which the Bank is exposed and the tools and methodologies used to measure these risks as of December 31, 2020. The Bank faces market risk as a consequence of its lending, trading and investments businesses.\n\nThe Bank uses VaR calculation to limit its exposure to the market risk of its Treasury Book. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR based on its assessment of the appropriate level of risk for Bancolombia. The Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR for each company and the Propietary Trading",

These limits are supervised on a daily basis by the Market Risk Management Office.\n\nFor managing the interest rate risk from banking activities, the Bank analyses the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities. In addition, the foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the banking book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## a.     Measurement of market risk of trading instruments\n\nThe Bank currently measures the treasury book exposure to market risk (including OTC derivatives positions) as well as the currency risk exposure of the banking book, which is provided to the Treasury Division, using a VaR methodology established in accordance with 'Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular', issued by the SFC.\n\nThe  VaR  methodology  established  by  'Chapter  XXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular'  is  based  on  the  model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee of 2005, which focuses on the treasury book and excludes investments classified as amortized cost which are not being given as collateral and  any  other  investment  that  comprises  the  banking  book,  such  as  non-trading  positions  excluding  the  value  of  the currency the risk position stemming from investment in affiliated but not consolidated entities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the methodology aggregates all risks by the use of correlations, through an allocation system based on defined zones and bands, affected by given sensitivity factors.\n\nThe total market risk for the Bank is calculated by the arithmetical aggregation of the VaR calculated for each subsidiary. The aggregated VaR is reflected in the Bank's Capital Adequacy (Solvency) ratio, in accordance with Decree 2555 de 2010.\n\nFor purposes of VaR calculations, a risk exposure category is any market variable that is able to influence potential changes in the portfolio value. Taking into account a given risk exposure, the VaR model assesses the maximum loss not exceeded, over a given period of time. The fluctuations in the portfolio's VaR depend on volatility, modified duration and positions changes relating to the different instruments that are subject to market risk.\n\nThe relevant risk exposure categories for which VaR is computed by the Bank according to 'Chapter XXI, Appendix 1 of the Basic Accounting Circular' are: (i) interest rate risks relating to local currency, foreign currency and UVR; (ii) currency risk; (iii) stock price risk, (iv) fund risk; and (v) credit default swaps risk.\n\n## \u00b7 Interest Rate Risk (Treasury Book)\n\nThe interest rate risk is the probability of decrease in the market value of the position due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The Bank calculates the interest rate risk for positions in local currency, foreign currency and UVR separately; in accordance with Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular issued by the SFC.\n\nIn the first instance, the interest rate risk exposure is determined by the sensitivity calculation for the net position of each instrument. This sensitivity is calculated as the net value market product, its corresponding modified duration and the estimated variation of interest rates. The possible variations in the interest rates are established by the SFC according to the historical behavior of these variables in the markets, and they are a function of the duration and currency, as seen in the following table.",

A net sensitivity is then calculated for each band, by determining the difference between the sum of all long-positions and the sum of all short-positions. Then a net position is calculated for each zone (which consists of a series of bands) determined by the SFC. The final step is to make adjustments within each band, across bands and within each zone, which results in a final number that is the interest rate risk VaR by currency. Each adjustment is performed following the guidelines established by the SFC.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to interest risk primarily arises from investments in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES).\n\n## \u00b7 Currency (Treasury and Banking Book), Equity (Treasury Book) and Fund (Treasury Book) Risk\n\nThe VaR model uses a sensitivity factor to calculate the probability of loss due to fluctuations in the price of stocks, funds and currencies in which the Bank maintains a position. As previously indicated, the methodology used in these financial statements to measure such risk consists of computing VaR, which is derived by multiplying the position by the maximum probable variation in the price of such positions ('\u2206p'). The ('\u2206p'). The ('\u2206p') is determined by the SFC, as shown in the following table:\n\n| Currency             | Sensitivity Factor   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|\n| United States Dollar | 12.49 %              |\n| Euro                 | 11.00 %              |\n| Other currencies     | 13.02 %              |\n| Equity and Fund Risk | 14.70 %              |\n\nThe SFC according to historical market performance establishes the interest rate's fluctuations and the sensitivity factors for currency, equity and fund risk used in the model.\n\n## \u00b7 Total Market Risk VaR\n\nThe total market risk VaR is calculated as the algebraic sum of the interest rate risk, the currency risk, the stock price risk, fund risk and the credit default swaps risk which are calculated as the algebraic sum of the Parent Company and each of its subsidiaries' exposure to these risks. Currently Bancolombia Group does not present exposure to credit default swaps risk.\n\nThe total market risk VaR, had a 52% reduction going from COP 1,692,516 in December 31 st , 2019 to COP 811,247 as of December 31 st , 2020, due by the adoption of External Circular 016 of 2020 issued by the SFC, within the calculation of",

Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as predictive of future results. The Bank may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by the Bank's VaR models. A VaR model does not calculate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the reasonable judgment of the Bank's risk management personnel.\n\n## b. Non-trading instruments market risk measurement\n\nThe banking book's relevant risk exposure is interest rate risk, which is the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income as a result of a change in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the Bank's earnings because of timing differences on the repricing of the assets and liabilities. The Bank manages the interest rate risk arising from banking activities in non-trading instruments by analyzing the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and  its  interest  bearing  liabilities.  The  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  exposures  arising  from  the  banking  book  are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## \u00b7 Interest Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nThe Bank has performed a sensitivity analysis of market risk sensitive instruments estimating the impact on the net interest income of each position in the Banking Book, using a repricing model and assuming positive parallel shifts of 50 basis points (bps).\n\nThe table 1 provides information about Bancolombia's interest rate sensitivity for the statement of financial position items comprising the Banking Book.",

A negative sensitivity denotes a higher sensitivity of liabilities than of assets and implies that a rise in interest rates will negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. In the event of a decrease in interest rates, the impacts on net interest income would be opposite to those described above.\n\n## Total Exposure:\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the net interest income sensitivity in local currency for the banking book instruments, entered for other than trading purposes with positive parallel shifts of 50 basis points was COP 180,399. The change in the net interest income sensitivity between 2020 and 2019 is due to the increase in the sensitivity of float loans and the decreace in the sensitivity of float time deposit.\n\nOn the other hand, the net interest income sensitivity in foreign currency, assuming the same parallel shift of 50 basis points, was USD 5,285 at December 31, 2020, compared with USD 1,315 at December 31, 2019. The increase in net interest income sensitivity due to interest rate risk between 2020 and 2019 occurred due to the reduction in the sensitivity of float borrowings from other financial institutions.\n\n## Assumptions and limitations:\n\nNet interest income sensitivity analysis is based on the repricing model and considers the following key assumptions: (a) does not consider prepayments, new operations, defaults,  etc.,  (b);  the  fixed  rate  instruments  sensitivity,  includes  the amounts with maturity lower than one year and assumes these will be disbursed at market interest rates and (c) changes in interest rate occur immediately and parallel in the yield curves from assets and liabilities for different maturities.\n\n## \u00b7 Structural equity risk exposure (Banking Book)\n\nBancolombia's investment banking affiliate, in its role of financial corporation, holds, directly and through its affiliated companies, structural equity investments. These positions are maintained mostly in the industrial and financial sectors. The market value of those investments increased by 5% during the year, from COP 38,428 million as of December 31 st, 2019 to COP 40,502 million as of December 31 st, 2020, as a result mainly driven by the increase in the market value of the investments in Enka Shares.\n\nThe structural equity positions are exposed to equity price risk. Sensitivity calculations are made for those positions:",

Thus, funding liquidity risk is the risk that a firm will not be able to meet its current and future cash flow and collateral  needs,  both  expected  and  unexpected,  without  materially  affecting  its  daily  operations  or  overall  financial condition. The Bank is sensitive to funding liquidity risk since debt maturity transformation is one of its key business areas.\n\nAt the Bank, liquidity prevails over any objective of growth or revenue. Managing liquidity has always been a fundamental pillar of its business strategy, together with capital, in supporting its statement of financial position.\n\nThe Bank's liquidity management model promotes the autonomy of subsidiaries, which must be self-sufficient in their structural funding. Each subsidiary is responsible for meeting the liquidity needs of its current and future activity, within a framework of management coordination at the Bank level. The metrics used to control liquidity risk are developed based on common and homogeneous concepts, but analysis and adaptation are made by each subsidiary.\n\nIn line with best governance practices, the Bank has established a clear division of function between executing liquidity management, responsibility of the Asset and Liability Division, and their monitoring and control, responsibility of the Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office.\n\nThe different  authorities  of  senior  management  define  the  policies  and  guidelines  for  managing  liquidity  risk.  These authorities are the Board of Directors, the Risk Committee, and senior management of the Parent Company, which set the risk appetite and define the financial strategy. The ALCO committees (asset and liability committee) define the objective positioning of liquidity and the strategies that ensure the funding needs derived from businesses. The ALM division (Asset and liability management) and the Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office support the mentioned committees, which elaborate analysis and management proposals, and control compliance with the limits established.\n\nLiquidity Risks Management Office is responsible for proposing the minimum amount of the liquidity reserve, the policies of the liquidity portfolio, defining premises and metrics in order to model the behaviour of the cash flows, proposing and",

All of the above activities are verified and evaluated by the Internal Audit.\n\nThe measures to control liquidity risk include maintaining a portfolio of highly liquid assets, and the definition of triggers and liquidity limits, which enable evaluating the level of exposure of each one of the entities in a proactive way.\n\nThe methodologies used to control liquidity risk include the liquidity gaps and stress scenarios. The liquidity gaps measure the mismatches of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet position's cash flows, separately for local currency and foreign currency. Regulatory metrics are also applied, in which the contractual maturities are used; and internal models in which the cash flows are adjusted by different ratios, to reflect a more accurate behaviour.\n\nPeriodically, a validation of the policies, limits, processes, methodologies and tools to evaluate liquidity risk exposure is performed, in order to establish its pertinence and functionality, and to carry out the necessary adjustments. The Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office elaborate reports daily, weekly and monthly basis in order to monitor the exposure levels and the limits and triggers set up, and to support the decision-making process.\n\nEach subsidiary has its own liquidity contingency plan, which is tested annually. These contingency plans procure the optimization of different funding sources, including obtaining additional funding from the Parent Company.\n\n## Effects of Covid-19\n\nGiven the client's preference for liquidity due to the uncertainty generated by the Covid-19 pandemic, an increase in deposits was observed, increasing the liquid assets of Grupo Bancolombia. The risk premium of Grupo Bancolombia did not present adverse movements and access to financial markets allowed the issuance of bonds for USD 400 millions in Banistmo, for corporate purposes such as working capital, funding the growth of the loan portfolio, offering new products and services, and debt settlement.\n\nThe following is the behavior of the liquid assets of Grupo Bancolombia during 2020:\n\n| Liquid Assets (1)              | Low        | High       | Average    | December  2020                         |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|----------------------------------------|\n| High quality liquid assets*    |            |            |            |                                        |\n| Cash                           | 18,356,375 | 23,075,497 | 20,662,818 | 18,356,375                             |\n| High quality liquid securities | 11,208,617 | 16,846,251 | 15,374,136 | 16,729,107                             |\n| Other Liquid Assets            |            |            |            |                                        |\n| Other securities**             | 2,583,872  | 2,937,580  | 2,717,180  | 2,672,337                              |\n| Total Liquid Assets            | 36,867,986 |            |            | 41,914,085    38,754,134    37,757,819 |\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Bank's Board of Directors sets the strategy for managing liquidity risk and delegates responsibility for oversight of the implementation of this policy to ALCO committee that approves the Bank's liquidity policies and procedures. The Treasury Division manages the Bank's liquidity position on a day-to-day basis and reviews daily reports covering the liquidity position. A summary report, including any exceptions and remedial action taken, is submitted regularly to Risk Committee and ALCO committees.",

Liquid Assets\n\nOne of the main guidelines of the Bank is to maintain a solid liquidity position, therefore, the ALCO Committee, has established a minimum level of liquid assets, based on the funding needs of each subsidiary, to ensure, as far as possible, that  it  will  always  have  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  its  liabilities  when  they  are  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Bank's reputation.\n\nThe following table shows the liquid assets held by Bank's:\n\n| Liquid Assets (1)              |            | December 31, 2020    December 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|\n| High quality liquid assets*    |            |                                          |\n| Cash                           | 18,356,375 | 16,594,906                               |\n| High quality liquid securities | 16,729,107 | 12,054,474                               |\n| Other Liquid Assets            |            |                                          |\n| Other securities**             | 2,672,337  | 1,982,308                                |\n| Total Liquid Assets            | 37,757,819 | 30,631,688                               |",
