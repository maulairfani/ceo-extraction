Five out of the 10 independent director nominees standing for this year's election have joined our Board within the past four years. In recruiting directors, we focus on how the experience and skill set of each individual complements those of their fellow directors to create a balanced board with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds, deep expertise, and strong leadership experience.\n\n## Shareholder outreach and engagement\n\nShareholder engagement is fundamental to our commitment to good governance and essential to maintaining our strong corporate governance practices. We engage regularly with our global investors to gain valuable insights into the governance issues about which they care most. We aim to seek a collaborative and mutually beneficial approach to issues of importance to investors that affect our business, and to ensure that our corporate governance practices remain industry-leading from their perspectives.\n\nDuring 2019, members of senior management met with a cross-section of shareholders owning approximately 29 percent of our outstanding shares or approximately 42 percent of our institutional shareholders. The meetings included an overview of the Company and a discussion of the Company's practices on corporate governance, including board refreshment and diversity, director evaluation, directors' skills matrix, board leadership structure, as well as on strategic priorities, capital allocation and structure, environmental and social matters, sustainability, and company culture. In general, investors viewed the Company's governance practices favorably, including the Board chairman transition, the mix of tenure and overall diversity, and the disclosure regarding the Directors' skill sets and qualifications. The feedback from these meetings was shared with the Board of Directors and helped inform the Board on corporate governance practices and trends.\n\n## PROPOSAL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2020\n\n- \u00b7 Ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 3M's independent registered public accounting firm for 2020.\n- \u00b7 Based on its assessment of the qualifications and performance of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ('PwC'), the Audit Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to retain PwC.\n\n## Executive compensation\n\n## PROPOSAL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation\n\n- \u00b7 Approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers.\n- \u00b7 Our executive compensation program appropriately aligns our executives' compensation with the performance of the Company and its business units as well as their individual performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 46\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 50\n\n<!-- image -->",

If any nominee is not able to serve, proxies will be voted in favor of the remainder of those nominated and may be voted for substitute nominees, unless the Board chooses to reduce the number of directors serving on the Board. Each nominee elected as a director will continue in office until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or retirement. Edward M. Liddy is no longer eligible to stand for re-election as he has reached the mandatory retirement age. We thank Mr. Liddy for his many contributions to the Board and to the Company.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee reviewed the Board Membership Criteria (described on page 19) and the specific experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills of each nominee, including membership(s) on the boards of directors of other public companies. The following pages contain biographical and other information about the nominees. Following each nominee's biographical information, we have provided information concerning the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills that are deemed most critical to 3M's long-term success and led the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board to determine that each nominee should serve as a director. In addition, the majority of our directors serve or have served on boards and board committees (including as committee chairs) of other public companies, which the Board believes provides them with additional board leadership and governance experience, exposure to best practices, and substantial knowledge and skills that further enhance the functioning of our Board.",

The Board of Directors regards diversity as an important factor in selecting board nominees to serve on the Board.

The current composition of our Board reflects those ongoing efforts and the continued importance of diversity to the Board.",

The Committee and the Chairman of the Board interview candidates that meet the Board Membership Criteria, and the Committee selects nominees that best suit the Board's current needs and recommends them to the Board. The Board reviews such recommendations and determines submissions for election at the next shareholder meeting of the Company in which directors will be elected or filling any vacancies on the Board. The Committee also focuses on overall Board-level succession planning at the director level, periodically reviews the appropriate size and composition of the Board and anticipates future vacancies and needs of the Board. In the event the Committee recommends an increase in the size of the Board or a vacancy occurs, the Committee considers qualified nominees from several sources, including current Board members and nominees recommended by shareholders and other persons.\n\nThe Committee may from time to time retain a director search firm to help the Committee identify qualified director nominees for consideration by the Committee. In 2019, the Committee retained Russell Reynolds to help identify future Board candidates.\n\n## Director independence\n\nThe Board has adopted a formal set of Director Independence Guidelines with respect to the determination of director independence, which either conform to or are more exacting than the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE') listing standards, and the full text of which is available on our website at www.3M.com , under Investor Relations - Governance. In accordance with these Guidelines, a director or nominee for director must be determined to have no material relationship with the Company other than as a director. The Guidelines specify the criteria by which the independence of our directors will be determined, including strict guidelines for directors and their immediate family members with respect to past employment or affiliation with the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm. The Guidelines also prohibit Audit and Compensation Committee members from having any direct or indirect financial relationship with the Company, and restrict both commercial and not-for-profit relationships of all directors with the Company. Directors may not be given personal loans or extensions of credit by the Company, and all directors are required to deal at arm's length with the Company and its subsidiaries, and to disclose any circumstance that might be perceived as a conflict of interest.\n\nIn accordance with these Guidelines, the Board undertook its annual review of director independence. During this review, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each director, or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in each of the most recent three completed fiscal years. The Board also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between the Company and a director or any members of a director's immediate family (or any entity of which a director or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner, or significant equity holder). The Board considered that in the ordinary course of business, transactions may occur between the Company and its subsidiaries and companies at which some of our directors are or have been officers. In particular, the Board considered the annual amount of sales to 3M for each of the most recent three completed fiscal years by each of the companies where directors serve or have served as an executive officer, as well as purchases by those companies from 3M. The Board determined that the amount of sales and purchases in each fiscal year was below one percent of the annual revenues of each of those companies, the threshold set forth in the Director Independence Guidelines. The Board also considered charitable contributions to notfor-profit organizations with which our directors or immediate family members are affiliated, none of which approached the threshold set forth in our Director Independence Guidelines.",

The Board has also determined that members of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee received no compensation from the Company other than for service as a director. Michael F. Roman, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, is considered to not be independent because of his employment by the Company.\n\n## Nominees proposed by shareholders\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee has a policy to consider properly submitted shareholder recommendations for candidates for membership on the Board of Directors. Shareholders proposing individuals for consideration by the Committee must include at least the following information about the proposed nominee: the proposed nominee's name, age, business or residence address, principal occupation or employment, and whether such person has given written consent to being named in the Proxy Statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected. Shareholders should send the required information about the proposed nominee to:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate Secretary 3M Company 3M Center Building 220-13E-26A St. Paul, MN 55144-1000\n\nFor an individual proposed by a shareholder to be considered by the Committee for recommendation as a Board nominee for the 2021 Annual Meeting, the Corporate Secretary must receive the proposal by November 25, 2020. Such proposals must be sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the shareholder to determine when the proposal was received by the Company). The Corporate Secretary will refer properly submitted shareholder proposed nominations to the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee for consideration at a future Committee meeting. Individuals proposed by shareholders in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration received by individuals identified to the Committee through other means.\n\n## Shareholder nominations - Advance notice bylaw\n\nIn addition, 3M's Bylaws permit shareholders to nominate directors at an annual meeting of shareholders or at a special meeting at which directors are to be elected in accordance with the notice of meeting. Shareholders intending to nominate a person for election as a director must comply with the requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws. With respect to nominations to be acted upon at our 2021 Annual Meeting, our Bylaws would require, among other things, that the Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the record shareholder no earlier than November 25, 2020, and no later than December 25, 2020. The notice must contain the information required by the Bylaws, a copy of which is available on our website at www.3M.com , under Investor Relations - Governance. Nominations received after December 25, 2020, will not be acted upon at the 2021 Annual Meeting.\n\n## Proxy access nominations\n\nFurther, pursuant to the proxy access Bylaw adopted by the Board in November 2015, a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, continuously owning for three years at least three percent of our outstanding common shares may nominate and include in our proxy materials up to the greater of two directors and 20 percent of the number of directors currently serving, if the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the Bylaw requirements. For eligible shareholders to include in our proxy materials nominees for the 2021 Annual Meeting, proxy access nomination notices must be received by the Company no earlier than November 25, 2020, and no later than December 25, 2020. The notice must contain the information required by the Bylaws.",

It is aspirational and authentic to 3M, and is an important part of the purpose that drives us as an enterprise.\n\n## Our strengths\n\nOur strengths help us continually innovate to create differentiated value for customers at above-market growth rates. They also enable us to take advantages of the changes in customers, technology and commercial channels.\n\nIn our Customer Inspired Innovation approach, we combine close engagement with customers, deep domain expertise in markets and the science behind our technology platforms to develop unique insights into the critical needs of our customers.\n\nWe then leverage our fundamental strengths. In technology, we leverage our deep intellectual property and broad range of technology platforms. In manufacturing, we leverage our unique capabilities in process engineering. Our global capabilities enable us to take that technology and manufacturing strength and deliver through our go-to-market models to serve customers around the world. And finally, our brand adds value in each of our businesses.\n\nWe do this while maintaining a focus on our customers - the end users of our solutions. Most of our sales are specified or designed into customer applications. While the channel to our end user may change over time, our global commerce strategy is to connect directly with end users while leveraging the go-to-market model that will deliver where, when and how the end user wants.\n\n## Our priorities\n\nWe have four priorities that are positioning us for long-term growth and value creation: Portfolio, Transformation, Innovation, and People & Culture. The first three are levers that have been proven to create extraordinary value over time. They form the foundation of our priorities moving forward. They depend on our efforts to advance people and culture. Our focus on advancing people and culture supports the entire value model.\n\n## New phase of our transformation journey\n\nOn our journey of transformation - one of our strategic priorities - we have taken concrete actions to streamline and improve our operations, including the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and the April 2019 move from five to four business groups. Enabled by the success of these initiatives, we are now entering a new phase of our transformation journey by implementing, at the beginning of 2020, a new global operating model to further align our four business groups - Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer - with the company's customers and go-to-market models. In this new model, 3M's business groups now have full responsibility for all facets of strategy, portfolio optimization and resource prioritization across their entire global operations. We continue to transform how we operate and build a more streamlined and customerdriven organization for the future. This latest phase of our transformation journey is designed to improve growth and operational efficiency, and will enable us to create even more value for our customers and shareholders.\n\n## Our values\n\nOur values bind us together as one 3M - across business groups and geographies. They include our leadership behaviors - how we want our leaders to act to drive performance, develop others, and continue to win in the marketplace. Then our Code of Conduct; great companies are built on trust from customers, shareholders, employees, communities. We've earned that trust and our reputation for integrity over many decades. No one at 3M is free to compromise it. We also have four values that will be a priority moving forward. We are working to make 3M the most inclusive enterprise we can be. This will help us become even more diverse and enable us to become an even more creative and innovative company. We have long been a leader in sustainability and we will continue to advance this across the company. Finally, we will do even more to encourage and challenge every 3M employee to be their best.",

At least annually, the Board reviews enterprise risks facing the Company and certain of its businesses. Other important categories of risk are assigned to designated Board committees (which are comprised solely of independent directors) that report back to the full Board. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee through its charter the primary responsibility for the oversight of risks facing the Company, including cybersecurity. The Audit Committee's charter provides that the Audit Committee shall 'discuss policies and procedures with respect to risk assessment and risk management, the Company's major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate such exposures.'\n\nThe Vice President and General Auditor, Corporate Auditing (the 'Auditor'), whose appointment and performance is reviewed and evaluated by the Audit Committee and who has direct reporting obligations to the Committee, is responsible for leading the formal risk assessment and management process within the Company. The Auditor, through consultation with the Company's senior management, periodically assesses the major risks facing the Company and works with those executives responsible for managing each specific risk. The Auditor periodically reviews with the Audit Committee the major risks facing the Company and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate those risks. The Auditor's risk management report, which is provided in advance of the meeting, is reviewed with the entire Board by either the chair of the Audit Committee or the Auditor. The executive responsible for managing a particular risk may also report to the full Board on how the risk is being managed and mitigated. With the establishment of the new Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee and the sunsetting of the Finance Committee in November 2019, the Audit Committee has assumed from the Finance Committee the oversight responsibilities over risks associated with the Company's capital structure, credit ratings and cost of capital, long-term benefit obligations, and use of or investment in financial products, such as derivatives to manage risk related to foreign currencies, commodities, and interest rates.\n\nThe Board has delegated to other committees the oversight of risks within their areas of responsibility and expertise. For example, the Compensation Committee oversees risks associated with the Company's compensation practices, including by performing an annual review of the Company's risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices for its employees. The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees risks associated with the Company's overall governance and its succession planning process to ensure that the Company has a slate of future, qualified candidates for key management positions. The Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee oversees risks associated with the Company's environmental and product stewardship efforts, including environmental, health and safety (EHS) legal and regulatory compliance, as well as significant emerging science and technology, disruptive innovations, materials vulnerability, and geopolitical issues that my impact the company's overall strategy, global business continuity and financial results.\n\nThe Board believes that its oversight of risks, primarily through delegation to the Audit Committee, but also through delegation to other committees to oversee specific risks within their areas of responsibility and expertise, and the sharing of information with the full Board, is appropriate for a diversified technology and manufacturing company like 3M. The chair of each committee that oversees risk provides a summary of the matters discussed with the committee to the full Board following each committee meeting. The minutes of each committee meeting are also provided to all Board members. The Board also believes its oversight of risk is enhanced by its current leadership structure (further discussed below) because the CEO, who is ultimately responsible for the Company's management of risk, also chairs regular Board meetings. Given his in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, the CEO is best able to bring key business issues and risks to the Board's attention.\n\n## Management succession planning\n\nThe Board plans the succession to the position of Chairman, CEO and other senior management positions. To assist the Board, the Chairman, CEO and Senior Vice President of Human Resources annually assess senior managers and their succession potential for the position of Chairman/CEO and other senior management positions. As a result of a thorough and thoughtful succession planning process, in February 2019, Inge G. Thulin, Executive Chairman of the Board, announced his intention not to stand for reelection at the 2019 Annual Shareholder Meeting. The Board nominated Michael F. Roman, CEO and a Board member, to serve as Chairman of the Board, effective May 14, 2019, following his election as a director by shareholders at the 2019 Annual Shareholder Meeting.",

Shareholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Lead Director, the chairs of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Science, Technology & Sustainability Committees of the Board, or with any of our other independent directors, or all of them as a group, by sending a letter to the following address: Corporate Secretary, 3M Company, 3M Center, Building 220-13E-26A, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000. The Corporate Secretary reviews communications to the independent directors and forwards those communications to the independent directors as discussed below. Communications involving substantive accounting or auditing matters will be immediately forwarded to the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Company's Chief Compliance Officer consistent with time frames established by the Audit Committee for the receipt of communications dealing with these matters. Communications that pertain to non-financial matters will be forwarded promptly. Items that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board will not be forwarded, such as: business solicitation or advertisements; product-related inquiries; mass mailings; resumes or other job-related inquiries; and unsolicited commercial emails.\n\n## Compliance\n\n## 3M's codes of conduct\n\nMore than a century of operating with uncompromising integrity has earned 3M trust from our customers, credibility with our communities, and dedication from our employees. All of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, are required to abide by 3M's Code of Conduct to ensure that our business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner. The Code forms the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with corporate policies and procedures and a Company-wide focus on uncompromising integrity in every aspect of our operations. Our Code of Conduct covers many topics, including antitrust and competition law, conflicts of interest, financial reporting, protection of confidential information, and compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of our business.\n\nEmployees are required to report any conduct that they believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent violation of the Code of Conduct. The Audit Committee has adopted procedures to receive, retain, and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential and anonymous submission by employees or others of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. Information on how to submit any such communications can be found on 3M's Investor Relations website, under Governance - Governance Documents - Employee Business Conduct Policies - 'Report a concern or ask a question.' Our Chief Compliance Officer, who has direct reporting obligations to the Audit Committee, periodically reports to the Audit Committee on compliance with the Company's Code of Conduct, including the effectiveness of the Company's compliance program.\n\nThe Board also has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors of the Company. This Code incorporates long-standing principles of conduct the Company and the Board follow to ensure the Company's business and the activities of the Board are conducted with integrity and adherence to the highest ethical standards, and in compliance with the law. The Company's Code of Conduct for employees and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors are available on our website at www.3M.com under Investor Relations - Governance - Governance Documents.\n\n## Public policy engagement\n\nThe Company believes that transparency with respect to the consideration, processes, and oversight of our engagement with lawmakers is important to our shareholders, and continuously makes efforts to give our shareholders useful information about our public policy engagement. Since 2007, the Company has voluntarily published a detailed explanation of the Company's political activities which is available on our website at www.3M.com under Investor Relations - Governance - Governance Documents - 'Political Activities and Issue Advocacy.' There, the Company sets out in detail its positions on important public policy issues, the factors we consider when making political contributions, and the processes we use for legal, financial, executive, and Board oversight of our political activities and contributions. We also provide links to the reports the 3M Political Action Committee files monthly with the",

The Company believes that these disclosures on our website, which exceed the disclosures required by law, offer transparency respecting the Company's public policy engagement and political activities.\n\n## Commitment to sustainability\n\nAt 3M, we are inspired and motivated by Our Vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life. In collaboration with our employees, customers, partners, government and communities, we apply our expertise and technology to help solve shared global challenges. Sustainability is at the heart of our company. It anchors our purpose-driven innovation in products, manufacturing processes and new technologies-and we're always trying to do more. It is our ambition to meet the increasing expectations of our customers, employees, investors, and stakeholders-and grow our business-by continuing to make bold sustainability commitments and taking stronger actions.\n\n3M has a long-standing commitment to sustainability, from our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program that began in 1975 to our increasingly ambitious set of 2025 Sustainability Goals, which are designed to improve the footprint of our own operations, help our customers meet their own sustainability goals and drive action on global environmental and social issues. We report on these efforts annually in our Sustainability Report. As a global corporation, contributing to society through diverse markets, we believe that we have a significant responsibility to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals across the world. We are also a participant of the United Nations Global Compact, a policy initiative for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to ten principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. We align our Sustainability Report to the guidelines of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations for helping businesses disclose climate-related financial information. Together with our ambition of improving every life and our strong set of 3M values, these commitments drive and inform our formalized approach to sustainability-the 3M Strategic Sustainability Framework. Announced by CEO Mike Roman on Investor Day in November 2018, the Framework directs our efforts to areas where we can make the greatest impact: Science for Circular, Science for Climate, and Science for Community.\n\nTo advance Science for Circular, we design solutions that do more with less material to advance a global circular economy. To help accomplish this, in December 2018, at the United Nations Climate Conference (COP24), CTO John Banovetz announced 3M's Sustainability Value Commitment-requiring all new products entering 3M's new product commercialization process to demonstrate how they drive impact for the greater good. This commitment builds on 3M's history of creating more sustainable products and collaborating with our customers to help them reach their own sustainability goals. Additional initiatives to drive circularity include moving more than 30 percent of our manufacturing sites to zero waste to landfill status, membership in the Ellen MacArthur Foundation CE100 and establishing Circular Economy Working Groups to increase use of renewable and recycled materials. We've also announced significant product innovations, like 3M's iconic yellow and green Scotch-Brite \u00ae Heavy Duty scrub sponge with scrubbing fibers made from 100 percent recycled content and 3M\u2122 Thinsulate\u2122 100% Recycled Featherless Insulation that mimics the warmth and performance of down through tiny fibers made from post-consumer recycled plastic.\n\nTo advance Science for Climate, we are innovating to decarbonize industry, accelerating global climate solutions and improving 3M's environmental footprint. We believe that climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face as a society and now is the time to lead and take action-for our climate, and our communities. Since 2002, we've achieved a 63.7 percent reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 location-based greenhouse gas emissions and have helped our customers avoid emitting over 41 million metric tons CO2 through use of select 3M product platforms in the last three years alone. In 2019, we developed methodologies around Scope 3 Categories 9-12, providing a holistic map of relevant categories for 3M and identifying new opportunities to reduce emissions. We also advanced efforts to better understand our climate risks and are incorporating this analysis into business strategies and actions. In February 2019, CEO Mike Roman committed to moving our entire global operations to 100 percent renewable electricity and increased our interim target to 50 percent by 2025, having already achieved the prior goal of 25 percent. On March 1, 2019, 3M flipped the switch to 100 percent renewable sources of energy at our global headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota. From a product perspective, our portfolio of window films retain heat in the winter and cool air in the summer, resulting in",

Our innovative 3M\u2122 Smog-reducing Granules and 3M\u2122 Cool Roofing Granules are helping resident and commercial property owners address poor air quality and the urban heat island effect by turning pollution in contact with roofs into water-soluble ions that wash away and reflect sunlight.\n\nTo advance Science for Community, we aim to create a more positive world through science, and inspire people to join us. This begins with 3M's culture, which is rooted in a community of scientists who are driven to create positive impact. We deliver through a variety of products, solutions and services across 3M's 51 technology platforms and core business groups-Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care and Consumer. Examples include the Fluency Direct\u2122 speech recognition system from M*Modal, which increases physician productivity while capturing a more complete, informative patient narrative; School Zone Safety programs that engage key stakeholders in improving the routes children take to school; and personal safety equipment, such as the 3M 8210 (N95) and 3M 8511 (N95) respirators, which can save lives when disaster strikes. To give our employees the space and freedom to innovate these solutions, we have a program that encourages them to spend 15 percent of their working time on projects of their own choosing. In addition to maintaining and expanding its diverse and inclusive work environment, 3M strives to help employees grow in their career. In December 2019, 3M unveiled a new 2025 Sustainability Goal and committed to providing 300,000 work hours of service across the globe through the expansion of 3M Impact, our skills-based employee volunteer program. This program joins existing philanthropic and social programs that support the workforce of the future-both in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines, as well as the skilled trades. It is this unique innovation culture, ambition for improving every life and dedicated scientific community that allows 3M to advance the greater good.\n\nOur continued work across the Strategic Sustainability Framework helps advance 3M's progress toward our 2025 Sustainability Goals, which is reported on in our annual Sustainability Report. Sustainability at 3M is also guided by our Innovation Steering Committee which includes our CEO, CTO and General Counsel. The Committee provides leadership, oversight and strategy to encourage and ensure sustainability opportunities are recognized, and strong policies and procedures are in place. In November 2019, the 3M Board of Directors established a new board-level committee to provide general oversight of the significant scientific and technological aspects of 3M Company's businesses and the Company's sustainability and stewardship activities: The Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee. The Committee will review the company's sustainability policies and programs, identifying and analyzing significant sustainability, materials vulnerability and geopolitical issues that may impact our overall business strategy, global business continuity and financial results.\n\nTo learn more, please visit www.3M.com/Sustainability .\n\n## Related person transaction policy and procedures\n\nThe Board of Directors has adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy and Procedures which is administered by the Nominating and Governance Committee. This Policy applies to any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a Related Person (as that term is defined in the Policy) has a direct or indirect material interest and which is required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Transactions that fall within this definition are referred to the Committee for approval, ratification, or other action. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Committee decides whether or not to approve a transaction and approves only those transactions that are in the best interests of the Company. In the course of its review and approval or ratification of a transaction, the Committee considers:\n\n- \u00b7 The nature of the Related Person's interest in the transaction;\n- \u00b7 The material terms of the transaction, including whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances;\n- \u00b7 The significance of the transaction to the Related Person;\n- \u00b7 The significance of the transaction to the Company;\n- \u00b7 Whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in the best interest of the Company; and\n- \u00b7 Any other matters the Committee deems appropriate.",

There were no Related Person Transactions that were referred to the Committee in 2019.\n\n## Policy on adoption of a rights plan\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, a 3M shareholder submitted a shareholder proposal to 3M regarding the approval process for adopting a shareholders' rights plan (also known as a 'poison pill'). 3M does not have a rights plan and is not currently considering adopting one. The Board continues to believe, however, that there may be circumstances under which adoption of a rights plan would give the Board the negotiating power and leverage necessary to obtain the best result for 3M shareholders in the context of a takeover effort.\n\nFollowing consideration of the favorable vote the shareholder proposal received and in light of this belief, the Board adopted and has reaffirmed a statement of policy on this topic. The Board's policy is that it will only adopt a rights plan if either: (1) shareholders have approved adoption of the rights plan; or (2) the Board (including a majority of the independent members of the Board), in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, makes a determination that, under the circumstances existing at the time, it is in the best interests of 3M's shareholders to adopt a rights plan without the delay in adoption resulting from seeking shareholder approval.\n\nThe Board has directed the Nominating and Governance Committee to review this policy statement on an annual basis and to report to the Board on any recommendations it may have concerning the policy. The terms of the policy, as in effect, are included in 3M's published Corporate Governance Guidelines and its Proxy Statement.\n\n## Board structure and processes\n\n## Board's leadership structure\n\nFollowing his election to directorship at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 14, 2019, CEO Michael Roman was nominated and elected to serve as Chairman of the Board.\n\nThe Board's current leadership structure is characterized by:\n\n- \u00b7 A combined Chairman of the Board and CEO;\n- \u00b7 A strong, independent, and highly experienced Lead Director with well-defined responsibilities that support the Board's oversight responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 A robust committee structure consisting entirely of independent directors with oversight of various types of risks; and\n- \u00b7 An engaged and independent Board.\n\nThe Board of Directors believes that this leadership structure provides independent board leadership and engagement while deriving the benefits of having our CEO also serve as Chairman of the Board. As the individual with primary responsibility for managing the Company's day-to-day operations and with in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, the CEO is best positioned to chair regular Board meetings as the directors discuss key business and strategic issues. Coupled with an independent Lead Director, this combined structure provides independent oversight while avoiding unnecessary confusion regarding the Board's oversight responsibilities and the day-to-day management of business operations.\n\nThe Board believes that adopting a rigid policy on whether to separate or combine the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO would inhibit the Board's ability to provide for a leadership structure that would best serve shareholders. As a result, the Board has rejected adopting a policy permanently separating or combining the positions of Chairman and CEO in its Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are reviewed at least annually and available on our website at www.3M.com , under Investor Relations - Governance. Instead, the Board adopted an approach that allows it, in representing the shareholders' best interests, to decide who should serve as Chairman or CEO, or both, under present or anticipated future circumstances.",

The Board believes that to drive change and continuous improvement within the Company, tempered by respect for 3M's traditions and values, the CEO must have maximum authority. The CEO is primarily responsible for effectively leading significant change, improving operational efficiency, driving growth, managing the Company's day-to-day business, managing the various risks facing the Company, and reinforcing the expectation for all employees of continuing to build on 3M's century-old tradition of uncompromising integrity and doing business the right way.\n\nThe Board believes that the Company's corporate governance measures ensure that strong, independent directors continue to effectively oversee the Company's management and key issues related to executive compensation, CEO evaluation and succession planning, strategy, risk, and integrity. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide, in part, that:\n\n- \u00b7 Independent directors comprise a substantial majority of the Board;\n- \u00b7 Directors are elected annually by a majority vote in uncontested director elections;\n- \u00b7 Only independent directors serve on the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Science, Technology & Sustainability Committees;\n- \u00b7 The committee chairs establish their respective agendas;\n- \u00b7 The Board and committees may retain their own advisors;\n- \u00b7 The independent directors have complete access to management and employees;\n- \u00b7 The independent directors meet in executive session without the CEO or other employees during each regular Board meeting; and\n- \u00b7 The Board and each committee regularly conduct a self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees function effectively.\n\nThe Board has also designated one of its members to serve as Lead Director, with responsibilities (described in the next section) that are similar to those typically performed by an independent chairman.\n\n## Independent lead director\n\nThe Board has designated one of its members to serve as a Lead Director, with responsibilities that are similar to those typically performed by an independent chairman ('Lead Director'). Michael L. Eskew was appointed Lead Director by the independent directors effective November 12, 2012, succeeding Dr. Vance Coffman who had served as Lead Director since 2006. Michael Eskew is a highly experienced director, currently serving on the boards of The Allstate Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, and International Business Machines Corporation, and is the former Chairman and CEO of United Parcel Service, Inc. His responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors;\n- \u00b7 Acts as a key liaison between the Chairman/CEO and the independent directors;\n- \u00b7 Approves the meeting agendas for the Board, and approves the meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;\n- \u00b7 Has the authority to approve the materials to be delivered to the directors in advance of each Board meeting and provides feedback regarding the quality, quantity, and timeliness of those materials (this duty not only gives the Lead Director approval authority with respect to materials to be delivered to the directors in advance of each Board meeting but also provides a feedback mechanism so that the materials may be improved for future meetings);\n- \u00b7 Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors;\n- \u00b7 Communicates Board member feedback to the Chairman/CEO (except that the chair of the Compensation Committee leads the discussion of the Chairman/CEO's performance and communicates the Board's evaluation of that performance to the Chairman/CEO);\n- \u00b7 If requested by major shareholders, ensures that he is available, when appropriate, for consultation and direct communication; and\n- \u00b7 Performs such other duties as requested by the independent directors.",

The Lead Director presides over the Board's executive sessions.\n\n## Board committees\n\n## Board, committees, and director evaluations\n\nThe Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively and consider opportunities for continual enhancement. The Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee solicits and receives comments from all directors and shares those comments with the Committee and the Board. Based on the comments and further discussion and reflection, the Board makes an assessment reviewing areas in which the Board believes improvements could be made to increase the effectiveness of the Board and its committees as well as identifying existing practices which have contributed to high effectiveness and accordingly should be continued. Self-evaluation items requiring follow-up and/or the development and execution of implementation and action plans are monitored on a going-forward basis by the full Board, as well as by individual committees and the chairs thereof, as applicable. While this formal self-evaluation is conducted on an annual basis, directors share perspectives, feedback, and suggestions year-round. The Board and each committee conducted an evaluation of its performance in 2019.\n\nBefore the November Board meeting, the Chairman/CEO, Lead Director, and chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee meet to discuss the performance and contributions of each director. As part of the nomination process, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the performance and contributions of each director and evaluates each of the directors to ensure our directors continue to possess the necessary skills and experience to effectively oversee the Company. On occasion, the Nominating and Governance Committee has not renominated a director based on this individual director evaluation process.\n\n## Board and committee information\n\nThe Board currently has twelve directors and the following four committees: Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Science, Technology & Sustainability. The Board had a Finance Committee until November 12, 2019, when the Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee was established. The membership and the function of each committee, both before and after the November committee structural update, are described below.\n\nDuring 2019, the Board of Directors held five regularly scheduled meetings and three telephonic meetings. Overall attendance at Board and committee meetings was 96 percent. During 2019, all of our directors attended at least 75 percent of all Board and Committee meetings on which they served.\n\nThe Company has a long-standing policy that directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders unless extenuating circumstances prevent them from attending. All directors who were members of the Board as of May 2019 attended last year's Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Sondra Barbour was not present at the meeting as she did not seek re-election and ended her service on the Board on May 14, 2019, when her term expired.",

The Committee is responsible for providing the general oversight of the significant scientific and technological aspects of 3M's businesses and the Company's sustainability and stewardship activities.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7 Monitors and reviews the overall strategy, direction and effectiveness of the Company's research and development activities;\n- \u00b7 Reviews management's strategy and allocation of resources for research and development activities, including product line extensions and new product platforms;\n- \u00b7 Reviews the Company's policies and programs on sustainability; environmental and product stewardship; and environmental, health and safety, including for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 Assists the Board in identifying and analyzing significant emerging science and technology, disruptive innovations, sustainability, materials vulnerability, and geopolitical issues that may impact the Company's overall business strategy, global business continuity and financial results; and\n- \u00b7 Annually reviews the Company's Sustainability Report.\n\nCommittee Charters\n\n## Director compensation and stock ownership guidelines\n\n## Director compensation philosophy and elements\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee periodically receives reports on the status of Board compensation in relation to other large U.S. companies and is responsible for recommending to the Board changes in compensation for non-employee directors. In developing its recommendations, the Committee is guided by the following goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Compensation should fairly pay directors for work required in a company of 3M's size and scope;\n- \u00b7 A significant portion of the total compensation should be paid in common stock to align directors' interests with the long-term interests of shareholders; and\n- \u00b7 The structure of the compensation should be simple and transparent.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee works with an independent compensation consultant to support its objectives of maintaining a reasonable and appropriate program. For 2019, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ('FW Cook') provided the Committee with expert advice on the compensation of non-employee directors, in addition to analyzing market data on director compensation at the same peer group of 17 companies approved by the Compensation Committee for evaluating Named Executive Officer compensation. Neither the Company nor the Nominating and Governance Committee has any arrangement with any other compensation consultant who has a role in determining or recommending the amount or form of director compensation.",

        "page_content": "Our director program is comprised of a mix of cash and equity that is intended to approximate the peer-group median mix. Our directors' overall target total direct compensation is consistent with 3M's size and market-capitalization value relative to its peers. In addition, our hold-until-termination requirement on the annual stock retainer is rigorous relative to the holding requirement of our peers. For more information on the peer group, please see the section entitled 'Executive peer group' beginning on page 62 of this Proxy Statement. Non-employee directors' compensation includes the following compensation elements:\n\nAnnual Compensation In May 2019, the Nominating and Governance Committee considered a board compensation study prepared by FW Cook. After reviewing that study, the Committee recommended no changes in the compensation for non-employee directors. As a result, the 2019 annual compensation for non-employee directors was $305,000. Approximately 44 percent of the annual compensation (or $135,000) is payable in cash in four quarterly installments and approximately 56 percent of the annual compensation (or $170,000) is payable in 3M common stock equivalents ('Deferred Stock Units') granted after the Annual Meeting (referred to as the 'annual stock retainer'). In addition, the Lead Director receives an annual fee of $35,000, the chair of the Audit Committee receives an annual fee of $25,000, and the chairs of the Compensation, Finance (before it was ended), Nominating and Governance, and Science, Technology & Sustainability Committees each receive an annual fee of $20,000. The Lead Director and committee chair fees are payable in cash in four quarterly installments. There are no meeting fees. In lieu of receiving the Deferred Stock Units, a director may elect to receive 3M common shares on a current basis, but such shares must be retained until the director leaves the Board. Similarly, in lieu of cash fees, a director may elect to receive 3M common shares or Deferred Stock Units. Non-employee directors also may elect to defer all or part of their annual compensation until they cease to be members of the Board.\n\nDeferred Stock For each director who receives all or a portion of the annual fees in deferred stock, the Company credits his or her account with a number of Deferred Stock Units equal to the number of shares (including fractional shares) of 3M common stock that otherwise could have been purchased with such fees, as determined using the closing sales price for a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for the last trading day immediately preceding the earliest date such amount otherwise could have been be paid to the director if taken on a current basis. For each ordinary cash dividend paid on the shares of the Company's common stock, the Company also credits the directors' accounts with an additional number of Deferred Stock Units on the dividend payment date. The number of additional Deferred Stock Units credited to each directors' account is calculated by dividing the aggregate dividends that otherwise would have been paid on the shares underlying the aggregate number of Deferred Stock Units credited to the director's account on the relevant dividend record date by the closing sales price for a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for the last trading day immediately preceding the applicable dividend payment date. The Deferred Stock Units are fully vested upon grant but do not have voting rights. Appropriate adjustments to the number of Deferred Stock Units credited to each director's account will be made for stock splits, stock dividends, mergers, consolidations, payments of dividends other than in cash, and similar circumstances affecting 3M common stock. The shares of 3M common stock underlying the Deferred Stock Units will be distributed in a single lump sum during the month of January in the first year after the director leaves the Board, unless the non-employee director elects an alternative distribution schedule prior to the beginning of the year in which the fees are earned. Non-employee directors may elect to receive distribution of the shares of 3M common stock underlying his or her Deferred Stock Units for a year in a single lump sum during the month of January in the first or second year following the year in which they leave the Board or in a series of three, five, or ten annual installments beginning on the first business day of January in the first year following their termination of Board service.\n\nAll Other Compensation The column below showing 'All Other Compensation' includes the incremental cost of complimentary products and matching gifts. The non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Company's matching gift program on the same terms as 3M employees. Under this program, the 3M Foundation will match up to a total of $5,000 a year in contributions by the director to eligible educational institutions and, effective January 1, 2020, up to a total of $1,000 a year in contributions by the director to eligible charitable organizations.",

We believe that the application of this philosophy has resulted in a non-employee director compensation program that reflects best-in-class design with the following provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Retainer-only cash compensation with no fees for attending meetings that are an expected part of board service.\n- \u00b7 Additional retainers for special roles having greater responsibilities, such as Lead Director and committee chairs, to recognize the incremental additional time and effort required.\n- \u00b7 Equity delivered in the form of current or deferred full-value shares, where annual grants are based on a competitive fixed-value formula and immediate vesting helps avoid director entrenchment.\n- \u00b7 A requirement to retain the stock retainer portion of annual compensation issued on or after October 1, 2007, until termination from Board service, which includes net after-tax shares attributable to current payments and pre-tax shares attributable to deferrals.\n- \u00b7 Flexible voluntary deferral provisions and no material benefits or perquisites.\n- \u00b7 Our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting, includes a $600,000 annual compensation limit on all forms of compensation for non-employee directors.",

PwC has been 3M's Independent Accounting Firm since 1998. Prior to that, 3M's Independent Accounting Firm was Coopers & Lybrand from 1975 until its merger with Price Waterhouse in 1998. In accordance with SEC rules and PwC policy, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide service to our Company. For lead and concurring audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of the Company's lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation policy involves a meeting between the Chair of the Audit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well as discussion by the full Committee and with management.\n\nThe Audit Committee annually reviews PwC's independence and performance in connection with the Audit Committee's determination of whether to retain PwC or engage another firm as our Independent Accounting Firm. In the course of these reviews, the Audit Committee considers, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 PwC's historical and recent performance on the 3M audit, including input from those 3M employees with substantial contact with PwC throughout the year about PwC's quality of service provided, and the independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism demonstrated throughout the engagement by PwC and its audit team;\n- \u00b7 an analysis of PwC's known legal risks and significant proceedings;\n- \u00b7 external data relating to audit quality and performance, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ('PCAOB') reports on PwC and its peer firms;\n- \u00b7 PwC's independence;\n- \u00b7 the appropriateness of PwC's fees, on both an absolute basis and as compared to its peer firms;\n- \u00b7 PwC's tenure as our independent auditor and its familiarity with our global operations and businesses, accounting policies and practices and internal control over financial reporting; and\n- \u00b7 PwC's capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of our global operations, including the Company's phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning system on a worldwide basis over the next several years.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the Audit Committee believes that PwC is independent and that it is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders to retain PwC to serve as our Independent Accounting Firm for 2020.\n\nWe are asking our shareholders to ratify the selection of PwC as our Independent Accounting Firm for 2020. Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of PwC to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. If the selection of PwC is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another Independent Accounting Firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may in its discretion select a different Independent Accounting Firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.",

The management of the Company is responsible for (i) the preparation of complete and accurate annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements ('financial statements') in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (ii) maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and internal controls designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and laws and regulations, and (iii) an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Independent Accounting Firm is responsible for planning and conducting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ('PCAOB') an audit of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and a review of the Company's quarterly financial statements and expressing opinions on the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting based on the integrated audits.\n\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the Independent Accounting Firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of the Company's results and the assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed significant accounting policies applied by the Company in its financial statements, as well as alternative treatments. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated audited financial statements with management and the Independent Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee has discussed with the Independent Accounting Firm matters required to be discussed pursuant to the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and the Securities and Exchange Commission with Audit Committees.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with the Independent Accounting Firm the auditor's independence from the Company and its management. As part of that review, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letters required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the Independent Accounting Firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed the Independent Accounting Firm's independence from the Company.\n\nThe Audit Committee also has considered whether the Independent Accounting Firm's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that the Independent Accounting Firm is independent from the Company and its management.\n\nThe Audit Committee has discussed with the Company's Internal Audit Department and Independent Accounting Firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel, and representatives of the Independent Accounting Firm in regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting and compliance programs.\n\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for filing with the SEC.\n\nSubmitted by the Audit Committee\n\nDavid B.

The Audit Committee has established a policy requiring its pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Accounting Firm.\n\nThe policy identifies the guiding principles that must be considered by the Audit Committee in approving services to ensure that the Independent Accounting Firm's independence is not impaired; describes the Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services that may be provided and the non-audit services that may not be performed; and sets forth the pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. The policy provides for the pre-approval of specific types of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other services and a limited fee estimate range for such services on an annual basis. The policy also requires specific pre-approval of all permitted services not already included in the annual pre-approval. The Independent Accounting Firm is required to report periodically to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided in accordance with their pre-approval and the fees for the services performed to date.\n\nThe Audit Committee's policy delegates to its Chair the authority to address requests for pre-approval of services in certain limited circumstances between Audit Committee meetings. The chair, in his discretion, must either seek immediate approval by e-mail from the other Audit Committee members, or report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee for its approval at its next scheduled meeting.\n\nThe Audit Committee may not delegate to management the Audit Committee's responsibility to pre-approve permitted services of the Independent Accounting Firm.\n\nAll Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services described below were approved by the Audit Committee before services were rendered.\n\n## Fees of the independent accounting firm\n\nThe following table represents fees billed for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ('PwC') for the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, and fees billed for other services rendered by PwC during those periods.\n\n## AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT FEES ($ IN MILLIONS)\n\n|                    | 2018   | 2019   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Audit Fee:         | $18.6  | $18.8  |\n| Audit-Related Fee: | 1.3    | 1.3    |\n| Tax Fee:           | 0.7    | 0.7    |\n| All Other Fee:     | 0.2    | 0.1    |\n| Total              | $20.8  | $20.9  |\n\nIn the above table, in accordance with SEC rules, 'Audit' fees consisted of audit work and review services, as well as work generally only the independent registered public accounting firm can reasonably be expected to provide, such as statutory audits, comfort letters, consents, and review of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'Audit-related' fees consisted principally of carve out audit procedures, procedures related to the adoption of new accounting standards in future years, internal control and system audit procedures for periods prior to the rollout of the ERP system, agreed-upon procedures, employee benefit plan audits, and other attestation services. 'Tax' fees consisted principally of tax compliance services in foreign jurisdictions, assistance with transfer pricing documentation, and advice on foreign and domestic tax related matters. 'All Other' fees consisted of general industry and accounting training, information security vendor assessments, licenses for accounting research software, and other permissible services that do not fall into the three categories listed above.",

This is the tenth year that the Company is asking shareholders to vote on this type of proposal, known as a 'say-on-pay' proposal.\n\nWe believe that our executive compensation program is consistent with our core compensation principles and is structured to assure that those principles are implemented. At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 14, 2019, approximately 95 percent of the votes cast on this issue voted to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in last year's Proxy Statement. Although the vote was non-binding, the Compensation Committee believes this level of approval percentage indicates that our shareholders strongly support our core compensation principles and our executive compensation program.\n\nThus, the Company is submitting to shareholders the following resolution for their consideration and approval:\n\n'RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and related narrative).'\n\nWe encourage you to read the entire Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement to learn more about our executive compensation program and the impact that our financial performance has on the annual and long-term incentive compensation earned by our leadership team.\n\nWhile the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee intend to carefully consider the results of the voting on this proposal when making future decisions regarding executive compensation, the vote is not binding on the Company or the Board and is advisory in nature.

        "page_content": "Based on the Company's financial performance and consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, the 2019 annual incentive payments that our Named Executive Officers received and their performance share accruals based on 2019 performance were below targeted levels. For additional information, see 'Impact of company performance on incentive compensation and real pay delivery,' '2019 annual incentive' and 'Performance share accruals based on 2019 performance' beginning on pages 53, 66 and 70, respectively. The stock, stock options and other long-term incentive compensation awards held by our Named Executive Officers throughout 2019 also decreased in value during the year with the decline in the market value of our shares.\n\nNoteworthy accomplishments from January 1, 2019, through March 1, 2020, include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Realigned our organizational structure and streamlined our global operating model around four new business groups to further align to customers and go-to-market models for improved growth, operating agility, and accountability;\n- \u00b7 Completed the acquisition of M*Modal to strengthen our Health Information Systems portfolio and complement organic growth;\n- \u00b7 Completed the acquisition of Acelity, Inc. to bolster our Medical Solutions business and support our growth strategy to offer comprehensive advanced and surgical wound care solutions;\n- \u00b7 Strengthened our portfolio going forward by completing the divestitures of our gas and flame detection business and advanced ballistics-protection business; and announced the divestiture of substantially all of the drug delivery business;\n- \u00b7 Awarded a total of 3,616 patents from patent offices around the world in 2019, including 700 patents granted to 3M by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which brings to more than 121,000 the total number of patents awarded to 3M in its corporate history;\n- \u00b7 Established a new Board committee to provide oversight of the Company's strategies related to research and development, commercialization, sustainability, environmental stewardship, and other related activities, which will help ensure that the Company is building on its strong innovation capabilities while maintaining the Company's high product stewardship standards;\n- \u00b7 Over 100 consecutive years of paying dividends to shareholders and 62 consecutive years of annual increases;\n- \u00b7 Reported an all-time high free cash flow of $5.4 billion for 2019, up 10 percent over 2018;\n- \u00b7 Returned $4.7 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases; and\n- \u00b7 Recognized by FORTUNE \u00ae magazine as one of the 'World's Most Admired Companies,' which 3M management believes is a recognition of our ability to create a foundation of trust with all of our stakeholders.\n\n## Factors creating alignment between pay and performance\n\n3M's executive compensation program is designed to maintain a strong alignment between corporate performance and executive compensation by tying incentive compensation to the achievement of performance metrics that we believe increase the Company's long-term value. For 2019, highlights of the program include:\n\n- \u00b7 A large portion of each executive's target Total Direct Compensation (cash plus long-term incentives) is performance-based, varying from 90 percent for Chief Executive Officer Michael Roman to a range of 72-86 percent for the other Named Executive Officers; and\n- \u00b7 The incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Named Executive Officers utilize multiple performance-based metrics focused primarily on revenue and earnings performance, increase in 3M's common stock price, efficient use of capital, and free cash flow conversion.",

        "page_content": "## Impact of company performance on incentive compensation and real pay delivery\n\nOne objective of our incentive compensation program is to align our Named Executive Officers' real pay delivery with performance. The Company's performance directly impacted incentive compensation pay outcomes for our Named Executive Officers as follows:\n\n## 2019 annual incentive compensation\n\nFor the Named Executive Officers paid on the basis of the Company's overall performance, the 2019 annual incentive compensation payout (before any adjustment for individual performance) was 62 percent of the target amount. The payouts reflect the Committee's view of our performance against the goals established for 2019, as shown below.\n\n- \u00b7 Local currency sales achieved 96 percent of plan, which resulted in an 80 percent payout for this metric (40 percent of target after adjusting for weighting);\n- \u00b7 3M economic profit achieved 84 percent of plan, which was below the threshold required to receive a payment based on this metric; and\n\n2019 annual incentive payout vs. target based on the Company's overall performance (before any adjustment for individual performance):\n\n62%\n\n- \u00b7 3M's 2019 economic profit represented 86 percent of its 2018 results, which resulted in a 72 percent payout for this metric (22 percent of target after adjusting for weighting).\n\nThe achievement levels described above reflect certain adjustments that the Committee believed were appropriate to better reflect the Company's performance against its 2019 operating plan. See Appendix A to this Proxy Statement for a reconciliation of local currency sales to our results for the most directly comparable financial measure as reported under GAAP, and the calculation of 2018 and 2019 economic profit.\n\n## Performance share award payouts and accruals (long-term incentive compensation)\n\nThe three-year performance period for the 2017 Performance Share Awards issued to the Named Executive Officers ended on December 31, 2019. Based on the financial results achieved during 2017 - 2019 and excluding dividend equivalents, the Named Executive Officers received 1.189 shares of 3M common stock for each target performance share subject to their 2017 Performance Share Awards. After considering the change in the market value of 3M's common stock over the three-year performance period and the additional shares delivered pursuant to the dividend equivalent rights granted as part of the 2017 Performance Share Awards, the value of the total number of 3M shares delivered to the Named Executive Officers in settlement of these awards (determined using the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 31, 2019) equaled 120 percent of the value of the target number of performance shares subject to such awards (determined using the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for March 1, 2017, the grant date for the 2017 performance share awards).\n\nWhen evaluating the payouts for these awards against the Company's performance, it is important to keep in mind the weightings applied to each year (2017 - 50 percent; 2018 - 30 percent; and 2019 - 20 percent) and each metric (Relative Organic Volume Growth - 40 percent; Return on Invested Capital - 20 percent; Earnings per Share Growth 20 percent; and Free Cash Flow Conversion - 20 percent). As illustrated in the charts below, the above target payout of these awards was driven primarily by the Company's strong 2017 Relative Organic Volume Growth, Return on Invested Capital, and Earnings per Share Growth, which was partially offset by the Company's below target performance on certain metrics for 2018 and 2019.",

To illustrate this point, the table below shows the number of shares of 3M common stock accrued per target performance share based on the Company's performance for the performance share awards that were outstanding at December 31, 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor additional information concerning the overall status of the performance share awards that were outstanding at December 31, 2019, and the impact that the Company's 2019 performance had on such awards, see 'Status of outstanding performance share awards' and 'Performance share accruals based on 2019 performance' beginning on pages 68 and 70, respectively.\n\n## Stock and long-term incentive compensation\n\nThe performance of 3M's stock has a material impact on the amount of compensation actually realized by our Named Executive Officers. Our stock ownership guidelines require covered executives, including the Named Executive Officers, to own amounts of Company stock having a value exceeding a specified multiple of their base salary. If the market price of 3M's stock declines, so does the value of the stock they own. Similarly, stock options and other longterm incentive awards held by our Named Executive Officers increase or decrease in value along with increases and decreases in the value of 3M's common stock.\n\nThe stock, stock options and other long-term incentive compensation awards held by our Named Executive Officers throughout 2019 decreased in value during the year as the closing price for a share of the Company's common stock on the NYSE decreased from $190.54 on December 31, 2018, to $176.42 on December 31, 2019.\n\n## Total shareholder return\n\nThe graphs below illustrate 3M's stock performance relative to the stock performance of the S&P 500 and the peer companies included in the Company's executive peer group (excluding DuPont de Nemours, Inc., formerly DowDuPont Inc., which was excluded due to its spinoff of two independent public companies during 2019 - Dow Inc. and Corteva, Inc.), as described under 'Competitive pay' beginning on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: 5-year period = Five years ending 12/31/19; 3-year period = Three years ending 12/31/19; 1-year period = One year ending 12/31/19 Source: Bloomberg.",

Among other things, the new plan is intended to help support talent recruitment and retention objectives and provide a consistent approach to executive departures. For more information concerning the new severance plan, see 'New severance plan' and 'Rights and payments upon a qualifying termination under the severance plan' beginning on pages 61 and 85 of this Proxy Statement, respectively.\n\n## Compensation policies and practices\n\nOur compensation program is designed to provide appropriate performance incentives and avoid compensation practices that do not promote the interests of our shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We do not\n\n- Maintain a strong alignment between corporate performance and our executive officers' compensation by having a majority of Total Direct Compensation consist of performance-based compensation.\n- Conduct an annual assessment for the purpose of identifying and mitigating significant economic and reputational risks in the design of our incentive compensation programs.\n- Have a comprehensive clawback policy that covers both cash and equity compensation and includes provisions addressing reputational and financial risk as well as risk management failures.\n- Use an independent compensation consultant retained by, and reporting directly to, the Committee.\n- Limit the number and amount of executive perquisites.\n- Prohibit our executive officers from hedging or pledging 3M common stock.\n- Maintain robust stock ownership guidelines applicable to all of our executive officers.\n- Conduct competitive benchmarking to align executive compensation with the market.\n- x Have employment or change in control agreements with any of our executive officers.\n- x Provide tax gross-ups on executive perquisites.\n- x Have agreements that would provide automatic 'single-trigger' accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to any of our executive officers upon a change in control.\n- x Pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned equity awards.\n- x Reprice stock options without the approval of 3M shareholders, except for 'anti-dilution' adjustments (such as adjustments in connection with a stock split, spinoff, etc.)",

        "page_content": "## Section II: How we determine executive compensation\n\n## Principles\n\nThe Company maintains global compensation principles that are intended to ensure that its compensation practices are fair and reasonable as applied to both executive and non-executive employees. These principles align with the Company's vision and strategies, balance both individual and enterprise-wide performance and seek to provide competitive wages and benefits with consistent positioning in the median range of the most-relevant markets to employees based on roles, responsibilities, skills, and performance. 3M also believes that the compensation of its executives should be closely tied to the performance of the Company, so that their interests are aligned with the interests of long-term 3M shareholders. Consistent with this philosophy, the following core principles provide a framework for the Company's executive compensation program:\n\n- \u00b7 Total Direct Compensation should be competitive to attract the best talent to 3M, motivate executives to perform at their highest levels, reward individual contributions that improve the Company's ability to deliver outstanding performance, and retain those executives with the leadership abilities and skills necessary for building long-term shareholder value;\n- \u00b7 The portion of Total Direct Compensation that is performance-based and is, therefore, at risk should increase with the level of an individual's responsibility;\n- \u00b7 The program should balance incentives for delivering outstanding long-term, sustainable performance against the potential to encourage inappropriate risk-taking;\n- \u00b7 The metrics and targets for earning performance-based incentives should be consistent with, and aligned to, increasing shareholder value over the long term; and\n- \u00b7 A significant portion of each executive's personal net worth should be tied to the value of 3M common stock as further motivation to build long-term shareholder value and mitigate the risk of inappropriate risk-taking.\n\nTo monitor and support the effectiveness of this program, the Committee periodically reviews the compensation principles used for setting annual total cash compensation for the Company's global workforce and approves the methodology for determining annual long-term incentive target grant values for employees eligible to receive such awards. The Company also periodically compares its pay components to those of other premier companies and adjusts them as necessary to stay competitive and attract, retain, and motivate a highly qualified, diverse workforce at all levels throughout the organization, not just for its executives.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Company believes that a collaborative process best ensures that compensation decisions reflect the principles of our executive compensation program. Set forth below is a summary of the roles and responsibilities of the key participants that were involved in making decisions relating to the compensation that our Named Executive Officers earned in 2019.\n\n| Responsible Party                                              | Primary Roles and Responsibilities Relating to Compensation Decisions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Compensation  Committee (Composed solely of  independent, non- | \u00b7  Reviews the design of, and risks associated with, the Company's compensation policies  and practices; \u00b7  Approves the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Independent Non- employee Members of  the Board of Directors   | (including performance metrics and goals for performance-based long-term and short- term incentive compensation), subject to ratification by the independent members of the  Board of Directors; \u00b7  Approves annual performance goals and objectives for our Chief Executive Officer and  \u00b7  Considers the Committee's annual evaluation of our Chief Executive Officer's and  Executive Chairman's performance; and  \u00b7  Considers the Committee's actions regarding the compensation of our Chief Executive |\n|                                                                | \u00b7  with the independent members of the Board of Directors;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                                                                | Acting through the Committee's Chairman, conducts an annual evaluation of our Chief  Executive Officer's and Executive Chairman's performance and reviews such evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                                | \u00b7  Approves the compensation of our other Named Executive Officers (including  performance metrics and goals for performance-based long-term and short-term  incentive compensation); and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

Other than the support that it provided to the Committee, FW Cook provided no other services to the Company or 3M management, with the exception of independent advisory support to the Nominating and Governance Committee on the compensation of 3M's non-employee directors so that valuation methodologies and peer groups are consistent with those used for executives and other employees. During the year, the Committee considered an evaluation of the independence of Mr. Paulin and his firm based on the relevant regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NYSE listing standards. The Committee concluded that the services performed by Mr. Paulin and his firm did not raise any noteworthy conflicts of interest.\n\n## Elements of target 2019 total direct compensation\n\nThe illustration below and the discussion that follows show how the target Total Direct Compensation of the Named Executive Officers (excluding our former Executive Chairman) was apportioned among base salary, annual incentives, performance share awards and stock options for 2019, and how these elements relate to the strategic business goals of the Company.\n\n## CEO*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbbreviations: AIP = Annual incentive pay; PSAs = Performance share awards.\n\n- * Numbers do not add to 100 percent due to rounding.\n- ** Amounts shown reflect the average apportionment for all Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Roman and Mr. Thulin. Including Mr. Thulin, the average apportionment for the other Named Executive Officers would be as follows: base salary - 18 percent; AIP 18 percent; stock options - 29 percent; performance shares - 35 percent; and performance-based pay - 82 percent.",

        "page_content": "## BASE SALARY\n\n## Percentage of Target 2019 Total Direct Compensation:\n\nCEO - 10%\n\nOther NEOs - 19%\n\n3M pays each of its executives a base salary in cash on a monthly basis. The amount of this base salary is reviewed at least annually and does not vary with the performance of the Company. Base salaries are designed to compensate the executives for their normal day-to-day responsibilities, and it is the only component of their compensation that is considered to be fixed rather than variable in nature.\n\n## ANNUAL INCENTIVE\n\n| Percentage of Target 2019 Total Direct Compensation:   | Performance Metrics and Weighting:                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CEO - 15%                                              | \u00b7  50% Local Currency Sales (of 3M or a business unit, as                  |\n| Other NEOs - 17%                                       | applicable) vs. Plan                                                       |\n|                                                        | \u00b7  20% Economic Profit (of 3M or a business unit, as  applicable) vs. Plan |\n\n3M provides its executives with annual incentive compensation through plans that are intended to align a significant portion of their Total Cash Compensation with the financial performance of the Company and its business units. Each executive is assigned a target amount of annual incentive compensation as part of his or her target Total Cash Compensation, but the amount of annual incentive compensation actually paid depends on the performance of 3M and its relevant business units as well as each executive's individual performance.\n\n3M's AIP offers eligible employees an opportunity to earn short-term incentive compensation based on three performance metrics, which were weighted for 2019 as indicated above. All 2019 performance targets for our Corporate AIP plan were set at or above 2018 results.\n\nThe actual amount paid to an eligible employee for a particular year may range from 0 percent to 200 percent of the employee's target amount for that year, depending on the performance of the Company and its business units compared to the performance goals approved by the Compensation Committee. The amount of annual incentive compensation paid to an eligible employee also may be increased (up to 30 percent), reduced or eliminated entirely based on the employee's individual performance during that year. Individual performance takes into account both quantitative (financial results, for example) and qualitative (market and economic circumstances, for example) factors. In no event, however, may the total amount paid to an eligible employee exceed 200 percent of the employee's target amount for the year.\n\nIn determining the amount of annual incentive compensation paid to a Named Executive Officer, the Named Executive Officer's individual performance is considered based upon the annual performance evaluation that Mr. Roman, assisted by 3M's Senior Vice President, Human Resources, and other Company employees, completed for each Named Executive Officer (other than himself and Mr. Thulin) and the annual performance evaluation that the Compensation Committee (acting through its Chairman) completed for each of Mr. Roman and Mr. Thulin. These performance evaluations are done according to 3M's overall performance assessment and management processes, which involve setting annual financial and non-financial goals and objectives for each individual and then assessing the individual's overall performance against these goals and objectives at the end of the year. While the annual incentive compensation earned by eligible 3M employees generally is determined under the AIP, the annual incentive compensation earned during 2019 by the senior executives whose compensation is decided by the Committee (including all of the Named Executive Officers) was determined under the Executive Plan approved by 3M's shareholders at the 2007 Annual Meeting. A total of 20 senior executives participated in this Executive Plan during 2019. The Company utilized the Executive Plan in 2019 to provide performance-based compensation that, at the time action was taken to designate the plan participants for 2019, was intended to be exempt from the $1 million annual deduction limit of state tax laws that are similar to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as in effect prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Given the number of states that have eliminated the performance-based compensation exception to the annual deduction limit since the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Committee decided to include the Company's senior executives in the broad-based AIP beginning in 2020.",

        "page_content": "Assuming the Company meets the Adjusted Net Income goal, the Executive Plan provides the Committee with discretion to determine the amount of annual incentive compensation paid to 3M's Named Executive Officers and its other senior executives. The Executive Plan establishes a maximum amount of annual incentive compensation that may be earned by each covered executive for a year (a percentage of the Company's Adjusted Net Income for such year) and then the Committee utilizes this discretion to pay each covered executive less than this maximum amount based on such factors as it deems relevant. Since the Executive Plan was first adopted in 2007, the Committee has rarely used this discretion to pay a covered executive (other than our Chief Executive Officer) anything other than the same amount such executive would have received had he or she been participating in the broad-based AIP (including the individual performance multiplier).\n\n## LONG-TERM INCENTIVES\n\n| Percentage of Target 2019 Total Direct Compensation:   | Performance Metrics and Weighting:    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| CEO - 38% Stock Options                                | \u00b7  20% Earnings per Share Growth      |\n| 38% Performance Shares                                 | \u00b7  40% Relative Organic Volume Growth |\n| Other NEOs - 32% Stock Options                         | \u00b7  20% Return on Invested Capital     |\n| 32% Performance Shares                                 | \u00b7  20% Free Cash Flow Conversion      |\n\n3M provides long-term incentive compensation to its executives through an incentive plan approved by the Company's shareholders. This is a typical omnibus-type plan that authorizes the Committee to grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, and other stock awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company provides its executives with this long-term incentive compensation based on 3M common stock in order to effectively motivate such executives to build long-term shareholder value.\n\nIn determining the performance-adjusted target grant value of the stock options and performance shares provided to our Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee considers the individual performance of our Named Executive Officers using the performance evaluations described under 'Annual Incentive' on page 59.\n\nOur Named Executive Officers also may receive special equity awards on an ad hoc basis as new hires or for recognition and retention, promotions, or other purposes.\n\n## Adjustments for certain special items\n\nIn determining the level of achievement of the performance goals established under the AIP and the performance share awards for any given period, the costs, sales and impact on assets and liabilities from acquisitions are excluded in the year that the acquisition is completed. The Committee also makes other adjustments from time to time for special items that it believes are unrelated to the operational performance of the Company for the relevant measurement period (e.g., changes in tax laws or accounting principles, asset write-downs, the impact of restructurings, divestitures or asset sales in which net gains or losses exceed certain thresholds, unusual tax transactions, litigation or claim judgments and settlements, and other special items described in management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations appearing in the Company's annual/quarterly report to shareholders for the applicable period). These adjustments can have either a positive or negative impact on award payouts.\n\nSee Appendix A to this Proxy Statement for additional details concerning the adjustments made to certain metrics under the AIP and the outstanding performance share awards.\n\n## Benefits and perquisites\n\nThe Company's Named Executive Officers participate in the same health care, disability, life insurance, pension, and 401(k) benefit plans available to most of the Company's U.S. employees. They also are eligible to receive certain additional benefits and perquisites that are provided for the convenience (financial planning assistance and meals when attending to 3M business, for example), financial security (nonqualified deferred compensation plans and premiums for additional life insurance coverage, for example), personal security (home security equipment/monitoring, for example) or personal health (on-site exercise facilities and physical exams, for example) of the executives. Our Named Executive Officers and other employees also may receive Company tickets for sporting or other events. The Company believes that the benefits and perquisites offered generally are similar to those of our peers and assist in attracting and retaining executives. In some cases, there is no incremental cost to the Company associated with providing these additional benefits and perquisites (physical exams and certain tickets to events, for example) or the executives pay all or a substantial portion of the incremental costs incurred by the Company (on-site exercise facilities, for example).",

        "page_content": "These additional benefits and perquisites generally are provided on a consistent basis only to a limited group of our most senior U.S. employees (including all of the Named Executive Officers), although enhanced personal security equipment and monitoring is provided only to our Chief Executive Officer and the type of additional life insurance coverage provided varies based on the date the employee was first appointed to an executive position. Individuals first appointed to an executive position on or before August 31, 2003, receive additional life insurance coverage that is provided through a universal life insurance policy. Individuals first appointed on or after September 1, 2003, including our Chief Executive Officer, receive group term life insurance coverage.\n\nThe Company also operates aircraft that are used by our senior officers and other employees to conduct company business. For personal security reasons, the Board of Directors requires our Chief Executive Officer to use the Company's aircraft for all air travel, both business and personal. Our Chief Executive Officer's spouse and other guests also may accompany him on flights.\n\nThe incremental cost to the Company of providing these additional benefits to the Named Executive Officers is reflected in the All Other Compensation Table. No tax gross-ups are provided on any of these additional benefits and perquisites.\n\n## New severance plan\n\nIn the first half of 2019, the Committee's independent compensation consultant, FW Cook, conducted an analysis of the benefits and perquisites offered to executives at companies in the executive peer group. Following completion of its work, FW Cook informed the Compensation Committee that maintenance of formal severance arrangements for some or all of their executives was a common practice among executive peer group members. Based upon the results of its analysis, FW Cook recommended that the Committee consider implementing a new executive severance plan in order to support talent recruitment and retention objectives (especially at times when there are uncertainties around restructurings and reductions in force) and to provide a consistent approach to executive departures. With FW Cook's assistance, the Committee then discussed the pros and cons associated with adoption of a formal severance plan and other related issues over the course of the next nine months, including the benefits that a formal plan would provide the Company, the scope of eligible employees, the various termination scenarios that would be covered, and the compensation and benefits that would be offered. After considering the issues, the Committee recommended that the Board adopt a new 3M Executive Severance Plan to provide separation pay and benefits to certain U.S. employees (including each of the Named Executive Officers) in the event of a qualifying termination of employment. Upon the Committee's recommendation, the independent members of the Board of Directors unanimously approved the 3M Executive Severance Plan, which became effective on February 3, 2020. Additional details concerning the benefits made available under the plan and the circumstances under which benefits will be made available can be found under 'Rights and payments upon a qualifying termination under the severance plan' beginning on page 85.\n\n## Separation pay\n\nIn 2019, we entered into an agreement with Dr. Delgado under which he received $1,750,000 upon the Company's separation of his employment without cause and his execution of a release of all claims against the Company and its affiliates. In accordance with the terms of the applicable plans and award agreements, Dr. Delgado remained eligible to receive a prorated annual incentive payment for 2019 based upon 3M's actual performance and continues to vest in his outstanding stock options and performance shares, except that his 2019 performance shares were prorated based on the portion of the year worked. Dr. Delgado remains subject to existing non-competition, non-solicitation, and confidentiality obligations.\n\n## Competitive pay\n\nWe compete for executive talent in a global market. In order to ensure that we are providing Total Direct Compensation that is competitive, the Committee annually conducts a rigorous benchmarking process with the help of its independent compensation consultant, FW Cook. During this process, the Committee generally considers available pay data for two peer groups: an executive peer group and a survey peer group.",

The companies in this executive peer group were selected because (1) their performance was monitored regularly by the same market analysts who monitor the performance of 3M (investment peers), and/or (2) they met criteria based on similarity of their business and pay models, market capitalization (based on an eight-quarter rolling average), and annual revenues and compete with 3M for talent or capital.\n\n| (Dollars in millions) Latest Four Quarters Revenues   |             | Trailing Eight-Quarter  Average Market Capitalization   |               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| General Electric Company                              | $95,214     | Johnson & Johnson                                       | $ 3 5 7,9 9 3 |\n| Johnson & Johnson                                     | $82,059     | The Procter & Gamble Company                            | $258,771      |\n| United Technologies                                   | $ 7 7,0 4 6 | Medtronic plc                                           | $132,027      |\n| The Procter & Gamble Company                          | $69,594     | Honeywell International, Inc.                           | $116,945      |\n| Caterpillar Inc.                                      | $53,800     | United Technologies Corporation                         | $109,629      |\n| Deere & Company                                       | $38,880     | 3M Company                                              | $106,606      |\n| Honeywell International, Inc.                         | $36,709     | General Electric Company                                | $ 91,417      |\n| 3M Company                                            | $32,136     | Danaher Corporation                                     | $ 91,106      |\n| Medtronic plc                                         | $31,062     | Caterpillar Inc.                                        | $ 7 7,9 5 3   |\n| Johnson Controls International plc                    | $24,080     | Deere & Company                                         | $ 50,140      |\n| Eaton Corporation plc                                 | $21,390     | Illinois Tool Works Inc.                                | $ 49,275      |\n| Kimberly-Clark Corporation                            | $18,450     | Kimberly-Clark Corporation                              | $ 43,137      |\n| Emerson Electric Co.                                  | $18,376     | Emerson Electric Co.                                    | $ 42,392      |\n| Danaher Corporation                                   | $17,911     | Eaton Corporation plc                                   | $ 35,127      |\n| Illinois Tool Works Inc.                              | $ 14,109    | Johnson Controls International plc                      | $ 31,431      |\n| TE Connectivity Ltd.                                  | $13,269     | TE Connectivity Ltd.                                    | $ 29,847      |\n| Corning Incorporated                                  | $11,503     | Corning Incorporated                                    | $ 23,820      |\n| 75th Percentile                                       | $57,74 9    | 75th Percentile                                         | $111,458      |\n| Mean                                                  | $38,966     | Mean                                                    | $ 96,313      |\n| Median                                                | $ 2 7,571   | Median                                                  | $ 64,047      |\n| 25th Percentile                                       | $18,260     | 25th Percentile                                         | $ 40,576      |\n| 3M Percentile Rank                                    | 55%         | 3M Percentile Rank                                      | 72%           |\n\nAll data shown was obtained from Standard & Poor's Capital IQ.

        "page_content": "## Survey peer group\n\nFor 2019, there were approximately 250 comparator companies in the survey peer group. Although the number and identity of the companies varies from year to year and from survey to survey, each of the companies included in the survey peer group had annual revenue exceeding $10 billion. All of the companies in the survey peer group also participate in one or more executive compensation surveys obtained from three consulting firms (Aon, FW Cook, and Willis Towers Watson). Pay data for the survey peer group is statistically regressed to recognize the different sizes of the comparator companies (based on annual revenues) as compared to the size of 3M. The Committee does not review the identity of the companies in the survey peer group.\n\n## How the Committee establishes target compensation levels using competitive pay data\n\nThe Committee considers the pay data from the Peer Groups as a reference point when establishing the target Total Cash Compensation and the initial target value of long-term incentive compensation to be provided to our executives in any given year before consideration of individual circumstances. For each Named Executive Officer, the Committee's general approach is to set such amounts at or very near the median for the corresponding items of compensation provided to similarly situated executives in the executive peer group. In situations where the Committee believes that there is insufficient market data for one or more positions, the Committee starts with the median amount for a similar position and adjusts that amount up or down (generally not more than 15 percent) to arrive at a number that it uses as the 'median' for that position. The final amounts of target Total Cash Compensation established by the Committee for each executive may vary based on individual circumstances, but generally are set between 80 and 120 percent of the applicable median. When setting the target amounts for any individual executive, the Committee may consider the breadth and complexity of the executive's duties and responsibilities, the scores assigned to the executive for his or her leadership behaviors (e.g., customer focus, strategic mindset, operational leadership), the financial and operational performance of the business activities for which the executive is responsible, experience and time in their current position, internal pay equity, individual performance, and such other factors as the Committee determines to be appropriate. The pay data for the survey peer group is used by the Committee to assess the reasonableness of the benchmarking results for each executive position benchmarked, helping to ensure that the Company's compensation objectives are being met.\n\nThe Committee also uses information on the executive compensation practices at companies in the executive peer group when considering design changes to the Company's executive compensation program. Overall, the Company believes that use of this information from the Peer Groups enables the Committee to create better alignment between executive pay and performance and to help ensure that 3M can attract and retain high-performing executive leaders.\n\n## Tally sheets\n\nThe Committee periodically reviews a report comparing the amounts of compensation actually received by the Company's Named Executive Officers to the amounts reported in its annual proxy statement and summarizing the compensation that would be owed to such individuals in the event of the termination of their employment under various circumstances. Reviewing this report helps the Committee better understand the Company's potential obligations to the Named Executive Officers following the termination of their employment. It also helps the Committee better assess the risk of any of the Named Executive Officers leaving the Company prematurely because the Company is not providing sufficient retention incentives.\n\n## Tax considerations\n\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation paid per year in excess of $1 million to certain current and former executive officers of the Company (although there historically was an exception to this $1 million annual limitation for performance-based compensation if certain requirements set forth in Section 162(m) and the applicable regulations were met and for a company's chief financial officer and former executive officers). As a result, we expect that compensation paid per year to our Named Executive Officers and certain other current and former executive officers in excess of $1 million generally will not be deductible, subject to limited exceptions. Interpretations of and changes in applicable tax laws and regulations as well as other factors beyond the control of the Committee can affect deductibility of compensation, and there can be no assurance that compensation paid to our executive officers will be tax deductible. The Committee has in prior years considered the tax implications (including the potential lack of deductibility under Section 162(m)) when making compensation decisions but reserves the right to make future compensation decisions based on other factors. The Committee also reserves the right to make changes or amendments to existing compensation programs and arrangements, including changes or amendments that may result in the loss of tax deductions, if the Committee believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.",

As part of its normal process to progress senior executives to a level of compensation that is commensurate with their responsibilities, the Committee also periodically considers adjustments to the base salaries and target Total Cash Compensation of senior executives whose rate of pay is set below the market median. All adjustments are made only after considering the most recent compensation data available to the Committee for executives with similar responsibilities at companies in the Peer Groups, each individual's place in the target total cash compensation range for his or her position, and the individual's job performance.\n\nIn February 2019, the Committee approved (and, in the case of Mr. Roman, the independent members of the Board ratified) the increases in the base salaries and target Total Cash Compensation shown below for the Named Executive Officers following completion of their annual performance evaluations. No changes were made to Mr. Thulin's, Ms. Bushman's, Dr. Delgado's or Mr. Vale's base salary or target Total Cash Compensation at that time. The adjustments to Mr. Roman's compensation primarily were intended to progress his compensation closer to the market median.\n\n| Name                  | Previous  Base Salary  ($)   | New  Base Salary  Effective  4/1/19  ($)   | % Increase   | Previous  Target  Total Cash  Compensation  ($)   | New Target  Total Cash  Compensation  Effective  4/1/19  ($)   | % Increase   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Michael F.

Each Named Executive Officer's target annual incentive for the year was equal to the difference between his or her target Total Cash Compensation and annual base salary. Each of the Named Executive Officers was assigned to an appropriate business unit (the entire Company, in some cases) established under the AIP for the purpose of measuring business performance during 2019 and converting that performance into a payout determined in accordance with the terms of the AIP. While none of the Named Executive Officers were covered by the AIP during 2019, the Committee rarely uses its discretion under the Executive Plan to pay the covered executives (other than our Chief Executive Officer) anything other than the same amount such executive would have received had he or she been participating in the AIP (including the individual performance multiplier).\n\nThe amounts payable under the AIP for 2019 were based on the following performance results for the Company and, as applicable, the respective business units to which the Named Executive Officers were assigned for all or part of the year:\n\n|                                             | Local Currency Sales  (50%)   | Local Currency Sales  (50%)   | Local Currency Sales  (50%)   | Economic Profit  (20%)   |

performance objective by earning Adjusted Net Income of $5.3 billion for 2019, the plan authorized the Committee to approve payments of annual incentive compensation to each Named Executive Officer equal to a maximum of one-quarter of one percent of such Adjusted Net Income ($13 million), subject to the Committee's negative discretion to pay each covered executive any amount less than this maximum based on such factors as it deems relevant, including the goals set forth under the AIP. At its meeting in February 2020 and consistent with its past practice, the Committee approved (and with respect to Mr. Roman and Mr. Thulin, the independent members of the Board of Directors ratified) a payment to each executive equal to the amount such executive would have received had he or she been participating in the broad-based AIP (including the individual performance multiplier).\n\n| Name                       | Target 2019  Annual  Incentive*  ($)   | Actual 2019  Annual  Incentive  ($)   | Payout  as a % of Target   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Michael F.

The number of shares of 3M common stock that will be issued for each 2019 performance share is linked to the Company's performance as measured by the criteria of Earnings per Share Growth (20 percent weighting), Relative Organic Volume Growth (40 percent weighting), Return on Invested Capital (20 percent weighting), and Free Cash Flow Conversion (20 percent weighting). These performance criteria were selected because they are aligned with 3M's operating plan and the financial objectives communicated to shareholders, and the Committee believes that they are important drivers of long-term shareholder value. Attainment of these four independent performance criteria is measured separately for each calendar year during the three-year measurement period, with each year weighted as follows: 2019 - 50 percent; 2020 - 30 percent; and 2021 - 20 percent. However, the targets by which the Company's performance is measured do not change over the three-year performance period.",

        "page_content": "Excluding shares issued pursuant to dividend equivalent rights, the actual number of shares of 3M common stock that will be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2021, may be anywhere from 0 percent to 200 percent of the target number of performance shares awarded, depending on the performance of the Company during the performance period. However, an executive may forfeit all or a portion of such shares if he or she does not remain employed by the Company throughout the three-year performance period.\n\nFor awards tied to the achievement of performance goals over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, the Committee approved the following targets for determining the number of shares of 3M common stock to be delivered for each performance share awarded, with the total number of shares actually delivered being the sum of the number of shares earned as a result of the Company's achievement of each of the four financial goals, plus the number of shares issued pursuant to dividend equivalent rights granted with respect to the shares earned. In the event that the Company's performance as measured by any of these performance criteria falls between any of the percentages listed below, the number of shares of 3M common stock earned will be determined by linear interpolation.\n\n| EPS  Growth   | % of Performance  Shares   | Relative  Organic  Volume  Growth   | % of Performance  Shares   | Return on  Invested  Capital   | % of Performance  Shares   | FCF  Conversion   | % of Performance  Shares   | Total % of Performance  Shares   |\n|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| below 4.0%    | 0%                         | below -1.0%                         | 0%                         | below  20.0%                   | 0%                         | below 95.0%       | 0%                         | 0%                               |\n| 4.0%          | 4%                         | -1.0%                               | 8%                         | 20.0%                          | 4%                         | 95.0%             | 4%                         | 20%                              |\n| 8.0%          | 20%                        | 0.5%                                | 40%                        | 22.0%                          | 20%                        | 100.0%            | 20%                        | 100%                             |\n| 12.0% or      | 40%                        | 2.0% or                             | 80%                        | 25.0% or                       | 40%                        | 105.0% or         | 40%                        | 200%                             |\n| higher        |                            | higher                              |                            | higher                         |                            | higher            |                            |                                  |\n\nThe above targets are not a prediction of how 3M will perform during the years 2019 through 2021 or any other period in the future. The sole purpose of these formulas, which were approved by the Committee in February 2019, is to establish a method for determining the number of shares of 3M common stock to be delivered for the performance share awards described above. 3M is not providing any guidance, nor updating any prior guidance, of its future performance with the disclosure of these formulas, and you are cautioned not to rely on these formulas as a prediction of 3M's future performance.\n\n## Long-term incentives - all outstanding performance share awards\n\nThe Company's annual award cycle and three-year performance periods result in an overlap of awards. For example, the performance goals for 2019 performance share awards relate to the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Similarly, the performance goals for 2018 performance share awards relate to the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, and so on, as shown below. Performance against the goals established for each award are measured separately for each calendar year during the measurement period, with each year weighted as shown below in parenthesis. The Committee believes this structure reduces motivation to maximize performance in any one period by providing the highest-level rewards only by building sustainable long-term results.\n\n| Award    | 2017         | 2018         | 2019         | 2020         | 2021         |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 2017 PSA | Year 1 (50%) | Year 2 (30%) | Year 3 (20%) |              |              |\n| 2018 PSA |              | Year 1 (50%) | Year 2 (30%) | Year 3 (20%) |              |\n| 2019 PSA |              |              | Year 1 (50%) | Year 2 (30%) | Year 3 (20%) |\n\n## Status of outstanding performance share awards\n\nThe Committee periodically reviews the Company's performance against the goals established for each performance share award throughout the duration of its applicable measurement period. The table below summarizes the status of the different performance share awards held by the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2019.",

Although each such Named Executive Officer (other than Mr. Roman) has until December 31, 2022, to acquire beneficial ownership of any additional shares required as a result of the recalculation, each such individual beneficially owned a sufficient number of shares on December 31, 2019, to comply with the new ownership levels required.\n- ** As a result of Mr. Roman's appointment to the position of Chief Executive Officer and the resulting increase in his required level of ownership, effective July 1, 2018, from a multiple of three times his annual base salary to a multiple of six times his annual base salary, Mr. Roman has until June 30, 2023, to acquire beneficial ownership of any additional shares required as a result of the December 31, 2019, recalculation. Mr. Roman beneficially owned a sufficient number of shares on December 31, 2019, to comply with the new ownership level required.\n\nThe stock ownership guidelines provide that the number of shares required to be beneficially owned by each covered executive will be calculated using such executive's annual base salary at the time of his or her initial appointment to a Section 16 position and again at the time of a position change from one multiple level to another multiple level, and the fair market value of 3M common stock at that time. The guidelines also provide that the number of shares required to be beneficially owned by each executive will be recalculated every three years using his or her annual base salary and the fair market value of 3M common stock at the recalculation date. Pursuant to the terms of the guidelines, the next periodic recalculation date is scheduled to occur on December 30, 2022.\n\nEach covered executive is expected to attain beneficial ownership of the number of shares of 3M stock determined by the guidelines within five years of his or her initial appointment to a position covered by the guidelines or a position change from one multiple level to another multiple level. The guidelines also provide that each covered executive whose required level of ownership increases as a result of a periodic recalculation will have three years from the recalculation date (or the balance of the five-year period since the date of their initial appointment or latest position change, if longer) to acquire beneficial ownership of any additional shares required as a result of the recalculation. However, if a covered executive is not making adequate progress to meet the required level of ownership within the applicable time period, the guidelines provide that he or she will be required to hold and not sell a sufficient number of the after-tax 3M shares received upon the next payout of performance shares to be on track to satisfy the required ownership level.",

All transactions in 3M securities by directors and executive officers must be pre-cleared with the Company's General Counsel.\n\n## Clawback policy\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors has adopted a policy under which it is authorized to require reimbursement of certain cash and equity compensation provided to an executive if (1) 3M is required to make a material restatement of its financial statements, whether or not the result of misconduct by the executive or any other individual, (2) the executive commits an act of misconduct that causes, or might reasonably be expected to cause, significant financial or reputational harm to the Company, or (3) the executive fails to identify, escalate, monitor or manage, in a timely manner and as reasonably expected, risks material to the Company, which cause, or might reasonably be expected to cause, significant financial or reputational harm to the Company. The policy also authorizes the Company to require reimbursement of any profits the executive realizes on the sale of Company securities during the 12-month period following the issuance by the Company of a financial report that, due to the misconduct of the executive, is materially noncompliant with Federal securities laws. This policy applies to all senior executives of the Company, including all of the Named Executive Officers.\n\nThe Board of Directors continues to monitor regulatory developments relating to recoupment of incentive-based compensation and intends to further amend this policy, if necessary, to comply with any final regulations issued for the purpose of implementing the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n## Assessment of risk related to compensation programs\n\nFollowing completion of a recent compensation risk assessment, the Company concluded that none of its compensation policies and practices is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In connection with this assessment, the Company completed an inventory of its executive and non-executive compensation programs globally, with particular emphasis on incentive compensation plans or programs. The scope of the fiscal 2019 risk assessment generally was consistent with that conducted in recent years, including heightened attention on plan design, and whether the design, oversight, and controls in place have potential to create not only financial risk, but reputational risk as well. Based on this assessment, the Company evaluated the primary components of its compensation plans and practices to identify whether those components, either alone or in combination, properly balanced compensation opportunities and risk.\n\nThe Company believes that our overall cash versus equity pay mix, balance of shorter-term versus longer-term performance focus, balance of revenue versus profit focused performance measures, stock ownership guidelines, and 'clawback' policy all work together to provide our employees and executives with incentives to deliver outstanding performance to build long-term shareholder value, while taking only necessary and prudent risks. In this regard, the Company's strong ethics and its corporate compliance systems, which are overseen by the Audit Committee, further mitigate against excessive or inappropriate risk taking. In addition, our employee sales plans are designed under global guidelines, where oversight of plan terms, administration, and operation is stronger and governance roles are segregated.",

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company amended the ERIP to include a pension equity formula for (1) employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2001, and (2) employees who voluntarily elected the pension equity formula during the one-time choice election period in 2001. The ERIP was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009, meaning that employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2009, do not participate in the plan. Of the Named Executive Officers, Mr. Roman, Mr. Thulin, Mr. Gangestad, Mr. Khandpur, Ms. Bushman and Dr. Delgado participate under the non-pension equity formula of the ERIP (the Portfolio I Plan), while Mr. Vale participates under the pension equity formula of the ERIP (the Portfolio II Plan). Retirement benefits under the ERIP are based on an employee's years of service and average annual earnings during the employee's four highest-paid consecutive years of service. As applied to the Named Executive Officers, earnings for purposes of the ERIP include base salary and target annual incentive compensation. All benefits earned under the ERIP by the Named Executive Officers will be payable in the form of life annuities, unless an individual elects at the time their employment ends to receive the entire amount of his or her earned pension benefits in the form of a single lump-sum cash payment.",

        "page_content": "Under the Portfolio I Plan, employees earn annual benefits payable at retirement generally equal to 1.15 percent of their high-four average annual earnings multiplied by their years of service plus 0.35 percent of their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security breakpoint multiplied by their years of service (up to a maximum of 35 years). The Social Security breakpoint is an average of the Social Security taxable wage bases for each of the 35 years ending with the year each employee qualifies for receiving unreduced Social Security retirement benefits. Under the Portfolio I Plan, an employee may retire with an unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62 for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively). If the employee's age and service at the time of retirement total at least 90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively) the employee also would receive a Social Security bridge payment until age 62. Mr. Thulin currently receives unreduced retirement benefits, and Dr. Delgado currently receives reduced retirement benefits. As of March 13, 2020, each of Mr. Roman, Mr. Gangestad, and Ms. Bushman is eligible to retire with reduced early retirement benefits, with the reduction being equal to 5 percent of the pension otherwise payable for each year that such executive retires prior to age 61 (age 62 for Mr. Gangestad and Ms. Bushman).\n\nUnder the Portfolio II Plan, employees earn pension credits (from 3 percent to 12 percent) for each year of employment based on their age and accumulated years of service under the plan. Once their employment ends, these accumulated pension credits are multiplied by their high-four average annual earnings and added to an amount determined by multiplying one-half of these accumulated pension credits by their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security integration level (70 percent of the Social Security taxable wage base in the year employment ends). The sum of these two amounts is then converted into an annuity payable over the lifetime of the employee using fixed conversion factors. The Portfolio II Plan does not provide any subsidies for early retirement.\n\nAs a tax-qualified plan, the ERIP is subject to a variety of limits that apply to both the amount of any employee's earnings that may be considered when determining the benefits earned under the plan as well as the maximum amount of benefits that any employee may earn. The Nonqualified Pension Plan is designed to provide additional benefits to employees, including the Named Executive Officers, affected by these limits. The amount of benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan generally equals the amount of benefits an employee was not able to earn under the ERIP as a result of the limits imposed by Federal tax laws. The benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan are generally paid in the form of a single lump-sum cash payment following the termination of their employment (subject to any applicable delay under Federal tax laws). Current employees were given a one-time opportunity during 2008 to elect to receive their benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan in the form of a life annuity following their retirement, and none of the Named Executive Officers elected to receive their benefits in the form of a life annuity.\n\n## Nonqualified deferred compensation\n\nThe following table reflects the participation during 2019 by the Named Executive Officers in three nonqualified deferred compensation plans offered by the Company. The Deferred Compensation Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until retirement from the Company the receipt of a portion of their base salary and annual incentive compensation. The Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until retirement from the Company the payout of their performance share awards under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The VIP Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer until retirement from the Company the receipt of a portion of their base salary and annual incentive compensation. All three plans generally allow the eligible employees to elect to receive payment of their account balances in the form of either a single lump sum payment or in up to ten annual installments. With the exception of deferrals of performance shares under the Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan, earnings are credited to the amounts deferred under all three plans based on the returns paid on the investment funds available to participants in 3M's qualified 401(k) plan or a fixed rate of return based on corporate bond yields (as selected by each participant). Earnings are credited to the deferrals of performance shares under the Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan based on the return on shares of 3M common stock, including reinvested dividends.",

With the exception of 3M matching contributions to Mr. Khandpur's VIP Excess Plan account in respect of his 2018 annual incentive payment (paid in 2019), all amounts contributed by the Company on behalf of these individuals during 2019 are included in the 'All Other Compensation' column of the Summary Compensation Table. The Summary Compensation Table does not reflect any portion of the 3M matching contributions made to Mr. Khandpur's VIP Excess Plan account in respect of his 2018 annual incentive payment because those amounts were earned prior to the first year he became a Named Executive Officer.\n\n- (3) None of these amounts are included in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation earned in 2019, since none of the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plans provide above-market or preferential earnings.\n- (4) Includes the following amounts that were reported as compensation for 2017 and 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. Roman - $ 501,252 ; Mr. Thulin - $ 5,554,184 ; Mr. Gangestad - $384,096; Mr. Khandpur - $0; Ms. Bushman - $107,497; Dr. Delgado - $1,144,068; and Mr. Vale - $ 280,955 .\n\n## Potential payments upon termination or change in control\n\nAs reflected in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, 3M has no employment agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers nor does it have any change in control plans or arrangements that would provide benefits to any of the Named Executive Officers solely in the event of a change in control of the Company. We also do not have any agreements that would provide automatic 'single-trigger' accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to any of our Named Executive Officers in the event of a change in control of the Company.\n\nEffective February 3, 2020, 3M adopted a new severance plan to provide separation benefits to eligible U.S. employees (including the Named Executive Officers) who incur a qualifying termination. In addition, certain of the Company's executive compensation and benefit plans provide all participants (including the Named Executive Officers) with certain rights or the right to receive payments in the event of the termination of their employment or upon a change in control of the Company. The terms applicable to these potential rights or payments in various situations are described below. Payments or benefits under other plans and arrangements that are generally provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated employees of the Company upon the termination of their employment are not described, including (a) accrued base salary; (b) annual incentive earned with respect to completed performance periods; (c) retiree welfare benefits provided to substantially all of the Company's U.S. employees, including retiree medical benefits; (d) distribution of vested account balances under the Company's qualified 401(k) plan; (e) accrued pension benefits under the Company's defined benefit pension plans payable following an employee's retirement or other termination of employment (the amounts of these benefits earned by the Named Executive Officers are reported in the 2019 Pension Benefits Table); (f) life insurance benefits generally available to all salaried employees; and (g) distribution of account balances under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plans (the account balances of the Named Executive Officers are reported in the 2019 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table).\n\n## Rights and payments upon retirement\n\nFollowing retirement (as described below), the Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive:\n\n- \u00b7 continued vesting of stock options previously granted under the Company's stock plans, and the opportunity to exercise vested stock options previously granted under such plans during the remainder of the original term (up to 10 years) of such options;\n- \u00b7 an annual incentive plan payment for the year of retirement, prorated based on the number of days worked prior to the date of separation;\n- \u00b7 for those Named Executive Officers initially appointed to a 3M executive position before January 1, 2006, or after December 31, 2017, payment for all previously granted performance shares upon completion of the respective threeyear performance period (prorated to reflect the portion of the year worked only with respect to the performance shares granted in the year of retirement) and based on actual performance; and\n- \u00b7 for those Named Executive Officers initially appointed to a 3M executive position on or after January 1, 2006, and on or before December 31, 2017, payment for all previously granted performance shares upon completion of the respective three-year performance period (prorated to reflect the portion of the three-year performance period that occurred prior to the date of the Named Executive Officer's retirement) and based on actual performance.\n\nFor this purpose, the term 'Retirement' means a termination of employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with at least 10 years of service (age 55 with at least five years of service for awards granted before January 1, 2016).",

An eligible employee who becomes entitled to benefits under the Severance Plan receives the following:\n\n- \u00b7 continued payment of his or her annual base salary for a number of months (24 months for the Chief Executive Officer, and 18 months for all other Named Executive Officers);\n- \u00b7 continued payment of annual incentive payments that would have been paid if the participant remained employed through the end of the severance payment period, calculated based on actual results for the relevant year, using the participant's final performance rating as of the end of the applicable year (or if none, a performance rating of 'fully meets expectations' or equivalent), and prorated based on the number of days in the year preceding the end of the severance period (if the severance payment period ends prior to the end of a year);\n- \u00b7 an opportunity to exercise all vested stock options and stock appreciation rights following the participant's termination and prior to the expiration date of such award;\n- \u00b7 accelerated vesting and payment of a prorated portion of the participant's outstanding 'annual' restricted stock units, with proration based on the number of full years of the participant's completed service over the number of years required to vest under the original vesting schedule;\n- \u00b7 outstanding performance share awards will not be forfeited solely as a result of the participant's termination, and the target number of shares under each award will be prorated based on the number of months the participant worked during the applicable performance period;\n- \u00b7 full vesting of the participant's VIP company contribution account; and\n- \u00b7 outplacement services in accordance with 3M's policy.",

        "page_content": "Any severance payments under the Severance Plan will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis (but not below $0) by any payments the participant may receive under his or her non-competition agreement with 3M. In addition, severance payments will cease in the event the participant becomes reemployed by 3M.\n\nThe Severance Plan does not provide severance benefits to employees who terminate pursuant to a mandatory retirement policy adopted by the Board. Employees who terminate in connection with a spinoff, divestiture or similar transaction involving the employee's business unit may be eligible to participate at the discretion of the Company. To be eligible to receive benefits under the Severance Plan, an employee must execute and not revoke a general release of claims in favor of the Company in form approved by the Company.\n\nIn addition, in the event a Named Executive Officer's payments under the Severance Plan would be subject to an excise tax on 'parachute payments' in connection with a change in control of the Company due to the application of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the Named Executive Officer will not be entitled to a 'gross-up.' Instead, the Named Executive Officer's 'parachute payments' may be reduced if such reduction would provide the Named Executive Officer with a greater post-tax benefit than he or she would receive if the excise taxes were to apply.\n\nFor purposes of the Severance Plan, the terms 'Misconduct' and 'Good Reason' mean the following:\n\n'Misconduct' means (i) the employee's willful failure to substantially perform his or her duties (other than a failure resulting from his or her disability); (ii) the employee's willful failure to carry out, or comply with any lawful and reasonable directive of the Board or his or her immediate supervisor; (iii) the occurrence of any act or omission by the employee that could reasonably be expected to result in (or has resulted in) his or her conviction, plea of no contest, plea of nolo contendere, or imposition of unadjudicated probation for any felony or indictable offense or crime involving moral turpitude; (iv) the employee's commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, misconduct, or breach of fiduciary duty against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their officers, directors, employees, customers, suppliers, insurers or agents; (v) the employee's material breach of any material provision of any written agreement with the Company or any subsidiary; (vi) any action (or inaction) by the employee that 3M reasonably determines constitutes gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duties and responsibilities; or (vii) any other intentional misconduct by the Named Executive Officer that significantly affects the business or affairs of the Company or any subsidiary in an adverse manner.\n\n'Good Reason' means, with respect to a voluntary termination occurring within 18 months following a change in control of the Company, (i) a material diminution in the employee's position, authority, duties or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to the change in control, (ii) a material diminution in the employee's base salary or annual planned cash compensation, or (iii) a material change in the geographic location at which the employee is required to perform services for his or her employer. If the voluntary termination does not occur within 18 months following a change in control, 'Good Reason' means (i) a material diminution in the employee's base salary or annual planned cash compensation, other than an across-the-board reduction that applies to all comparable positions, or (ii) a change in excess of 100 miles in the primary work location at which the employee is required to perform services for his or her employer. For terminations that do not occur within 18 months following a change in control, the employee will be required to provide written notice to the Company of the grounds for a Good Reason termination within 30 days of the initial existence of such grounds, and the Company has 30 days from the date of such notice to cure such circumstances. An employee must terminate employment for Good Reason within 60 days after the first occurrence of the applicable grounds.\n\n## Rights and payments upon a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control\n\nIf the Company terminates a Named Executive Officer's employment for reasons other than Misconduct (or for awards granted prior to May 10, 2016, reasons other than Cause) or if a Named Executive Officer resigns for Good Reason, in any such case within 18 months following a 'change in control event' of the Company (as defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), then in addition to any benefits provided under the Severance Plan described above, all of the Named Executive Officer's outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock units granted under the Company's stock plans will be immediately vested and all of such Named Executive Officer's outstanding performance shares will be prorated and settled in accordance with the terms of the plan.",

As of December 31, 2019, Mr. Roman, Mr. Gangestad, and Ms. Bushman were eligible to retire (as that term is defined for purposes of 3M's stock plans). Mr. Thulin retired from employment with the Company effective as of June 1, 2019, and Dr. Delgado's employment with the Company ended on July 1, 2019. The amounts shown below do not reflect payments and benefits available under the Severance Plan, as it was not in effect on December 31, 2019.",

Under such plan, individuals first appointed to an executive position on or before August 31, 2003, receive additional life insurance coverage that is provided through a universal life insurance policy and individuals first appointed on or after September 1, 2003, receive additional group term life insurance coverage.\n- (5) The amount shown reflects the payment made to Dr. Delgado under the terms of a separation agreement. For more information concerning the arrangement with Dr. Delgado, see the section entitled 'Separation pay' on page 61 of this Proxy Statement.\n\n## Pay ratio\n\nPresented below is the ratio of annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our CEO) for 2019. The ratio reflects a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIn determining the ratio below, we began by using the same median employee (a full-time production employee in the Midwestern United States) identified for purposes of calculating the ratio included in our 2018 and 2019 proxy statement because there have not been changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. The median employee initially was identified based on target annual total cash compensation for each employee as of December 31, 2017. For these purposes, annual total cash compensation included base salary or hourly wages, cash incentives, commissions, and comparable cash elements of compensation in non-U.S. jurisdictions and was calculated using internal human resources records. All amounts were annualized for permanent employees who did not work for the entire year, such as new hires, employees on paid or unpaid leave of absence and employees called for active military duty. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation.\n\nThe median employee was selected from among 90,823 full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal workers who were employed as of December 31, 2017. As permitted by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we excluded 1,575 employees (including 966 non-U.S. employees) who joined the Company during 2017 as part of our acquisition of Scott Safety when making this determination. Except for the employees excluded on the basis of the Scott Safety acquisition completed in 2017, we did not exclude any other employees (whether pursuant to the de minimis exemption for foreign employees or any other permitted exclusion).\n\nAs determined in accordance with Item 402 of Regulation S-K, the 2019 annual total compensation was $18,321,566 for our CEO and $57,494 for our median employee. Among other things, these amounts include base salary, overtime, incentive payments, stock-based compensation (based on the grant date fair value of awards granted during 2019), changes in pension values and retirement plan contributions. As calculated in this manner, the ratio of our CEO's total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal year 2019 is 319 to 1.",

The Proponent has requested that the Company include the following proposal and supporting statement ( in italics ) in its proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The proposal may be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by the Proponent or the Proponent's qualified representative. For the reasons set forth following the Proponent's statement, your Board of Directors recommends that you vote 'AGAINST' this proposal.\n\nRESOLVED: Shareholders of 3M Corporation (the 'Company'') request that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors take into consideration the pay grades and/or salary ranges of all classifications of Company employees when setting target amounts for CEO compensation. The Compensation Committee should describe in the Company's proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings how it complies with this requested policy. Compliance with this policy is excused if it will result in the violation of any existing contractual obligation or the terms of any existing compensation plan.\n\n## SUPPORTING STATEMENT\n\nLike at many companies, our Company's Compensation Committee uses peer group benchmarks of what other companies pay their CEOs to set its target CEO compensation. These target pay amounts are then subject to performance adjustments. To ensure that our Company's CEO compensation is reasonable relative to our Company's overall employee pay philosophy and structure, we believe that the Compensation Committee should also consider the pay grades and/or salary ranges of Company employees when setting CEO compensation target amounts.\n\nThis proposal does not require the Compensation Committee to use other employee pay data in a specific way to set CEO compensation targets. Under this proposal, the Compensation Committee will have discretion to determine how other employee pay should impact CEO compensation targets. The Compensation Committee also will retain authority to use peer group benchmarks and/or any other metric to set CEO compensation target amounts. Over time, using peer group benchmarks to set CEO compensation can lead to pay inflation. Although many companies target CEO compensation at the median of their peer group, certain companies have targeted their CEO's pay above median. In addition, peer groups can be cherry-picked to include larger or more successful companies where CEO compensation is higher.

        "page_content": "The current system of using peer group benchmarks, without taking into account the pay grades or salary ranges of all company employees, when determining CEO compensation has had the effect of CEO pay far outpacing that of average employees. In 2018, the average S&P 500 CEO made 287 times that of their median employee. For our Company, the CEO/median employee ratio calculated in 2018 was 302 to 1. According to the 2006 report The State of Working America the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay has risen from 35 to 1 in 1979, to 71 to 1 in 1989, to 248 to 1 in 1998. The current system of determining CEO compensation without taking into account the pay of average company employees has led to glaring inequality between the workers who make our company what it is and the man or woman who sits at the top.\n\nFor those reasons, we urge you to vote in favor of this proposal.\n\n## Board's statement opposing the proposal\n\nAfter careful consideration, and for the reasons set forth below, the Board believes that it is not in the best interests of 3M or its shareholders to approve the proposed resolution.\n\n- 1. The Company already maintains global compensation principles that are intended to ensure that its compensation practices are fair and reasonable as applied to both executive and non-executive employees. These principles align with the Company's vision and strategies, balance both individual and enterprise-wide performance and seek to provide competitive wages and benefits with consistent positioning in the median range of the markets that are most relevant to employees based on roles, responsibilities, skills, and performance. To monitor and support the effectiveness of this program, the Company also periodically compares its pay components to those of other premier companies, and adjusts them as necessary to stay competitive and attract, retain, and motivate a highly qualified, diverse workforce at all levels throughout the organization, not just for its executives.\n- 2.  The Board of Directors believes that the overwhelming majority of our shareholders support the Company's current executive compensation program. As described in more detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, the current program emphasizes a strong pay-for-performance philosophy and seeks to align the compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers with the interests of long-term 3M shareholders. In 2019, approximately 95 percent of the votes cast on the Company's say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in last year's Proxy Statement.\n- 3.  The Compensation Committee already reviews and considers the ratio of annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our Chief Executive Officer), as reported in the proxy statement, which the Company believes provides a similar perspective to the Compensation Committee at no incremental cost to the Company. 3M has operations and different compensation programs in about 70 countries around the world. Compliance with the proposal would require substantial coordination with local employees in foreign countries to collect and transmit the necessary data on 'all classifications' of the Company's approximately 96,000 employees worldwide, all of which would need to be carefully analyzed and summarized. The Company believes that the time, cost, and resource burden associated with implementing the proposal is not warranted by any incremental benefit that the resulting information may be able to offer.\n\n## RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote  ' AGAINST '  this proposal. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted  ' AGAINST '  this proposal unless a shareholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.",

You must present that proxy and admission ticket, as well as a valid government issued photo identification, at the entrance to the meeting.\n\nOn the day of the meeting, an admission ticket, along with a valid government issued photo identification such as a driver's license or passport, must be presented in order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting.

In the event it is not possible or advisable to hold our Annual Meeting in person, we will publicly announce, as soon as practicable before the meeting, a determination to hold the meeting solely by means of remote communication online. In that event, you or your proxyholder could participate, vote and examine the list of shareholders of record by accessing a designated website using your 16-digit control number. Please monitor our investor relations website at https://investors.3m.com for updated information.\n\n## Information about the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials\n\nWhy did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of the Proxy Materials and not the printed proxy materials?\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission allows companies to furnish their proxy materials to shareholders over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing to many of our shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. In addition, we are providing the notice and proxy materials by e-mail to some of our shareholders who previously consented to electronic delivery of proxy materials. Those shareholders should have received an e-mail containing a link to the website where the proxy materials are available, as well as a link to the proxy voting website. All shareholders receiving the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and to request to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found in the notice. In addition, the notice contains instructions on how you may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or to access them electronically in connection with future distributions of proxy materials. Distributing proxy materials electronically conserves natural resources and reduces the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials.\n\n## Why did I receive a printed copy of the proxy materials and not the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?\n\nWe are providing some of our shareholders, including shareholders who have previously requested to receive paper copies of the proxy materials, with paper copies of the proxy materials instead of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.\n\n## How do I view the proxy materials online?\n\nGo to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions to view the materials. You will need to provide the control number printed in the box marked by the arrow located on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (see example below - the information in the box is an example only - your number will be different and is unique to you).\n\n1234 5678 9012 3456",

As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially:\n\n## Shareholder of Record\n\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with 3M's transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered the shareholder of record of those shares and the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or if you requested paper delivery, a copy of these proxy materials are being sent directly to you by 3M. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to 3M or to vote in person at the meeting. You may also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the heading 'Voting methods.'",

If you hold shares beneficially in street name, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker or other nominee or in person at the Annual Meeting by requesting a legal proxy from your broker or other nominee. If you own shares beneficially as a participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to the trustee. In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.\n\nPlease refer to the summary instructions below and those included on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card or, for shares held in street name, the voting instruction card provided by your broker or other nominee.\n\nThe Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareholders by use of a control number and to allow you to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote by telephone or on the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. Telephone and Internet voting for shareholders of record will be available 24 hours a day, up until 10:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on May 11, 2020. Participants in 3M's Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings Plan may instruct the trustee how to vote their shares via the Internet, by telephone, or by signing and returning the proxy card by 10:59 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on May 10, 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| VOTE BY INTERNET                               | If you have Internet access, you may submit your proxy from any location in the  world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

You may enter a new vote by using the Internet or the telephone or by mailing a new proxy card or new voting instruction card bearing a later date (which will automatically revoke your earlier voting instructions), so long as the new vote is received before the deadlines described above under the heading 'Voting methods.' You may also change your vote by granting a new proxy or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting.\n\n## Counting the vote\n\nIn the election of directors, you may vote 'FOR' or 'AGAINST' one or more of the nominees or you may 'ABSTAIN.' Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. For Proposals 2, 3, and 4, you may vote 'FOR,' 'AGAINST,' or 'ABSTAIN,' but please note that abstentions will have the same effect as a vote 'AGAINST.' If you sign your proxy card or broker voting instruction card but provide no voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. Shares held in your account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan will be voted by the trustee as described in 'Shareholders entitled to vote' beginning on page 97.\n\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes and act as the inspectors of election.\n\n## Confidentiality\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors has a policy that all shareholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify shareholders are to be maintained in confidence. No such document will be available for examination, and the identity and vote of any shareholder will not be disclosed, except as necessary to meet legal requirements and allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of the shareholder vote. The policy also provides that inspectors of election for shareholder votes must be independent and cannot be employees of the Company. Occasionally, shareholders provide written comments on their proxy card that may be forwarded to 3M management.\n\n## Results of the vote\n\nWe will issue a press release announcing the preliminary voting results for items of business properly presented at the meeting and will disclose the results for those items in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days of the Annual Meeting date. The press release with voting results will also be available on our website at www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.jhtml .\n\n## Delivery of documents to shareholders sharing an address\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission rules allow us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to any household not participating in electronic proxy material delivery at which two or more shareholders reside, if we believe the shareholders are members of the same family (a practice called 'householding'). We believe that householding benefits both you and the Company by eliminating duplicate mailings to shareholders living at the same address and by reducing our printing and mailing costs. Each shareholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card.\n\nYour household may have received a single set of proxy materials this year. If you prefer to receive your own copy now or in future years, please request a duplicate set by calling 1-800-579-1639, by going to www.proxyvote.com , by e-mailing sendmaterial@proxyvote.com, or by writing to 3M Company, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Alternatively, if your household received multiple sets of proxy materials this year, and members of your household who are entitled to receive proxy materials would all prefer to receive only a single set of proxy materials, you may submit such a request as specified in the preceding sentence.\n\nIf a broker or other nominee holds your shares, you may continue to receive some duplicate mailings. Certain brokers will eliminate duplicate account mailings by allowing shareholders to consent to such elimination, or through implied consent if a shareholder does not request continuation of duplicate mailings. Since not all brokers and nominees may offer shareholders the opportunity this year to eliminate duplicate mailings, you may need to contact your broker or other nominee directly to discontinue duplicate mailings to your household.",

The list also will be available for ten days prior to the meeting during normal business hours at 3M Center, St. Paul, MN 55144 , by contacting the Secretary of the Company.\n\n## Cost of proxy solicitation\n\n3M will pay for the cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing, and distributing these proxy materials.

In addition to mailing these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by telephone, or by electronic communication by our directors, officers, and employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for these solicitation activities. We have hired Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of votes. We will pay Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. a fee of $20,000 plus expenses for these services. We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to beneficial owners of stock.\n\n## Transfer agent\n\nOur transfer agent is EQ Shareowner Services.

Such proposals must be sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the shareholder to determine when the proposal was received by the Company) to: Ivan K. Fong, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, 3M Company, 3M Center, Building 220-13E-26A, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000. Such proposals must comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulations regarding the inclusion of shareholder proposals in Company sponsored proxy materials, such as the shareholder continuing to own a minimum number of shares until the Annual Meeting and appearing in person or through an authorized representative at the meeting to present the proposal.\n\nAlternatively, shareholders intending to present a proposal at next year's Annual Meeting without having it included in the Company's Proxy Statement must comply with the requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws, a copy of which is available at www.3M.com under Investor Relations - Governance. Our Bylaws require, among other things, that our Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the shareholder no earlier than the close of business on November 25 , 2020, and no later than the close of business on December 25 , 2020. The notice must contain the information required by our Bylaws.\n\nProposals received by the Corporate Secretary after the dates mentioned will not be included in the Proxy Statement or acted upon at next year's Annual Meeting.\n\nBy Order of the Board of Directors.\n\nIvan K. Fong\n\nSenior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\n\n<!-- image -->",

Operating income, net income attributable to 3M (hereafter referred to as 'net income'), and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders (hereafter referred to as 'diluted earnings per share') are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure (excluding special items). Special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the Company's operations. The Company believes that discussion of results excluding special items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe reconciliations provided below reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\n## ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n## (non-GAAP measure)\n\n|                                                   | 2019                   | 2019                                                       | 2019                                                                  | 2019                                      | 2019                                                    | 2019                                                 | 2019                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions,  except per share  amounts) | Reported GAAP  Measure | Adjustment for  Significant Litigation  Related Charges(a) | Adjustment for loss  on deconsolidation  of Venezuelan  subsidiary(b) | Adjustment for  Gas & Flame Sale  Gain(c) | Adjustment for  Fourth Quarter  Restructuring  Items(d) | Adjustment for  Acelity and M*Modal  Acquisitions(e) | Adjusted  Non-GAAP  Measure |\n| Net Sales                                         | $32,136                |                                                            |                                                                       |                                           |                                                         |                                                      | $32,136                     |\n| Operating Income                                  | 6,174                  | 762                                                        | -

        "page_content": "- (g) During the first quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a tax expense of $217 million related to a measurement period adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). In the fourth quarter 2018, 3M finalized the tax impact related to TCJA with a reversal of previously recorded tax expense in the amount of $41 million.\n- (h) In June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $494 million as a result of this divestiture. Additionally, in December 2018, completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration services portion of the business based in Germany and reflected a pre-tax gain of $15 million as a result of this divestiture. Both divestitures were reported within the Company's Electronics and Energy business. During the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture. These actions resulted in a second quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $105 million and a fourth quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates.\n- (i) During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 'TCJA'). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA's transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and was net of remeasurement of 3M's deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA's newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount was subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the net impact of enactment of the TCJA. This item represents a significant charge that impacted the Company's financial results. Income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Because of the TCJA, the Company made a $600 million pension contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. This contribution did not impact 2017 net income, but it did impact Free Cash Flow Conversion and ROIC. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company's operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for this item is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends.\n- (j) Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under GAAP. Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion is meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by 3M's enactment of the TCJA, along with a U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by three percentage points. Refer to the proceeding 'Cash Flows from Operating Activities' section for discussion of additional items that impacted operating cash flow. Refer to the proceeding 'Cash Flows from Investing Activities' section for discussion on capital spending for property, plant and equipment.\n- (k) Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation.",
