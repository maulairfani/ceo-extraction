        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Statement 2020\n\nFortum Corporation (Fortum) has been listed on Nasdaq Helsinki since 18 December 1998. Fortum's industrial sector, according to the Global Industry Classification Standard, is Electric Utilities. The State of Finland is the majority owner in Fortum with 50.76% of the shares as on 31 December 2020.\n\nCorporate governance at Fortum is based on Finnish laws and the company's Articles of Association. Fortum fully complies with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020. The corporate governance statement is issued separately from the operating and financial review, and it has been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee of Fortum's Board of Directors.\n\nFortum prepares the consolidated financial statements and interim reports in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, the Finnish Securities Markets Act, as well as the appropriate Financial Supervision Authority's regulations and guidelines and Nasdaq Helsinki's rules. The company's operating and financial review and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act, Accounting Act, Securities Markets Act, and the opinions and guidelines of the Finnish Accounting Board. The auditor's report covers the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.\n\nThe Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020 is available on the website of the Securities Market Association at 4 www.cgfinland.fi .\n\n## Governing bodies of Fortum\n\nThe decision-making bodies managing and overseeing Fortum's administration and operations are the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors with its two Committees; the Audit and Risk Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and the President and CEO, supported by the Fortum Executive Management.\n\nFurther, Fortum has an informal Advisory Council consisting of representatives of Fortum's stakeholder groups as invited by the Board of Directors. The Advisory Council aims at advancing Fortum's businesses by facilitating a dialogue and exchange of views between\n\nFortum and its stakeholders. In 2020, the Advisory Council consisted of 13 representatives of Fortum's stakeholder groups including three employee representatives.\n\nAs sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy and operations, the highest decision making on sustainability and climaterelated matters falls on the duties of the members of the Board of Directors, who share joint responsibility for these matters. Therefore, Fortum has not established a specific Sustainability Committee for the decision making on economic, environmental and social matters. The Audit and Risk Committee, members of the Fortum Executive Management, and other senior executives support the Board of Directors in the decision-making in these matters, when necessary.\n\n## Governing bodies of Fortum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nThe General Meeting of Shareholders is the highest decision-making body of Fortum. Every shareholder has the right to participate in the General Meeting, propose items to be included on the agenda of the General Meeting and exercise his/her power of decision in the matters belonging to the General Meeting by law, as stipulated in the Finnish Companies Act. Each share entitles to one vote. A shareholder also has the right to ask questions about the matters discussed at the General Meeting of Shareholders. By the end of each financial year, Fortum discloses the date by which a shareholder may propose items to be included on the agenda of the following General Meeting on its Annual General Meeting website.\n\nThe decisions at the General Meeting of Shareholders are primarily made by a simple majority of votes. Such decisions include, for example, resolutions on the adoption of the financial statements, payment of dividends, discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability, appointment of the Board of Directors and the external auditor, and deciding on their remuneration.\n\nIn accordance with Fortum's Articles of Association and the Finnish Companies Act, a notice to convene the General Meeting of Shareholders is issued by the Board of Directors. The notice is delivered no more than three months and no less than three weeks before the General Meeting of Shareholders by publishing the notice on the company's website or in two newspapers chosen by the Board of Directors. The Annual General Meeting is to be held once a year, in June at the latest.\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders shall be held whenever the Board of Directors finds it necessary or when it is required by law to convene such a meeting.",

The Annual General Meeting was held with special arrangements at the company headquarters in Espoo, Finland on 23 April.\n\nNo Extraordinary General Meetings of Shareholders were held in 2020.\n\n## Shareholders' Nomination Board\n\nThe Annual General Meeting held on 9 April 2013 established a permanent Shareholders' Nomination Board. The purpose and task of the Shareholders' Nomination Board is to prepare and present proposals on the remuneration, size and members of the Board of Directors to the General Meeting. In addition, the Shareholders' Nomination Board seeks candidates for potential board members.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board consists of four members, three are appointed by the company's three largest shareholders, who shall appoint one member each. The Chair of the Board of Directors serves as the fourth member. The members are nominated annually, and their term of office ends when new members are nominated to replace them. Fortum's three largest shareholders that are entitled to appoint members to the Shareholders' Nomination Board are determined on the basis of the registered holdings as at the first working day of September in the year concerned. In the event that a shareholder does not wish to exercise its right to appoint a representative, it shall pass the right to the next-largest shareholder. The Shareholders' Nomination Board forwards its proposals for the Annual General Meeting to the Board of Directors by 31 January each year.\n\n## Diversity Principles for the Board of Directors\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board prepares and applies diversity principles for the Board of Directors in line with the Corporate Governance Code. The principles are applied in preparing the proposal\n\nconcerning nomination of board members. The diversity principles include, among others, that the board composition shall include expertise from the geographical areas where Fortum conducts its business, the background profession of the board members shall include such competences that support implementation of Fortum's strategy and that enable board members to challenge management decisions and to exercise an overseeing role. In addition, the board composition shall include both genders. Fortum also complies with the principles issued in the Finnish Government Resolution dated 17 December 2015 on equal gender representation in the boards of listed companies with the aim having been that the board would consist of at least 40% of women and men respectively by 2020. The Shareholders Nomination Board reviews the diversity principles and their implementation annually.\n\nFortum reports on the objectives, actions and progress of the diversity principles in this corporate governance statement. The Shareholders' Nomination Board has applied the diversity principles in preparing the proposal concerning nomination of the board members for the Annual General Meeting 2020 and for the upcoming Annual General Meeting 2021. The Shareholders' Nomination Board deems that the current board composition and the proposed board members for the Annual General Meeting 2021 include all the competences defined in the diversity principles in a well-balanced manner.\n\nThe proposal for the board members for the Annual General Meeting 2021 consists of 4 women and 4 men. The current Board of Directors consists of 4 women and 5 men, corresponding to a ratio of 44.4% and 55.6%.\n\n## Shareholders' Nomination Board prior to the Annual General Meeting 2021\n\nIn September 2020, the following person were appointed to the Shareholders' Nomination Board: Kimmo Viertola, b. 1961, M.Sc. (Econ.), Director General of the Ownership Steering Department, Prime Minister's Office; Jouko P\u00f6l\u00f6nen, b. 1970, M.Sc.

The Chair of the Nomination Board informed the Nomination Board and the company that the Finnish State will propose to the 2021 Annual General Meeting that, given the prevailing exceptional circumstances, increasing the fees of the Board of Directors for the coming period is not justified and proposes the following remuneration of the Board of Directors for the term 2021: Chair: EUR 77,200/year, Deputy Chair: EUR 57,500/year, members: EUR 40,400/ year, and Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, if he/she does not simultaneously act as Chair or Deputy Chair of the Board: EUR 57,500/ year.

Uniper shares Fortum's view on how to prudently steer business activities and on the governance process, although its current steering models and governance processes do not directly have Fortum's practices as their basis. Hence, Uniper's current governance framework, policies and processes are not exactly the same as described in this statement. Thus descriptions on governance and controls processes in this document do not include Uniper.\n\n## The main features of the Internal Control and Risk Management Systems\n\nThe internal control and risk management systems relating to financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and aim at ensuring compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Risk management systems\n\nFortum's Board of Directors approves the Group Risk Policy that defines the objective, main principles and division of responsibilities for risk management. The Group Risk Policy also includes a description of the main features of the risk management process which is applicable to all processes including financial reporting.\n\n## Internal controls in relation to financial reporting\n\nFortum's internal control framework is based on the main elements of the framework introduced by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The controls including financial reporting controls, have been defined based on the main risks in the process. Internal controls are one of the key elements of the Compliance Programme in Fortum, which also covers business ethics and regulatory compliance.\n\n## Financial reporting framework in Fortum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Steering Confirming Group principles and policies Approving external financial reporting                                                               | Board of Directors                                 | Board of Directors                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Monitoring Supervising external financial reporting process Reviewing the external and internal audit work and reporting                               | Audit and Risk Committee                           | Audit and Risk Committee                           |\n| Delegate, execute and monitor Business planning Management reporting Performance reporting                                                             | Fortum Executive Management                        | Fortum Executive Management                        |\n| Design, communication and  monitoring of the control framework Group instructions and Controllers manual Regular controller meetings and expert forums | Risk  Management                                   | IT & Security  application  controls               |\n| Implementing measures and performing the controls Reporting and analysing Assessment of operating effectiveness of controls                            | Divisions, business areas and staff/ service units | Divisions, business areas and staff/ service units |\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe standards, processes and structures in internal control are set through Group policies, Group instructions and the Fortum internal control framework.

The internal control framework defines key controls and minimum\n\nrequirements for the key processes. Corporate Accounting and Control\n\nis responsible for the overall control structure of the financial reporting process. Fortum Controllers' manual defines instructions and guidelines relating to financial reporting.\n\nFortum has a decentralised organisational model, and a substantial degree of authority and responsibility has been delegated to the divisions in the form of control responsibilities.
