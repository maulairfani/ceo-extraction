        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## EXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Apartment Investment and Management Company ('Aimco' or 'the Company') completed the previously announced separation of its business into two, separate and distinct, publicly traded companies, Aimco and Apartment Income REIT Corp. ('AIR'). The separation was effected by way of a pro rata distribution, in which stockholders of Aimco received one share of Class A common stock of AIR for every one share of Class A common stock of Aimco held as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. AIMCO Properties, L.P. ('AIR Operating Partnership') also completed a pro rata distribution of all of the outstanding common limited partnership units of Aimco OP L.P. ('Aimco Operating Partnership' and such units, 'Aimco OP Units') to holders of AIR Operating Partnership common limited partnership units and AIR Operating Partnership Class I High Performance partnership units as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. The transactions described in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the 'Separation.'\n\nNotwithstanding the legal  form  of  the  Separation,  for  accounting  and  financial  reporting  purposes,  Aimco  is  presented  as  being  spun-off  from  AIR.  This presentation  is  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  United  States,  and  is  due  primarily  to  the  relative  significance  of  Aimco's business,  as  measured  in  terms  of  revenues,  net  income,  assets,  and  other  relevant  indicators,  as  compared  to  those  indicators  for  AIR  before  the  Separation. Therefore, Aimco is the accounting spinnee and AIR is considered the divesting entity and treated as the accounting spinnor ('Aimco Predecessor'). A separate capital structure did not exist since the assets, liabilities and operations of Aimco prior to the Separation (Aimco and AIR together, as they existed prior to the Separation, 'Aimco Predecessor') were spread across multiple legal entities. The historical financial statements of Aimco do not represent the financial position and results of operations of one legal entity, but rather a combination of entities under common control that have been 'carved out' from Aimco Predecessor's financial statements.\n\nThis filing combines the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, of Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership. Where it is important to distinguish between the two entities, we refer to them specifically. Otherwise, references to 'we,' 'us,' or 'our' mean collectively Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated entities.\n\nAimco, a Maryland corporation, is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ('REIT'). Aimco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the general partner and directly is the special limited partner of the Aimco Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2020, Aimco owned approximately 93.2% of the legal interest in the common partnership units of the Aimco Operating Partnership and 94.8% of the economic interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership. The remaining 6.8% legal interest is owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Aimco Operating Partnership, Aimco has exclusive control of the Aimco Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nThe Aimco Operating  Partnership  holds  all  of  Aimco's  assets  and  manages  the  daily  operations  of  Aimco's  business.  Pursuant  to  the  Aimco  Operating Partnership agreement, Aimco is required to contribute to the Aimco Operating Partnership all proceeds from the offerings of its securities. In exchange for the contribution of such proceeds, Aimco receives additional interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership with similar terms (e.g., if Aimco contributes proceeds of a stock offering, Aimco receives partnership units with terms substantially similar to the stock issued by Aimco).\n\nWe believe combining the periodic reports of Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 We present our business as a whole, in the same manner our management views and operates the business;\n- \u00b7 We eliminate duplicative disclosure and provide a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosures apply to both Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership; and\n- \u00b7 We save time and cost through the preparation of a single combined report rather than two separate reports.\n\nWe operate Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership as one enterprise, the management of Aimco directs the management and operations of the Aimco Operating Partnership, and Aimco OP GP, LLC, Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner, is member managed by Aimco.\n\nWe believe it is important to understand the few differences between Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership in the context of how Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. Aimco has no assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Aimco Operating Partnership. Also, Aimco is a corporation that issues publicly traded equity from time to time, whereas the Aimco Operating Partnership is a partnership that has no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from stock offerings by Aimco, which are contributed to the Aimco Operating Partnership in exchange for additional limited partnership interests (of a similar type and in an amount equal to the shares of stock sold in the offering), the Aimco Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by its business. These sources include the Aimco Operating Partnership's working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under  its  revolving  credit  facility,  the  issuance  of  debt  and  equity  securities,  including  additional  partnership  units,  and  proceeds  received  from  the  sale  of apartment communities.",

Interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership held by entities other than Aimco, which we refer to as OP Units, are classified within partners'  capital  in  the  Aimco Operating  Partnership's  consolidated  financial  statements  and  as  noncontrolling  interests  in  Aimco's  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Aimco  and  the  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  this  report  provides  separate  consolidated  financial statements for Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership; a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity's stockholders' equity or partners' capital, and earnings per share or earnings per unit, as applicable; and a combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes discrete information related to each entity.\n\nThis report also includes separate Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership are both compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a71350.",

Certain information included in this Annual Report contains or may contain information that is forward-looking, within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding: the ongoing relationship between Aimco and AIR following the Separation; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including our ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental rate and property operating results; the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments, and developments; our ability to meet budgeted costs and timelines, and achieve budgeted rental rates related to our development and redevelopment investments; expectations regarding sales of our apartment communities and the use of proceeds thereof; the availability and cost of corporate debt; and our ability to comply with debt covenants, including financial coverage ratios.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on management's judgment as of this date, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to: the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on Aimco's business and on the global and U.S. economies generally, and the ongoing, dynamic and uncertain nature and duration of the pandemic, all of which heightens the impact of the other risks and factors described herein, and the impact on entities in which Aimco holds a partial interest, and the impact of the coronavirus related lockdown on Aimco's residents, commercial tenants, and operations; real estate and operating risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in the markets in which we operate and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions, including the pace of job growth and  the  level  of  unemployment;  the  amount,  location  and  quality  of  competitive  new  housing  supply;  the  timing  and  effects  of  acquisitions,  dispositions, redevelopments and developments; changes in operating costs, including energy costs; negative economic conditions in our geographies of operation; loss of key personnel;  Aimco's  ability  to  maintain  current  or  meet  projected  occupancy,  rental  rate  and  property  operating  results;  ability  to  meet  budgeted  costs  and timelines,  and,  if  applicable,  achieve  budgeted  rental  rates  related  to  development  and  redevelopment  investments;  expectations  regarding  sales  of  apartment communities and the use of proceeds  thereof;  insurance  risks,  including  the  cost  of  insurance,  and  natural  disasters  and  severe  weather  such  as  hurricanes; financing risks, including the availability and cost of financing; the risk that cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; the risk that earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants, including financial coverage ratios; legal and regulatory risks, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; the terms of laws and governmental regulations that affect us and interpretations  of  those  laws  and  regulations;  possible  environmental  liabilities,  including  costs,  fines  or  penalties  that  may  be  incurred  due  to  necessary remediation  of  contamination  of  apartment  communities  presently  or  previously  owned  by  Aimco;  the  relationship  between  Aimco  and  AIR  (the  'Separate Entities')  after  the  Separation;  the  ability  and  willingness  of  the  Separate  Entities  and  their  subsidiaries  to  meet  and/or  perform  their  obligations  under  any contractual arrangements that were entered into among the parties in connection with the Separation and any of their obligations to indemnify, defend and hold the other party harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities; and the ability to achieve some or all the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Separation; and such other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in filings by the Separate Entities with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn addition, our current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code') and depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.\n\nReaders should carefully review Aimco's financial statements and the notes thereto, as well as the section entitled 'Risk Factors' described in Item 1A of this Annual Report and the other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAs used herein and except as the context otherwise requires, 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' refer to Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership and their consolidated entities, collectively.\n\nCertain financial  and  operating  measures  found  herein  and  used  by  management  are  not  defined  under  Accounting  Principles  Generally  Accepted  in  the United States ('GAAP'). These measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures under the Non-GAAP Measures heading.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## The Company\n\nAimco is a Maryland corporation incorporated on January 10, 1994. On December 15, 2020, Aimco completed the Separation, creating two, separate and distinct, publicly traded companies, Aimco and AIR.\n\nAimco is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ('REIT'). Aimco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the general partner and directly is the special limited partner of the Aimco Operating Partnership, a Delaware Limited Partnership. Aimco conducts all of its business and owns all of its assets through the Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nPlease refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion regarding our business segments.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nAimco benefits from its ownership of a diversified portfolio of stabilized multi-family properties, a safe balance sheet with limited use of corporate credit, access to substantial liquidity, and an embedded pipeline of future investment opportunities.\n\nWe rely on the skills and experience of our team in building a broad portfolio of value-add real estate investments, primarily focused on the multifamily sector and located within the continental United States.  Individual investment strategies include property development, redevelopment, and a wide array of other opportunistic ventures. We plan to fund our investment activities through the redeployment of Aimco equity in combination with debt and third-party equity in order to improve our returns on invested capital and to grow Assets Under Management ('AUM').\n\nGiven our stated strategy, it is expected that at any point in time the value-creation process will be ongoing at numerous of our investments and will therefore be difficult to value. Over time, we expect the Aimco enterprise to produce superior returns on equity on a risk-adjusted basis and it is our plan to do so by:\n\n- \u00b7 Managing and investing in the development and redevelopment of real property\n- Our dedicated team will source and execute development and redevelopment projects across our national platform. Aimco will seek outsized returns on incremental  capital  invested,  for  itself  and  its  partners,  through  our  team's  local  insights  regarding  sub-market  fundamentals,  the  specific  property location, a deep understanding of how best to meet the end users' needs and wants, a disciplined commitment to mitigating risk during the construction process,  and  a  passion  for  quality.    We  believe  that  each  of  these  components  are  critical  to  the  creation  of  an  investment  platform  that  is  both sustainable and viable independent of broader market conditions.\n- \u00b7 Managing and investing in other value-add activities (opportunistic investments)\n- We expect to have a broad set of investment opportunities due to our national platform, management's experience and relationships within the industry, and our longstanding experience in solutions-oriented deal structuring. These opportunities may include, but are not limited to, portfolio acquisitions, programmatic  joint  ventures,  debt  placements,  operational  turnarounds,  and  re-entitlements.  Aimco  will  undertake  such  opportunistic  value-add transactions when warranted by the prospect of outsized risk-adjusted returns.\n- \u00b7 Owning a portfolio of stabilized properties\n\nWe own a geographically diversified portfolio of stabilized properties that produces stable cash flow and serves to balance the risk and highly variable cashflows associated with our portfolio of development and redevelopments and value-add investments.\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining sufficient liquidity and utilizing financial leverage\n\nWe are highly focused on the importance of maintaining ample liquidity and of limiting our exposure to any single investment. On December 31, 2020, our cash on hand plus capacity to borrow on our revolving credit facility equaled $448.7 million.\n\n- We expect to capitalize our activities through a combination of non-recourse property debt, construction loans, third-party equity, and the recycling of Aimco equity, including through retained earnings. We plan to limit the use of recourse leverage, with a strong preference towards property-level debt in order to limit risk to the Aimco enterprise. When warranted, we plan to seek equity capital from joint venture partners to improve our cost of capital, further leverage Aimco equity, reduce exposure to a single investment and, in certain cases, for strategic benefits.\n- \u00b7 Benefiting from a national platform while leveraging local and regional expertise\n\n## PART I",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe have corporate headquarters  in Denver,  Colorado, and  Bethesda,  Maryland.  Our  investment  platform  is  managed  by  experienced  professionals based in four regions: West Coast, Central and Mountain West, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and Southeast. By regionalizing this platform, we are able to leverage the in-depth local market knowledge of each regional leader, creating a comparative advantage when sourcing, evaluating, and executing investment opportunities.\n\n## Competition\n\nThere are many developers, managers, and owners of apartment real estate and underdeveloped land, as well as REITs, private real estate companies, and investors, that compete with us in acquiring, developing, obtaining financing for, and disposing of apartment communities. This competition affects our ability to realize our real estate development and transactional objectives.\n\nIn  addition,  our  apartment  communities  compete  for  residents  with  other  housing  alternatives,  including  other  rental  apartments  and  condominiums,  and single-family homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing, as well as household formation and job creation in a particular area, could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates.\n\n## Taxation\n\n## Aimco\n\nAimco has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), commencing with our initial taxable year, and intends to continue to operate in such a manner. The Code imposes various requirements related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income that must be met in order to continue to qualify as a REIT. If Aimco continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, Aimco will generally not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the 'double taxation' (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.\n\nCertain of our operations, or a portion thereof, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a subsidiary Ccorporation that has not elected REIT status and, as such, is subject to United States federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to perform activities that cannot be performed directly by a REIT.\n\n## The Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nThe Aimco Operating Partnership is treated as a 'pass-through' entity for United States federal income tax purposes and is not subject to United States federal income taxation. Partners in the Aimco Operating Partnership, however, are subject to tax on their allocable share of partnership income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits, regardless of whether the partners receive any actual distributions of cash or other property from the Aimco Operating Partnership during the taxable year. Generally, the characterization of any particular item is determined by the Aimco Operating Partnership rather than at the partner level, and the amount of a partner's allocable share of such item is governed by the terms of the Aimco Operating Partnership's Partnership Agreement. The Aimco Operating Partnership is subject to tax in certain states.\n\n## Regulation\n\n## General\n\nApartment development is subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including those concerning entitlement, building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales, and similar matters apply to or affect the real estate development industry.\n\nApartment communities and their owners are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including those related to real estate broker licensing and regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, activity centers, and other common areas.\n\nChanges in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on communities or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, as well as changes in laws affecting development, construction, and safety requirements, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows from operating activities.\n\nIn addition, existing rent control laws, as well as future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws, or other laws and ordinances regulating multifamily housing, such as eviction moratoriums and governmental lockdowns, may reduce rental revenue or increase operating costs in particular markets.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Environmental\n\nVarious federal, state, and local laws subject real estate owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present. These materials may include lead-based paint, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, and petroleum-based fuels. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such materials. In connection with the ownership of real estate, we could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our real estate, whether currently owned, acquired in the future, or owned in the past. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\n## Corporate Responsibility\n\nOur corporate responsibility is an important part of our business. As with all other aspects of our business, our corporate responsibility program focuses on continuous improvement, to the benefit of our stockholders, our residents, our team members and our communities.\n\n## Team and Culture\n\nOur  team  and  culture  are  keys  to  our  success.  Our  intentional  focus  on  collaborative  and  productive  culture  based  on  respect  for  others  and  personal responsibility is reinforced by a preference for promotion from within. We focus on succession planning and talent development to produce a strong, stable team that is the enduring foundation of our success.  We offer benefits reinforcing our value of caring for each other, including paid time for parental leave, paid time annually to volunteer in local communities, and a bonus structure at all levels of the organization. We also pay full compensation benefits for team members who are actively deployed by the United States military.\n\nWe are responsible for and implement succession planning in all leadership positions, both in the short term and the long term.\n\nWe evaluate team engagement, retention, and efficiency and include those in our goals on which all team members are compensated.  Every team member is surveyed via a third-party, confidential survey on his or her annual anniversary of employment.  The team member engagement score consists of the average of the responses to the questions that comprise the engagement index, on a scale of 1 to 5, for all team members who complete the survey during the year.  Aimco's overall team member engagement score for the 2020 Annual Lifecycle Surveys was 4.42, compared to the target of 4.20.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 52 full-time team members, approximately two-thirds performing development or transactional services with the balance managing  corporate  and  area  functions,  including  debt  and  capital  market  transactions,  legal,  finance,  accounting,  and  other  support  functions.  None  of  our employees are represented by labor unions.\n\nOur focus on our team and culture is recognized externally, as well.  Out of hundreds of participating companies in 2020, we were one of only six recognized as a 'Top Workplace' in Colorado for each of the past eight years, and were one of only two real estate companies to receive a BEST award from the Association for Talent Development in recognition of our company-wide success in talent development, marking our third consecutive year receiving this award.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur combined Annual Report on Form 10-K, our combined Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by Aimco or the Aimco Operating Partnership, and any amendments to any of those reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable through Aimco's website at www.aimco.com. The information contained on Aimco's website is not incorporated into this Annual Report.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nThe risk factors noted in this section, and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report, describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS\n\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could affect our ability to collect rents and late fees from tenants,  and  our  ability  to  evict  tenants,  in  addition  to  having  other  negative  effects  on  our  business,  which  in  turn  could  adversely  affect  our  financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions, local, regional, national, or international health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could negatively impact our tenants and our operations. For example, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global",

The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting a wide variety of measures including states of emergency, mandatory quarantines, required business and school closures, implementing 'shelter in place' orders, and restricting travel. In addition, many cities and states have enacted, or are considering enacting, exceptions to contractual obligations for residents and commercial tenants, including government mandated rent delays or other abatement measures or concessions or prohibitions on lease terminations or evictions. Many experts predict that the outbreak will trigger a period of material global economic slowdown or a global recession.\n\nFactors that have negatively impacted, or would negatively impact, our operations or those of entities in which we hold a partial interest during the COVID-19 pandemic or another health crisis, adverse economic or geopolitical event or dislocation in the credit market include:\n\n- \u00b7 our ability to collect rents and late fees on a timely basis or at all, without reductions or other concessions;\n- \u00b7 our ability to evict residents for non-payment and for other reasons;\n- \u00b7 our ability to ensure business continuity in the event our continuity of operations plan is not effective or improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption;\n- \u00b7 fluctuations in regional and local economies, local real estate conditions, and rental rates;\n- \u00b7 our ability to control incremental costs associated with COVID-19;\n- \u00b7 our ability to dispose of communities at all or on terms favorable to us;\n- \u00b7 our ability to complete developments and redevelopments and other construction projects as planned; and\n- \u00b7 potential litigation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict how significant the impact of this outbreak will be on the global economy, our residents and commercial tenants, our communities, and the operations of entities in which we hold a noncontrolling interest (including our interest in Maximus PM Mezzanine A LLC, the partnership owning the 'Parkmerced Apartments'), or for how long disruptions are likely to continue. The extent of such impact will depend on developments, which are highly uncertain, rapidly evolving and cannot be predicted, including the ability to contain the virus, the duration of measures implemented, and the overall impact of these measures. Such developments, depending on their nature, duration, and intensity, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\n\n## We do not have control over the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments, the operation of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur indirect interest in the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, exposure to the skill and capital of the controlling party and those resulting from the severe downturn in San Francisco rents, the ongoing disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental response, and the current economic situation which may result in all or a portion of the loan not being repaid. Such risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Development, redevelopment, and construction risks could affect our profitability.\n\nDevelopment and redevelopment are subject to numerous risks, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third-party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities;\n- \u00b7 we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material, labor, or other factors and costs, such as litigation and program changes;\n- \u00b7 we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of an apartment community on schedule, resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues;\n- \u00b7 occupancy rates  and  rents  at  an  apartment  community  may  fail  to  meet  our  expectations  for  a  number  of  reasons,  including  changes  in  market  and economic conditions beyond our control and the development of competing communities;",

If market volatility causes economic conditions to remain unpredictable or to trend downwards, we may not achieve our expected returns on properties under development and we could lose some or all of our investments in those properties. In addition, the lead time required to develop, construct, and lease-up a development property may increase, which could adversely impact our projected returns or result in a termination of the development project.\n\nIn addition, we may serve as either the construction manager or the general contractor for our development projects. The construction of real estate projects entails unique risks, including risks that the project will fail to conform to building plans, specifications, and timetables. These failures could be caused by labor strikes, weather, government regulations, and other conditions beyond our control. In addition, we may become liable for injuries and accidents occurring during the construction process that are underinsured.\n\n## Failure to generate sufficient net operating income may adversely affect our liquidity, limit our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures, or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions.\n\nOur ability to fund necessary capital expenditures on our communities depends on, among other things, our ability to generate net operating income in excess of required debt payments and our ability to collect on interest and principal payments due to us pursuant to the terms of our arrangement with AIR relative to their interest in the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures on our communities, we may not be able to preserve the competitiveness of our communities, which could adversely affect their net operating income and long-term value.\n\nOur ability  to  make  payments  to  our  investors  depends  on  our  ability  to  generate  net  operating  income  in  excess  of  required  debt  payments  and  capital expenditure requirements and our ability to collect on interest and principal payments due to us pursuant to the terms of our arrangement with AIR relative to their interest in the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments.

Until we acquire additional sources of development and redevelopment opportunities, we will primarily depend on AIR.  We  may  not  be  successful  in  identifying  additional  opportunities  to  further  diversify  and  increase  our  sources  of  revenue  and  reduce  our  portfolio concentration in the near future or at all. The inability of AIR to source such opportunities for us efficiently or at all, could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Our properties  are  geographically  concentrated  in  California,  Chicago,  Florida,  and  in  the  Northeast  region  of  the  United  States,  which  makes  us  more susceptible to regional and local adverse economic and other conditions than if we owned a more geographically diversified portfolio.\n\nThe majority of our properties are located in California, Chicago, Florida, and in the Northeast region of the United States. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse economic or other conditions in these markets (such as periods of economic slowdown or recession, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases in real estate and other taxes, and the cost of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation), as well as to natural disasters (including earthquakes, storms, and hurricanes), potentially adverse effects of 'global warming,' and other disruptions that occur in these markets (such as terrorist activity or threats of terrorist activity and other events), any of which may have a greater impact on the value of our assets or on our operating results than if we owned a more geographically diversified portfolio.\n\nWe cannot assure you that these markets will grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners, operators, and developers of office, multifamily or retail assets, or future development assets. Our operations may also be affected if competing assets are built in these markets. Moreover, submarkets within our core markets may be dependent upon a limited number of industries. Any adverse economic or other conditions in the Northeast region of the United States or in California, or any decrease in demand for office, multifamily, or retail assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Our development projects may subject us to certain liabilities, and we are subject to risks associated with developing properties in partnership with others.\n\nWe may hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction, engineering, and various other services for development projects. Certain of these contracts may be structured such that we are the principal rather than the agent. As a result, we may assume liabilities in the course of the project and be subjected to, or become liable for, claims for construction defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions by third parties we have engaged.\n\nAdverse outcomes of disputes or litigation could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, particularly if we have not limited the extent of the damages for which we may be liable, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance that we carry. Moreover, our tenants may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a legal matter, in which case we may determine it necessary to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the tenant or customer relationship or to protect our corporate brand. Acting as a principal may also mean that we pay a contractor before we have been reimbursed by our tenants. This exposes us to additional risks of collection in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, or a condominium purchaser default. The reverse can occur as well, where a contractor we have paid files for bankruptcy protection or commits fraud with the funds before completing a project that we have funded in part or in full.\n\nAdditionally,  we  may  use  partnerships  and  limited  liability  companies  to  develop  some  of  our  real  estate  investments.  Acting  through  our  wholly  owned subsidiaries, we typically will be the general partner or managing member in these partnerships or limited liability companies. There are, however, instances in which we may not control or even participate in management or day-to-day operations of these properties. The use of partnerships and limited liability companies involve special risks associated with the possibility that:\n\n- \u00b7 a partner or member may have interests or goals inconsistent with ours;\n- \u00b7 a general  partner  or  managing  member  may  take  actions  contrary  to  our  instructions,  requests,  policies,  or  objectives  with  respect  to  our  real  estate investments;\n- \u00b7 a partner or member could experience financial difficulties that prevent it from fulfilling its financial or other responsibilities to the project; or",

In addition, if the bankruptcy court were to discharge the obligations of our partner or member, it could result in our ultimate liability for the project being greater than originally anticipated.\n\nFurther, disputes between us and a partner may result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent our management from focusing their time and attention on our business.\n\nTo the extent we are a general partner, we may be exposed to unlimited liability, which may exceed our investment or equity in the partnership. If one of our subsidiaries is a general partner of a particular partnership, it may be exposed to the same kind of unlimited liability.\n\n## Development of properties may entail a lengthy, uncertain, and costly entitlement process.\n\nApproval  to  develop  real  property  sometimes  requires  political  support  and  generally  entails  an  extensive  entitlement  process  involving  multiple  and overlapping  regulatory  jurisdictions  and  often  requires  discretionary  action  by  local  governments.  Real  estate  projects  must  generally  comply  with  local  land development  regulations  and  may  need  to  comply  with  state  and  federal  regulations.  We  may  incur  substantial  costs  to  comply  with  legal  and  regulatory requirements. An increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs, or in some cases cause us to determine that the property is not feasible  for  development.  In  addition,  our  competitors  and  local  residents  may  challenge  our  efforts  to  obtain  entitlements  and  permits  for  the development of properties. The process to comply with these regulations is usually lengthy and costly, may not result in the approvals we seek, and can be expected to materially affect our development activities.\n\n## Government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of the development of our communities, increase our expenses or limit our building of apartments or other activities.\n\nVarious local,  state,  and  federal  statutes,  ordinances,  rules,  and  regulations  concerning  building,  health  and  safety,  site  and  building  design,  environment, zoning, sales, and similar matters apply to or affect the real estate development industry. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state, and local policies, rules and regulations, and their interpretations and application.\n\nMunicipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. If municipalities in which we operate take such actions, it could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs, or limiting our ability to operate in those municipalities. These measures may reduce our ability to develop apartment communities and to build and sell other real estate development projects in the affected markets, including with respect to land we may already own, and create additional costs and administration requirements, which in turn may harm our future sales, margins, and earnings.\n\nIn addition, there is a variety of legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state, and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct buildings. Such environmental laws may affect, for example, how we manage storm water runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. In addition, it is possible that some form of expanded energy efficiency legislation may be passed by the U.S. Congress or federal agencies and certain state legislatures, which may, despite being phased in over time, significantly increase our costs of building apartment communities and the sale price to our buyers and adversely affect our sales volumes. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law.\n\nEnergy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent  the  manufacturers  and  suppliers  of  our  materials  are  burdened  with  expensive  cap  and  trade  and  similar  energy-related  taxes  and  regulations.  Our noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations, and other sanctions.\n\nGovernmental  regulation  affects  not  only  construction  activities  but  also  sales  activities,  mortgage  lending  activities,  and  other  dealings  with  consumers. Further, government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews, or investigations of our business",

Further,  we  may  experience  delays  and  increased  expenses  as  a  result  of  legal  challenges  to  our  proposed  communities,  whether  brought  by governmental authorities or private parties.\n\n## Competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes, increase or maintain rents or execute our development strategy.\n\nOur apartment  communities  compete  for  residents  with  other  housing  alternatives,  including  other  rental  apartments  and  condominiums,  and,  to  a  lesser degree,  single-family  homes  that  are  available  for  rent,  as  well  as  new  and  existing  condominiums  and  single-family  homes  for  sale.  Competitive  residential housing,  as  well  as  household  formation  and  job  creation  in  a  particular  area,  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  lease  apartment  homes  and  to  increase  or maintain rental rates.\n\nIn  addition,  there  are  many  developers,  managers,  and  owners  of  apartment  real  estate  and  underdeveloped  land,  as  well  as  REITs,  private  real  estate companies, and investors, that compete with us, some of whom have greater financial resources and market share than us.

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to sell apartment communities or other assets when appropriate.\n\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. REIT tax rules also restrict our ability to sell apartment communities. Thus, we may  not  be  able  to  change  our  portfolio  promptly  in  response  to  changes  in  economic  or  other  market  conditions.  Our  ability  to  dispose  of  apartment communities in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions, including the cost and availability of financing. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Potential liability or other expenditures associated with potential environmental contamination may be costly.\n\nVarious federal, state, and local laws subject real estate owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present in the land or buildings. Potentially hazardous materials may include polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleumbased fuels, lead-based paint, or asbestos, among other materials. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or  was  responsible  for,  the  presence  of  such  materials.  The  presence  of,  or  the  failure  to  manage  or  remediate  properly,  these  materials  may  adversely  affect occupancy at such real estate as well as the ability to sell or finance such real estate. In addition, governmental agencies may bring claims for costs associated with investigation and remediation actions, damages to natural resources, and for potential fines or penalties in connection with such damage or with respect to the improper management of hazardous materials. Moreover, private plaintiffs may potentially make claims for investigation and remediation costs they incur, or personal injury, disease, disability, or other infirmities related to the alleged presence of hazardous materials at an apartment community. In addition to potential environmental liabilities or costs associated with our current real estate, we may also be responsible for such liabilities or costs associated with communities we acquire or manage in the future, or real estate we no longer own or operate.\n\n## Rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability.\n\nState and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates, which may affect our rental  income.  Especially  in  times  of  recession  and  economic  slowdown,  rent  control  initiatives  can  acquire  significant  political  support.  If  rent  controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties, our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected.\n\n## Laws benefiting disabled persons may result in our incurrence of unanticipated expenses.\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ('ADA'), all places intended to be used by the public are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 ('FHAA'), requires apartment communities first occupied after March 13, 1991, to comply with design and construction requirements for disabled access. For those apartment communities receiving federal funds, the Rehabilitation Act  of  1973  also  has  requirements  regarding  disabled  access.  These  and  federal,  state,  and  local  laws  may  require  structural  modifications  to  our  apartment communities or changes in policy/practice, or affect renovations of the communities. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. Although we believe that our apartment communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements, we may incur unanticipated expenses to comply with the ADA, the FHAA, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in connection with the ongoing operation or redevelopment of our apartment communities.\n\n## Moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly.\n\nAlthough we are proactively engaged in managing moisture intrusion and preventing the presence of mold at our apartment communities, it is not unusual for periodic  moisture  intrusion  to  cause  mold  in  isolated  locations  within  an  apartment  community.  We  have  implemented  policies,  procedures,  and  training,  and include  a  detailed  moisture  intrusion  and  mold  assessment  during  acquisition  due  diligence.  We  believe  these  measures  will  manage  mold  exposure  at  our apartment communities and will minimize the effects that mold may have on our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate mold conditions. We have only limited insurance coverage for property damage claims arising from the presence of mold and for personal injury claims related to mold exposure.\n\n## Although we are insured for certain risks, the cost of insurance, increased claims activity, or losses resulting from casualty events may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are insured for a portion of our real estate assets' exposure to casualty losses resulting from fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and other perils, which insurance is subject to deductibles and self-insurance retention. We recognize casualty losses or gains based on the net book value of the affected asset and the amount of any related insurance proceeds. In many instances, the actual cost to repair or replace the apartment community may exceed its net book value and any insurance proceeds. We recognize the uninsured portion of losses as casualty losses in the periods in which they are incurred. In addition, we are self-insured for a portion of our exposure to third-party claims related to our employee health insurance plans, workers' compensation coverage, and general liability exposure. With respect to our exposure to claims of third parties, we establish reserves at levels that reflect our known and estimated losses. The ultimate cost of losses and the impact of unforeseen events",

We purchase insurance to reduce our exposure to losses and limit our financial losses on large individual risks. The availability and cost of insurance are determined by market conditions outside our control. No assurance can be made that we will be able to obtain and maintain insurance at the same levels and on the same terms as we do today. If we are not able to obtain or maintain insurance in amounts, we consider appropriate for our business, or if the cost of obtaining such insurance increases materially, we may have to retain a larger portion of the potential loss associated with our exposures to risks.\n\n## Natural disasters and severe weather may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNatural disasters  such  as  earthquakes  and  severe  weather  such  as  hurricanes  may  result  in  significant  damage  to  our  real  estate  assets.  The  extent  of  our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area. When we have geographic concentration of exposures, a single catastrophe (such as an earthquake) or destructive weather event (such as a hurricane) affecting a region may have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot accurately predict natural disasters or severe weather, or the number and type of such events that will affect us. As a result, our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next. Although we anticipate and plan for losses, there can be no assurance that our financial results will not be adversely affected by our exposure to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather in the future that exceed our previous experience and assumptions.\n\n## We depend on our senior management.\n\nOur success and our ability to implement and manage anticipated future growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts of our senior management team, who have  extensive  market  knowledge  and  relationships,  and  exercise  substantial  influence  over  our  operational,  financing,  acquisition,  and  disposition  activity. Members  of  our  senior  management  team  have  national  or  regional  industry  reputations  that  attract  business  and  investment  opportunities  and  assist  us  in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants, and other industry participants. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain similarly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities, and weaken our relationships  with  lenders,  business  partners,  existing  and  prospective  tenants,  and  industry  participants,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\n\n## We rely on AIR to manage a majority of our properties. If AIR fails to efficiently manage such properties, tenants may not renew their leases, or we may become subject to unforeseen liabilities.\n\nA majority of our properties are managed by AIR. We do not supervise AIR or its managers and employees on a day-to-day basis and we cannot assure you that they will manage such properties in a manner that is consistent with their obligations under our agreements, that they will not be negligent in their performance or engage in any criminal or fraudulent activity, or that they will not otherwise default on their management obligations to us. If any of the foregoing occurs, the relationships with our tenants at such properties could be damaged, which may cause the tenants not to renew their leases, and we could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to the properties or to persons at the properties. If we are unable to lease the properties or we become subject to significant liabilities as a result of AIR's management performance, our financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\n\n## In addition to property management services, we depend on AIR to support certain of our property's operations, and any adverse changes in the financial health of AIR or our relationship with it could hinder AIR's ability to successfully manage our operations.\n\nWe are dependent on AIR to support certain  of  our  property's  operations  pursuant  to  the  Property  Management  Agreement.  Any  adverse  changes  in  the financial condition of AIR, AIR's ability to retain or replace its employees, or our relationship with AIR, could hinder AIR's ability to successfully manage our operations, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Our business and operations would suffer in the event of significant disruptions or cyberattacks of our information technology systems or our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations related to privacy and data protection.\n\nInformation technology, communication networks, and related systems are essential to the operation of our business. We use these systems to manage our vendor relationships, internal communications, accounting and record-keeping systems, and many other key aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks, which also depend on the strength of our procedures and the effectiveness of our internal controls. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks.\n\nDespite system redundancy, risk transfer, insurance, indemnification, the implementation of security measures, required employee awareness training, and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems, and systems maintained by third-party vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number",

This right of first offer and purchase option may discourage third parties from negotiation with us with respect to the sale of our real property and may limit the number of interested buyers, and further may prevent us from receiving the maximum price that we may otherwise have obtained for such properties.\n\n## There may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR.\n\nThere may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR. The Separation was designed to minimize conflicts of interest between us and AIR, however, there can be no assurance that such conflicts don't exist.\n\nAlthough we and AIR each have an independent board of directors and independent management and are incentivized to make decisions that are in the best interests of its respective business, Mr. Considine, along with Messrs. Miller and Stein, serve on both our and AIR's boards of directors, however, such directors will recuse themselves from voting as members of either board of directors during the approval or disapproval of any transactions between the two companies.\n\nThe agreements between us and AIR generally do not limit or restrict AIR or its affiliates from engaging in any business or managing other entities that engage in business of the type conducted by us. Although we and AIR do not generally engage in the same business, AIR and its affiliates may in the future determine to redevelop or develop apartment communities and other real estate assets, some of which may be in close proximity to certain of our apartment communities. Certain business opportunities appropriate for us may also in the future be appropriate for AIR or its affiliates, and we may compete with AIR for certain business opportunities. This may cause us to compete with AIR for business opportunities or result in a change in our current business strategy.\n\nActual,  potential,  or  perceived  conflicts  could  give  rise  to  investor  dissatisfaction,  settlements  with  stockholders,  litigation  or  regulatory  inquiries  or enforcement actions. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential, actual, or perceived conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including causing a reluctance of counterparties  to  do  business  with  us,  a  decrease  in  the  prices  of  our  equity  securities,  and  a  resulting  increased  risk  of  litigation  and  regulatory  enforcement actions.\n\n## Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\n\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. Given our stockholder composition and other factors, it is possible our stockholders or future activist stockholders",

Responding to proxy contests and other actions by such activist stockholders or others would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management team from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential lenders, partners, or others with whom we do business, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING\n\n## Our debt financing could result in foreclosure of our apartment communities, prevent us from making distributions on our equity, or otherwise adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nOn December 16, 2020, we entered into a new revolving secured credit facility. In connection with the Separation, certain of our subsidiaries retained existing secured property-level  debt  equal  to  approximately  $449.5  million  and  another  became  the  obligator  on  two  notes  payable  to  the  subsidiaries  of  AIR  with  an aggregated  principal  amount  equal  to  approximately  $534.1  million  ('Notes  Payable  to  AIR').  Over  time,  we  may  become  party  to  one  or  more  additional financing arrangements, including credit facilities or other bank debt, bonds, and mortgage financing.\n\nIn connection with such financing activities, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that our indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of thenexisting  indebtedness.  If  we  fail  to  make  required  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  our  non-recourse  debt,  our  lenders  could  foreclose  on  the  apartment communities and other collateral securing such debt, which would result in the loss to us of income and asset value. As of December 31, 2020, a significant number of our apartment communities are encumbered by property debt or serve as collateral for the Notes Payable to AIR. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur, and we have significant amounts of debt outstanding. Payments of principal and interest may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our communities or pay distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT.\n\n## Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing and the cost of available financing and could adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing and the cost of such financing depends on the overall condition of the United States credit markets. During periods of economic uncertainty,  the  United  States  credit  markets  may  experience  significant  liquidity  disruptions,  which  may  cause  the  spreads  on  debt  financings  to  widen considerably and make obtaining financing, both non-recourse property debt and corporate borrowings such as those under our credit facilities, more difficult. In particular, apartment borrowers have benefited from the historic willingness of the Federal National Mortgage Association ('Fannie Mae'), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ('Freddie Mac'), to make substantial amounts of loans secured by multifamily properties, even in times of economic distress. These two lenders are federally chartered and subject to federal regulation, which is subject to change, making uncertain their prospects and ability to provide liquidity in a future downturn.\n\nIf  our  ability  to  obtain  financing  is  adversely  affected,  we  may  be  unable  to  satisfy  scheduled  maturities  on  existing  financing  through  other  sources  of liquidity,  which could result in lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt and loss of income and asset value, both of which would adversely affect our liquidity.\n\n## Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and reduce our profitability, and the potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.\n\nOur new revolving secured credit facility contains variable-rate interest and may be based, in part, on LIBOR. An increase or decrease in LIBOR would likely increase or decrease our interest expense. An increase in interest expense may affect our profitability.\n\nIn addition, in July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation  of  LIBOR  after  2021.  In  2018,  the  Alternative  Reference  Rates  Committee  identified  the  Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate  ('SOFR'),  as  the alternative to LIBOR. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement remains a question, and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Due to the broad use of LIBOR as a reference rate, all financial market participants, including us, are impacted by the risks associated with this transition. To the extent any of our new revolving secured credit facility is expected to have a variable-rate interest based, in part, on LIBOR and, if LIBOR is no longer available, an alternative benchmark index will likely be proposed to replace it. Accordingly, any of these proposals or the resulting consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, and as a result, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.",

These may include covenants that limit our operations  or  impact  our  ability  to  make  distributions  or  other  payments  unless  certain  financial  tests  or  other  criteria  are  satisfied,  as  well  as  certain  other customary affirmative and negative covenants.\n\n## We may increase leverage in executing our development plan, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\n\nWe may decide to increase our leverage to execute our development plan. We will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. Although our credit facilities may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, our  governing  documents  do  not  limit  the  amount  of  debt  we  may  incur,  and  we  may  change  our  target  debt  levels  at  any  time  without  the  approval  of  our stockholders. We may incur additional indebtedness from time to time in the future to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our indebtedness could intensify.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION\n\n## We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Separation.\n\nFollowing the Separation, we and AIR are two, focused and independent companies. We may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a company independent from AIR in the time we expect, if at all. For instance, it may take longer than anticipated for us to, or we may never, succeed in growing our revenues through our development and redevelopment business.\n\n## The Separation could give rise to disputes or other unfavorable effects, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with AIR, effective as of December 15, 2020 (the 'Separation Agreement'), which, among other things, contains the agreements among the parties regarding the principal transactions necessary to effect the Separation. It also sets  forth  other  agreements  that  govern  certain  aspects  of  the  parties'  ongoing  relationship  after  the  completion  of  the  Separation.  The Separation may lead to increased operating and other expenses, of both a nonrecurring and a recurring nature, and to changes to certain operations, which expenses or changes could arise pursuant to arrangements made between AIR and us or could trigger contractual rights of, and obligations to, third parties. Disputes with third parties could also arise  out  of  these  transactions,  and  we  could  experience  unfavorable  reactions  to  the  Separation  from  employees,  lenders,  ratings  agencies,  regulators,  OP unitholders or other interested parties. These increased expenses, changes to operations, disputes with third parties or other effects could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, following the Separation, disputes with AIR could arise in connection with each of the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Property Management Agreements, the Master Services Agreement, the Master Leasing Agreement, or certain other agreements.\n\n## Although we have endeavored to enter into agreements on market terms, our agreements with AIR may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm'slength negotiations with unaffiliated third parties.\n\nThe agreements related to the Separation, including the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Property Management Agreements, the Master Services Agreement, the Master Leasing Agreement, and certain other agreements were entered into in the context of the Separation while both companies were under common control. As a result, although we endeavored to enter into these agreements on market terms, they may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements entered into in the context of the Separation concern, among other  things,  allocation  of  assets  and  liabilities  attributable  to  periods  prior  to  the  Separation  and  the  rights  and  obligations,  including  certain  indemnification obligations, of AIR and us after the Separation, certain services provided by us to AIR and by AIR to us after the Separation, and our lease from AIR of the Initial Leased Properties.\n\n## Following the Separation, we may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company.\n\nFollowing  the  Separation,  AIR  hired  substantially  all  of  Aimco's  existing  employees  (including  Aimco's  existing  property  management  employees),  and Aimco  retained  approximately  50  employees.  We  have  no  significant  historical  operations  as  a  company  independent  from  AIR  and  did  not,  following  the Separation, have the infrastructure or personnel necessary to operate as an independent company without relying on AIR to provide certain services (such as those related to technology, payroll, etc.) on an ongoing basis. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Master Services Agreement with AIR pursuant to which AIR will provide certain services to us to allow us to benefit from certain cost efficiencies in sharing certain resources",

As a separate publicly traded company, Aimco is subject to, and responsible for, regulatory compliance, including periodic public filings with the SEC and compliance with the NYSE continued listing requirements as well as compliance with generally applicable tax and accounting rules, certain elements of which may rely on services provided by AIR under the Master Services Agreement. Because our business has not been operated as a separate company, we cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully implement the infrastructure or retain or hire the personnel necessary to operate as a separate company or that we will not incur costs in excess of anticipated costs to establish such infrastructure and retain or hire such personnel. Because we will not be permitted under the terms of the Master Services Agreement to terminate certain services before the completion of the applicable term, we may be obligated to pay rates for the services higher than those a third party would have paid or that we could have provided to ourselves.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\n## Aimco may fail to qualify as a REIT .\n\nIf Aimco fails to qualify as a REIT, Aimco will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and will be subject  to  United  States  federal  income  tax  at  regular  corporate  rates.  This  would  substantially  reduce  our  funds  available  for  general  corporate  usage  or  for distribution to our investors. Unless entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, Aimco also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, Aimco's failure to qualify as a REIT may place us in default under our credit facilities.\n\nWe believe that Aimco operates, and has since its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, operated, in a manner that enables it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. However, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited  judicial  and  administrative  authorities  exist.  Moreover,  even  a  technical  or  inadvertent  mistake  could  jeopardize  our  REIT  status.  Aimco's  continued qualification  as  a  REIT  will  depend  on  its  satisfaction  of  certain  asset,  income,  investment,  organizational,  distribution,  stockholder  ownership,  and  other requirements on a continuing basis. Aimco's ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we do not obtain independent appraisals. Aimco's compliance with the REIT annual income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the 'IRS'), will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or other issuers constitutes a violation of the REIT requirements. Moreover, future economic, market, legal, tax, or other considerations may cause Aimco to fail to qualify as a REIT, or the board of directors of Aimco may determine to revoke its REIT status.\n\n## REIT distribution requirements limit our available cash.\n\nAs a REIT, Aimco is subject to annual distribution requirements. Aimco pays distributions, including taxable stock dividends, intended to enable Aimco to satisfy its distribution requirements. This limits the amount of cash available for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. Aimco generally must distribute annually at least 90% of its 'real estate investment trust taxable income,' which is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, in order for its distributed earnings not to be subject to United States federal corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to Aimco's stockholders to comply with the requirements applicable to REITs under the Code (which may be all cash or combination of cash and stock satisfying the requirements of applicable law). However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income  and  the  actual  receipt  of  cash  could  require  us  to  sell  apartment  communities  or  borrow  funds  on  a  short-term  or  long-term  basis  to  meet  the  90% distribution requirement of the Code.\n\n## Aimco may be subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in certain circumstances.\n\nEven as a REIT, Aimco may be subject to United States federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on its undistributed income. Aimco could also be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm's-length transactions between Aimco and a taxable REIT subsidiary ('TRS') and on any net income from sales of apartment communities that were held for sale primarily in the ordinary course. State and local tax laws may not conform to the United States federal income tax treatment, and Aimco may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions in which Aimco transacts business. Any taxes imposed on Aimco would reduce our operating cash flow and net income and could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends and distributions.\n\n## Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\n\nREITs are entitled to a United States federal tax deduction for dividends paid to their stockholders. As compared to other taxable corporations, this ability to reduce or eliminate the REIT's taxable income by paying dividends to stockholders is a",

Notwithstanding  this  combined  benefit,  dividends  payable  by  REITs  may  result  in marginally higher taxes to the stockholder.\n\nC-corporations are generally required to pay United States federal income tax on earnings. After tax earnings are then available for stockholder dividends. The maximum United States federal tax rate applicable to income from 'qualified dividends' payable to United States stockholders that are individuals, trusts, and estates is currently 20%, plus the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. While dividends payable by REITs are generally not eligible for the qualified dividend reduced rates, stockholders that are individuals, trusts, or estates, and meet certain requirements, may generally deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary dividends from REITs. This deduction is available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, and will generally cause the maximum tax rate for ordinary dividends from REITs to be 29.6%, plus the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. The more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts, and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including Aimco Common Stock.\n\n## Complying with the REIT requirements may cause Aimco to forgo otherwise attractive business opportunities.\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, Aimco must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts distributed to Aimco stockholders, and the ownership of Aimco stock. As a result of these tests, Aimco may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when Aimco does not have funds readily available for distribution, forgo otherwise attractive investment opportunities, liquidate assets in adverse market conditions, or contribute assets to a TRS that is subject to regular corporate federal income tax.\n\n## Changes to United States federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect Aimco and Aimco's stockholders.\n\nThe present United States federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial, or administrative action at any time, which could affect the United States federal income tax treatment of an investment in Aimco Common Stock. The United States federal income tax rules dealing with REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, and the United States Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect Aimco or Aimco's stockholders. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect Aimco's ability to qualify as a REIT and the tax considerations relevant to an investment in Aimco Common Stock, or could cause Aimco to change its investments and commitments.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO AIMCO OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS\n\nThere are restrictions on the ability to transfer and redeem Aimco Operating Partnership Units, there is no public market for Aimco Operating Partnership Units and holders of Aimco Operating Partnership Units are subject to dilution.\n\nThe Aimco Operating Partnership agreement restricts the transferability of Aimco Operating Partnership Units ('OP Units'). Until the expiration of a one-year holding period, subject to certain exceptions, investors may not transfer OP Units without the consent of Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner. Thereafter, investors may transfer such OP Units subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the general partner's right of first refusal. In addition, after the expiration of the one-year holding period, investors have the right, subject to the terms of Aimco Operating Partnership's agreement, to require Aimco Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of such investor's OP Units (in exchange for shares of Aimco Common Stock or cash, in Aimco Operating Partnership's discretion) once per quarter on an exchange date set by Aimco Operating Partnership, provided such investor provides notice at least 45 days prior to the quarterly exchange  date.  See  'Description  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  Units  and  Summary  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  Agreement-Redemption  Rights  of Qualifying Parties'. There is no public market for the OP Units. Aimco Operating Partnership has no plans to list any OP Units on a securities exchange. It is unlikely that any person will make a market in the OP Units, or that an active market for the OP Units will develop. If a market for the OP Units develops and the OP Units are considered 'readily tradable' on a 'secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof),' Aimco Operating Partnership would be classified as a publicly traded partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could have a material adverse effect on Aimco Operating Partnership and its unitholders.\n\nIn addition, Aimco Operating Partnership may issue an unlimited number of additional OP Units or other securities for such consideration and on such terms as it  may  establish,  without  the  approval  of  the  holders  of  OP  Units.  Such  securities  could  have  priority  over  the  OP  Units  as  to  cash  flow,  distributions,  and liquidation proceeds. The effect of any such issuance may be to dilute the interests of holders of OP Units.",

There can be no assurance regarding the amounts of available cash that Aimco Operating Partnership will generate or the portion that its general partner will choose to distribute. The actual amounts of available cash will depend upon numerous factors, including profitability of operations, required principal and interest payments on its debt, the cost of acquisitions (including related debt service payments), its issuance of debt and equity securities, fluctuations in working capital, capital expenditures, adjustments in reserves, prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business, and other factors, some of which may be beyond Aimco Operating Partnership's control. Cash distributions depend primarily on cash flow, including from reserves, and not on profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. Therefore, cash distributions may be made during periods when the Aimco Operating Partnership records losses and may not be made during periods when it records profits. The Aimco Operating Partnership agreement gives the general partner discretion in establishing reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership's business that will affect the amount of available cash. Aimco Operating Partnership may be required to make reserves for the future payment of principal and interest under its credit facilities and other indebtedness. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership's credit facilities may limit its ability to distribute cash to holders of OP Units. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance regarding actual levels of cash distributions on OP Units, and Aimco Operating Partnership's ability to distribute cash may be limited during the existence of any events of default under any of its debt instruments.\n\n## Holders of Aimco OP Units have limited voting rights and are limited in their ability to effect a change of control.\n\nAimco Operating Partnership is managed and operated by its general partner, Aimco. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, holders of OP Units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting Aimco Operating Partnership's business. Such matters relate to certain amendments of the partnership agreement and certain transactions such as the institution of bankruptcy proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors and certain transfers by the general partner of its interest in Aimco Operating Partnership or the admission of a successor general partner. Holders of OP Units have no right to elect the general partner on an annual or other continuing basis, or to remove the general partner. As a result, holders of OP Units have limited influence on matters affecting the operation of Aimco Operating Partnership, and third parties may find it difficult to attempt to gain control over, or influence the activities of, Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nThe limited partners of Aimco Operating Partnership are unable to remove the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership or to vote in the election of Aimco's directors unless they own shares of Aimco. In order to comply with specific REIT tax requirements, Aimco's charter has restrictions on the ownership of its equity securities. As a result, Aimco Operating Partnership limited partners and Aimco stockholders are limited in their ability to effect a change of control of Aimco Operating Partnership and Aimco, respectively.\n\n## Holders of OP Units may not have limited liability in specific circumstances.\n\nThe limitations  on the  liability  of  limited  partners  for  the  obligations  of  a  limited  partnership  have  not  been  clearly  established  in  some  states.  If  it  were determined that Aimco Operating Partnership had been conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute, or that the right or the exercise of the right by the holders of OP Units as a group to make specific amendments to the agreement of limited partnership or to take other action under the agreement of limited partnership constituted participation in the 'control' of Aimco Operating Partnership's business, then a holder of OP Units could be held liable under specific circumstances for Aimco Operating Partnership's obligations to the same extent as the general partner.\n\n## Aimco may have conflicts of interest with holders of OP Units.\n\nConflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership and its affiliates (including Aimco), on the one hand, and Aimco Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. The directors and officers of the general partner have fiduciary duties to manage the general partner in a manner beneficial to Aimco, as the sole stockholder of the general partner. At the same time, as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, it has fiduciary duties to manage Aimco Operating Partnership in a manner beneficial to Aimco Operating Partnership and its limited partners. The duties of the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership to Aimco Operating Partnership and its partners may therefore come into conflict with the duties of the directors and officers of the general partner to its sole stockholder, Aimco. Such conflicts of interest might arise in the following situations, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 decisions of the general partner with respect to the amount and timing of cash expenditures, borrowings, issuances of additional interests and reserves in any quarter, will affect whether or the extent to which there is available cash to make distributions in a given quarter;",

Neither  the  Aimco  Operating  Partnership agreement nor any of the other agreements, contracts, and arrangements between Aimco Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership and its affiliates, on the other, are or will be the result of arm's-length negotiations.\n\n## Provisions in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement may limit the ability of a holder of OP Units to challenge actions taken by the general partner.\n\nDelaware law provides that, except as provided in a partnership agreement, a general partner owes the fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the partnership and  its  limited  partners.  The  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  agreement  expressly  authorizes  the  general  partner  to  enter  into,  on  behalf  of  Aimco  Operating Partnership, a right of first opportunity arrangement and other conflict avoidance agreements with various affiliates of Aimco Operating Partnership and the general partner, on such terms as the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, believes are advisable. The latitude given in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement to the general partner in resolving conflicts of interest may significantly limit the ability of a holder of OP Units to challenge what might otherwise be a breach of fiduciary duty. The general partner believes, however, that such latitude is necessary and appropriate to enable it to serve as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership without undue risk of liability.\n\nThe  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  agreement  limits  the  liability  of  the  general  partner  for  actions  taken  in  good  faith.  Aimco  Operating  Partnership's partnership agreement expressly limits the liability of the general partner by providing that the general partner, and its officers and directors, will not be liable or accountable  in  damages  to  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  the  limited  partners,  or  assignees  for  errors  in  judgment  or  mistakes  of  fact  or  law  or  of  any  act  or omission if the general partner or such director or officer acted in good faith. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership is required to indemnify the general partner, its  affiliates,  and  their  respective  officers,  directors,  employees, and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,  joint  or  several,  expenses,  judgments,  fines,  and  other  actions  incurred  by  the  general  partner  or  such  other  persons,  provided  that  Aimco Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (i) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law or (ii) for any transaction for which such person received an improper  personal  benefit  in  violation  or  breach  of  any  provision  of  the  partnership  agreement.  The  provisions  of  Delaware  law  that  allow  the  common  law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and the general partner has not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict the fiduciary duties of the general partner that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries may be prohibited from making distributions and other payments.\n\nAll of Aimco Operating Partnership's real estate assets are owned by subsidiaries of Aimco Operating Partnership. As a result, Aimco Operating Partnership depends on distributions and payments from its subsidiaries in order to satisfy our financial obligations and make payments to our equity holders, as applicable. The ability of Aimco Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to make such distributions and other payments depends on their earnings and cash flows and may be  subject  to  statutory  or  contractual  limitations.  As  an  equity  investor  in  the  REIT  subsidiaries  and  our  subsidiaries,  our  right  to  receive  assets  upon  their liquidation or reorganization are effectively subordinated to the claims of their creditors and any holders of preferred equity senior to our equity investments. To the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiaries, our claims may still be subordinate to any security interest in or other lien on their assets and to any of their debt or other obligations that are senior to our claims.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\n## Aimco\n\nAimco's Common Stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol 'AIV.'\n\nOn March 10, 2021, there were 149,208,479 shares of Common Stock outstanding, held by 757 stockholders of record. The number of holders does not include individuals or entities  who beneficially  own shares but whose shares are held of record by a broker or clearing agency, but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one record holder.\n\n## Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities\n\nFrom time to time, we may issue shares of Common Stock in exchange for OP Units, defined under The Aimco Operating Partnership heading below. Such shares are issued based on an exchange ratio of one share for each common OP Unit. Please refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further  discussion  of  such  exchanges.  We  may  also  issue  shares  of  Common  Stock  in  exchange  for  limited  partnership  interests  in  consolidated  real  estate partnerships. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we did not issue any shares of Common Stock in exchange for OP Units or limited partnership interests in consolidated real estate partnerships.\n\n## Repurchases of Equity Securities\n\nThere were no repurchases by Aimco of its common equity securities during the three months ended December 31, 2020. Aimco's Board of Directors has, from time to time, authorized Aimco to repurchase shares of its outstanding Common Stock. As of December 31, 2020, Aimco was authorized to repurchase approximately 10.4 million shares. This authorization has no expiration date. These repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.\n\n## The Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nInterests in the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than Aimco are referred to as OP Units. OP Units are common partnership units ('common OP Units'). There is no public market for OP Units, and we have no intention of listing the common partnership units on any securities exchange. In addition, the Aimco Operating Partnership's Partnership Agreement restricts the transferability of OP Units.\n\nOn March 10, 2021, there were 159,938,614 common partnership units and equivalents outstanding (149,208,479 of which were held by Aimco) that were held by 2,284 unitholders of record.\n\n## Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities\n\nWe did not issue any unregistered OP units during the three months ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Repurchases of Equity Securities\n\nThe Aimco Operating Partnership's Partnership Agreement generally provides that after holding common OP Units for one year, limited partners other than Aimco have the right to redeem their common OP Units for cash or, at our election, shares of Aimco Common Stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary antidilution  adjustments).  No  common  OP  Units  held  by  Limited  Partners  were  redeemed  for  shares  of  our  Common  Stock  during  the  three  months  ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Dividend and Distribution Payments\n\nAs a REIT, Aimco is required to distribute annually to holders of its Common Stock at least 90% of its 'real estate investment trust taxable income,' which, as defined by the Code and United States Department of Treasury regulations, is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income. Aimco's Board of Directors determines and declares its dividends. In making a dividend determination, Aimco's Board of Directors considers a variety of factors, including REIT distribution requirements; current market conditions; liquidity needs; and other uses of cash, such as for deleveraging and accretive investment activities. Aimco's Board of Directors has not declared a dividend payment, nor have they set the expectation for any future regular dividend payments.",

With respect to certain non-United States stockholders, Aimco may be required to withhold United States tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in Common Stock.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner determines and declares distributions on OP Units. Aimco, through a whollyowned subsidiary, is the sole general partner. As of December 31, 2020, Aimco owned approximately 93.2% of the legal interest in the common partnership units of  the  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  and  94.8%  of  the  economic  interest  of  the  Aimco  Operating  Partnership.  The  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  holds  all  of Aimco's assets and manages the daily operations of Aimco's business. The distributions paid by the Aimco Operating Partnership to Aimco are used by Aimco to fund the dividends paid to its stockholders. Accordingly, the per share dividends Aimco pays to its stockholders generally equal the per unit distributions paid by the Aimco Operating Partnership to holders of its common partnership units.\n\nOur revolving credit agreement includes customary covenants, including a restriction on dividends and other restricted payments, but permits dividends and distributions as may be necessary to maintain Aimco's REIT status.",

The MSCI US REIT Index is published by Morgan Stanley Capital International Inc., a provider of equity indices. The Nareit Equity Apartment Index is published by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ('Nareit'), a representative of real estate investment trusts and publicly traded real estate companies with interests in United States real estate and capital markets. The MSCI US REIT Index reflects total shareholder return for a broad range of REITs and the Nareit Equity Apartment Index provides a more direct multifamily peer comparison of total shareholder return.  The  indices  are  weighted  for  all  companies  that  fit  the  definitional  criteria  of  the  particular  index  and  are  calculated  to  exclude  companies  as  they  are acquired and to add companies to the index calculation as they become publicly traded companies. All companies that fit the definitional criteria and existed at the point  in  time  presented  are  included  in  the  index  calculations.  The  graph  assumes  the  investment  of  $100  in  Aimco's  Common  Stock  and  in  each  index  on December 31, 2015, and that all dividends paid have been reinvested.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nOur strategy includes property development, redevelopment, and other opportunistic investments that offer the prospect of outsized returns on a risk-adjusted basis. We invest where the talent of our business professionals, including their local market knowledge and insight, offers a comparative advantage. We deploy a variety  of  project  and  property-level  financing  structures  to  improve  our  returns  on  invested  capital.  Additionally,  we  own  a  national  portfolio  of  operating properties which offers diversification, capital allocation opportunity, and a stable source of cash flow from operations.\n\nPlease refer to 'Item 1. Business' for additional discussion of our business organization and strategy and 'Item 2. Properties' for details regarding the size, location, and key metrics about our various properties.\n\n## The Separation\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Aimco completed the separation of AIR from Aimco, creating two distinct,  independent  businesses.  Prior to the Separation, the consolidated financial statements were prepared on a carve-out basis and reflect significant assumptions and allocations. The consolidated financial statements reflect our historical financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The financial statements of Aimco are presented for all historical periods described and at the carrying value of such assets and liabilities reflected in Aimco Predecessor's books and records. The following discussion focuses on the year ended December 31, 2020 results of Aimco as a separate company from AIR.\n\n## Financial Highlights\n\nNet income attributable to Aimco common stockholders per common share, on a dilutive basis, decreased by $0.03 during the year ending December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, due primarily to non-cash charges resulting from the Separation.\n\nOur business is organized around five areas of strategic focus: development and redevelopment; operating properties; investment and portfolio; balance sheet; and team and culture.\n\n## Development and Redevelopment\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, capital additions at properties retained by Aimco totaled approximately $20 million.\n\nOn December 15, 2020, we entered into leasehold agreements with AIR for four initial leased assets, as announced in the separation agreements. The leasehold agreements with AIR were obtained by Aimco to complete the development and redevelopment activities underway at the time of Separation.  The four assets leased  are:  The  North  Tower  at  Flamingo  Point  in  Miami  Beach,  Florida,  where  we  are  completing  the  major  redevelopment  of  366  apartment  homes  and amenities; The Fremont Residences on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, a new 253 apartment home community completed in late 2020 and currently in lease-up; 707 Leahy Apartments in Redwood City, California, a completed major redevelopment of 110 apartment homes that are currently in lease-up; and Prism in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a 136 apartment home development scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2021. The lease terms commenced on January 1, 2021 and as a result of this, we expect the incremental direct costs to complete the development and redevelopment of these assets to be approximately $70.0 million. Please refer to Note 17 for additional details on the lease agreements with AIR.\n\n## Operating Properties\n\nWe own a national portfolio of operating properties which offers diversification, capital allocation opportunity, and provides a stable source of cash flow. Our Operating Portfolio, notwithstanding headwinds due to the pandemic, produced solid results for the year ended December 31, 2020. Highlights include:\n\n- \u00b7 Average daily  occupancy  at  our  Operating  Portfolio  of  96.3%  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020  and  96.9%  for  the  three  months  ended December 31, 2020, a 190-basis point improvement from the three months ended September 30, 2020.\n- \u00b7 Average revenue per occupied unit at our Operating Portfolio of $1,873 for the year ended December 31, 2020, up 0.1% year over year.\n- \u00b7 Net operating income for our Operating Portfolio decreased by 1.8% year over year, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n- \u00b7 We estimate that in the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $4.5 million of incremental costs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These estimated incremental costs include $1.9 million of lost commercial revenue, $1.3",

In 2020, we collected 98.3% of all amounts owed by Aimco residents.\n\nOffice operations at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, while facing headwinds due to the pandemic, remain steady with occupancy on December 31, 2020 of 77%. In November and December, we collected 100% of rents owed, and we collected an average of 96% of rents owed since April.\n\n## Investment and Portfolio\n\nAcquisitions : During the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired Hamilton on the Bay, located in Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, for $89.6 million. The acquisition  includes  a  271-apartment  home  community  located  on  the  waterfront,  plus  an  adjacent  0.6-acre  development  site  with  four  apartment  homes. Current zoning allows for the construction of more than 380 additional apartment homes on the combined sites. We are now in planning for a substantial renovation of the existing building.\n\nJoint Venture Transaction : During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a third party developer on Upton Place, a $290.0 million, mixed-use development containing 689 apartment homes and approximately 100,000 square feet of retail space in upper-northwest Washington, D.C. Aimco consolidates this joint venture and holds a 90% economic interest inclusive of a 17% position owned by AIR which, by contract, is controlled by Aimco.\n\nParkmerced Mezzanine Investment :  On November 26, 2019, Aimco Predecessor made a five-year, $275.0 million mezzanine loan to a partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments, located in southwest San Francisco (the 'Mezzanine Investment'). The loan bears interest at a 10% annual rate, accruing if not paid from property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Aimco Predecessor received interest payments of $0.6 million and accrued all remaining interest due, as provided by the loan agreement, consistent with GAAP. The terms of the Separation from AIR provide for the mezzanine loan and related agreements to be transferred  to  us  by  AIR  once  third-party  consents  related  to  the  transfer  are  received.  The  legal  transfer  of  the  assets  had  not  occurred  as  of  December  31, 2020.  Until such time as ownership is transferred, the terms of the Separation Agreement require AIR to pass payments on such loan to us, and we are obligated to indemnify AIR against any such costs and expenses related thereto. We have the risks and rewards of ownership of the Mezzanine Investment and have recognized an asset related to our right to receive the Mezzanine Investment from AIR.\n\nThe loan is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, those resulting from the severe downturn in San Francisco rents, the ongoing disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental response, and the current economic situation which may result in all or a portion of the loan not being repaid. In the event we determine that a portion of the Mezzanine Investment is not recoverable, we will recognize an impairment, if appropriate.\n\nLife Science Developer Investment : In the third quarter of 2020, Aimco made a $50 million commitment to IQHQ, Inc. ('IQHQ'), a privately-held life sciences real estate development company.  In addition, Aimco gained the right to collaborate with IQHQ on any multifamily component at its future development sites. As of December 31, 2020, we funded $12.5 million of this commitment and have a remaining commitment of $37.5 million.\n\nThe Aimco team continues to actively source and evaluate a wide range of potential investment opportunities.\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\n## Leverage\n\nWe seek to increase  financial  returns  and  reduce  investment  risk  by  using  leverage  and  partners'  capital  with  appropriate  caution.  Our  leverage  consists primarily of long-term, non-recourse property loans encumbering apartment communities, outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, borrowings on construction loans, Notes Payable to AIR, and a redeemable noncontrolling interest in a consolidated real estate partnership. Please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information regarding our leverage.\n\nIn evaluating our financial condition and operating performance we use non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDAre, which we believe is useful to investors and creditors as a supplemental measure of our ability to incur and service debt. Our Adjusted EBITDAre for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $104.7 million. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section for further information about the calculation of Adjusted EBITDAre and our leverage ratios.\n\n## Financing Activity\n\nOn December 16, 2020, we entered into a three-year credit agreement providing for a new $150.0 million secured credit facility, a $20.0 million swingline loan sub-facility and a $30.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. We expect to use our credit",

As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts drawn on this revolving secured credit facility, swingline loan sub-facility or letter of  credit sub-facility.\n\nOn December 23, 2020, in connection with our Upton Place property, we secured a construction loan of up to $174.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts drawn on this construction loan.\n\nPlease refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our financing activity.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nOur liquidity consists of cash and restricted cash and available capacity on our revolving secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, our total liquidity was $448.7 million. Please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information regarding our leverage.\n\n## Team and Culture\n\nOur team is our most important asset and our culture is key to our success. In connection with the Separation, we retained approximately 50 Aimco employees, including: Wes Powell, Chief Executive Officer; Lynn Stanfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Johnson, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel; each of whom has more than 16 years of Aimco experience. In addition, former Aimco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine will be actively engaged for a transition period with a particular focus on strategic guidance and new business.\n\nAimco benefits from having experienced leaders located in each of four regional hubs where they utilize their local knowledge and connections to source and execute on exceptional investment opportunities. We believe the talent of our team, and our ability to retain that talent through a rewarding and balanced work-life culture, will result in superior outcomes and is key to our long-term success. We offer benefits reflecting this belief, including paid time for parental leave, paid time annually to volunteer in local communities, a bonus structure at all levels of the organization, and flexibility in work locations and schedules.\n\nOut of hundreds of participating companies in 2020, we were one of only six recognized as a 'Top Workplace' in Colorado for each of the past eight years, and were one of only two real estate companies to receive a BEST award from the Association for Talent Development in recognition of our company-wide success in talent development, marking our third consecutive year receiving this award.\n\n## Impacts of COVID-19 and Government Lockdown\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental lockdown continued through the fourth quarter of 2020. At the onset of the pandemic, we formed a cross-functional committee to lead our efforts to adjust to the changing conditions in order to keep our team and our residents safe. We continued our commitment to employees by allowing flexible work arrangements, undertook to pay all costs associated with COVID-19 testing and treatment, and continued clear and frequent communication. Utilizing our previous investment in technology and artificial intelligence, paired with policies providing flexibility, operations continued at our apartment communities with the leasing of apartments and fulfillment of service requests in a safe environment for our team members and our residents.\n\nOur top priority is the health and safety of our residents and teammates. Accordingly, we implemented enhanced cleaning procedures and physical distancing and remote working guidelines at our communities and corporate offices. Additionally, seeing residents as individuals, each impacted differently by the pandemic and governmental lockdown, our teammates have undertaken to speak to every resident in need, to listen, and to help each to solve his or her problems. We also seek to assist the communities where our residents and employees live and work.\n\nDuring the year  ended  December  31,  2020,  we  estimate  that  we  incurred  $4.5  million  of  incremental  costs  as  a  result  of  the  pandemic.  These  estimated incremental costs include $1.9 million of lost commercial revenue, $1.3 million of higher bad debt expense, and $1.3 million of other COVID-19 related items including increased cleaning costs.\n\n## Residential Rent Collections\n\nWe measure residential rent collection as the amount of payments received as a percentage of all residential amounts owed. Through December 31, 2020, we have collected 98.3% of all amounts owed by Aimco residents in 2020.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\nWe have three segments: (i) Development and redevelopment, (ii) Operating Portfolio, and (iii) Other. Our Development and redevelopment segment includes residential apartment communities, including associated commercial space, that are under construction or have not achieved stabilization. Our Operating Portfolio segment includes majority owned residential",

Our Other segment consists of 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, our only commercial real estate property.\n\nThe  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  the  results  of  our  operations  and  financial  condition  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n\nDetailed Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared to 2019 and the Year Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to 2018\n\nNet  income  decreased  by  $5.8  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020  compared  to  2019,  and  decreased  by  $3.3  million  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, as described more fully below.\n\n## Property Operations\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, our Operating Portfolio segment included 24 communities  with 6,067 apartment  homes, our Development  and redevelopment segment included Upton Place and Hamilton on the Bay, which are both being prepared for construction, and our Other segment includes one office building.\n\nWe use proportionate property net operating income to assess the operating performance of our segments. Proportionate property net operating income is defined as our share of rental and other property revenues, excluding utility reimbursements, less direct property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements, for  consolidated  communities.  In  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  utility  reimbursements  are  included  in  rental  and  other  property  revenues,  in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the results of operations of our segments discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis and exclude the results of four apartment communities with an aggregate 142 apartment homes that we neither manage nor consolidate, notes receivable, our investment in IQHQ and the Mezzanine Investment.\n\nWe do not include property management costs and casualty gains or losses, reported in consolidated amounts, in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below.\n\nPlease refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses.\n\nProportionate Property Net Operating Income - Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared to December 31, 2019\n\nThe results of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are presented below (in thousands).\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                                    | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |          |          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------|----------|\n|                                                                    | 2020                      | 2019                      | $ Change | % Change |\n| Rental and other property revenues, before utility reimbursements: |                           |                           |          |          |\n| Development and redevelopment                                      | $ 1,515                   | $ -    $                  | 1,515    | 100.0%   |\n| Operating Portfolio                                                | 130,689                   | 131,346                   | (657)    | -0.5%    |\n| Other                                                              | 12,986                    | 6,888                     | 6,098    | 88.5%    |\n| Total                                                              | 145,190                   | 138,234                   | 6,956    | 5.0%     |\n| Property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements:        |                           |                           |          |          |\n| Development and redevelopment                                      | 981                       | -                         | 981      | 100.0%   |\n| Operating Portfolio                                                | 43,891                    | 42,962                    | 929      | 2.2%     |\n| Other                                                              | 4,148                     | 1,931                     | 2,217    | 114.8%   |\n| Total                                                              | 49,020                    | 44,893                    | 4,127    | 9.2%     |\n| Proportionate property net operating income:                       |                           |                           |          |          |\n| Development and redevelopment                                      | 534                       | -                         | 534      | 100.0%   |\n| Operating Portfolio                                                | 86,798                    | 88,384                    | (1,586)  | -1.8%    |\n| Other                                                              | 8,838                     | 4,957                     | 3,881    | 78.3%    |\n| Total                                                              | $ 96,170                  | $ 93,341                  | $ 2,829  | 3.0%     |\n\nDevelopment and redevelopment proportionate property net operating income increased by $0.5 million, or 100% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, due to the acquisition of Hamilton on the Bay in August 2020.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, our Operating Portfolio proportionate property net operating income decreased by $1.6 million, or 1.8%, as operations at Aimco properties were impacted by the pandemic and related restrictions. This decrease was attributable to a $0.7 million, or 0.5%, decrease in rental and other property revenues due primarily to bad debt, increasing from 40 basis points of revenue to 130 basis points, and lower average daily occupancy of  40  basis  points.  This  was  partially  offset  by  higher  average  rent  of  $21  per  apartment  home.  Property  operating  expenses  increased  $0.9  million,  or  2.2% increase due primarily to an increase in real estate taxes and insurance.",

This increase was attributable primarily to a $4.0 million, or 3.1%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues of $43 per apartment home. The increase in Operating Portfolio proportionate property net operating income was offset partially offset by a $1.2 million, or 2.8%, increase in property operating expenses due primarily to higher controllable operating expenses, real estate taxes, and utility costs.\n\n## Non-Segment Property Operating Expenses\n\nProperty operating expenses not attributed to our segments includes property management costs and casualty losses, which we do not allocate to our segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance.\n\nNon-property operating expenses were consistent for all periods presented.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $13.9 million, or 21.8%, due primarily to depreciation and amortization of assets at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, acquired in July 2019, and Hamilton on the Bay, acquired in August 2020.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $14.7 million, or 29.7%, due primarily to depreciation and amortization of assets at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, acquired in July 2019.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, general and administrative expenses increased by $3.4 million, or 48.2%, due primarily to audit and tax fees incurred as a separate legal entity and increased allocation of expenses from Aimco Predecessor.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 22.5%, due primarily to increased allocation of expenses from Aimco Predecessor driven by the acquisition of 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and our Mezzanine Investment.",

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we  recognized  $27.6  million  of  income  representing  accrued  interest  amounts  due  in  connection  with  the  Mezzanine  Investment,  net  of  transaction  cost amortization.\n\nIn the event we determine that the value of the Mezzanine Investment has declined below its carrying value, we will recognize an impairment, if appropriate.\n\n## Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\n\n1001 Brickell  Bay  Drive  is  owned  through  a  TRS  entity.  Our  income  tax  benefit  (expense)  calculated  in  accordance  with  GAAP  includes  income  taxes associated with the income or loss of our TRS entities, including tax on gains on dispositions (if applicable), for which the tax consequences have been realized or will be realized in future periods.\n\nIncome taxes related to these items, and the establishment of incremental deferred tax items in conjunction with intercompany asset transfers (if applicable), are included in income tax benefit (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, income tax benefit increased by $6.8 million due primarily to the tax effect on GAAP losses at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, acquired in July 2019 and higher TRS losses.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, income tax changed from tax expense of $0.3 to a tax benefit of $3.3 million resulting in an increase of $3.6 million due primarily to an income tax benefit associated with 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, which was acquired in July 2019.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our loan agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, our available liquidity was $448.7 million, which consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 $289.6 million in cash and cash equivalents;\n- \u00b7 $9.2 million of restricted cash, including amounts related to tenant security deposits and escrows held by lenders for capital additions, property taxes, and insurance; and\n- \u00b7 $150.0 million of available capacity to borrow under our revolving secured credit facility.\n\nOur principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, and future investments. We use our cash and cash equivalents, including that provided by operating activities, to meet short-term liquidity needs.\n\nIn the event that our cash and cash equivalents, revolving secured credit facility, and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our liquidity needs, we have the means to generate additional liquidity, such as property financing activity and proceeds from apartment community sales. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities, development and redevelopment spending, and future investment activity, primarily through property financing activity and cash generated from operations. Our revolving secured credit facility matures in December 2023, prior to consideration of its two one-year extension options.\n\n## Leverage and Capital Resources",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels, and financing is readily available.  Any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We believe we have mitigated much of this exposure by reducing our short and intermediate term maturity risk. However, if property or development financing options become unavailable for our future debt needs, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in capital spending or proceeds from apartment community dispositions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 46% of our leverage consisted of property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, amortizing debt. Approximately 88% of our property-level debt is fixed-rate, which provides a hedge against increases in interest rates, capitalization rates, and inflation. The weighted-average remaining term to maturity of our property-level debt was 5.7 years and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.1%.\n\nWhile our primary source of leverage is property-level debt which includes construction loans, we also have a credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving secured credit facility, swingline loan sub-facility and  letter of credit sub-facility and had capacity to borrow up to $150.0 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 54% of our leverage consisted of Notes Payable to AIR, with a fixed interest rate of 5.2% and a term to maturity of 3.1 years.\n\nUnder our revolving secured credit facility, we have agreed to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, minimum tangible net worth of $625.0 million, and maximum leverage of 60% as defined in the credit agreement. We are currently in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants.\n\n## Changes in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n\nThe following discussion relates to changes in consolidated cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8 of this report.\n\n## Operating Activities\n\nOur operating cash flow is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our communities.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $47.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating  activities  decreased  by  $10.1  million  compared  to  2019,  due  primarily  to  lower  net  cash  contribution  from  our  properties,  which  were  negatively impacted  by  the  pandemic  and  governmental  lockdown  and  general  and  administrative  and  other  increases  related  to  the  Separation,  partially  offset  by  the incremental contribution from properties acquired in 2020 and 2019.\n\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $4.4 million compared to 2018, due primarily to higher contribution from our communities.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $283.5 million compared to 2019, due primarily to the $277.6 million payment made by Aimco Predecessor on November 26, 2019 for the Mezzanine Investment. Adding to the decrease in cash used in investing was lower capital expenditures. The lower capital expenditures resulted from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic whereby temporary local restrictions halted construction activity at many apartment communities.\n\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $375.0 million compared to 2018, due primarily to the $277.6 million payment made by Aimco Predecessor on November 26, 2019 for the Mezzanine Investment and related transaction costs and the $95.9 million acquisition of 1001 Brickell Bay Drive.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $9.9 million compared to 2019, due primarily to $420.9 million investment from Aimco Predecessor. Partially offsetting this were higher principal payments on our non-recourse property debt, purchase of the interest rate option and deferred financing costs.\n\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $376.2 million compared to 2018, due primarily to higher net investment from Aimco Predecessor, proceeds from the Notes Payable to AIR lower",

We believe, based on the information available at this time, that we have sufficient cash on hand and access to additional sources of liquidity to meet our operational needs for 2021 and beyond.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nWe use EBITDAre and Adjusted  EBITDAre  in  managing  our  business  and  in  evaluating  our  financial  condition  and  operating  performance.  These  key financial indicators are non-GAAP measures and are defined and described below. We provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP.",

        "page_content": "Earnings Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre)\n\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP measures, which we believe are useful to investors, creditors, and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of our ability to incur and service debt because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and allow for comparison of our credit strength to different companies. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of liquidity. There can be no assurance that our method of calculating EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre is comparable with that of other  real  estate  investment  trusts.  Nareit  defines  EBITDAre  as  net  income  computed  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  before  interest  expense,  income  taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, further adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 gains and losses on the dispositions of depreciated property;\n- \u00b7 impairment write-downs of depreciated property;\n- \u00b7 impairment  write-downs  of  investments  in  unconsolidated  partnerships  caused  by  a  decrease  in  the  value  of  the  depreciated  property  in  such partnerships; and\n- \u00b7 adjustments to reflect Aimco's share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities.\n\nEBITDAre is defined by Nareit and provides for an additional performance measure independent of capital structure for greater comparability between real estate  investment  trusts.  We  define  Adjusted  EBITDAre  as  EBITDAre  adjusted  to  exclude  the  effect  of  net  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  in consolidated real estate partnerships and EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests, to allow investors to compare a measure of our earnings before the effects of our capital structure and indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry.\n\nThe reconciliation of net (loss) income to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, is as follows (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                                                            | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                                            | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| Net (loss) income                                                                          | $ (5,771)                 | $ 113                     | $ 3,411                   |\n| Adjustments:                                                                               |                           |                           |                           |\n| Interest expense                                                                           | 27,512                    | 18,598                    | 19,643                    |\n| Income tax (benefit) expense                                                               | (10,149)                  | (3,301)                   | 261                       |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                                              | 77,965                    | 64,030                    | 49,375                    |\n| Impairments                                                                                | 15,860                    | -                         | -                         |\n| Adjustment related to EBITDAre of unconsolidated partnerships                              | 848                       | 843                       | 837                       |\n| EBITDAre                                                                                   | $ 106,265                 | $ 80,283                  | $ 73,527                  |\n| Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships | 461                       | 206                       | 5                         |\n| EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests                              | (925)                     | (465)                     | (27)                      |\n| Unrealized gain on interest rate option (1)                                                | (1,058)                   | -                         | -                         |\n| Litigation, net (2)                                                                        | -                         | -                         | (312)                     |\n| Adjusted EBITDAre                                                                          | $ 104,743                 | $ 80,024                  | $ 73,193                  |",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nWe prepare our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  which  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions.  We  believe  that  the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Capitalized Costs\n\nWe capitalize  costs,  including  certain  indirect  costs,  incurred  in  connection  with  our  capital  additions  activities,  including  redevelopments,  other  tangible apartment community improvements, and replacements of existing community components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by employees in connection with the planning, execution, and control of all capital addition activities at our communities. We characterize as 'indirect costs' an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital addition activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes, and insurance during periods in which redevelopments are in progress. We commence capitalization of costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital addition activities, at the point in time when activities necessary to get communities, apartment homes, or  leased  spaces  ready  for  their  intended  use  begin.  These  activities  include  when  communities,  apartment  homes,  or  leased  spaces  are  undergoing  physical construction, as well as when homes or leased spaces are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting, planning, and design  are  in  progress.  We  cease  the  capitalization  of  costs  when  the  communities  or  components  thereof  are  substantially  complete  and  ready  for  their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and homes or leased spaces are available for occupancy. We charge costs including ordinary repairs, maintenance, and resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nReal estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a sublease of office space within our corporate offices to AIR at then-current market rents.  Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows per the terms of the sublease arrangement, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with the subleased space, including, the right-of-use asset, tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment and concluded the subleased assets were impaired. We recorded an impairment charge of $11.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.  There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a software license agreement with AIR to provide for the use of certain internally developed software at then-current market rates.  Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relative to the carrying value of the internally developed software, we concluded  the  assets  were  impaired.    Additionally,  following  an  evaluation  of  the  future  service  potential  of  certain  other  internal  software  that  was  under development, we ceased development and impaired the associated carrying value.  We recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $4.9 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.  There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nUpon  the  acquisition  of  real  estate,  we  determine  whether  the  purchase  qualifies  as  an  asset  acquisition  or,  less  frequently,  meets  the  definition  of  an acquisition of a business. We generally recognize the acquisition of apartment communities or interests in partnerships that own communities at our cost, including the related transaction costs, as asset acquisitions.\n\nWe allocate the cost of apartment communities acquired based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using valuation techniques that rely on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs within the fair value framework. We determine the fair value of tangible assets, such as land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment using valuation techniques that consider comparable market transactions, replacement costs  and  other  available  information.  We  determine  the  fair  value  of  identified  intangible  assets  or  liabilities,  which  typically  relate  to  in-place  leases,  using valuation techniques that consider the terms of the in-place leases, current market data for comparable leases and our experience in leasing similar communities.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe intangible assets or liabilities related to in-place leases are comprised of: (a) the value of the above- and below-market leases in-place, measured over the period, including probable lease renewals for below-market leases, that the leases are expected to remain in effect; (b) the estimated unamortized portion of avoided leasing commissions and other costs that ordinarily would be incurred to originate the in-place leases; and (c) the value associated with leased apartment homes during an estimated absorption period, which estimates rental revenue that would not have been earned had leased apartment homes been vacant at the time of acquisition, assuming lease-up periods based on market demand and stabilized occupancy levels. The above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to rental revenue over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases, which include reasonably assured renewal periods. Other intangible assets related to inplace leases are amortized to depreciation and amortization over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment\n\nWe use  the  equity  method  of  accounting  for  investments  in  unconsolidated  real  estate  ventures  when  we  have  significant  influence  but  do  not  have  a controlling financial interest. Significant influence is typically indicated through ownership of 20% or more of the voting interests. Under the equity method, we record our investments in these entities in \"Mezzanine investment' on our consolidated balance sheets, and our proportionate share of earnings or losses earned by the real estate venture is recognized in \"Mezzanine investment income, net' in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We earn revenues from the loan receivable we provide to this investment.\n\nOn a  periodic  basis,  we  evaluate  our  Mezzanine  investment  for  impairment.  We  assess  whether  there  are  any  indicators,  including  underlying  property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investment may be impaired. An investment is considered impaired if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment on an other-than-temporary basis. Cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. We consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks. If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. If our analysis indicates that there is an other-than temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate venture, the carrying value of the venture will be adjusted to its estimated fair value.\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur chief market risks are refunding risk, that is the availability of property debt or other cash sources to refund maturing property debt, including the Notes Payable to AIR, and repricing risk, that is the possibility of increases in base interest rates and credit risk spreads. We use long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing, nonrecourse property debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short-term borrowings. We use working capital primarily to fund short-term uses. We make limited use of derivative financial instruments and we do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $55.0 million of variable-rate property-level debt outstanding. We estimate that a change in 30-day LIBOR of 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads would reduce or increase interest expense by approximately $0.6 million on an annual basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $298.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, a portion of which bears interest at variable rates.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of debt instruments as described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. The estimated fair value of total indebtedness, including our Notes Payable to AIR, was approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nThe independent registered public accounting firm's reports, consolidated financial statements and schedule listed in the 'Index to Financial Statements' on page F-1 of this Annual Report are filed as part of this report and incorporated herein by this reference.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Aimco\n\n## Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nAimco's  management,  with  the  participation  of  Aimco's  chief  executive  officer,  chief  financial  officer  and  chief  accounting  officer,  has  evaluated  the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this  report.  Based  on  such  evaluation,  Aimco's  chief  executive  officer  and  chief  financial  officer  have  concluded  that,  as  of  the  end  of  such  period,  Aimco's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nAimco's  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Internal  control  over  financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;\n- \u00b7 provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  our  management  and directors; and\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of Aimco's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).\n\nBased on their assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, Aimco's internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nAimco's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on Aimco's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nIn connection with the Separation, Aimco entered into a property management agreement and master lease agreement with AIR and AIR will continue to provide certain information technology, administrative and other services. We have designed controls to review information provided by AIR that we use for our financial results and related disclosures.\n\nOther than those noted above, there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of Aimco.",

In our opinion, Apartment Investment and Management Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a) and our report dated March 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## /s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nDenver, Colorado March 12, 2021",

In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013 Framework).\n\nBased on their assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, Aimco Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nAimco Operating  Partnership's  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  has  issued  an  attestation  report  on  Aimco  Operating  Partnership's  internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nIn connection with the Separation, Aimco Operating Partnership entered into a property management agreement and master lease agreement with AIR and AIR will continue to provide certain information technology, administrative and other services. We have designed controls to review information provided by AIR that we use for our financial results and related disclosures.\n\nOther than those noted above, there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of Aimco.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apartment Investment and Management Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apartment Investment and Management Company (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2020,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Accounting for Acquisitions of Real Estate\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\nDuring 2020 the Company acquired real estate for total consideration  of  $120.5 million.  As more  fully  described  in  Note  2  and summarized in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the total consideration for these asset acquisitions was allocated to land,  buildings  and  improvements,  right-of-use  assets,  intangible  assets,  and  intangible  liabilities,  based  upon  their  relative  fair values.\n\nAuditing the Company's allocation of cost for these asset acquisitions involved a higher degree of judgment due to the subjective nature  of  the  assumptions  in  determining  the  relative  fair  values  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.    The  significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes market comparable prices for similar land parcels, estimated replacement costs for buildings and improvements, market rental rates, and assumptions regarding the time it would take to lease residential units assuming they were vacant at acquisition.\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's allocation of cost  of  its  asset  acquisitions  on  a  relative  fair  value  basis  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  This  included  testing controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above.\n\nFor the  Company's asset  acquisitions,  we  performed  audit  procedures  that  included,  among  others,  testing  the  completeness  and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimates of fair value. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we compared the significant  assumptions  described  above  to  observable  market  data  and  published  industry  resources.  For  example,  we  compared management's  land  value  assumptions  and  estimated  building  replacement  costs  to  observable  market  transactions  for  similar properties.  For lease intangibles we compared management's assumptions regarding market rental rates and the amount of time it would take to lease a residential unit if the building were vacant at acquisition to published market data for comparable leases.\n\n## /s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2020.\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nMarch 12, 2021",

(the Partnership) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Partnership's internal control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2020,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 12, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Partnership's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Partnership's  financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Accounting for Acquisitions of Real Estate\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\nDuring 2020 the Partnership acquired real estate for total consideration of $120.5 million. As more fully described in Note 2 and summarized in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the total consideration for these asset acquisitions was allocated to land,  buildings  and  improvements,  right-of-use  assets,  intangible  assets,  and  intangible  liabilities,  based  upon  their  relative  fair values.\n\nAuditing the Partnership's allocation of cost for these asset acquisitions involved a higher degree of judgment due to the subjective nature  of  the  assumptions  in  determining  the  relative  fair  values  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.    The  significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes market comparable prices for similar land parcels, estimated replacement costs for buildings and improvements, market rental rates, and assumptions regarding the time it would take to lease residential units assuming they were vacant at acquisition.\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm",

This included testing controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above.\n\nFor the Partnership's asset acquisitions, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimates of fair value. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we compared the significant  assumptions  described  above  to  observable  market  data  and  published  industry  resources.  For  example,  we  compared management's  land  value  assumptions  and  estimated  building  replacement  costs  to  observable  market  transactions  for  similar properties.  For lease intangibles we compared management's assumptions regarding market rental rates and the amount of time it would take to lease a residential unit if the building were vacant at acquisition to published market data for comparable leases.\n\n## /s/\u00a0Ernst\u00a0&\u00a0Young\u00a0LLP\n\nWe\u00a0have\u00a0served\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0Partnership's\u00a0auditor\u00a0since\u00a02020.\n\nDenver,\u00a0Colorado\n\nMarch\u00a012,\u00a02021",

('Aimco Operating Partnership') and their consolidated subsidiaries. The Aimco Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Aimco Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nExcept as the context otherwise requires, 'we,' 'us,' and 'our,' refer to Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated entities.\n\n## The Separation\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Aimco completed the separation of its businesses (the 'Separation'), creating two, separate and distinct, publicly traded companies, Aimco and Apartment Income REIT Corp. ('AIR').\n\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Separation, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, Aimco is presented as being spun-off from AIR. This presentation is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ('GAAP'), and is due primarily to the relative significance of Aimco's business,  as  measured  in  terms  of  revenues,  net  income,  assets,  and  other  relevant  indicators,  as  compared  to  those  indicators  for  AIR  before  the  Separation. Therefore, Aimco is the accounting spinnee and AIR is considered the divesting entity and is treated as the accounting spinnor (Aimco and AIR together, as they existed prior to the Separation, 'Aimco Predecessor').\n\nPrior to the Separation, the consolidated financial statements were prepared on a carve-out basis and reflect significant assumptions and allocations. The consolidated financial statements reflect our historical consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The historical financial statements of Aimco do not represent the financial position and results of operations of one legal entity, but rather a combination of entities under common control that have been 'carved out' from Aimco Predecessor's financial statements. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nAll separation related transactions between Aimco and Aimco Predecessor are considered effectively settled through partners' capital in our consolidated financial statements, other than the Notes Payable to AIR as discussed in Note 8. The settlement of these transactions is reflected as net contributions from and distributions  to  Aimco  Predecessor  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  equity  and  partners'  capital  and  net  change  in  Aimco  Predecessor  invesment  in  our consolidated statements of cash flows as financing activities.\n\n## Organization and Business\n\nAimco, a Maryland corporation incorporated  on January  10,  1994,  is  a  self-administered  and  self-managed  real  estate  investment  trust  ('REIT').  Aimco, through  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  is  the  general  and  special  limited  partner  of  the  Aimco  Operating  Partnership.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  Aimco  owned approximately 93.2% of the legal interest in the common partnership units of the Aimco Operating Partnership and 94.8% of the economic interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership. The remaining 6.8% legal interest is owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Aimco Operating Partnership, Aimco has exclusive control of the Aimco Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Separation, we retained the development and redevelopment business of Aimco, 25 consolidated communities including 16 multi-family communities securing $534.1 million of Notes Payable to AIR, and four partially-owned communities that we do not consolidate. In the fourth quarter of 2020 we entered into a joint venture for the development of a property located in the Washington, D.C. area. In addition, we hold other opportunistic investments including  1001  Brickell  Bay  Drive;  our  indirect  interest  in  the  loan  to,  and  the  equity  option  in,  Maximus  PM  Mezzanine  A  LLC,  the  partnership  that  owns Parkmerced Apartments (the 'Mezzanine Investment'); and our IQHQ, Inc. ('IQHQ') investment.\n\nWe own and operate a portfolio of apartment communities, diversified by both geography and price point in 12 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio included 27 properties with 6,342 apartment homes. Any reference to the number of apartment communities and homes, square footage, or occupancy percentage in these notes to our consolidated financial statements are unaudited.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nWe consolidate variable interest entities ('VIE'), in which we are considered the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.\n\nAs used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, 'partnership' refers to a limited partnership or a limited liability company and 'partner' refers to a partner in a limited partnership or a member of a limited liability company.\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period financial statement presentation with no effect on the Company's previously reported results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\n## Allocations\n\nThe consolidated statements of operations include allocations  of general  and administrative  expenses  from Aimco Predecessor, as discussed in Note 5 Transactions with AIR. We consider the basis on which expenses have been allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by us during the periods presented. However, the allocations may not include all the actual expenses that we would have incurred and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had it been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that might have been incurred had we been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, what functions we might  have  performed  ourselves  or  outsourced,  and  strategic  decisions  we  might  have  made  in  areas  such  as  information  technology  and  infrastructure. Following the Separation, AIR, through its subsidiaries, provides Aimco with certain property management and other services, and we perform certain functions using our own resources or purchase services from third parties.\n\n## Common Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nCommon  noncontrolling  interests  in  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  consist  of  common  OP  Units  and  are  reflected  in  Aimco's  accompanying consolidated balance sheets as common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership.  The Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss is allocated to the  holders  of  common  OP  Units,  other  than  Aimco,  based  on  the  weighted-average  number  of  common  OP  Units  (including  Aimco)  outstanding  during  the period.  During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the holders of common OP Units had a weighted-average economic ownership interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership of 5.4%.  Please refer to Note 11 for further information regarding the items comprising common noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership.  Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Aimco are held by the Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest consists of equity interests held by a limited partner in a consolidated real estate partnership that has a finite life. We generally  attribute  to  noncontrolling  interests  their  share  of  income  or  loss  of  consolidated  partnerships  based  on  their  proportionate  interest  in  the  results  of operations of the partnerships, including their share of losses even if such attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance within our equity accounts.\n\nIf  a  real  estate  partnership  includes  redemption  rights  that  are  not  within  our  control,  the  noncontrolling  interest  is  included  as  temporary  equity.  If  the redemption right is not currently redeemable but probable of being redeemable in the future, changes in redemption value are recognized each quarter with the change in value being reflected in additional paid-in-capital.\n\nThe assets of our consolidated real estate partnerships must first be used to settle the liabilities of the consolidated real estate partnerships. The consolidated real estate partnership's creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nThe  following  table  represents  a  reconciliation  of  our  redeemable  noncontrolling  interest  in  consolidated  real  estate  partnerships  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| Balance at December 31, 2019   | 4,720   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|\n| Net loss                       | (457)   |\n| Balance at December 31, 2020   | 4,263   |\n\n## Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nWe own  general  and  limited  partner  interests  in  partnerships  that  either  directly,  or  through  interests  in  other  real  estate  partnerships,  own  apartment communities. We generally account for investments in real estate partnerships that we do not consolidate under the equity method. Accordingly, we recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods presented, inclusive of our share of any impairments and disposition gains or losses recognized by and related to such entities,",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nand we present such amounts within income from unconsolidated real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe excess of our cost of the acquired partnership interests over our share of the partners' equity or deficit is generally ascribed to the fair values of land and buildings owned by the partnerships. We amortize the excess cost ascribed to the buildings over the related estimated useful lives. Such amortization is recorded as an adjustment of the amounts of earnings or losses we recognize from such unconsolidated real estate partnerships.\n\nWe may also originate loans for real estate acquisitions or developments where we either expect, or have the opportunity, to participate in the residual profits from such projects. When the risks and rewards of these arrangements are similar to an equity investor or joint venture partner, we account for these arrangements as real estate investments using the equity method of accounting. We recognize as income changes in our share of net assets, adjusted for any basis differential, in mezzanine investment income, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe assess the recoverability of our equity method investments if there are indicators of potential impairment. We did not recognize any such impairments of our equity method investments during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment\n\nThe Separation Agreement provides for AIR to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the mezzanine loan to the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments, the related equity option and the interest rate option, or swaption, that provides partial protection against future refinancing risk through 2024 once required consents to transfer are received.  At the time of the Separation and as of March 12, 2021, AIR retained legal ownership of these subsidiaries. Until ownership of the subsidiaries is transferred, AIR is obligated to pass payments on such loan to us, and we are obligated to indemnify AIR against any costs and expenses related thereto. We have the risks and rewards of ownership of the Mezzanine Investment and have recognized an asset related to our right to receive the Mezzanine Investment from AIR.\n\nPrior to the Separation, consistent with the presentation of the consolidated financial statements on a carve out basis and considering intent to legally transfer the subsidiaries holding the mezzanine investment and related assets in connection with the Separation, the Mezzanine Investment was accounted for as an equity method investment. Accordingly, we recognized as income changes in our share of net assets, adjusted for any basis differential, in mezzanine investment income, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nSubsequent to the Separation, we recognize as income the net amounts recognized by AIR on its equity investment that are due to be paid to us when collected, which primarily represent the interest accrued under the terms of the underlying mezzanine loan. As of December 31, 2020, the Mezzanine Investment in our consolidated  balance  sheets  represents  the  assets  associated  with  our  indirect  interest  in  the  subsidiary  that  owns  Parkmerced  Apartments,  which  we  do  not consolidate.\n\n## Real Estate\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nUpon  the  acquisition  of  real  estate,  we  determine  whether  the  purchase  qualifies  as  an  asset  acquisition  or,  less  frequently,  meets  the  definition  of  an acquisition of a business. We generally recognize the acquisition of real estate or interests in partnerships that own real estate at our cost, including the related transaction costs, as asset acquisitions.\n\nWe allocate the cost of real estate acquired based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using valuation techniques that rely on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs within the fair value framework. We determine the fair value of tangible assets, such as land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, and equipment using valuation techniques that consider comparable market transactions, replacement costs, and other  available  information.  We  determine  the  fair  value  of  identified  intangible  assets  or  liabilities,  which  typically  relate  to  in-place  leases,  using  valuation techniques that consider the terms of the in-place leases, current market data for comparable leases, and our experience in leasing similar real estate.\n\nThe intangible assets or liabilities related to in-place leases are comprised of: (a) the value of the above- and below-market leases in-place, measured over the period, including probable lease renewals for below-market leases, for which the leases are expected to remain in effect; (b) the estimated unamortized portion of avoided leasing commissions and other costs that ordinarily would be incurred to originate the in-place leases; and (c) the value associated with in-place leases during an estimated absorption period, which estimates rental revenue that would not have been earned had the leased space been vacant at the time of acquisition, assuming  lease-up  periods  based  on  market  demand  and  stabilized  occupancy  levels.  The  above-  and  below-market  lease  intangibles  are  amortized  to  rental revenue over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases, which include reasonably assured renewal periods. Other intangible assets related to in-place leases are amortized to depreciation and amortization over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases.\n\n## Capital Additions",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe capitalize  costs,  including  certain  indirect  costs,  incurred  in  connection  with  our  capital  additions  activities,  including  redevelopments,  other  tangible apartment community improvements, and replacements of existing community components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by employees in connection with the planning, execution, and control of all capital addition activities at our communities. We characterize as 'indirect costs' an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital addition activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes, and insurance during periods in which construction projects are in progress. We commence capitalization of costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital addition activities, at the point in time when activities necessary to get communities, apartment homes, or  leased  spaces  ready  for  their  intended  use  begin.  These  activities  include  when  communities,  apartment  homes  or  leased  spaces  are  undergoing  physical construction, as well as when homes or leased spaces are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting, planning, and design  are  in  progress.  We  cease  the  capitalization  of  costs  when  the  communities  or  components  thereof  are  substantially  complete  and  ready  for  their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and homes or leased spaces are available for occupancy. We charge costs including ordinary repairs, maintenance, and resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred.\n\nFor the each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we capitalized to buildings and improvements $1.0 million, $0.2 million, and $0.3 million of interest costs, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we capitalized to buildings and improvements $2.7 million, $4.1 million, and $4.9 million of indirect costs, respectively.\n\n## Gain or Loss on Dispositions\n\nGain or loss on dispositions are recognized when we no longer hold a controlling financial interest in the real estate and sufficient consideration has been received.  Upon  disposition,  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  are  derecognized,  and  the  gain  or  loss  on  disposition  is  recognized  as  the  difference  between  the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities and the value of consideration received. There were no dispositions in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\n\n## Impairment\n\nReal estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the  carrying  amount  to  our  estimate  of  the  undiscounted  future  cash  flows,  excluding  interest  charges,  of  the  community.  If  the  carrying  amount  exceeds  the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the community.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a sublease of office space within our corporate offices to AIR at then-current market rents.  Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relative to the sublease arrangement, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with the subleased space, including, the right-of-use asset, tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment and concluded the subleased assets were impaired. We recorded an impairment charge of $11.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.  There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a software license agreement with AIR to provide for the use of certain internally developed software at then-current market rates.  Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relative to the carrying value of the internally developed software, we concluded  the  assets  were  impaired.    Additionally,  following  an  evaluation  of  the  future  service  potential  of  certain  other  internal  software  that  was  under development, we ceased development and impaired the associated carrying value.  We recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $4.9 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.  There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify  highly  liquid  investments  with  an  original  maturity  of  three  months  or  less  as  cash  equivalents.  We  maintain  cash  equivalents  in  financial institutions in excess of insured limits. We have not experienced any losses in these accounts in the past and believe that we are not exposed to significant credit risk because our accounts are deposited with major financial institutions.\n\nSupplemental cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:",

The allowance is determined based on an assessment on whether substantially all of the amounts due from the resident or tenant is probable of collection. This includes a specific tenant analysis and aging analysis.\n\n## Deferred Leasing Costs\n\nBeginning in 2019, in accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standard Codification ('ASC') 842, we defer leasing costs incremental to a lease that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. Amortization of these costs is included in depreciation and amortization. Prior to 2019, we deferred leasing commissions and other direct costs incurred in connection with successful leasing efforts and amortized the costs over the terms of the related leases.\n\n## Revenue from Leases\n\nWe are a  lessor  for  residential  and  commercial  leases.  Our  operating  leases  with  residents  may  provide  that  the  resident  reimburse  us  for  certain  costs, primarily the resident's share of utilities expenses, incurred by the apartment community. Our operating leases with commercial tenants may provide that the tenant reimburse us for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other recoverable costs incurred by the commercial property.\n\nBeginning in 2019, with the adoption of ASC 842, we concluded that residential and commercial reimbursements represent revenue attributable to non-lease components for which the timing and pattern of recognition is the same as the revenue for the lease components. We adopted the practical expedient that allows us to  account  for  the  lease  and  non-lease  components  as  a  single  component.  Reimbursements  and  the  related  expenses  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis  in  our consolidated statements of operations, with the reimbursements included in rental and other property revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in the period the recoverable costs are incurred. We recognize rental revenue attributed to lease components, net of any concessions, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Debt Issuance Costs\n\nWe defer, as debt issuance costs, lender fees and other direct costs incurred in obtaining new financing and amortize the amounts over the terms of the related loan agreements. In connection with the modification of existing financing arrangements, we defer lender fees and amortize these costs and any unamortized debt issuance costs over the term of the modified loan agreement. Debt issuance costs associated with non-recourse property debt are presented as a direct deduction from the related liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. For debt issuance costs associated with our revolving credit facilities and construction loans that have not been drawn we record the costs in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets and amortize the costs to interest expense, on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. Debt issuance costs associated with construction loans are reclassified as a direct deduction to the construction loan liability in proportion to any draws on the loans in our consolidated balance sheets and subsequently amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the arrangement in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWhen financing arrangements are repaid or otherwise extinguished prior to maturity, unamortized debt issuance costs are written off. Any lender fees or other costs incurred in connection with an extinguishment are recognized as expense. Amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs and other extinguishment costs are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation for all tangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Acquired buildings and improvements are depreciated  over  a  useful  life  based  on  the  age,  condition,  and  other  physical  characteristics  of  the  asset.  Furniture,  fixtures,  and  equipment  are  generally depreciated over five years.\n\nWe depreciate capitalized costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related improvement, which is generally 5, 15, or 30 years. We also capitalize payroll and other indirect costs incurred in connection with preparing an asset for its intended use. These costs include corporate-level costs that clearly relate to the capital addition activities, which we allocate to the applicable assets. All capitalized payroll costs and indirect costs are allocated to capital additions proportionately based on direct costs and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of such capital additions.\n\nPurchased equipment is recognized at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally five years. Leasehold improvements are also recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's estimated useful life or the term of the related lease.\n\nCertain homogeneous items that are purchased in bulk on a recurring basis, such as appliances, are depreciated using group methods that reflect the average estimated useful life of the items in each group. Except in the case of casualties, where the net book value of the lost asset is written off in the determination of casualty  gains  or  losses,  we  generally  do  not  recognize  any  loss  in  connection  with  the  replacement  of  an  existing  community  component  because  normal replacements are considered in determining the estimated useful lives used in connection with our composite and group depreciation methods.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nAimco has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), commencing with its taxable  year  ended December 31, 1994, and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner. Our current and continuing qualification as a REIT depends on its ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which are related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. If Aimco qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it will generally not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the 'double taxation' (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.\n\nEven if Aimco qualifies as a REIT, it may be subject to United States federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on undistributed income. Aimco also will be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm's length transactions between it and a TRS (described below) and on any net income from sales of apartment communities that were held for sale in the ordinary course. The state and local tax laws may not conform to the United States federal income tax treatment, and Aimco may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business. Any taxes imposed on us reduce our operating cash flow and net income.\n\nCertain of Aimco's operations or a portion thereof, including property management and risk management, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are our subsidiaries of the Aimco Operating Partnership, and each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a subsidiary C-corporation that has not elected REIT status and, as such, is subject to United States federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents and investment partners that cannot be offered directly by a REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain apartment communities.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor our TRS entities, deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for United States federal income tax purposes, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We reduce deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance when we determine, based on available evidence, that it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. We recognize the tax consequences associated with intercompany transfers between the Aimco Operating Partnership and TRS entities when such transactions occur. Please refer to Note 9 for further information about our income taxes.\n\n## Earnings per Share and per Unit\n\nWe and the Aimco Operating Partnership calculate earnings per share and unit based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock or common OP units,  participating  securities,  common  stock  or  common  unit  equivalents  and  dilutive  convertible  securities  outstanding  during  the  period.  The  Aimco Operating Partnership considers both common OP units and equivalents, which have identical rights to distributions and undistributed earnings, to be common units for purposes of the earnings per unit computations. Please refer to Note 12 for further information regarding earnings per share and unit computations.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Current Year\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, issued by the FASB, which changes the method and timing of the recognition of credit losses on financial assets. The standard requires us to estimate and record credit losses over the life of a financial instrument, including our note receivable, at its inception. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nOn January 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ('ASU') 2020-01, Investment - Equity Securities , (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Venture (Topic 323) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which updates and addresses accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method and provides clarification of the interaction of rules for equity securities, the equity method of accounting, and forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities, which is effective for us on January 1, 2021.  Adoption of the standards update requires changes to be made prospectively and early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2021 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nOn August  2020,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2020-06, Debt  -  Debt  with  Conversion  and  Other  Options (Subtopic  470-20)  and Derivatives  and  Hedging  Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, and affects the diluted earnings per share calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares, which is effective for us on January 1, 2021.  Adoption of the standards update requires changes to be made retrospectively and early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2021 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Significant Transactions\n\n## Acquisition of Upton Place\n\nOn December 4, 2020, we entered into a joint venture partnership with AIR (the 'Upton Place Holding JV') to acquire a 90% interest in a joint venture partnership (the 'Upton Place JV') with a third party developer ('Developer'). The Upton Place JV was formed to acquire Upton Place, a mixed-use development project which will create 689 apartment homes and approximately 100,000 square feet of commercial space in upper-northwest Washington, D.C.\n\n## Upton Place Holding JV\n\nWe issued an $85.0 million promissory note (representing a commitment to fund equity) for an approximate 81% interest and AIR contributed $20.0 million for an approximate 19% interest in the Upton Place Holding JV. As of December 31, 2020, $5.2 million of the $85 million was funded.\n\nFollowing the formation of the Upton Place Holding JV, contemporaneous with the Separation, Aimco and AIR also entered into a membership interest lease agreement in which AIR assigned all its economic rights in the Upton Place Holding JV to Aimco in exchange for annual payments of $1.15 million. We evaluated the joint venture, concluded that we are the primary",

AIR's equity interest in the joint venture is presented as noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Upton Place JV\n\nContemporaneous with the formation of the joint venture, the Developer provided a guaranty of cost overruns which requires the Developer to fund all costs and expenses in excess of certain guaranteed cost amounts. The Developer has also guaranteed the project's construction, delivery and will be responsible for managing the lease up and management of the retail units. We will be responsible for the lease-up and management of the residential units.\n\nThe Developer has a 10% interest in the Upton Place JV as well as rights to receive a promote distribution contingent on certain internal rates of return. Upon final completion of the project and following 360 days after stabilization ('Stabilization', defined as at least 95% of apartment units and 90% of retail space being leased with tenants having taken possession), the Developer has the option to require the Upton Place JV to redeem its promote based on the then fair value of the project.\n\nWe evaluated the joint venture, concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidate the Upton Place JV. The Developer's equity interest in the joint venture is presented as noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships in the consolidated balance sheets. The Developer's contingent option relative to its promote distribution is a liability.  As of December 31, 2020, the Developer's noncontrolling interest and promote distribution liability was $11.7 million and $0, respectively.\n\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Upton Place, we entered into two 99-year ground leases with a third party for the land underlying the property.\n\nUpon the signing of the Upton Place JV we paid customary acquisition costs including a broker fee to a related party in the amount of $1.8 million.\n\n## Acquisition of Hamilton on the Bay\n\nOn August 25, 2020, we acquired Hamilton on the Bay, an apartment community and an adjacent land parcel located in Miami, Florida.\n\nSummarized information regarding these acquisitions is set forth in the table below (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| Purchase price                     | 115,394   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Capitalized transaction costs      | 5,136     |\n| Total consideration                | 120,530   |\n| Land                               | 56,649    |\n| Building and improvements          | 56,171    |\n| Right-of-use lease assets          | 92,787    |\n| Due from affiliates                | 705       |\n| Lease liabilities                  | (86,348)  |\n| Intangible assets (1)              | 1,517     |\n| Below-market lease liabilities (2) | (951)     |\n| Total consideration                | 120,530   |",

In addition, Aimco has the right to collaborate with IQHQ on any multifamily component at its future development sites.\n\n## Note 4 - Leases\n\n## Lessor Arrangements\n\nThe majority of payments we receive for our residential and commercial leases are fixed. We receive variable payments from our residents and commercial tenants primarily for utility reimbursements and other services. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception.\n\nOur total lease income was comprised of the following amounts for all operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                       | 2020           | 2019    |\n|-----------------------|----------------|---------|\n| Fixed lease income    | $ 140,140    $ | 133,180 |\n| Variable lease income | 11,192         | 9,929   |\n| Total lease income    | $ 151,332  $   | 143,109 |\n\nIn general, our commercial leases have options to extend for a certain period of time at the tenant's option.

Our  commercial  leases,  as  of December 31, 2020, have an average remaining term of 2.8 years.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\nWe estimated the value of our lease liabilities using discount rates equivalent to the rates we would pay on a secured borrowing with terms similar to the leases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected to not separate these components for all classes of underlying assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Leases with initial terms greater than 12 months are recorded as operating or financing leases on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into two 99-year ground leases for the land underlying the development site at Upton Place and initially recorded right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities of $92.8 million and $86.3 million, respectively. We also have a lease for our corporate office. Substantially, all  of  the  payments  under  our  ground and office  leases  are  fixed.

The initial term of each property management/property accounting agreement is one-year, with automatic one-year renewal periods, unless either party elects to terminate at any time upon delivery of 60 days' prior written notice to the other party. Neither party is obligated to pay to the other party a termination fee or other penalty upon such termination.\n\nSubsequent to the Separation, we recorded property management/property accounting fees of $0.2 million, which is included in property operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Master Services Agreement\n\nWe and AIR entered into a Master Services Agreement, in which AIR will provide us with customary administrative and support services. We are obligated to pay AIR the fully burdened costs (including internal allocated costs) in performing the services.

In connection with such an early termination, AIR will generally have an option (and not an obligation) to pay us an amount equal to the difference between the then-current fair market value of such property and the initial fair market value of such property at the time of Lease inception, at a five percent discount thereto; if AIR does not exercise such option, we will have the right to cause such property to be sold to a third party, with AIR guaranteed to receive an amount equal to the fair market value of the property at the time of the Lease inception and we will retain any excess proceeds. In the event of such sale of the property, we may also elect to purchase the property at a purchase price equal to the fair market value as agreed upon at the time of Lease inception (and may subsequently sell the property to a third party, subject to AIR's right of first refusal during the first year following our acquisition). If AIR elects not to pay the fee for the development or redevelopment-related improvements, and we decline to purchase the property or cause its sale to a third party, we may elect to rescind its termination of the applicable lease and instead continue such lease in effect in accordance with its terms. See Note-17 for further details related to properties leased on January 1, 2021.\n\n## Notes Payable to AIR\n\nOn December 14, 2020, we entered into $534.1 million of Notes Payable to AIR that are secured by a pledge of the equity interest in the entity that holds a portfolio of assets, however, the assets secure existing senior loans of $215.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The notes will mature on January 31, 2024 and bear interest  at  5.2%,  with  accrued  interest  payable  quarterly  on  January  1,  April  1,  July  1  and  October  1,  and  commencing  on  April  1,  2021.  For  the  year  ended December 31, 2020, we recognized interest expense of $1.3 million associated with the Notes Payable to AIR. See Note-8 for further details.\n\n## Expense Allocation\n\nIn  preparing  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  periods  prior  to  the  Separation,  certain  expenses,  including  property  operating  expenses, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses, incurred at the corporate level that are attributable to us have been allocated on a carve-out basis. Expenses allocated for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were $9.8 million, $9.5 million, and $7.6 million, respectively. Depending on the nature of the expense, the allocation was based on Aimco's relative share of total gross potential revenue and the relative gross asset value of our communities as  compared  to  the  total  gross  potential  revenue  and  gross  asset  value  of  all  communities  held  by  Aimco  Predecessor,  which  we  believe  to  be  reasonable methodologies. These allocated expenses are centralized corporate costs for management and other services, including, but not limited to, executive oversight, treasury, finance, human resources, tax, accounting, financial reporting, information technology, and investor relations.\n\n## Sublease with AIR\n\nIn December 2020, we entered into a sublease arrangement with AIR to provide space within our corporate office, including tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, at then-current market rents.  The sublease provides for fixed rents, which commenced on January 1, 2021 and expire on May 31, 2029.  Please refer to Note 4 for further information about our sublease income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have amounts due to and due from AIR of $5.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. The due to AIR primarily consist of invoices paid on our behalf and accrued interest on the Notes Payable to AIR. The due from AIR primarily consist of prepaid rents.\n\n## Guarantee Liability\n\nLegal liabilities that relate to occurrences prior to the Separation, including environmental liabilities related to properties that were no longer owned by Aimco or AIR at the time of the Separation, pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement, Aimco Operating Partnership will bear the first $17.5 million of such liabilities, in the aggregate, and AIR Operating Partnership will bear any such liabilities in excess of $17.5 million.\n\nOn the date of Separation, we recognized a guarantee liability of $16.4 million based on an estimate of the expected future cash flows required to settle the legal liabilities, including, but not limited to, remediation, settlement and legal costs, discounted by an estimated market discount rate of 4.25%.  The guarantee liability will be systematically reduced in proportion to the estimated liability as costs related to the legal liabilities are incurred, which we estimate will occur through 2023.

A limited partnership is considered a VIE when the majority of the limited partners unrelated to the general partner possess neither the right to remove the general partner without cause, nor certain rights to participate in the decisions  that  most  significantly  affect  the  financial  results  of  the  partnership.  In  determining  whether  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE,  we  consider qualitative  and  quantitative  factors,  including,  but  not  limited  to:  which  activities  most  significantly  impact  the  VIE's  economic  performance  and  which  party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of our investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support; and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the business activities of the other investors. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\n\nThe VIEs we consolidate own interests in real estate. We are the primary beneficiary for the VIEs because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly  impact  the  entities'  economic  performance  and  have  a  substantial  economic  interest.  We  have  six  unconsolidated  VIEs  for  which  we  are  not  the primary beneficiary because we are not the decision maker.\n\nThe details of our consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs are summarized in the table below as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except for VIE count).\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                         | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                         | Consolidated        | Unconsolidated      | Consolidated        | Unconsolidated      |\n| Count of VIEs                           | 2                   | 6                   | 1                   | 5                   |\n| Assets:                                 |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Real estate, net                        | $ 310,552   $       | -   $               | 299,387   $         | -                   |\n| Mezzanine investment                    | -                   | 307,362             | -                   | 280,258             |\n| Right-of-use lease assets               | 92,709              | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n| Unconsolidated real estate partnerships | -                   | 12,829              | -                   | 12,741              |\n| Other assets                            | 16,949              | 12,500              | 14,645              | -                   |\n| Liabilities:                            |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Notes Payable to AIR                    | -                   | -                   | 66,295              | -                   |\n| Deferred tax liability                  | 133,842             | -                   | 143,934             | -                   |\n| Accrued liabilities and other           | 7,106               | -                   | 8,873               | -                   |\n| Lease liabilities                       | 86,781              | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n\nAssets of our consolidated VIEs must first be used to settle the liabilities of the VIE. The consolidated VIEs' creditors do not have recourse to our general credit.\n\n## Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nWe own an interest in four apartment communities in San Diego, California, of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our investment balance of $12.8 million and $12.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represents our maximum exposure to loss in these VIEs. Our other unconsolidated VIE is insignificant to our consolidated balance sheets for both periods presented.\n\nAs discussed in Note 2, AIR owns an interest in a partnership that owns Parkmerced Apartments, of which it is not the primary beneficiary, and under the terms of the Separation Agreement, AIR is obligated to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that hold this interest to us upon receipt of applicable third-party consent. Our investment balance of $307.4 million as of December 31, 2020, reflected in Mezzanine Investment in our consolidated balance sheets, represents our indirect interest in notes receivable through our agreement with AIR and represents our maximum exposure to loss in this VIE.

The credit agreement provides for a new $150.0 million secured credit facility, a $20.0 million swingline loan sub-facility and a $30.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. We can request incremental commitments under the credit agreement up to an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The credit facility expires on December 2023, but can be extended, at our option, by up to two twelve-month periods, subject to the satisfaction of certain events and covenant metrics. The revolving loans (other than the swingline) will bear interest, at our option, at a per annum rate equal to (a) LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% or (b) a base rate plus a margin of 1.00%. Swingline loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the base rate plus a margin of 1.00%. The base rate is defined as a fluctuating per annum rate of interest equal to the highest of (x) the overnight bank funding rate as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.5%, (y) PNC Bank, National Association's prime rate and (z)  the  daily  LIBOR  Rate  plus  1.00%.  If  the  LIBOR  Rate  determined  under  any  referenced  method  would  be  less  than  .25%,  such  rate  shall  be  deemed .25%.  Aimco may terminate or, from time to time, reduce the aggregate amount of commitments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding balance related to the credit facility, the swingline sub-facility or the letter of credit Sub-facility. Total debt issuance costs of approximately $1.9 million have been deferred and are presented within other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Under our revolving secured credit facility, we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, minimum adjusted tangible net worth of $625.0 million, and maximum leverage of 60% as defined in the credit agreement, among other customary covenants. We are currently in compliance with these covenants.\n\n## Notes Payable to AIR\n\nOn December 14, 2020, our subsidiary, Aimco JO Intermediate Holdings LLC ('Aimco JO') entered into two notes aggregating to $534.1 million (the 'Notes Payable to AIR' or 'Notes') in exchange for an equity interest in James-Oxford Limited Partnership ('James Oxford') a consolidated subsidiary of Aimco that  indirectly  owns  a  portfolio  of  consolidated  real  estate  assets.  The  Notes  are  secured  by  a  pledge  of  the  equity  interests  in  James  Oxford,  however,  James Oxford's assets secure existing senior loans of $215.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The Notes mature on January 31, 2024 and bear interest at 5.2%, with accrued  interest  payable  quarterly  on  January  1,  April  1,  July  1  and  October  1,  commencing  on  April  1,  2021.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  we recognized interest expense of $1.3 million associated with the Notes Payable to AIR, which is included in interest expense and due to affiliates on the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets, respectively.\n\nUpon a disposition, consolidation, or similar event or transaction, Aimco JO is obligated to prepay the Notes in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds received in connection with such transaction or casualty event.  Any such prepayment shall be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole amount representing all remaining unpaid interest over the term of the Notes. However, if after giving effect to such transaction or casualty event, the fair market value of all real estate assets owned by James Oxford and its subsidiaries, less senior secured indebtedness (e.g., nonrecourse property debt), exceeds the thenoutstanding principal balance of the Notes, we have the option to reinvest the net cash proceeds within 180 days of such transaction or casualty event by acquiring, leasing, constructing, or improving real property useful in the business of Aimco JO or its subsidiaries that we believe in good faith will enhance or create value. We are not otherwise permitted to prepay the Notes prior to the maturity date.\n\nThe Notes Payable to AIR are senior secured obligations of Aimco JO and rank senior to all other senior obligations of Aimco JO to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral and rank pari passu with all other senior unsubordinated obligations of Aimco JO to the extent the amount of such obligations exceed the value of the underlying collateral. The Notes are not guaranteed and as a result, recourse is limited to Aimco JO, its assets and the underlying collateral pledged to secure Aimco JO's obligations under the Notes. The Notes also contain customary representations, warranties, non-financial covenants and events of default.\n\n## Upton Construction Loan\n\nOn December 23, 2020, our Upton Place joint venture entered into a construction loan with Bank OZK for up to $174.2 million, which was undrawn at December 31, 2020.  The construction loan is secured by the 99-year leasehold interest in the development site and by improvements to be constructed on the development site. Interest will accrue on the construction loan only when the funds are drawn upon. Funds drawn upon will bear interest at a rate equal to one month Libor ('Libor') plus 450 basis points subject to a minimum all-in per annum interest rate of 4.75%. The initial term of the construction loan is fifty-four months, beginning December 23, 2020. The Upton Place joint venture has the option to extend the term for two additional periods of one year each, subject to the satisfaction of certain events and covenant metrics.\n\nTotal debt issuance costs of approximately $7.5 million have been deferred and are presented within other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Property-Level Debt",

We recognize the tax effects related to stock-based compensation through earnings in the period the compensation is recognized.\n\n## Note 10 - Aimco Equity\n\nOn December 15, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our business into two, separate and distinct, publicly traded companies, Aimco and AIR. The Separation was effected by way of a pro rata distribution, in which stockholders of Aimco received one share of Class A common stock of AIR for every one share of Class A common stock of Aimco held as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. AIR Operating Partnership also completed a pro rata distribution of all of the outstanding common limited partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership to holders of AIR Operating Partnership common limited partnership units and AIR Operating Partnership Class I High Performance partnership units as of the close of business on December 5, 2020.\n\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Separation, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, Aimco is presented as being spun-off from AIR. Therefore, we are  the  accounting  spinee  and  AIR  is  considered  the  divesting  entity  and  treated  as  the  accounting  spinnor,  or  accounting  predecessor.    Since  the  assets, liabilities and operations of Aimco prior to the Separation were spread across multiple legal entities, a separate capital structure did not exist.\n\nImmediately following the Separation, our Board of Directors was authorized to issue up to 510,587,500 shares of common stock.\n\n## Note 11 - Partners' Capital\n\n## Separation from AIR\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Aimco Operating Partnership completed the Separation, which was effected, in part, through a pro rata distribution of all of the outstanding common limited partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership to holders of AIR Operating Partnership common limited partnership units and AIR Operating Partnership Class I High Performance partnership units as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. In addition, stockholders of Aimco received one share of Class A common stock of AIR for every one share of Class A common stock of Aimco held as of the close of business on the record date, and received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Class A common stock of AIR.\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership Partners' Capital\n\n## Common Partnership Units\n\nIn the Aimco Operating Partnership's consolidated balance sheets, the common partnership units held by Aimco are classified within Partners' Capital as General Partner and Special Limited Partner capital and the common OP Units are classified within Limited Partners' capital. In Aimco's consolidated balance sheets, the common OP Units are classified within permanent equity as common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nCommon partnership units held by Aimco are not redeemable whereas common OP Units are redeemable at the holders' option, subject to certain restrictions, on the basis of one common OP Unit for either one share of Common Stock or cash equal to the fair value of a share of Common Stock at the time of redemption. Aimco has the option to deliver shares of Common Stock in exchange for all or any portion of the common OP Units tendered for redemption. When a limited partner redeems a common OP Unit for Common Stock, Limited Partners' capital is reduced, and the General Partner and Special Limited Partners' capital is increased.\n\nThe holders of the common OP Units receive distributions in an amount equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of Common Stock.",

        "page_content": "## Note 12 - Earnings per Share and per Unit\n\nAimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership calculate basic earnings per common share and basic earnings per common unit based on the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock and common partnership units outstanding. We calculate diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit taking into consideration dilutive common stock and common partnership unit equivalents and dilutive convertible securities outstanding during the period.\n\nThe common shares and common partnership units outstanding at the Separation date are reflected as outstanding for all periods prior to the Separation for purposes of determining earnings per share and per unit.\n\nOur Common Stock and common partnership unit equivalents include options to purchase shares of Common Stock, which, if exercised, would result in Aimco's issuance of additional shares and the Aimco Operating Partnership's issuance to Aimco of additional common partnership units equal to the number of shares purchased under the options. These equivalents also include unvested TSR Restricted Stock awards that do not meet the definition of participating securities, which would result in an increase in the number of shares of Common Stock and common partnership units outstanding equal to the number of the shares that vest. Common partnership unit equivalents also include unvested long-term incentive partnership units. We include in the denominator securities with dilutive effect in calculating diluted earnings per share and per unit during these periods.\n\nOur Time-Based Restricted Stock awards receive non-forfeitable dividends similar to shares of Common Stock and common partnership units prior to vesting, and  our  TSR  LTIP  I  units  and  TSR  LTIP  II  units  receive  non-forfeitable  distributions  based  on  specified  percentages  of  the  distributions  paid  to  common partnership units prior to vesting and conversion. The unvested restricted shares and units related to these awards are participating securities. We include the effect of participating  securities  in  basic  and  diluted  earnings  per  share  and  unit  computations  using  the  two-class  method  of  allocating  distributed  and  undistributed earnings when the two-class method is more dilutive than the treasury stock method.\n\nReconciliations of the numerator and denominator in the calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share and per unit for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are as follows (in thousands, except per share and per unit data):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                      | Year Ended December 31, 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                      | Income (Numerator)             | Shares (Denominator)           | Per Share Amount               |\n| Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share:                |                                |                                |                                |\n| Net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders   | $ (5,041)                      | 148,569                        | $ (0.03)                       |\n|                                                      | Year Ended December 31, 2019   | Year Ended December 31, 2019   | Year Ended December 31, 2019   |\n|                                                      | Income (Numerator)             | Shares (Denominator)           | Per Share Amount               |\n| Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share:                |                                |                                |                                |\n| Net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders | $ 304                          | 148,549                        | $ -                            |\n| Diluted Earnings per Share:                          |                                |                                |                                |\n| Effect of dilutive securities                        | -                              | 20                             | -                              |\n| Net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders | $ 304                          | 148,569                        | $ -                            |\n|                                                      | Year Ended December 31, 2018   | Year Ended December 31, 2018   | Year Ended December 31, 2018   |\n|                                                      | Income (Numerator)             | Shares (Denominator)           | Per Share Amount               |\n| Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share:                |                                |                                |                                |\n| Net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders | $ 3,243                        | 148,549                        | $ 0.02                         |\n| Diluted Earnings per Share:                          |                                |                                |                                |\n| Effect of dilutive securities                        | -                              | 20                             | -                              |\n| Net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders | $ 3,243                        | 148,569                        | $ 0.02                         |",

As of December 31, 2020, approximately 29.8 million shares were available for issuance under the Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the '2015 Plan'). The total number of shares available for issuance under this plan may increase due to any forfeiture, cancellation, exchange, surrender, termination or expiration of an award outstanding under the 2015 Plan. Awards under the 2015 Plan may be in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, or other types of awards as authorized under the Plan. Our plans are administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into an agreement to modify all outstanding awards granted to the holders of such awards. Each outstanding time or performance-based Aimco award was converted into one share of Aimco common stock and one share of AIR common stock. Generally, all such Aimco equity awards retain the same terms and vesting conditions as the original Aimco equity awards immediately before the Separation.\n\nFollowing  the  Separation,  compensation  expense  related  to  these  modified  awards  for  the  employees  retained  by  Aimco  is  incurred  by  Aimco.  The compensation expense related to these modified awards for employees of AIR is incurred by AIR.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total compensation cost recognized for share-based awards was (in thousands):\n\n|                                          | 2020 (4)   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Share-based compensation expense (1)     | 1,070      |\n| Capitalized share-based compensation (2) | 138        |\n| Total share-based compensation (3)       | 1,208      |\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, our share of total unvested compensation cost not yet recognized was $1.5 million. We expect to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.\n\nWe grant stock options and restricted stock awards that are subject to time-based vesting and require continuous employment, typically over a period of four years from the grant date, and we refer to these awards as Time-Based Stock Options and Time-Based Restricted Stock, respectively. We also grant stock options, restricted stock awards, and two forms of long-term incentive partnership units ('LTIP units'), that vest conditioned on Aimco's total shareholder return ('TSR'), relative to the NAREIT Equity Apartment Index (60% weighting) and the MSCI US REIT Index (40% weighting) over a forward-looking performance",

Vested LTIP II units may be converted at the holders' option to LTIP Units for a conversion price over a term of 10 years. Earned TSR-based awards, if any, will vest 50% on each of the third  anniversary  and  fourth  anniversary  of  the  grant  date,  based  on  continued  employment.  Our  Time-Based  Stock  Options  and  TSR  Stock  Options  expire generally 10 years from the date of grant.\n\nWe recognize compensation cost associated with time-based awards ratably over the requisite service periods, which are typically four years. We recognize compensation cost related to the TSR-based awards, which have graded vesting periods, over the requisite service period for each separate vesting tranche of the award, commencing on the grant date. The value of the TSR-based awards takes into consideration the probability that the market condition will be achieved; therefore, previously recorded compensation cost is not adjusted in the event that the market condition is not achieved, and awards do not vest.\n\nWe had Time-Based Stock Options,  Time-Based  Restricted  Stock,  TSR  Stock  Options,  TSR  Restricted  Stock,  TSR  LTIP  I  units  and  TSR  LTIP  II  units outstanding  as  of  December  31,  2020.

This interest rate option, or swaption, provides partial protection against our refinancing interest rate risk and is intended to mitigate interest rate increases between now and 2024. We receive a cash settlement in the future if the prevailing interest rate is higher than the 1.68% strike price. The amount of future cash settlement is capped if the prevailing interest rate exceeds 2.78%. Alternatively, if interest rates were to decrease below the specified strike price, we would not receive a cash settlement.\n\nWe measure at fair value on a recurring basis our interest rate option, which is presented in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Our interest rate  option  is  classified  within  Level  2  of  the  GAAP  fair  value  hierarchy,  and  we  estimate  its  fair  value  using  pricing  models  that  rely  on  observable  market information, including contractual terms, market prices, and interest rate yield curves. The fair value adjustment is included in earnings in other expense, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. Changes in fair value are reflected as a non-cash transaction in adjustments to arrive at cash flows from operations, and the upfront premium is reflected in other financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have investments of $2.3 million in RET Ventures consisting of three privately held entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry. These investments are measured at net asset value ('NAV') as a practical expedient under ASC 820.  See Note 15 for further details for RET Ventures unfunded commitments.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  fair  value  of  our  interest  rate  option  and  our  investment  in  RET  Ventures  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019  (in thousands):\n\n|                                   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2019   | As of December 31, 2019   | As of December 31, 2019   | As of December 31, 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                   | Total                     | Level 1                   | Level 2                   | Level 3                   | Total                     | Level 1                   | Level 2                   | Level 3                   |\n| Interest rate option              | $ 13,315   $              | -   $                     | 13,315   $                | -   $                     | -   $                     |                           | -   $ -   $               | -                         |\n| Investment in RET    Ventures (1) | 2,293                     | -                         | -                         | -                         | 752                       | -                         | -                         | -                         |",

We estimate the fair value of our non-recourse property debt and Notes Payable to AIR using an income and market approach, including comparison of the contractual terms to observable and unobservable inputs such as market interest rate risk spreads, contractual interest rates, remaining periods to maturity, and loan to value ratios on similarly encumbered apartment communities within our portfolio. We classify the fair value of our non-recourse property debt and Notes Payable to AIR within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy based on the significance of certain observable inputs used to estimate its fair value.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Notes Payable to AIR approximated their fair value at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe following table summarizes carrying value and fair value of our non-recourse property debt as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                            | As of December 31, 2019   | As of December 31, 2019   | As of December 31, 2019   | As of December 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                            | 2020                      | 2020                      |                           |                           |\n|                            | Carrying Value            | Fair Value                | Carrying Value            | Fair Value                |\n| Non-recourse property debt | 449,510                   | 467,010    $              | 493,886                   | 499,841                   |\n\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nImmediately following the Separation, we tested our right of use assets, tenant improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and our internally developed software for impairment. We concluded that the estimated fair value of the related assets no longer exceeded their carrying values and recorded an aggregate impairment of $15.9 million.  The  fair  value  determination  included  assumptions  based  on  Level  3  inputs.  See  Note  2  for  further  details.  There  were  no  such impairments in 2019.\n\n## Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Commitments\n\nIn connection with our redevelopment and other capital activities, we have entered into various construction-related contracts and we have made commitments to complete certain projects. As of December 31, 2020, our commitments related to these projects totaled approximately $3.2 million, most of which we expect to incur during the next 12 months.\n\nWe enter  into  certain  commitments  for  future  purchases  of  goods  and  services  in  connection  with  the  operations  of  our  apartment  communities.  Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.\n\nWe have a commitment to fund an additional $37.5 million to IQHQ and currently expect to incur this investment over the next two years. We also have unfunded commitments related to RET Ventures in the amount of $1.1 million, the timing of which is uncertain.\n\n## Legal Matters\n\nFor legal liabilities that relate to occurrences prior to the Separation, including environmental liabilities related to properties that were no longer owned by Aimco or AIR at the time of the Separation, pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement, Aimco Operating Partnership will bear the first $17.5 million of such liabilities, in the aggregate, and AIR Operating Partnership will bear any such liabilities in excess of $17.5 million. See Note 5 for further details.\n\n## Note 16 - Business Segments\n\nWe evaluated  the  information  reviewed  by  our  chief  executive  officer,  who  is  our  chief  operating  decision  maker  ('CODM'),  to  assess  our  operating performance. We have determined we have three segments: (i) Development and redevelopment, (ii) Operating Portfolio, and (iii) Other. Our Development and redevelopment  segment  includes  residential  apartment  communities,  including  associated  commercial  space,  that  are  under  construction  or  have  not  achieved stabilization. Our Operating Portfolio segment includes majority owned residential communities that have a achieved stabilized level of operations as of January 1, 2019 and maintained it throughout the current year and comparable period. We aggregate all our apartment communities that have reached a stabilization into our Operating Portfolio. Our Other segment consists of 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, our only commercial",

We realigned our segments during the fourth quarter 2020 and have restated historical periods to conform with current segment presentation.\n\nOur  CODM uses  cash  flow,  construction  timeline  to  completion  and  actual  versus  budgeted  results  to  evaluate  our  properties  in  our  Development  and redevelopment  segment.  Our  CODM  uses  proportionate  property  net  operating  income  to  assess  the  operating  performance  of  our  Operating  Portfolio. Proportionate property net operating income is defined as our share of rental and other property revenues, excluding reimbursements, less direct property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements, for consolidated communities. In our consolidated statements of operations, utility reimbursements are included in rental and other property revenues, in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, our Development and redevelopment segment includes two communities under development or redevelopment, Upton Place and Hamilton on the Bay. Our Operating Portfolio segment includes twenty four consolidated communities with 6,067 apartment homes (apartment homes unaudited). Our Other segment includes one office building.\n\nThe following tables present the revenues, proportionate property net operating income, and income before income tax benefit (expense) of our segments on a proportionate basis, excluding amounts related to our proportionate share of four apartment communities with 142 apartment homes that we neither managed nor consolidated, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in thousands):\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                                               | Development and Redevelopment   | Operating Portfolio   | Other       | Proportionate and Other Adjustments (1)   | Corporate and Amounts Not Allocated to Segments   | Consolidated   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Year ended December 31, 2020:                                 |                                 |                       |             |                                           |                                                   |                |\n| Rental and other property revenues                            | $ 1,515    $                    | 130,689    $          | 12,986    $ | 6,196    $                                | 65                                                | $ 151,451      |\n| Property operating expenses                                   | 981                             | 43,891                | 4,148       | 5,702                                     | 6,792                                             | 61,514         |\n| Other operating expenses not allocated    to segments (2)     | -

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Organization and Nature of Business\n\nMaximus PM Mezzanine A LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, commenced operations on November 26, 2019 for the purpose of owning, operating and leasing a 3,086,918 square-foot apartment complex in San Francisco, California, commonly known as Villas at Parkmerced (the Property) through a wholly owned subsidiary, Parkmerced Owner LLC (collectively referred to as the Company). Prior to November 26, 2019, the sole member of Parkmerced Owner LLC was Maximus PM Mezzanine 1 LLC (the Member). On November 26, 2019, commensurate with securing new financing (see Note 5), the sole member of Parkmerced Owner LLC became Maximus PM Mezzanine A LLC, which in turn, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Member. Capital contributions, allocation of profits and losses,  and  distributions  are  in  accordance  with  the  limited  liability  company  agreement.  The  Company  shall  continue  until  dissolution  or  termination  in accordance with the terms outlined in the limited liability company agreement.\n\nThe Property was entitled for redevelopment from 3,221 units to 8,900 units. The redevelopment is in the design and planning stages for Phases 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D.\n\n## Note 2. The Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern - COVID 19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has developed rapidly in 2020. The resulting impact of the virus on the operations and measures taken by various governments to contain the virus have negatively affected the Company's consolidated results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. The extent to which the coronavirus will continue to impact the Company's results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and actions taken to contain the coronavirus or its impact, among others.\n\nAs a result of this pandemic and the measures taken by the regulatory and government agencies, the Company's occupancy and revenues declined significantly in 2020 compared to 2019. Ending occupancy as of December 31, 2020 was 75.7% compared to the same date for 2019 of 93.7%. Gross revenues also declined 10% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company also recognized $2,461,913 in bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $356,134 for the same period in 2019. As a result of the ongoing eviction moratorium in which the Property resides, the Company's gross accounts receivable went from approximately $1,100,000 as of December 31, 2019 to approximately $4,000,000 as of December 31, 2020. The Company ultimately used its operating cash reserves to manage through the impact of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe Company's mortgage and mezzanine loan agreements, which are further described in Note 5 and 6, require the Company to maintain a two-quarter consecutive debt coverage ratio of at least 1.05. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as described above, the Company failed to maintain the debt coverage ratio requirement as required. The lender has the right under the loan agreement to place the Company into a Cash Trap Period, as defined. Pursuant to a Cash Trap Period,  all  funds  deposited  into  a  clearing  account  are  applied  at  the  Lender's  discretion  and  restricted  from  withdrawal  by  the  Company.  As  of  the  date  the consolidated  financial  statements  are  available  to  be  issued,  the  lenders  have  not  indicated  their  intent  to  place  the  Company  into  the  Cash  Trap  Period  nor accelerate the due date of the loans.\n\nAs a result of these matters there is a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore whether  the  Company  will  realize  its  assets  and  settle  its  liabilities  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  at  the  amounts  recorded  in  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nIn response to these matters, management has and will continue to take the following actions:",

        "page_content": "## Maximus PM Mezzanine A LLC and Subsidiary\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nHowever, if leasing activity  does  not  resume  to  historical  levels  seen  before  COVID-19  then  it  will  be  necessary  to  raise  additional  capital  from  investors  or financing from lenders. Management has started those discussions and management expects that this capital will be available if required.\n\nAlthough it is not certain that these efforts will be successful, management has determined that these actions will be sufficient to mitigate the uncertainty and therefore has prepared the consolidated financial reporting on a going concern basis.\n\n## Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Company in preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles:\n\nBasis of presentation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The consolidated operations of the Company involve a variety of real estate transactions, and it is not possible to precisely measure the operating cycle of the Company. The consolidated balance sheet of the Company has been prepared on an unclassified basis in accordance with real estate industry practice.\n\nPrinciples of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include accounts and operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Parkmerced Owner LLC. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\n\nUse of estimates: The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. As such, those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates  include  the  allowance  for  uncollectible  accounts  receivable.  Estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Revisions  to estimates are recognized prospectively.\n\nDepreciation: Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The buildings are being depreciated over 40 years. Building improvements are depreciated over their respective estimated useful lives (five years to 40 years). Furniture and fixtures are depreciated over five years and equipment is depreciated over seven years. Expenditures for significant additions, renovations, renewals and betterments that extend the economic useful lives of the assets are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.\n\nImpairment of long-lived assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets to determine whether there has been any impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows before debt service is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company will perform a valuation of the asset group and will recognize an impairment loss to the extent that the fair value is lower than the carrying amounts. No impairment loss was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nCash and restricted cash: The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash  equivalents.  There  were  no  cash  equivalents  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020.  Restricted  cash  consists  of  amounts  held  in  escrow  for  capital replacements, real estate taxes and lender-controlled cash management accounts (CMA) pursuant to the lender agreement for capital improvements and debt service payments. As further discussed in Note 8, included in restricted cash is a money market balance required to secure a letter of credit issued by the Company's bank.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                       | 2020        |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Cash                                  | $ 3,467,696 |\n| Real estate tax and insurance escrows | 3,070,558   |\n| Money market                          | 1,749,860   |\n| Capital reserve escrow                | 899,592     |\n| Restricted cash                       | 5,720,010   |\n| Total cash and restricted cash        | $ 9,187,706 |\n\nPrepaid expenses: Prepaid expenses consist of prepayments for future expenses and are expensed over the terms of the agreements. Prepaid expenses primarily consist of prepaid insurance.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Maximus PM Mezzanine A LLC and Subsidiary\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDeferred financing costs: Deferred financing costs are bank fees, equity options, and other costs incurred in obtaining financing that are amortized over the term of the respective loan agreement using a method which approximates the effective interest method. Upon refinancing, any unamortized financing costs are written off, and both are included in amortization of deferred financing costs within interest and financing charges on the accompanying consolidated statements of income and are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\nRents and other accounts receivable: Rents and other accounts receivable consist primarily of tenant receivables and are stated at net realizable value. Rents receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically for adequacy by reviewing such factors as the credit quality of tenants, any delinquency in payments, historical trends and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,231,161.\n\nFair value of financial instruments: The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 825, Disclosures About Fair Value  of  Financial  Instruments,  requires  the  Company  to  disclose  fair  value  information  about  all  financial  instruments,  whether  or  not  recognized  on  the consolidated balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate fair value. The Company has elected application of a provision within Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which exempts the Company from the requirement to apply fair value disclosure of financial instruments that are measured at amortized cost.\n\nInterest rate swap option: The interest rate swap option is carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet, which is the estimated amount that the Company would  receive  in  a  current  exchange  transaction  at  year-end,  taking  into  account  current  interest  rates  and  the  current  creditworthiness  of  the  respective counterparties. The change in fair value is recorded in current period earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of $11,307,934 on that instrument.\n\nRevenue recognition: Revenue is recognized in accordance with the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to for those goods and services. The majority of the Company's revenue is derived from rental income and other lease related income.\n\nThe Company accounts for its leases with tenants as operating leases. Rents received in advance are deferred until they become due. During the term of their respective leases, tenants reimburse the Company for a share of the utilities as defined in their leases and income is recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue for new rental-related income not included as components of a lease, such as late fee income and termination fee income, as well as nonrental-related income when the performance obligation is met.\n\nDue to the nature and timing of the Company's identified revenue streams, there are no material amounts outstanding or unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2020.\n\nIncome taxes: No provisions for federal income taxes have been made, as the liability for such taxes is that of the Member, not the Company. For federal income tax purposes, the Company is considered a disregarded entity. The Company is subject to the statutory requirements of the state in which it conducts business. The FASB has provided guidance for how uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the entity's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained when challenged or when examined by the applicable taxing authority. For the year ended December 31, 2020, management has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions. With some exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by U.S. federal, state or local tax authorities for years before 2017\n\nConcentration  of  credit  risk: The  Company  maintains  funds  in  financial  institutions  that,  from  time  to  time,  may  exceed  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance Corporation insured limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and monitors the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which it conducts business. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash balances and reserves.\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires all lessees to record a lease liability at lease inception, with a corresponding right of use asset, except for short-term leases. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for operating leases. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which makes narrowscope improvements to the standard for specific issues. In July 2018, the FASB also issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements,  which  provides  lessors  with  a  practical  expedient,  in  certain  circumstances,  to  not  separate  nonlease  components  from  the  associated  lease component, similar to the expedient provided for lessees. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20, Narrow-scope Improvements for Lessors. This ASU provides an election for lessors to exclude",

ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted.\n\nThe Company intends to elect the practical  expedients  provided  to  lessors,  including,  in  certain  circumstances,  to  not  separate  nonlease  components  from  the associate lease component, and to exclude sales and related taxes from consideration in the contract. The Company continues to assess the effect the guidance will have on its existing accounting policies and the consolidated financial statements.\n\nSubsequent events: The Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and/or disclosure through March 1, 2021, the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.\n\n## Note 4. Fair Value Measurements\n\nUnder the FASB's authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date.  In  determining  fair  value,  the  Company  uses  various  methods,  including  market, income and cost approaches. Based on these approaches, the Company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability,  including  assumptions  about  risk  and/or  the  risks  inherent  in  the  inputs  to  the  valuation  techniques.  These  inputs  can  be  readily  observable,  market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Based on the observability  of the inputs used in the valuation  techniques,  the  Company is  required  to  provide  the  following  information according to the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets that the Company can access at the reporting date, such as the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n- Level 2: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant observable inputs are available, either directly or indirectly such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\nLevel 3: Prices or valuations that require inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nWhile the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities could result in a different estimate of fair value.\n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value:\n\nDerivative instruments: Derivatives are fair valued according to their classification as over-the-counter (OTC). OTC derivatives consist of an interest rate swap option.  This  derivative  is  fair  valued  under  Level  2  using  third-party  services.  Observable  market  inputs  include  yield  curves  (the  LIBOR  swap  curve  and applicable basis swap curves), commodity prices, option volatilities, counterparty credit risk and other related data. Credit valuation adjustments are required to reflect  both  the  Company's  own  nonperformance  risk  and  the  respective  counterparty's  nonperformance  risk.  These  adjustments  are  determined  generally  by applying a credit spread for the counterparty or the Company as appropriate to the total expected exposure of the derivative.\n\nThe following presents the Company's fair value hierarchy for those assets measured at fair value as of December 31:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                                               | Interest Rate Swap Option 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Level 1 - Quoted prices                       | -                                |\n| Level 2 - Other significant observable inputs | $ 7,513,189                      |\n| Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs     | -                                |\n|                                               | $ 7,513,189                      |",

Mortgage Notes Payable\n\nOn November 26, 2019, the Company entered into a loan agreement, with a total principal balance of $1,500,000,000. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay the existing mortgage debt in the amount of $450,000,000, including any unpaid interest and fees. The remaining proceeds of approximately $911,154,000 were distributed to repay mezzanine debt obligations of the Member. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3.25% per annum and requires monthly payments of interest only throughout the life of the loan. The loan matures on December 9, 2024, at which point all outstanding principal and unpaid interest are due.\n\nThe loan is nonrecourse and is secured by the Property, an assignment of rents and leases, as well as a security interest in substantially all of the Company's other assets. Certain payment and performance obligations are guaranteed under the loan by an affiliate of the Parent. The loan is subject to covenants and conditions which it has not met (see Note 2).\n\nThe loan requires the creation of certain escrows to be maintained by the lender, as defined in the loan agreement. The balances related to the required escrows are included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 (see Note 3).\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal balance of the loan was $1,500,000,000. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has presented unamortized deferred financing costs of $114,954,189 against the outstanding mortgage note payable balance on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $77,883,083, which includes amortization of deferred loan costs of $29,358,339.\n\nAs a requirement of the loan, the Company entered into an interest rate swap option agreement (Swaption), in order to manage the interest rate risk associated with the Company's borrowing. The Swaption provides the Company with the right but not the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap at December 9, 2024, with a notional amount of $1,500,000,000 to fix interest at a rate of 2.781% per annum.\n\n## Note 6. Mezzanine Notes Payable\n\nOn November 26, 2019, the Company entered into a Mezzanine Loan agreement with APMSF Investors LLC (APMSF or Optionee). The Mezzanine Note (Mezz Note) consists of a junior principal balance of $75,000,000 and senior principal balance of $200,000,000 which totals $275,000,000. Proceeds from the Mezz Note were distributed to pay off debt obligations at the Member and the Member's sole member. The Mezz Note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum and requires all available cash be first applied to interest accrued during the identified interest period each month, secondly to payment of unpaid interest that accrued during earlier interest periods, and third to all other sums then due and payable hereunder and last to the payment of the Junior Principal.\n\nThe Mezz Note matures on December 9, 2024 with an option to extend for an additional five years. The Company shall not be in default on each payment date if there is insufficient available cash to pay in full the accrued and unpaid interest. All accrued and unpaid interest shall compound annually on each anniversary of the first Payment Date. Any unpaid interest at the end of each month shall not result in a default, but rather will be added to the principal balance of the Mezz Note. For the period ended December 31, 2020, $28,816,302 of unpaid interest was added to the principal balance of the Mezz Note. Interest expense associated with this loan for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $28,094,410.\n\nAs collateral security for the Mezz Note, the Company pledges all membership interests in the Company and Property if loan is not repaid in terms described in the Loan Agreement.\n\nIn connection to the Mezz Note and for a payment of $100,000 from APMSF, the Parent of the Company granted APMSF Common LLC, an affiliate of APMSF, an exclusive and irrevocable option to acquire a thirty percent (30%) equity interest in the Parent (the Option). The Option may be exercised at any time during the period commencing November 26, 2021 and ending November 26, 2029. The Optionee may elect to accelerate the commencement of the option period upon receiving notice of a capital transaction, the Parent shall issue the optioned interest, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims, pledges, options, security interest and demands. The Optionee shall pay the Parent $1,000,000 plus thirty percent (30%) of the Net Value Contributions, as defined in the Option Agreement upon  exercising  the  option.  The  fair  value  of  the  option  at  issuance  was  $85,600,000  and  has  been  recorded  as  a  discount  against  the  Mezz  Note  on  the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $15,111,316 of amortization of the discount through interest expense in the consolidated income statement. The amortization of the discount was calculated using the effective interest method. The remaining unamortized discount of $70,488,684 as of December 31, 2020 has been presented against the mezzanine principal balance on the accompany consolidated balance sheet. The effective interest rate as of December 31, 2020 was 14.22%.",

Related-Party Transactions\n\nThe Company has entered into a Property  Management  Agreement  (PMA) with  an affiliate  of  the  Member.  The  term  of  the  PMA  is  20  years  unless  sooner terminated in accordance with the PMA. The PMA provides for the following fees to be paid:\n\n- \u00b7 A management fee equal to 3% of collected revenues (as defined) of the Property, payable monthly on the fifth of each month.

The agreement provided for $1,302,021of development fees to be paid as of December 31, 2020 and are included in prepaid expenses on the accompanying balance sheet.\n\n## Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn 2020, an adverse judgement from a lawsuit that was filed in 2014 by a labor union was received against a vendor, who previously provided janitorial and handymen services to the Company. The Company indemnified the vendor through its service agreement and the Company is working with the vendor to appeal the  judgement.  The  judgement  was  for  $2,120,835,  which  the  Company  has  recorded  in  accounts  payable  and  other  accrued  liabilities  on  the  accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Company, on behalf of the vendor, has filed an appeal of the judgement and as a condition of such appeal was required to post a bond for 150% of the judgement. As collateral for the bond, the Company was required to issue through its bank, an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of $1,590,289 to the bond issuer. As discussed in Note 3, the Company was required to establish a money market account as security for the letter of credit. The Company expects the appeal to be heard and ruled on in late 2021 or early 2022 depending on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the court system.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that the impact of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations when resolved.",

        "page_content": "## DESCRIPTION OF AIMCO CLASS A COMMON STOCK\n\n## General\n\nAimco's charter authorizes the issuance of up to 510,587,500 shares of capital stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, all of which are currently classified as Class A common stock. The Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol 'AIV.' Computershare Trust Company, N.A. serves as transfer agent and registrar of the Class A common stock.\n\nHolders of shares of the Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if, when and as declared by Aimco's Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefor. The holders of shares of Class A common stock, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of or any distribution of the assets of Aimco, are entitled to receive ratably any assets remaining after payment in full of all liabilities of Aimco and any liquidation preferences of preferred stock. The shares of Class A common stock possess voting rights for the election of directors of Aimco and in respect of other corporate matters, each share entitling the holder thereof to one vote. Holders of shares of Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, which means that holders of more than 50% of the shares of Class A common stock voting for the election of directors can elect all of the directors if they choose to do so and the holders of the remaining shares cannot elect any directors. Holders of shares of Class A common stock do not have preemptive rights, which means that they have no right to acquire any additional shares of Class A common stock that may be issued by Aimco at a subsequent date.\n\n## Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer\n\nFor Aimco to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, not more than 50% in value of its outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year, and the shares of capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Because Aimco's Board of Directors believes that it is essential for Aimco to continue to qualify as a REIT and to provide additional protection for Aimco's stockholders in the event of certain transactions, Aimco's Board of Directors has adopted provisions of the charter restricting the acquisition of shares of Class A common stock.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions specified in the charter, no holder may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of various attribution and constructive ownership provisions of the Code and Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, more than 8.7% (or 15% in the case of certain pension trusts described in the Code, investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or Mr. Considine) of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock. For purposes of calculating the amount of stock owned by a given individual, the individual's Class A common stock and interests in the Aimco OP L.P. are aggregated. Under certain conditions, Aimco's Board of Directors may waive the ownership limit. However, in no event may such holder's direct or indirect ownership of Class A common stock exceed (i) 12% of the total outstanding shares of Class A common stock, in the case of a person subject to the general 8.7% ownership limit, or (ii) 20% of the total outstanding shares of Class A common stock, in the case of an entity subject to the 15% ownership limit (although the 15% ownership limitation applicable to Mr. Considine may not be waived). As a condition of such waiver, the Aimco Board of Directors may require opinions of counsel satisfactory to it or an undertaking from the applicant with respect to preserving the REIT status of Aimco. If shares of Class A common stock in excess of the ownership limit, or shares of Class A common stock that would cause the REIT to be beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons, or that would result in Aimco being 'closely held,' within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code, or that would otherwise result in Aimco failing to qualify as a REIT, are issued or transferred to any person, such issuance or transfer shall be null and void to the intended transferee, and the intended transferee would acquire no rights to the stock. Shares of Class A common stock transferred in excess of the ownership limit or other applicable limitations will automatically be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more qualifying charitable organizations to be designated by Aimco. Shares transferred to such trust will remain outstanding, and the trustee of the trust will have all voting and dividend rights pertaining to such shares. The trustee of such trust may transfer",

Upon a sale of such shares by the trustee, the interest of the charitable beneficiary will terminate, and the sales proceeds would be paid, first, to the original intended transferee, to the extent of the lesser of (1) such transferee's original purchase price (or the market value of such shares on the date of the violative transfer if purportedly acquired by gift or devise) and (2) the price received by the trustee, and, second, any remainder to the charitable beneficiary. In addition, shares of stock held in such trust are purchasable by Aimco for a 90-day period at a price equal to the lesser of the price paid for the stock by the original intended transferee (or the original market value of such shares if purportedly acquired by gift or devise) and the market price for the stock on the date that Aimco determines to purchase the stock. The 90day period commences on the date of the violative transfer or the date that Aimco's Board of Directors determines in good faith that a violative transfer has occurred, whichever is later. All certificates representing shares of Class A common stock bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above.\n\nAll persons who own, directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code and Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, more than a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock must file a written statement or an affidavit with Aimco containing the information specified in the Aimco charter within 30 days after January 1 of each year. In addition, each stockholder shall upon demand be required to disclose to Aimco in writing such information with respect to the direct, indirect and constructive ownership of shares as Aimco's Board of Directors deems appropriate or necessary to comply with the provisions of the Code applicable to a REIT or to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental agency.\n\nThese restrictions on ownership and transfer of Class A common stock will not apply if Aimco's Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in the best interests of Aimco to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT or that compliance is no longer required for Aimco to qualify as a REIT. The restrictions on ownership and transfer of Class A common stock described above could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for Aimco's Class A common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of Aimco's stockholders.\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF AIMCO PREFERRED STOCK\n\n## General\n\nUnder its charter, Aimco may issue, from time to time, shares of one or more classes or series of preferred stock. The particular terms of any class or series of preferred stock issued will be determined by Aimco's Board of Directors.\n\nAimco's charter authorizes the issuance of up to 510,587,500 shares of capital stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, all of which are classified as Class A common stock. There are currently no shares of Aimco's preferred stock authorized, issued, and outstanding.  The Board of Directors of Aimco is authorized to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock into shares of preferred stock by setting or changing in any one or more respects the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of such shares of capital stock, including, but not limited to, ownership restrictions consistent with the ownership limit with respect to each class or series of capital stock, and the number of shares constituting each class or series, and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any such class or series, to the extent permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, and Aimco's charter.\n\nAimco's Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, may issue preferred stock with voting, conversion, or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of Class A common stock. Preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change of control or make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of Class A common stock, may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Class A common stock, and could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control of Aimco or other corporate action.",
