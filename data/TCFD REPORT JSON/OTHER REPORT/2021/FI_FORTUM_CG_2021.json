Fortum fully complies with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020. The corporate governance statement is issued separately from the operating and financial review, and it has been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee of Fortum's Board of Directors.\n\nFortum has been listed on Nasdaq Helsinki stock exchange since 18 December 1998. Fortum's industrial sector, according to the Global Industry Classification Standard, is Electric Utilities. The State of Finland is the majority owner in Fortum with 50.76% of the shares as on 31 December 2021.\n\nFortum prepares the consolidated financial statements and interim reports in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, the Finnish Securities Markets Act, as well as the appropriate Financial Supervisory Authority's regulations and guidelines and Nasdaq Helsinki's rules. The company's operating and financial review and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act, Accounting Act, Securities Markets Act, and the opinions and guidelines of the Finnish Accounting Board. The Financial Statements are also published in accordance with the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) reporting requirement. The audit firm, Deloitte Oy, has provided an independent auditor's reasonable assurance report on Fortum's ESEF Financial Statements in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised). The auditor's report covers the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.\n\nThe Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020 is available on the website of the Securities Market Association at 4 www.cgfinland.fi .\n\n## Governing bodies of Fortum\n\nThe decision-making bodies managing and overseeing Fortum's administration and operations are the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors with its two Committees; the Audit and Risk Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and the President and CEO, supported by the Fortum Executive Management.\n\nFurther, Fortum has an informal Advisory Council consisting of representatives of Fortum's stakeholder groups as invited by the Board of Directors. The Advisory Council aims at advancing Fortum's businesses by facilitating a dialogue and exchange of views between Fortum and its stakeholders. In 2021, the Advisory Council consisted of 13 representatives of Fortum's stakeholder groups including three employee representatives.\n\nAs sustainability is an integral part of Fortum's strategy and operations, the highest decision-making on sustainability and climaterelated matters falls on the duties of the members of the Board of Directors, who share joint responsibility for these matters. Therefore, Fortum has not established a specific Sustainability Committee for\n\n## Governing bodies of Fortum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe decision-making on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters. The Audit and Risk Committee, members of the Fortum Executive Management, and other senior executives support the Board of Directors in the decision-making in these matters, when necessary.\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nThe General Meeting of Shareholders is the highest decision-making body of Fortum. Every shareholder has the right to participate in the General Meeting, propose items to be included on the agenda of the General Meeting and exercise his/her power of decision in the matters belonging to the General Meeting by law, as stipulated in the Finnish Companies Act. Each share entitles to one vote. A shareholder also has the right to ask questions about the matters discussed at the General Meeting of Shareholders. By the end of each financial year, Fortum discloses the date by which a shareholder may propose items to be included on the agenda of the following General Meeting on its Annual General Meeting website.\n\nThe decisions at the General Meeting of Shareholders are primarily made by a simple majority of votes. Such decisions include, for example, resolutions on the adoption of the financial statements, payment of dividends, discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability, appointment of the Board of Directors and the external auditor, and deciding on their remuneration.\n\nIn accordance with Fortum's Articles of Association and the Finnish Companies Act, a notice to convene the General Meeting of Shareholders is issued by the Board of Directors. The notice is delivered no more than three months and no less than three weeks before the General Meeting of Shareholders by publishing the notice on the company's website or in two newspapers chosen by the Board of Directors. The Annual General Meeting is to be held once a year, in June at the latest.\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders shall be held whenever the Board of Directors finds it necessary or when it is required by law to convene such a meeting.",

The Board of Directors of the company decided on an exceptional annual general meeting procedure on the basis of the temporary law (677/2020) to the Finnish Companies Act to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with the temporary law, shareholders of the company and their proxies could only participate in the meeting and exercise the shareholder rights by means of voting in advance as well as by making counterproposals and presenting questions in advance. It was not possible to attend the meeting in person but shareholders could follow the Annual General Meeting live online on the company's website. The Remuneration report for the company's governing bodies 2020 was presented to the AGM and it was approved in an advisory vote.\n\nNo Extraordinary General Meetings of Shareholders were held in 2021.\n\n## Shareholders' Nomination Board\n\nThe Annual General Meeting held on 9 April 2013 established a permanent Shareholders' Nomination Board. The purpose and task of the Shareholders' Nomination Board is to prepare and present proposals on the remuneration, size and members of the Board of Directors to the General Meeting. In addition, the Shareholders' Nomination Board seeks candidates for potential board members.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board consists of four members. Three of them are appointed by the company's three largest shareholders, who shall appoint one member each. The Chair of the Board of Directors serves as the fourth member. The members are nominated annually, and their term of office ends when new members are appointed to replace them. Fortum's three largest shareholders that are entitled to appoint members to the Shareholders' Nomination Board are determined on the basis of the registered holdings as at the first working day of September in the year concerned. In the event that a shareholder does not wish to exercise its right to appoint a representative, it shall pass the right to the next largest shareholder.\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board forwards its proposals for the Annual General Meeting to the Board of Directors by 31 January each year.\n\n## Diversity Principles for the Board of Directors\n\nThe Shareholders' Nomination Board prepares and applies diversity principles for the Board of Directors in line with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2020. The principles are applied in preparing the proposal concerning nomination of board members. The diversity principles include, among others, that the board composition shall include expertise from the geographical areas where Fortum conducts its business, the background profession of the board members shall include such competences that support the implementation of Fortum's strategy and that enable board members to challenge management decisions and to exercise an overseeing role. In addition, the board composition shall include both genders. Fortum also complies with the principles set forth in the Finnish Government Resolution dated 17 December 2015 on equal gender representation in the boards of listed companies with the aim having been that the board would consist of at least 40% of women and men respectively by 2020. The Shareholders' Nomination Board reviews the diversity principles and their implementation annually.\n\nFortum reports on the objectives, actions and progress of the diversity principles in this Corporate Governance Statement. The Shareholders' Nomination Board has applied the diversity principles in preparing the proposal concerning nomination of the board members for the Annual General Meeting 2021 and for the upcoming Annual General Meeting 2022. The goal of the Nomination Board is to seek possible new Board member candidates meeting the requirements set by the international nature of the company's business emphasising experience from CEO level management position in international business and strong expertise in ESG, energy industry, and digitalisation in particular.

        "page_content": "## Risk management systems\n\nFortum's Board of Directors approves the Group Risk Policy that defines the objective, main principles and division of responsibilities for risk management. The Group Risk Policy also includes a description of the main features of the risk management process applicable to all processes, including financial reporting.\n\n## Internal controls in relation to financial reporting\n\nFortum's internal control framework is based on the main elements of the framework introduced by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The controls, including financial reporting controls have been defined based on the main risks in the process. Internal controls are one of the key elements of the Compliance Programme in Fortum, which also covers business ethics and regulatory compliance.\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe standards, processes and structures in internal control are set through Group policies, Group instructions and the Fortum internal control framework. Fortum's internal control framework is designed to support operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with laws, regulations and policies. The internal control framework defines the key controls and the minimum requirements for the key processes. Corporate Accounting and Control is responsible for the overall control structure of the financial reporting process. Fortum Controllers' manual defines the instructions and guidelines relating to financial reporting.\n\nFortum has a decentralised organisational model, and a substantial degree of authority and responsibility has been delegated to the divisions in the form of control responsibilities. Fortum's control governance applies the so-called 'Three lines of defense' model as illustrated in the graphic on the next page.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisks are regularly identified and analysed as part of the risk management process. Risks that might, if realised, have a material financial impact or lead to non-compliance are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee at least on an annual basis.\n\n## Control activities\n\nControl activities are applied in the processes and, from the financial reporting perspective, they ensure that errors or deviations are prevented or detected and corrected.\n\nThe Corporate Accounting and Control unit together with the Record-to-Report internal control process team determine the control requirements covering the financial reporting process. Divisions and units define their controls based on these requirements. Responsibilities are assigned for the control activities and for ensuring that the control coverage is in accordance with the requirements. The stream leader of the Record-to-Report ensures the consistency of the control requirements and assessment in the organisation.\n\nControl requirements for the financial reporting process include controls regarding the initiation, recognition, measurement, approval, accounting and reporting of financial transactions as well as disclosure of financial information. The general IT controls support the financial reporting controls in areas such as access control and back-up management.\n\nResponsibilities are assigned to finance functions to ensure that analyses of the business performance, including e.g. volumes, revenue, costs, working capital, and asset valuations are performed in accordance with the control requirements.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nThe Controllers' manual includes the Fortum Accounting manual, Investment manual and reporting instructions, and also other instructions relating to financial reporting. Regular core controllers' meetings, headed by the Vice President, Accounting&Reporting, steer the finance function. Accounting Network Forum meetings are held regularly to inform about upcoming changes in IFRS, new accounting policies and other changes in reporting requirements.\n\n## Uniper's internal control system\n\nIn addition to the Code of Conduct and the policies, the corresponding requirements and procedures for the internal control system (ICS) are defined in a consistent Group-wide framework. Uniper's ICS is based on the globally recognized COSO (The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) framework and pursues, among other things, compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The goal is to create a control environment for business processes and control activities at an operational process level. These general standards, rules, and structures refer, inter alia, to 'Compliance with legal and tax regulations' or 'Tone at the top'.",

The Group Compliance Officer\n\nreports on the results of internal control maturity assessments and identified improvement actions to the management and to the Audit and Risk Committee. Internal control design and operating effectiveness are also assessed as part of the audits carried out by Internal Audit.

Internal audit reports on the audit results and the status of the audits to the Audit and Risk Committee on a regular basis.\n\n## External Audit\n\nThe Group and the parent company have one external auditor. Due to the ongoing merger and acquisition processes, some of the target companies may have different audit firms during the transition period. The external auditor is elected by the Annual General Meeting for a term of office that expires at the end of the first Annual General Meeting following the election.\n\nFortum's Annual General Meeting 2021 re-elected audit firm Deloitte Oy as the company's external auditor with Authorised Public Accountant Jukka Vattulainen as principal auditor.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2021 also decided that the auditor's fee is paid pursuant to invoice approved by the company.

EUR 700,000 for the non-audit and advisory services rendered and invoiced.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft ('PwC Germany') is the appointed auditor of the subsidiary Uniper SE. The fee Uniper paid to the auditor for the services rendered and invoiced in 2021 totalled approx. EUR 11,600,000. In addition, the audit firm was paid a total of approx. EUR 1,100,000 for the non-audit and advisory services rendered and invoiced.\n\n## Code of Conduct and Compliance Programme at Fortum\n\nFortum's Code of Conduct is based on the shared corporate values which form the ethical basis for all work at Fortum. Fortum renewed its Code of Conduct in 2021 and it was approved by the Board of Directors. During 2021, continuous attention has in general been directed to communicating the business ethics and compliance topics through internal and external communication channels. Alignment is enforced by the full commitment of the top management.\n\nFortum applies a compliance programme which covers the key areas of regulatory compliance and business ethics. Internal Controls are an integral part of compliance at Fortum. Group Compliance prepares readiness to provide comprehensive compliance support in all potential outcomes and scenarios of ongoing strategic assessments. During 2021, Competition Law Compliance and Privacy development have been added to the Fortum Compliance framework. The Group Compliance Officer, who heads the compliance function in Fortum, reports to the General Counsel and also has a parallel independent reporting line to the Audit and Risk Committee. The Group Compliance&Controls organisation, including Country Compliance Leads, has continuously met as Fortum Compliance Network also during the COVID-19 as virtual team. Fortum and Uniper have started co-operation in Compliance and Fortum-Uniper joint compliance priorities have been agreed. Fortum has continued Compliance trainings including internal controls.\n\nFortum employees are responsible for reporting any suspected misconduct to their own supervisors, to other management members or, if necessary, directly to Group Compliance. Fortum employees and other stakeholders can confidentially report any suspicions of misconduct by using the 'SpeakUp' channel in their own language on Fortum's internal and external web pages. In Russia, Fortum has also a separate compliance organisation with appointed compliance officers. Fortum is also further developing the 'SpeakUp' process to ensure compliance with the EU Whistleblowing Directive.\n\nPrevention of corruption is one of the focus areas of the Code of Conduct. Fortum has anti-corruption procedures, including prevention, oversight, reporting and enforcement, in place, based on the requirements prescribed in international legislation. Compliance\n\n## Compliance governance and Compliance Programme at Uniper\n\nUniper's Board has published its commitment to compliance and has emphasised that Compliance is particularly important for Uniper as a company operating worldwide and forms an essential part of its integrity and culture. Through its commitment to compliance, Uniper's Board makes clear its rejection of infringements of any kind. At Uniper, the compliance principles are reinforced and lived by Uniper's management who serves as a role model encouraging the employees to strive towards those standards throughout the organisational structure.\n\nUniper's Code of Conduct establishes the basic principles of conduct that everyone at Uniper must follow.

It expressly recognises the ten UN Global Compact principles and provides an expectation that its suppliers also observe the fundamental provisions in their actions.\n\nrequirements are also part of the legal company governance at Fortum. One of the joint priorities with Uniper, also in the light of external stakeholder expectations, is the third-party compliance including economic sanctions and anti-money laundering aspects. The project launched for enhancing third-party risk management at Fortum was completed during 2021, and a new enhanced process has been in use since 1 January 2022.\n\nIn addition, Fortum has a Supplier Code of Conduct in place, and the company expects its business partners to act responsibly and to comply with the requirements set forth therein.
