And digitalization and innovation are also very advanced and directly in/fluence everyone's life. Symrise strives to seize with determination the opportunities created by this transformation and to allow its customers, employees, shareholders and other stakeholders of the company to use them. Thinking beyond tomorrow.\n\nSymrise stands out from its competitors through the breadth and depth of its business portfolio. Many years ago, we became the /first company in the industry to begin moving into new business areas outside the traditional fragrance and /flavor industry and tap into additional growth potential. A targeted backward integration for strategic raw materials guarantees a traceable, reliable and consistently high-quality supply. In order to harness the synergies of our portfolio to an even greater extent, we merged the Flavor and Nutrition business units into a new segment called Taste, Nutrition & Health in April, 2021. This way, we are better positioned to o/ffer our customers integrated product solutions for taste, nutrition, well-being and health. A joint research pipeline, comprehensive customer support and synergies in the supply chain promote the growth and pro/fitability of our activities.\n\nThe 2021 /fiscal year was also full of success for Symrise. We reached strong organic sales growth of 9.6 % and the EBITDA margin reached 21.3 %. Because of our long-term growth momentum, the Symrise share rose in the leading German index DAX \u00ae . Furthermore, we were recognized by the renowned in ternational organization CDP for our commitment to protecting climate, water and forests with the triple highest score of 'AAA' - the only company in Germany to achieve this and one of only 14 worldwide. The guidelines of our company our corporate values, our purpose, our integrated corporate strategy - as well as the description of many large and small projects which form the foundation of our success may be found in our Corporate Report for 2021.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Executive Board of Symrise AG\n\nDr. Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Bertram Chief Executive O/fficer, President Scent & Care\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOlaf Klinger CFO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Jean-Yves Parisot\n\nPresident Taste, Nutrition & Health\n\n15",

For example, Symrise has been present in Brazil since 1956, in China since 1982 and in India since 1994. In addition, we want to further deepen the collaboration with our customers by bringing our broad product range to them in an even more targeted manner.

They mainly concern the improvement of internal processes and optimization of the raw materials portfolio. When it comes to improving internal processes, the spectrum ranges from the Groupwide bundling of sourcing processes to warehousing and receivables management to the increased use of arti/ficial intelligence (AI) in research and development. Optimization of the raw materials portfolio involves reducing the number of raw materials used, improving yields, expanding the backward integration of strategic raw materials and also ensuring traceable, reliable and consistently highquality supplies. Backward integration also enables longterm social commitment in regions where vanilla, citrus fruits and patchouli are grown, for example.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We've established and are consistently implementing concrete measures based on our integrated corporate strategy across all areas of our corporate activities. With annual growth of 5 to 7 %, we want our sales to be in the area of \u20ac 5.5 to 6.0 billion. The increase in eco-e/fficiency of greenhouse gas emissions by 63 % represents an important intermediate step toward our goal of becoming climate-positive across the Group starting in 2030.",

Why?\n\n  If we've learned anything from the last few years, it's this: We can't just think about the next day, we have to think about the long term to be ready to act at any time. The title of this year's Corporate Report makes exactly this clear: 'Thinking beyond tomorrow' to me means that we - together with our customers, our suppliers, society and all other stakeholders -\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwas the amount of sales Symrise achieved in the 2021 /fiscal year.",

This applies to our sustainable business practices, without overstepping the earth's natural boundaries, and equally to our actions here in the Group, where we rely on our many capable employees. We can only continue our economic success and contribute to a better world for all if we maintain this long-term perspective.\n\n## Symrise is publishing a company purpose for the /first time with this Corporate Report. Why is this important to you?\n\n  The purpose - meaning the deeper sense and meaning of our business activities - has developed over the last few decades and gets slightly rede/fined as time goes by. However, it has always been present in our strategy and in our daily activities. Therefore, we essentially summarized what we are with a broad-based process. And that was a very signi/ficant measure, because we can now demonstrably align all our further steps with our purpose.\n\n## Why did you develop the purpose now of all times?\n\n  Over the last few years we have greatly expanded the portfolio, for example with the acquisition of Diana, Renessenz and ADF / IDF. These strategic decisions form the company. We think the purpose is a great way to sum it up on one level and to bring Symrise closer to our many new employees.\n\n## Let's get back to business. The year that just ended was successful, but surely also unpredictable again, right?\n\n  Yes, we had very high demand for products for travel and leisure such as sun protection products, perfumes, beverages and culinary products. This was partly due to the advances made in /fighting the pandemic. In 2020 it was totally di/fferent. The Nutrition segment grew the most in that year, particularly in the area of pet food, because a lot of people were forced to stay home during the many restrictions around the world. For me, however, this also shows that our strategy is working and that the products in our broad portfolio complement each other. Since 2009, we have increased the share of products outside scents and /flavors, our core business at that time, from 10 to\n\nover 30 %. By 2025, we want to increase the areas of nutrition and care - for people and animals - to 40 % and by 2028 to half of our sales.\n\n## The portfolio is, along with growth and e/fficiency, one of three pillars of the corporate strategy. How do you achieve the goals connected with this?\n\n  By concerning ourselves with new topics internally, for example. In recent years, for example, we have increasingly focused on cooperation within the Group. The divisions are working intensively on joint projects, as can also be seen in the Corporate Report. For plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy products, we have set up teams across the Group to increase the development, production, market and sales know-how of the whole company. The area of plant-based food alternatives is one of the most exciting markets out there. It will grow by about 15 to 25 % annually by 2030, which will mean sales of around \u20ac 85 billion. Some say this number could be as high as \u20ac 250 billion. We can contribute a huge amount to this with our products for taste, texture and mouthfeel.\n\n## Will there be more acquisitions in the next few years to expand the portfolio?\n\n  We will continue to acquire or invest in companies that generate a lot of value for us, particularly in the areas of health, nutrition and personal care. This is not just about sales and pro/fit - it's also about synergies. Here are two examples: At the start of 2022, we bought the Dutch company Scha/ffelaarbos, which extracts proteins for pet food from eggs. It is one of the market leaders in this area and helps us to expand internationally in the area of pet nutrition in combination with our activities with ADF/IsoNova. The Canadian company Gira/ffe Foods, which we bought in December 2021, creates sauces, dips, dressings, syrups and drinks for B2B customers. This acquisition allows us to bring together our /flavor and nutrition expertise and our knowledge of customer-speci/fic recipes, and therefore to become a leading supplier of integrated taste solutions in North America. In the next few months there will be even more acquisitions.",

How do you think this developed in 2021?\n\n  The supply chains have proven very fragile in a lot of areas, but we have been able to compensate for this through our many years of e/fforts to sustainably backward integrate our most important raw materials. This allowed us to keep production running, which was very satisfying. Nevertheless, we have to think one step further. Climate change and the loss of biodiversity, as well as increasing social inequality, have a major impact on people and the environment, and thus on our supply chains. This is why, in 2021, we expanded our analysis and assessment of the environmental, social and governance performance of our suppliers.\n\n## How are you doing that?\n\n  Since we cannot map many processes in procurement on our own, we have participated in joint initiatives for responsible procurement. One of these is the Initiative for Sustainable Agricultural Supply Chains (INA), in which 34 organizations and companies have come together to promote the planned German Supply Chain Act. This was adopted in 2021 to improve the protection of human rights along global supply chains. At the beginning of 2021, we also founded our Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee (RSSC), which brings together all the heads of procurement and sustainability experts at Symrise. We want to continually improve processes together.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin sales is our goal for 2025. This will take us into new dimensions.\n\n## What market developments could you see being a help to Symrise?\n\n  We have always been strong in product innovation. This helps us to o/ffer a service that is increasingly in demand: In the future, major manufacturers will often outsource new product development to free up resources for other purposes, such as expanding their e-commerce divisions. This is also one of the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. We are serving this development with our many integrated solutions, in which we bring together our expertise from di/fferent areas.\n\n## Was this also one of the reasons to set up the new Taste, Nutrition & Health segment?\n\n  Yes, we want to use it to more closely connect the topics of taste and healthy nutrition. The Flavor and Nutrition segments are hiding behind the new segment, which customers often access simultaneously anyway. We can ful/fill customer needs a lot better with the new segment. Along with /flavors and foods, the new segment also comprises nutritional supplements, products for the pharmaceutical industry, functional foods as well as animal food and products for animal health. The advantage of the new segment is that we can utilize the enormous synergies between the segments - for innovation, for contact with customers or for trend research.\n\n## On September 20, 2021, Symrise was promoted to the DAX \u00ae , Germany's leading index. Was that a great day for you?\n\n  Of course the recognition for our company was great, but it's not something we were speci/fically working toward. It was more a consequence of our growth momentum. For us, this means /first of all that we receive much more attention. We have signi/ficantly more inquiries from the media, but also from survey institutes, business associations, investors and analysts, academia and NGOs. In the process, we have to position ourselves more frequently on economic or social issues; we are used more and more as an example for 'the economy.' This is exciting, but requires additional e/ffort. Nevertheless, we want to maintain our narrow structures with short decision-making paths in order to be able to react quickly. That has always worked very well for us, and it is the only way we can achieve what we have manifested in our purpose: Taking responsibility for a livable, futureoriented world and developing sustainable, safe and customized products for people and their pets. This is how we care for wellbeing and quality of life, for beauty and taste.",

Five sta/ff members, between 21 and 31 years of age, study, and have fun during their /flavorist training course even though the program is ambitious and thus involves a very intensive workload. Two of these young talents are Suttipong Phosuksirikul from Thailand's capital Bangkok and Diana Salazar from Mexico City - the other trainees are from Singapore, Germany and the USA.\n\nSuttipong Phosuksirikul and Diana Salazar are now standing with Master Flavorist Thomas Riess at a lab table. They have cut through three mandarins and are smelling the fresh, orange segments. 'Fruity, juicy and peely, unique,' says Salazar of the smell. 'Ester-like and aldehydic,' complements Suttipong Phosuksirikul. In the subsequent step, both will identify the molecules that could be used to replicate the aroma of this citrus fruit. They start with a list and brainstorm together about which substances and in which proportions they would include. Then they take the small glass containers with the selected aroma molecules from the shelf and weigh them very accurately. Salazar uses pipettes to transfer drops of the seven, eight ingredients they have chosen to a beaker. Sometimes it's just 0.1 ppm, sometimes 10 ppm - parts per million that all contribute to the /final taste. They experiment, make a lot of trials and record their experiences.\n\n## Training for young talents\n\nThe exercise is intended to show the students, all with completed professional studies, how complex /flavors are. 'They get to know 500 di/fferent ingredients in the Flavor Academy that they must be able to recognize and use in compositions,' describes Master Flavorist Thomas Riess, who has worked in the company for 30 years. Alongside 30 to 40 other experienced colleagues, he guides and teaches the /five trainee /flavorists.

Relevant previous knowledge is an important prerequisite. They are trained chemical lab technicians or have a bachelor's degree in food chemistry, chemistry or nutrition and at least two years of job experience. 'We need people who can communicate well, because they will end up having a lot of customer contacts and, most importantly, they have to work as a team,' says Reichelt.

Here, they /first learn a common language of taste which they can use to talk about /flavors and smells. They work with terms such as 'earthy,' 'woody' or 'caramel,' and connect these with /flavor raw materials they have tried.\n\nThey then familiarize themselves with various raw materials, tasting and describing them, from individual substances such as vanillin to essential oils, extracts or ester compounds. Another task is to taste ready-made market products, recreate their taste and explain the process to each other. 'It could be that a customer later says, 'I like the taste, but the green notes don't /fit,'' Reichelt gives as an example. The team then must change the green notes like grass or bell pepper and consider how these integrate with other /flavor notes.\n\nThe basic training lasts until the end of May of the following year and involves an interim test. After this, the /five trainee /flavorists go back to their home countries for a training on the job module. There, they work closely with an experienced /flavorist in their daily work and sometimes change location or division. They then return to Holzminden for their /final exam - their masterpiece - which is due at the end of the two-year program. 'They get a project brie/fing modeled on that of a customer,' explains Reichelt. 'They have two and a half weeks time to create a /flavor composition that has various requirements. For example, they may only use natural raw materials and must keep to a certain product cost budget.'\n\nIf they pass the exam, they will be promoted to Junior Flavorists. After another two years, they can be promoted to Flavorists and after eight to ten years, to Senior or Master Flavorist. 'We really want young people to see a career path with us,' says Reichelt. 'This is why we rely heavily on in-house talents that we already know and that we have a connection with.'\n\n## Passion for the job\n\nFor Diana Salazar, the job is already a dream. 'After an internship in the beverage application lab, I worked as an assistant to a Flavorist at Symrise and got to know the work that way,' the 26-year-old remembers. The job involves a lot of the things she loves: She studied mathematics and chemistry and likes to cook, mostly the many Mexican dishes from her home country. She is also a dancer and choreographer. 'Creating good taste with a scienti/fic basis is something that really speaks to me,' she says. Her classmate Suttipong Phosuksirikul con/firms this with an energetic nod. The 31-year-old's family owns a small restaurant. Cooking has always been in his path and no matter where he is, he always tries the local specialties. After completing his mas ter's degree in food technology and working in various jobs in the industry, he has now been at Symrise for two and a half years. 'As soon as I heard about the Flavor Academy, I was in,' says Phosuksirikul. 'The link between science and creative cuisine is absolutely ideal for me.'\n\n47",

The proposal for this new building is to provide socio-environmental courses for students from the local community and a sustainable vision for the future.\n\nBIODIVERSITY, CLIMATE, SOCIETY\n\n  If you stand on a big balcony at the Symrise Granja  Viana location in Brazil, you won't believe that you are just 20 kilometers west of S\u00e3o Paulo City and its 20 million inhabitants. The view is of the Atlantic Rainforest, in which thousands of plants grow and hundreds of species of animals roam. In this place, the company founded its Center of Excellence as its  Latin American headquarters ten years ago. Currently, 270 people are employed at this site.\n\nLooking to the future with a sustainable focus, Symrise moved to this property with the idea of joining business and environmental commitment together. So, the idea of building a wooden house on Symrise ground next to the Atlantic Rainforest was a totally unique concept as the house includes internet, IT infrastructure, solar panels for energy supply and a rainwater facility. A landscaping project was created to inspire dialogues with the people and nature around it. It encompasses three functionalities: an aromatic herb yard where employees can harvest their spices and teas, a sensory garden to delight all /five senses, and a hotel for native bees. It extrapolates and transcends the conventional landscaping model to go beyond only the aesthetic.\n\nBesides that, the SymHouse ful/fills two purposes. The /first of these is building awareness of environmental issues. 'A few years ago, we started a project with an NGO in which we taught children from a nearby school about nature and its conservation, and more recently we have included the topic of diversity in the program,' says Mariana Martins, who is responsible for Symrise sustainability projects in Brazil. 'At the end of the joint work, we always invited the children to our regular building. Now we have our own place for this to advance socio-environmental education.' Since 2018, the Symrise team has trained 240 children, mainly from poorer families.\n\nThe second purpose has to do with the employees. There are very few spots around the Center for Excellence where employees can take a break in the fresh air or that they can use as alternative meeting locations. 'They can now use the wooden house and the space in front of it for their lunch breaks and to decompress,' says Eloa Castelucci, Operations Director Scent & Care and Sustainability Ambassador at Symrise. 'It also means we now have another nice place to conduct training sessions and welcome our customers.'\n\nAt the end of 2021, the team invited a Brazilian artist to paint one side of the house with a mural. The pictures are a well-known art form in Brazil and often have messages relating to important causes. 'For us, it's about environmental protection,' explains Mariana Martins. 'This is how we can show from afar what we can do with this house. In addition, art is a way to bring sensoriality and collaborators closer to such a project.'\n\nMariana Martins and Eloa Castelucci (left) worked with their team on the construction project in Brazil.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The goal is to create the innovative ingredients of tomorrow, from natural raw materials for a good price. For him, an important way to achieve this is through crossdivisional exchange. After he started working as the Lead of the Business Incubation Group for the PlantBased Solutions platform at Symrise in June 2020, he started holding regular meetings with 50 colleagues from four world regions. Once a month, these experts talk about retail, sales, technology and the individual food categories. The following day, technology experts meet and keep up to date on research, new developments and the necessary application technology. 'This saves time, leads to less duplication of work and prevents silo thinking.'\n\n## 80 % of consumers are repeat buyers\n\nAt Symrise, we always consider four layers when working on meat and dairy substitutes: masking o/ff notes coming from the protein, managing texture and mouthfeel, achieving a meaty or dairy note and adding a top note such as vanilla or grill /flavors. There are challenges speci/fic to every layer: For base raw materials like pea, soy or mycoprotein (derived from the fermentation of a /filamentous fungus), the /flavors are created in such a way that their commonly recognizable bitterness is masked. At the same time, burger patties made from these bases must also be juicy and have that grill /flavor. Developers are also tasked with adhering to food safety standards and mini mizing sugar and salt in the products. And last but not least the consumers have to like the taste:  '80 % of consumers will decide to buy the product again if they like it.'\n\nSymrise has solutions for all the requirements for plant-based replacement products and Florian Herkner is one of the interfaces. If Symrise doesn't know something about a new topic, he looks for new partners. His lunch break is now over, so he pays and makes his way to the trade show. Once there, he will discuss protein sources like microalgae and fava beans. 'I want to learn about as many developments as possible in order to evaluate them from a commercial and technical standpoint,' says Herkner, and adds, 'In these dynamic times, it's simply not enough to develop what customers wanted yesterday. We have to give them today what they will want tomorrow.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00bb\n\n## 80 % of consumers will decide to buy the product again if they like it.\n\n\u00ab\n\nFlorian Herkner Head of Global Growth Platform Plant Based\n\n55",

The functionalities are not the same: for instance /flavors are often not meant to add texture or color or provide a certain mouthfeel. But in meat alternatives, that's exactly what's needed. And this is what the combination of natural ingredients and /flavors can achieve.\n\n## How can you create a hearty mouthfeel, for example?\n\nA hearty mouthfeel is complex and requires several layers of ingredients. As a base, our mushroom juice concentrate tastes umami, which means hearty, savory and meaty. We then add culinary complexity with various onion, garlic or shallot products. If we are looking for something more unique, we also o/ffer Sofrito or Mirepoix solutions, which are made of di/fferent co-cooked vegetables and help a lot with juiciness. In addition, our products can balance the o/ff-/flavors of vegetable proteins.\n\n## What are the developments with vegetable alternatives that are already enjoyed in the kitchens of the world?\n\nThe market is huge and we have a whole range of solutions for it.

Moreover, the RSSC will encourage our raw material suppliers to take part in the CDP Supply Chain program, in which we have already participated for /five years. In 2021, 60 % of the suppliers that we contacted took part in the programs for protecting the climate, water and forests.

It's not enough for a few people to reduce their waste to zero, use alternative energies or shop consciously. Billions of people must commit to doing what they can, even if they can't do it perfectly. We cannot wait for the one big solution. We must simply begin, even with small steps.\n\nTo support this approach, we created the Ambassador Network at Symrise. We are kindred spirits whose passion for sustainability connects us across divisions and regional borders. More than 150 colleagues are now participating, and they are dedicated to making the topic of sustainability vivid and tangible. We are discussing what we can do, as Symrise employees and also privately. We organize informational events and start up local and cross-regional projects around the world. One great project is our 'Lunch for Change' cookbook, created as part of a project week around UN Food Day in 2020, for which we asked our colleagues to provide their favorite sustainable recipe. In the book, there are lots of tasty ideas that simultaneously reinforce our commitment to more sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SASCHA LIESE, CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY\n\n  Biodiversity - the diversity of species and ecosystems - is important for us in two ways: It serves as an inspiration and a model for the development of fragrance ingredients and aromas, and it also serves us as a rich source of raw material. At Symrise, we use botanical rarities gathered in the wild of the Amazon rainforest, fragrant and aromatic plants from small-scale farming in Madagascar and Indonesia, and numerous raw materials and byproducts from agriculture, forestry, /fisheries and aquaculture. 90 % of our diverse raw material portfolio consist of materials that originate in natural or managed ecosystems. This makes biodiversity a natural source of capital for us, which is important for the success of our business.\n\nTo support this diversity, we must take an equally diverse range of measures since, unlike the climate, biodiversity is highly contextspeci/fic. Whereas in the Amazon we must be careful not to overuse the wild populations when harvesting natural ingredients, in our Indonesian patchouli project we must primarily improve the biology and structure of the soil in order to maintain the productivity of the crop system. In Madagascar, on the other hand, it's important to us to engage in reforestation and /fight soil erosion. We have made a principle out of this: Around the globe, we make sure we recognize the material risks for biological diversity in the local context of our intervention projects in strategic supply chains, so we can develop tailored solutions to manage them.",

Has this inclusion changed the demands being placed on HR work at Symrise?\n\n  Overall, the challenges of HR work have grown signi/ficantly. For listed companies, what is known as the social footprint is also becoming increasingly important, especially our ESG (economic, social, governance) goals: both within the company and in relation to suppliers and customers. Our inclusion in the DAX \u00ae also brings with it heightened interest from investors, proxy advisors (i.e., the voting advisors of investors), journalists and NGOs in human resources issues. They want to know which goals we are pursuing and implementing as part of our corporate strategy. Our focus as a globally active and dynamically growing company is on diversity, equal opportunity and sustainability.\n\n## How do you de/fine the term diversity for your work and where do you want to take it?\n\n  For me, diversity is based on many aspects. One obvious and important aspect is gender diversity. For us, recruiting, developing and promoting women, including in management positions, is a key issue. Another aspect that is just as important for our corporate success, which comes from working together in diverse teams, is having employees from di/fferent cultures and nationalities. I also see the exchange between generations as an outstanding opportunity to work together, from di/fferent perspectives, on our current and future challenges. For me, making diversity into a value we embody at Symrise is a success factor that enables creative, innovative and sustainable solutions while also allowing us to work together in a constructive, lively spirit of togetherness.\n\n## How do you experience diversity at Symrise and how do you foster it?\n\n  Symrise has an open, entrepreneurial corporate culture characterized by team spirit, cross-border cooperation and the will to succeed. Our dynamic working environment allows employees to contribute individually with their di/fferent experiences, ways of thinking and skill sets. Currently, we are developing a comprehensive plan to promote our diversity in even more precise ways - in all the aspects mentioned above.\n\n## The topic of diversity is always a matter of equal opportunity. How do you make sure this is achieved?\n\n  It is important to us to give all employees equal opportunities, for example when it comes to their career and development prospects. We also want to o/ffer our employees fair compensation. This not only motivates employees but is also in line with our corporate values. Only recently, we saw this con/firmed for our German sites: Symrise was recognized for its fair pay with an award, the Universal Fair Pay Check, by the NGO Fair Pay Innovation Lab under the patronage of German Labor Minister  Hubertus Heil. This certi/fication also takes into account various diversity characteristics such as gender or age.\n\nKatharina D\u00fcrbaum has been Head of Global HR at Symrise since May 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n61",

I see this as a particular strength of Symrise, because mutual recognition and sharing knowledge and experience play a major role - in Germany, in other countries and across borders.\n\nAnd on the other hand, it is important to have a strategic succession planning that takes into account the dynamics in our company along with changing job pro/files and areas of responsibility in the future. Our career development process 'Grow' plays an important role here. We also consistently foster talent within the Company regardless of heritage, gender or age. The establishment and expansion of cross-segment and international programs, targeted international assignments or the assumption of new or expanded areas of responsibility are examples of how we successfully support our employees personally and professionally. We are especially pleased with the success of our very high quality e-learning tool that was launched globally this year. It o/ffers employees worldwide training opportunities in 30 languages. Interest is particularly high in speci/fic seminars for managers focused on women in management positions, the management of hybrid teams (working at home and in the o/ffice) or international teams with di/fferent nationalities.\n\n## What role does training at Symrise play here?\n\n  It has a very high priority for us, as shown by multiple awards in company comparisons over the past four years. On the one hand, we recruit quali/fied young people who we train to meet our needs. And on the other hand, we also ful/fill a social mission by o/ffering a wide range of trainee positions. 40 trainees starting with us in Germany alone, mainly in chemical-technical professions and technical professions as well as commercial careers. Many of our employees are also in work-study programs.\n\n## Since the coronavirus pandemic began, many employees have been working from home, some permanently and some occasionally. How do you see this development, also with a view to the future?\n\n  This is a challenging, complex and, above all, global issue. Since 7,000 of our more than 11,000 employees do not work in Germany, it is very important to coordinate with the many countries in which we operate. In Germany, the situation looks like this: Two-thirds of all employees at the headquarters in Holzminden, as well as in Braunschweig and N\u00f6rdlingen, have to be on site every day - mainly employees in production or in the laboratory. Here, as at our production sites around the world, it is important to strike a balance between work ing from home or remotely and working in our o/ffices, laboratories and production facilities. We don't want to create what might seem like a 'two-tier society.' Here, we need solutions for the Group overall. It is also important that personal contact between a manager and their team, or among team members and with other departments, not get lost as a result of working from home. Personal conversations, seeing colleagues face-to-face, chatting about news and developments are very important for building and maintaining personal ties. The last few years of the pandemic have shown that 'alienation' can also lead employees to feel that they are replacable in their work for a company. That's why we are working to develop a solution that allows us to bring all these aspects together.",

Every morning she takes saliva samples from a broad range of Symrise employees, which they collect at home in small tubes. Only after this is done can the volunteer donors brush their teeth. In the lab for microbiology in Holzminden, Grieger mixes the samples and puts the liquid into 96 small reaction vessels that are arranged on a seethrough plastic platter. A platter with 96 fake white teeth coated with hydroxylapatite, a natural component, is put on top as a lid.\n\nThe saliva will be thrown out the next day. In the meantime, a bio/film has appeared on the teeth - a visible layer of mucus built by microorganisms. Grieger, who completed training as a bioengineer alongside her Bachelor of Science in molecular biology, draws a nutrient medium into a multi-channel  pipette. She /fills the vessels on a new plate carefully and precisely, but still quickly, with the substance. She then closes them again with the same lid so that the bio/film on the teeth can continue to be nourished.\n\nAfter two days, the preparation is ready. The formerly white fake teeth have become slightly yellow and smell strongly of what we would call bad breath. That's all part of the plan. 'We have used the model to recreate the oral /flora, which consists of many di/fferent microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi,' explains Christin Koch of the process, which will subsequently serve to analyze the e/ffect of different test substances and products on the bacteria in the bio/film. She holds a doctorate in microbiology and heads the laboratory, which has developed an innovative focus in recent years: The research and development of molecules that target what is known as the microbiome.\n\n## Research close to people\n\n'People have their own little ecosystems in many places of the body that can be very di/fferent from each other. Their complex and dynamic interplay forms the larger ecosystem of a person,' says the scientist, who also dealt with the microbiome in her doctoral thesis. In the /field of personal care products, research has traditionally focused on how certain substances a/ffect the body and human cells, in particular with the goal of killing certain bacteria. Christin Koch, on the other hand, concentrates increasingly on the equilibrium of the human microbiome.\n\nTheir composition changes depending on the region of the body. The scientist compares them to ecosystems on earth: 'The oral cavity is like a coral reef, the scalp like a /flower meadow, the armpit with sweat and moist skin like a lush forest, or the dry skin on the shins like a desert.'\n\nFor research, it is therefore important to develop products that are as precise as possible and that work not only in vitro, i.e., in the test tube, but also in real life - in vivo, as the scientists call it. The test plate with the little teeth and saliva - that is, the ex vivo bio/film model - is aimed at this approach, as are the welding models developed in-house by the company. 'For this purpose, our external cooperation partner sends men to the sauna, where they collect their sweat, which we can in turn use in the experiments,' says Koch of the research's closeness to human life.",

An example of this is Crinipan \u00ae PMC Green, which hampers the growth of the Malassezia fungus. This fungus grows on the scalp and can cause dandru/ff. To do this, it relies on naturally occurring fats that it cannot produce itself. The product, which is derived from renewable raw materials, makes use of a 'trick,' as Koch calls it: 'Malassezia breaks down fat molecules present on the scalp to feed. These enzymes also release our Crinipan \u00ae PMC Green antifungal caprylic acid - an antifungal agent.' So Malassezia decimates itself, keeping the microbiome in balance.\n\nIn the area of deodorants, Symrise has developed the microbiome-friendly material SymDeo \u00ae B125. It can, for example, replace triclosan, which has a strong antimicrobial e/ffect and prevents the smell of sweat, but also kills bene/ficial bacteria.

Although the /first technologies for the DNA sequencing of the microbiome were available in the early 1990s, they have only been widely usable for the past ten years for cost-related reasons. 'Today, the laboratories where we send our samples can generate and evaluate huge amounts of data in a very short time,' explains Koch.\n\n## International networking\n\nSymrise has invested heavily in microbiome research in the last few years, which also runs over into other divisions. Denis Guyonnet of Diana Nova wants to demonstrate how polyphenols, found in fruit and vegetables, have a positive e/ffect on the gut microbiome. The secondary plant substances come primarily from fruits rich in polyphenols (for example, cranberries), as well as from the sidestreams of fruit and vegetable processing, such as peels or pomace, explains the innovation manager. In this process, Symrise performs standardized extraction of the polyphenols from these di/fferent raw materials to produce a product with speci/fic polyphenols, because the type of polyphenols di/ffer greatly from one fruit to another.\n\nHowever, Guyonnet doesn't just rely on research from within the Group. His task is also to connect the scientists with external academic researchers. The project on polyphenols has been running since 2018 in cooperation with the Universit\u00e9 Laval (INAF) in Qu\u00e9bec, and other research initiatives have been launched with world-class European experts in microbiology, gastroenterology and polyphenols. 'We are working in two directions: We want to /find out what e/ffect the polyphenols have on the pathogens, the bad bacteria, and we also want to explore how to stimulate good bacteria,' says Guyonnet.\n\n\u00bb\n\n## Today, the laboratories where we send our samples can generate and evaluate huge amounts of data in a very short time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\nChristin Koch Head of the lab for microbiology\n\nBoth groups of bacteria play a role in intestinal health according to the researchers that work closely with the development group and Koch. 'In a raw state, polyphenols can't be absorbed. However, the bacteria of the gut can split them into small molecules, bringing out their anti-in/flammatory and antioxidant capabilities,' explains Guyonnet. They also work against pathogenic bacteria. He emphasizes that people's microbiomes di/ffer from one another and that the complex research requires further investigation. For this reason, the /five-year program will soon be followed by clinical trials.\n\nTogether with the Swedish biotechnology company Probi, in which Symrise has invested, he is also looking into innovative new synbiotic products containing living microorganisms. 'These living bacteria can then directly break down the polyphenols from the fruits and release the active ingredients,' says Guyonnet. He is also working on this alongside his colleagues in Holzminden. 'We can pro/fit from the expertise of the entire Group - this is very e/fficient because paths are short and we can all work to the same quality standards. We can also access the broad natural portfolio throughout the company, which gives us a lot of options.'",

'All of us Symrise, the consumers, and our customers who produce perfumes, shampoos or cleaning products want to have bio degradable fragrance ingredients.' 'And they should come from natural raw material sources. This also means we face a huge transformation because many ingredients are currently produced using fossil  resources.'\n\nOriginally, from the beginning of ancient perfumery until well into the Middle Ages, almost all fragrances came from nature - for example, by treating /flowers with di/fferent processes. 'During the 20th century it became clear that the natural resources couldn't keep up with the rapidly increasing demand,' continues Panten. There were many reasons for this - one of which was the introduction of modern laundry technology. In the middle of the last century, the washing machine began its triumphal march in the USA. The demand for the base material and thus also fragrances for washing powder grew exponentially. Another reason is the perfume industry's much soughtafter musk scent, which can be found in nearly every perfume. It used to be sourced from a stomach gland of the wild musk deer, but the animal had to be killed in order to get to it. To improve animal  welfare and also to save costs, the industry transitioned to using synthetic ingredients.\n\n## New approach: Green chemistry\n\nTurning the dial back to natural materials isn't quite so easy, however. 'For some ingredients, we're looking for alternatives to synthetic products in raw materials from nature,' explains Panten. For years, Symrise has also used the residual materials from production processes involving natural raw materials. 'We apply the principles of green chemistry by avoiding waste and adding value to byproducts.'\n\nOne example of this is dihydromyrcenol. Thousands of tons of it are needed on the global market, making it one of the most important fragrance ingredients. With its citrusy and herbal scent, it is used in perfumes, shampoos and cleaning products. The material comes from a byproduct of paper production.  Johannes Panten grabs a marker and sketches out the process on a /flip chart. A highly simpli/fied process, of course, because the chemical reality is naturally a lot more complex. 'It all begins in the pine forests of North America, where the wood is grown sustainably. It is\n\nthen processed into pulp for paper production using the Kraft process. This process creates the byproduct raw sulfate turpentine oil,' explains Panten. The Symrise plant in Jacksonville, Florida, uses this byproduct and removes the sulfur, which has been added earlier in the process in the form of a solvent. Finally, the company breaks the material down into alpha- and beta-pinene - volatile liquids with a turpentine scent -and uses hydrogenation or pyrolysis to transform them into biodegradable fragrance and /flavor ingredients: linalool, citronellol, geraniol and, of course, dihydromyrcenol.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00bb\n\nWe apply the principles of green chemistry by avoiding waste and adding value to byproducts.\n\n\u00ab\n\nJohannes Panten Innovation scout at Symrise",

        "page_content": "## The bridge-builder\n\nThe US company Renessenz, which has been part of Symrise since 2016, created the process, and Symrise has further developed it over the years. To continue this development, Panten recently conducted a survey to /find not only the latest process technology but also the best-suited external partners who could work together with the internal researchers to carry out the optimization. One of the main tasks in his job is to get in contact with startups, universities, research centers and suppliers as a 'bridge-builder,' as he calls himself, in order to /find the best solutions.\n\nThe Dutch process developer InnoSyn proved to be the right partner for the production of dihydromyrcenol. At the Brunswick site on Colonels Island in Georgia, Symrise chemical engineer Thomas Mikulencak and his team then introduced, tested and scaled a new process. 'We work with a /flow chemistry process. The unique thing about it is that there is a continuous in/flow of raw materials and an equally continuous out/flow of reaction products,' says Mikulencak. 'It's extremely e/fficient, there are hardly any waste products because we are processing all of the base material that we are putting in. And it works in a very selective way, meaning we get exactly the result we want in the reactions.' The new process also increased the potential capacities for dihydromyrcenol production, so Symrise can continue to grow with the plant.\n\nOptimizing the process wasn't an easy task though, because production had to continue running at the same time. 'That's why it was so important to have a strong partner like InnoSyn on our side, who had developed the process with us in the lab to such an extent that we could implement it 1:1,' continues Mikulencak. In chemical engineering, a process must be very well thought-out and tested to get the optimal result. 'Flow chemistry is particularly well suited here because we can control the reaction parameters, such as the temperatures, very precisely.' The process, the expert makes very clear, is specially designed for dihydromyrcenol. 'The small improvements really pay o/ff, especially when it comes to large production volumes,' says Mikulencak. 'And we learn more with every new or optimized facility, so that we will be able to set up and expand sustainable processes in the future.'\n\n## WHEN IS SOMETHING BIODEGRADABLE?\n\nA material is biodegradable when it does not accumulate in nature after it has been used - instead, after a certain period of time, it can be transformed into CO2. Plants absorb carbon dioxide and then turn it back into organic material. The OECD has speci/fic requirements for this process, all of which Symrise ful/fills. One de/finition says, for instance, that the ingredients in perfumes, household cleaners and shampoos must be biodegraded by up to 60 % in wastewater from sewage sludge within 28 days.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the Brunswick site on Colonels Island in Georgia, chemical engineer Thomas Mikulencak and his team have further developed and introduced a /flow chemistry process.\n\n73",

The supply chain is unique as there are several small holder farmers who often depend on intermediaries, and cannot yet dependably earn a living income.\n\nMint India is a transformative initiative, we have launched as a multistakeholder project that will allow us, alongside Mars, Tanager and the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) to improve farmers' lives and also cultivation practices. We are leveraging our diverse range of experiences in backward integration developed in our Bridging The Gap projects in Madagascar, Brazil and the Philippines.\n\nWithin a short period of time, 25,250 farmers are bene/fitting from the program. They receive comprehensive education on good agricultural practices (GAP) like crop rotation techniques and water management - these and various other measures can make cultivation signi/ficantly more sustainable. The farmers also gain access to processing and distillation techniques and /financing through cooperatives. This means they can increase their productivity by 34 % and their income by 157 % per hectare. In addition, we also have several women and youth who are engaged in this program leading to higher empowerment for the individuals and enhanced quality of life for the families. Symrise also has a lot of advantages: The supply chain for incoming raw material is transparent and traceable, robust and sustainable. This has generated a lot of interest amongst our leading oral care customers, especially so as consumers today want to make a di/fference to the planet and demand greater transparency around what's in their products.",

However, it is almost impossible to capture the scent of the real /flower. While there is already a wide range of fragrance ingredients that can reproduce the characteristics of the smell of lily of the valley, some of them lack facets. That's why we have developed a new sustainable fragrance molecule called 'Lilybelle \u00ae ,' which is a great addition to the variety of lily of the valley fragrances. It combines watery, ozony and green facets with a /floral lily of the valley note. Lilybelle \u00ae is an ingredient in many com positions, which in turn are used in /fine fragrances, personal care products such as body lotions, shower gels and soaps, or in household and textile care products.\n\nNot only does Lilybelle \u00ae have a pro/file that is in demand, but its production is also special. Symrise produces the fragrance molecule according to the principles of green chemistry by using sustainable D-limonene, which is a byproduct of orange juice production. In the process, several catalytic steps minimize the environmental footprint. The result is that Lilybelle \u00ae has a high sustainability factor. 83 % of the carbon atoms in the molecule come from renewable raw materials. It is also easily biodegradable, so it quickly breaks down into harmless components in the environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FANNY RAKOTOARIVELLO, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF AROMATIC PLANTS IN MADAGASCAR\n\n  Vanilla is the main source of income for farmers in the SAVA region of Madagascar. However, they often don't earn enough with it to provide for their families for an entire year. It was important to us to help them earn regular income so they can be independent of money lenders and improve their standard of life.\n\nWe are therefore helping the farmers diversify their crops - for instance, with ginger, vetiver, mandarin oranges, patchouli, di/fferent kinds of pepper and bay leaves. These vary from region to region, depending on soil conditions and other environmental factors. Our support provides them with seedlings and young plants, o/ffers training sessions on agricultural techniques, helps them tap into markets, ensures traceability back to the farm, and creates pathways to various certi/fications such as UEBT, Rainforest Alliance, UTZ, organic and Fair Trade.\n\nSymrise also bene/fits from this: Since the farmers have additional income from the other crops, they can, for example, wait until the vanilla is fully ripe and provides the best quality before harvesting it. At the same time, through our on-site research and development, we can use the wide variety of raw materials to compile a sustainable, high-quality portfolio. Since a large part of my work consists of communicating with local producers and supporting them in the technical processes, I see how both sides continue to bene/fit.",

They each take a handful of pieces from the huge pile of ginger in the middle of the table and break it, smell it and taste small pieces. To them, every raw material is always exciting - for all senses. Now Maria Reichenbach, R\u00fcdiger Hupe and Beno\u00eet Join get talking. Even though they each work in a di/fferent department, their work overlaps in many areas - namely research, the evalu ation of trends and raw materials.\n\nGinger is a good example of this. For thousands of years, the aromatic, savory root has been used as a spice and also as a remedy, for example in traditional Chinese medicine or in Medieval Europe. Reichenbach uses the natural properties of ginger in cosmetic applications. The manager of the lab for cell and molecular biology has brought along a couple of creams that contain the spicy substance extracted from ginger. 'This spice is generated by the gingerol and shogaol substance classes, which have an anti-aging e/ffect here,' says Reichenbach, handing samples to both of her colleagues. 'Both molecule classes demonstrably have an antioxidant e/ffect and trap the free radicals created through external agents, which can damage human cells. Furthermore, they can greatly reduce redness, thus making the cosmetic ingredient a truly multifunctional substance.'\n\nFor the production, Symrise relies on an extraction method that uses CO2 to generate an odorless liquid. 'We need the positive properties of ginger, but we don't want cosmetic products to smell like it,' explains the doctor in biochemistry. In contrast, Hupe likes the opposite e/ffect. The /flavorist has worked at Symrise for 15 years and is now active in the Research and Technology team. 'We use the spice extract and ginger oils for the /flavoring of sweets such as hard candy. Here we refer to the sense of taste through the mouth and nose,' says Hupe. For this, he has tested di/fferent kinds of ginger, which eventually led him to the raw materials from Madagascar. 'There, our local teams established the connection to the farmers through our vanilla production. This is important because it allows for the roots to be processed fresh right after harvest in order to obtain the largest possible amount of important oils and other elements.'\n\n## Backward integration\n\nFor Symrise, the procurement of ginger in Madagascar works in the same way it does for many other raw materials grown there: The company integrated it backward into the value chain, which means that Symrise has been delivering pregerminated ginger roots to local farmers since 2014. At the end of the season, one kilogram of this produces six to seven kilograms, which the company then buys at a /fixed price. This functions so well because,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00bb\n\n## This spice is generated by the gingerol and shogaol substance classes, which have an anti-aging effect here.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\nMaria Reichenbach Lab manager for cell biology and microbiology",

Here we refer to the sense of taste through the mouth and nose.\n\n\u00ab\n\nR\u00fcdiger Hupe Flavorist at Research and Technology team\n\nas Join points out, ginger plays a big role in the cuisine of Madagascar. 'It really helped that everyone grows ginger in their garden anyway. And just like everywhere else in the world, farmers /first look at what their neighbor is doing before they try out something new,' declares the Director Naturals in the Perfumery and Oral Care division, who works intensively with the natural raw materials from Madagascar.\n\nGinger is but one of several raw materials that vanilla farmers in the island country o/ff the southeastern coast of Africa can grow while their main product is out of season. Their income grows as a result. Symrise has promoted this diversi/fication of di/fferent raw materials for many years now. By now, the di/fferent business units obtain products such as the roots of the fragrant vetiver grass, the seeds of the tamanu fruit from which a plant oil is obtained, green pepper, pink pepper leaves, cinnamon bark and red lemongrass. In addition to securing income for around 3,000 farmers and their families with whom Symrise works, the model also o/ffers great advantages for the company: The availability of the certi/fied organic products is secured while maintaining their quality.\n\nJoin adds that Symrise tries to increasingly carry out their processing close to the farmers to obtain the freshest possible raw materials while simultaneously avoiding the cost- and CO2intensive transportation of the roots. 'The ginger oil is produced in part by the farmers through steam distillation or at the production site of Symrise on the island,' says the doctor of chemistry.\n\n## Fragrant synergies\n\nAnother method is CO2 extraction, for which ginger is chopped up and dried. That also helps minimize transport because the weight and volume are reduced. 'However, this method also involves the risk of losing volatile substances. Therefore, we must\n\nalways analyze how we produce,' says Reichenbach. Another oily liquid is also produced during CO2 extraction, which Symrise then uses in perfumery under the name Symvital \u00ae Ginfuse.\n\nThe Symrise experts then move from raw material extraction to the technologies that each department uses. Reichenbach tells them about the experiments that she and her team carry out. For this, they use samples obtained from plastic surgery that involve the removal of excess skin and which are donated after the procedures. This way, they can produce an ex-vivo skin model and test the e/ffectiveness of cosmetic ingredients. 'We subject the skin model to an irritant trigger - which induces skin irritation. We then measure the signals of how the skin reacts to irritation-reducing ointments with ginger extracts,' explains Reichenbach. Join listens more closely because he still can't carry out tests like this in the area of oral care. Both agree to discuss an 'oral care model' at a later stage for inducing and treating mucomembranous irritation in gums.\n\nThe intensive exchange often generates new ideas, also for Hupe. He brought a soft drink that contains ginger. The three of them try the beverage and talk about its /flavor, which is slightly spicy but mostly very aromatic and natural. They also discuss what will be possible in the future. Hupe wonders out loud whether the essential oils from CO2 extraction could be further processed for premium quality /flavorings. 'Maybe it could also be used as a top note and component of a gin recipe or in other alcoholic beverages, maybe even for desserts in /fine restaurants that are looking for something extra special.'\n\n81",

Will it stay like that in the future?\n\n  For us, sustainability is part of our DNA and has become an integral component of our strategy. We neither want to nor can we continue without it. Therefore, we will continue to ask ourselves now and in the future whether each decision we make meets our ESG criteria - meaning whether our environmental and social interests as well as good corporate governance are considered. Because we can only conduct business successfully if we act sustainably. To answer your question: Yes, sustainability is here to stay. I think that, at some point, we will not communicate it as often because it will have truly become a matter of course.\n\n## In your view, what are the most important motivating factors to act sustainably?\n\n  There are several. One of them is, for example, the fact that we rely more and more on natural raw materials in all of our divisions. That means nature is one of the most decisive success factors for us. We will only be able to obtain and process su/fficiently diverse raw materials of the highest quality in the future if we protect biodiversity, the climate and human rights. This is another reason we focus so intensively on backward integration in the countries of origin by entering into close partnerships and working to bene/fit the people who live there.\n\n## How do you keep track of the topic along the value  chain?\n\n  In product development, we use the raw materials as e/fficiently as possible. We always search for new ways in the spirit of the circular economy to, for example, use waste products from our own\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproduction for di/fferent divisions and product lines (See page 76 'Vegetable diversity'). Furthermore, we use sidestreams from other production processes and turn them into valuable materials (See page 70 'Everything /flows'). Or we use our own proprietary technologies that generate added value where there was previously none (See page 86 'Creating added value').\n\n## How well does Symrise know the environmental impacts of its products?\n\n  We developed a product sustainability scorecard for our 200 most important products. We also apply the production methods of Green Chemistry to them.

The consumers demand it and politicians enact laws - and reason also shows that climate change will not be stopped otherwise. From the very beginning, we enter into close partnerships with our customers in order to /find cooperation models that allow us to work in both a sustainable and pro/fitable manner. Together with NGOs, we have implemented projects around the world that allow us to optimize cultivation methods, train farmers, diversify and improve their income and thus protect biodiversity. These blueprints work very well and should be expanded to other projects. Because of that and also due to our activities at our sites, we have again been awarded the highest score by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in all three audited areas - 'Climate change,' 'Forests' and 'Water protection.' This was only achieved by 14 out of more than 13,000 companies worldwide. We are the only one in Germany.\n\n## You mention the customers, but doesn't the /financial market also exert considerable pressure?\n\n  Indeed, in a few years there will only be a few capital measures that don't take the sustainability factor into account. Last year, we received a \u20ac 500 million revolving credit line that incorporates our sustainability commitments. We de/fined three indicators that we must ful/fill here: First of all, we want to increase our eco-e/fficiency by 63 % by 2025 compared to 2016, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions in relation to the value added. Secondly, we also want to obtain all of our strategic biological raw materials sustainably by 2025 and, thirdly, we want to increase the e/fficiency of water consumption at all production sites in arid regions such as Mexico, India and Egypt. If we achieve that, the interest of the loan will be reduced and, if we don't, it will be increased. Regardless of who pays more in the end, the sum will be donated to the 'Save the Children' organization. Incidentally: The sustainability objectives are also embedded in Executive Board remuneration.\n\n## What structures have you built to achieve the sustainability objectives?\n\n  In addition to CEO Dr. Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Bertram and myself, who determine the strategic direction to a large extent, our Sustainability Board includes sustainability specialists from all business units including Human Resources, Communications, Investor Relations and the individual divisions. We are joined by a network of over 150 sustainability ambassadors based all over the world. I /find it very impressive that their involvement takes place exclusively in their free time. They start their own initiatives in which they themselves get involved.\n\n## What is their aim?\n\n  An example is the Sustainable Living Space in Brazil, which was founded by some of our employees. It o/ffers children a space to learn about environmental topics and it is also a place that employees can use (See page 48 'A commitment to sus tainability'). Another very new development is that we will have our /first sustainability ambassadors among our trainees this year. We promote this initiative and look forward to many exciting ideas - especially those that can make a huge di/fference, like our new way to deal with plastic. In 2020, we largely banned disposable plastic products, and we want to recycle more than 95 % of the plastic we use and  introduce sustainable packaging materials across the Group by 2025. In order to achieve that, we established a cross-functional team last year.\n\n## You mention teams, and one of the goals here is to create more diversity. How do you plan to achieve that?\n\n  For us, it is very clear that diversity - of gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, ethnic background, religion and world view - is important and must be promoted. In the future, we want to create more diverse groups and more positions for people with disabilities and continue to deal with the topic that has received the most public attention: the advancement of women.

Symrise recognized the advantage of further utilization of co-products 20 years ago and developed the patented SymTrap \u00ae technology.\n\n  Jennifer Bufalo opens a bag of cloves. The biologist with a PhD in her /field breathes it in and tries to recognize the full scent pro/file. Then the lab head, who is primarily concerned with natural substances for the Scent & Care unit, wonders what ingredient from the clove could lend a new olfactory element to a traditional perfume ingredient. Symrise has been using the essential clove oil for decades as a product, for example, in the area of dental care or in perfumes. Most essential oils are created through steam distillation. This process involves entraining the fragrance molecules in the vapor and then condensing it into liquid form. The essential oils are collected, and a lot of water is produced as a byproduct. There are more valuable ingredients in there: small amounts of intense and very volatile molecules that still smell strongly of cloves even after the essential oil has been separated.\n\nINNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nBufalo has been working for Symrise in Brazil since 2015 and has been heading the lab in Holzminden for a few months now. In her hometown, she made a discovery while visiting a supplier. 'I found a few containers there and, after asking what was in them, was told that it was the leftover water from the clove distillation that gets thrown away.' She gets curious, smells the liquid and instantly recognizes that she has discovered something special. She takes a sample and shows it to two Symrise perfumers, Fanny Grau and Isaac Sinclair, who con/firm the peculiarity of her /find: They had never smelled a clove scent like this.\n\nBufalo recognizes the potential of the original byproduct and prepares it in the lab. For this, she uses the SymTrap \u00ae process and what is known as the aqueous phase. Symrise developed and patented it 20 years ago. The liquid /first passes through the adsorber column while speci/fic temperatures or pressure levels are maintained - Bufalo won't reveal the exact conditions. After the process, the fragrance molecules remain suspended in the equipment and are then dissolved out again by means of a foodgrade and natural extraction agent. The liquid byproduct from the distillation process produces a new product that di/ffers from essential clove oil in odor and is therefore ideally suited as an exclusive additional material in fragrance blends.\n\n## Reprocess natural byproducts\n\nThanks to the SymTrap \u00ae process, co-products can be recycled. Just a few buildings away from Bufalo's laboratory, a dozen silver columns about 1.50 meters high stand in a high rack. Lab manager Dominik Winkler knows his way around the SymTrap \u00ae technology. 'We are working at two levels: The aqueous phases are either delivered directly to us and we get the molecules out with the help of SymTrap \u00ae , or we install small facilities directly where",

The advantage of the latter is that we don't have to transport the large quantities of liquid around the world - this reduces emissions and costs.\n\nIn the meantime, Symrise has created hundreds of scents and fragrances with the SymTrap \u00ae process and 40 to 50 of them are in the current portfolio. Apples, red and citrus fruits, nuts and malt can also be utilized like this. Manufacturing non-alcoholic beer or processing co/ffee beans for instant co/ffee can also involve the use of aqueous phases. 'With technology, we can process natural byproducts and capture and concentrate aromas,' says Winkler.

        "page_content": "SymTrap \u00ae also allowed for the creation of a complex /flavor pro/file in a lot of products. 'Oranges, for examples, are pressed where they are grown and the juice is concentrated via a dehydration process. The concentrate has a lower volume and can be transported at a lower cost and with less CO2 output,' says Winkler. The disadvantage is that the orange juice tastes /flatter than freshly pressed juice when it is rehydrated at its /final destination. It's missing the aroma molecules from the water that was removed. 'With SymTrap \u00ae , we can put these back in the product.'\n\n## Get valuable ingredients\n\nAnother argument for using the SymTrap \u00ae process on site: The aqueous phase goes o/ff very quickly. If it is processed right after harvest, the valuable substances are still there. For this reason, Symrise has installed sophisticated systems where a lot of raw materials grow - in Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Brazil, South Africa and Japan. In these facilities, cartridges with the absorber material, which are replaced regularly, collect the aroma molecules. In Symrise production, a food-grade extraction agent dissolves them out again. These natural aroma concentrates are then used as natural building blocks in scents or fragrance creations, for example, and can also be applied to a carrier via spray drying.\n\nBack to Bufalo's lab: 'Of course, there are challenges, too,' says the scientist. 'With natural materials the quality often varies with the season and harvest time. We put a lot of value on the standardization of products, and this means we have to develop methods.' This is why the constant exchange of knowledge with her colleagues from the other divisions is important. The Taste, Nutrition & Health colleagues in France have developed the 'Garden Lab,' for example, with the help of Dominik Winklers team. The name arises from the Fine Fragrances department: 'Our colleagues extracted volatile aroma molecules from the aqueous phases that result from the manufacture of vegetable puree.' These can, among other things, give the purees back their full /flavor, just like with the orange juice, and are also used rather unusually at /first glance: Symrise Fine Fragrances has integrated a wide variety of diverse molecules from asparagus, leek, cauli/flower, artichoke and even onion into its fragrance creations. 'They come from the byproducts of a completely different production and now give a kick to new fragrance compositions - that is really a special innovation,' emphasizes Bufalo.\n\nIn the lab, Jennifer Bufalo works on new solutions for the Scent & Care segment at Symrise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00bb\n\nWith natural materials the quality often varies with the season and harvest time.

It is a tremendous opportunity for us and with our highvalue solutions, we are willing to make an incredible contribution to this growth! In order to be able to answer this market demand, we had to expand our former plant . That's why we decided to build a new, state-of-the-art production site at a di/fferent, much larger location in the same city of Chuzhou.\n\nFrom there, we can now process our natural raw materials into the best products for our customers. We use fresh or frozen chicken and beef byproducts and, for special recipes, /fish processing sidestreams to produce powder and liquid products. We have also equipped the plant with a large product development center and all the lab equipment our analysts need. As the /first site in the Asia/Paci/fic region, Chuzhou also features the integrated expert measurement center Panelis, which we use at sites around the world. Panelis is where we observe food acceptance by cats and dogs.\n\nJust like the rest of our new pet food sites, this plant is LEED-certi/fied, at the coveted silver level. At the plant, we use low-consumption or highly e/fficient electrical equipment for light /fixtures and air conditioning. We have also insulated the buildings well and installed taps with low water consumption. We are also supporting the use of electric vehicles by providing charging stations for e-bikes and electric cars.

We are developing natural processes to achieve this, one of which is bioconversion. Bioconversion involves feeding /flies larvae with fruit and vegetable byproducts for roughly seven to nine days. From the larval stage to their mature stage, the larvae absorb a very high amount of protein and concentrate some compounds. Once they are mature, we freeze the larvae and use them to produce two end products: insect /flour, which we aim to use in products for aquacultures and pet food, and insect oil, which can be used as a technical ingredient in cosmetics and other areas. We also collect all the waste the insects produce and have it spread on /fields as organic fertilizer.\n\nIn our tests so far, we have tried out six di/fferent sidestreams, including celery, onion pomace and banana peels. The process works - now we want to know which products have which bene/fits, for instance, if a speci/fic kind of insect /flour can demonstrate health bene/fits thanks to the compounds bioconcentration like beta-carotene. Over the next few months, we will evaluate how these products can be used and also how they can be produced on a larger scale.",

The two-hour workshop, intended to achieve the objective of the long-term campaign with di/fferent modules - more occupational safety, fewer accidents, and therefore also fewer health risks for the employees - then started after a short introduction.\n\nThe meeting, which is held as a kick-o/ff event at all departments at Symrise, started o/ff by asking participants for all kinds of information. Cosima Hebestadt, member of the project team, who is currently completing her cooperative studies towards a Bachelor of Business Administration in the communications department, carried out the safety culture check. This check determines the status quo of occupational safety within the particular department. In the questionnaire, the employees answer around 25 questions on issues such as leadership, communication, participation, error culture, teamwork and safety organization, which Symsafe is based on. During the remainder of the workshop, she evaluated the responses and concluded by presenting the /fields that showed the greatest need for development. Philipp M\u00fcller, external occupational safety consultant, and Kristin Frese, external coach for changing work culture, then took over together with the Symrise occupational safety team. They introduced initial occupational safety concepts and got the employees actively involved, for example with a 'World Caf\u00e9.' During this activity, they asked employees questions about speci/fic topics at three di/fferent tables and then asked them to write them down on the tablecloths and discuss them afterwards. One of the discussions centered around why you should be mindful of occupational safety in the /first place. In the end, the participants had written down keywords such as 'consequences,' 'involvement in decisions,' 'teamwork' and 'risks' on the tablecloth.\n\nAt the Symsafe kick-o/ff event, employees learn about the measures that make up the occupational safety campaign. The main focus here is on employee participation.",

        "page_content": "## An MAQ value of less than 1.5\n\nThese keywords describe very well what Symsafe is all about. Bernhard Kott, who is responsible for all sustainability issues at the company as Chief Sustainability O/fficer, also attended the event that day. He explained why Symrise launched the campaign: 'For one, our accident numbers are very high. In Germany alone, there were 270 accidents in 2021,' said Kott. While the number itself is one thing, each number represents an individual who has su/ffered an injury. 'We don't want to just accept that anymore,' said Kott. He followed this up by pointing out that many accidents at Symrise did not result in serious consequences, but that they always could end up being more severe injuries. This is why the company has set itself the goal of achieving a MAQ rate of less than 1.5 by 2025. This rate represents the number of workplace accidents with at least one lost day per one million work hours.\n\nA host of measures and tools are meant to pave the way to fewer accidents. Symsafe is a comprehensive system that is founded on numerous pillars. 'It doesn't really take much to avoid most accidents. This is why we primarily want to sensitize and train employees so that they are in a better position to recognize, assess and prevent hazards,' said Jessica Hildebrandt, a project leader. She went on to explain that the technical equipment and safety features that Symrise o/ffers represent the framework, but that the attitude with which employees approach their work is just as important. At the same time, the company intends to impart signi/ficantly more knowledge, such as with tools like short daily meetings or analyzing accidents that actually occurred as well as almost-accidents. 'Occupational safety should become a core component of day-to-day work,' said Hildebrandt. 'And that will only work when we get employees involved and see them as experts for their workplace. If we fail to do that, we will only /find short-term solutions that will not result in sustainable safety culture.' Overall, around 30 di/fferent tools are in use, according to Peter Asche, who as head of the Symrise occupational safety team at the Holzminden site was decisively involved creating Symsafe together with his employees. 'We have laid out all the measures on a /five-year roadmap, which we also introduce in the kick-o/ff workshop. We will install these measures selectively or permanently at the company on this basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nSymrise has set itself the goal of achieving an MAQ value of less than 1.5 by 2025.\n\nExecutives take on a particular role in the process, which is scheduled to last several years. They are meant to not only see this campaign as an important component of their work for themselves, but to also promote it and hold their employees to it. Special workshops are held for these employees - all the way to the top - to increase their awareness of the topic and their responsibilities, rights and duties. To support this, the occupational safety objectives will also be included as part of the portion of executive bonus compensation linked to the non-/financial company objectives starting in 2023. 'The issue belongs to the 'Care' pillar of our sustainability strategy. For this reason, it should be viewed in the same way as all other annual targets,' Hildebrandt explained.\n\nSymsafe also evolved once again in late 2021. Since the issue of occupational safety plays an important role in many cases, colleagues in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment in France had also set out on the path to develop a new safety culture. In most cases, both approaches netted the same results - but there also were nuanced di/fferences in the approach. 'We combined both processes into one campaign, which resulted in an excellent outcome,' said Bernhard Kott. One example is the guidelines that the teams developed. 'While the eleven guidelines of the experts from Germany were based more on behavior, the ten guidelines from the French experts focused on safe working, identifying hazards and creating conditions for a safe workplace,' explained Kott. 'We, along with many other parts of the Group have also bene/fited from the synergies that the di/fferent ways of thinking have produced. Now, after intensive planning, we will also move into successful implementation.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the same time, we face mounting challenges, including the increasingly negative consequences of climate change on nature, biodiversity and natural resources as well as the serious e/ffects of the spread of the coronavirus on global supply chains and people around the world. Symrise seeks a dialogue with all relevant stakeholder groups in order to discuss current developments and to meet the needs of various stakeholders regarding sustainable governance. Examples of dialogue platforms are the various WBCSD committees, global representative bodies IFRA and IOFI, and initiatives such as OP2B and the Development and Climate Alliance. We exchange sustainability information particularly closely with the company's shareholders, investors, voting proxies and rating agencies. Rating agencies MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS ESG provide especially high-quality and e/fficient communication of our ESG performance to investors. Moreover, our sustainability performance is regularly evaluated by internationally recognized institutions such as CDP, EcoVadis and SEDEX. Customers as well as investors are interested in the continued development of our sustainability reporting, which will increase the transparency of our business processes and allow for better assessment of the opportunities and risks inherent to our business activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nArnaud Bellon, Sustainability Cosmetic Ingredients\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Marcus Eh, Sustainability Aroma Molecules\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTobias Erfurth, Investor Relations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Birch, Sustainability Taste, Nutrition & HealthDr. Helmut Frieden, Corporate Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarie Le Hena/ff, Sustainability Taste, Nutrition & Health\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSascha Liese, Corporate SustainabilityFriedrich-Wilhelm Micus, Corporate Communications\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhilippa Smith, Sustainability Scent & Care\n\nMore than 150 Sustainability Ambassadors worldwide\n\nMore than 11,000 employees in more than 40 countries\n\nDoris Gattermann, Corporate Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC h i e f E x e c u t i ve O /ffi c e r\n\nC h i e f S u st a in a b ili t y O /ffi c e r\n\nS u st a in a b ili t y B o a r d\n\nDr. Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Bertram, CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBernhard Kott, CSO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n105",

It is an enormous challenge to procure these services in a sustainable and fair manner; at the same time, this presents an opportunity for Symrise to reinforce supplier relationships over the long term and to foster partnerships. Symrise has de/fined the conditions for responsible sourcing in its sourcing policy and its Code of Conduct, which apply to all suppliers. Symrise is also currently working on a Supplier Code of Conduct that will take e/ffect in 2022. For inte grating its suppliers in this way, Symrise made it onto the CDP rating's Supplier Engagement Leaderboard in 2020 for the /first time. The Leaderboard is a list of the top performers of the 9,600 companies assessed by CDP. Symrise also established a Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee (RSSC) in 2021 to implement the company's own due diligence. The decision-making\n\nbody de/fines the processes for assessing suppliers and undertaking corresponding measures, as well as for embedding the assessment criteria in the business processes. This not only makes our supply chains more resilient, but also allows us to ful/fill the requirements of our stakeholders.\n\n## Within sight: 100 % of suppliers with a sustainable rating\n\nOur aim is to make our supply chains more sustainable on a continuous basis - both socially and environmentally. For this reason, we plan to assess the sustainability of all our suppliers (raw materials and services) by 2025. We also aim to increase the number of our suppliers that establish their own environmental goals through the CDP Supply Chain program, and to achieve 100 % responsible sourcing of strategic agricultural and aquacultural raw materials by 2025.\n\n## Symrise joins the AIM-Progress initiative\n\nSymrise has been involved in the European Brands Association's international AIM-Progress initiative since March 2021, together with other consumer goods manufacturers and suppliers who are dedicated to sustainability and upholding human rights in the supply chain. In addition to Symrise, many other companies including The Coca-Cola Company support the initiative. AIM-Progress provides a forum for exchange, mutual audit recognition, continuing education and networking.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In line with the motto 'There's no such thing as sustainable products; there are only more sustainable products,' we believe that sustainability is a journey on which we can all learn from each other. If someone thinks there's nothing more they can do, they haven't fully grasped the issue. We believe that always searching for better concepts and approaches, and incorporating them into our processes, is key to upholding human rights in the supply chain.

Crop losses resulting from water scarcity, /flooding and storms have a direct impact on our local partners and can lead to supply shortages and increasing costs for our production. However, this dependence also provides us with opportunities to use our sphere of in/fluence. One example is our SBTi climate protection goal, which also incorporate our primary suppliers. In addition, we rely on innovative products with a reduced carbon footprint, such as alternative proteins. This allows us to meet the increasing demand for sustainably manufactured products, making Symrise particularly attractive to investors who value sustainability.\n\n13.1\n\n13.2\n\n## Step by step: climate-positive starting in 2030\n\nAs of 2030, our business activities are expected to contribute to preventing or sequestering more greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere than we produce through our operating activities.

The target was approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative in February 2022. Symrise aims to reduce GHG emissions (Scope 1+2) by 80 % by 2028 compared to 2020.

Symrise has repeatedly achieved top CDP positions with A ratings.\n\n## What are the challenges and opportunities for Symrise with regard to climate protection?\n\nThe consequences of climate change are already perceptible for Symrise. At the same time, as a partner and an important supplier, Symrise can make contributions including helping shape the transformation of the food industry. For example, synthetic menthols can be produced with far fewer emissions than menthols from conventionally cultivated peppermint - though the customers must also accept this. The supply chain o/ffers the greatest potential for Symrise to contribute to climate protection. This is a very good starting point - not least because of the signi/ficance of Symrise as a DAX \u00ae company - but it is also an obligation.\n\n## How do you rate the climate protection goals and measures at Symrise?\n\nFirst of all, it's noteworthy that Symrise is consistently rated very well by organizations such as the CDP. Which is not to say that Symrise can rest on its laurels. The company's goals should be updated with an orien tation toward the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. More activity is needed with regard to energy consumption in the plants and also toward suppliers, in order to get more standardized information from the supply chain. The existing goals - particularly those assessed by the SBTi - are a good start, but they need to be implemented and developed on a continuous basis.\n\nDr. Alen Sacek, ESG / Engagement O/fficer LBBW AM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLBBW Asset Management Investmentgesellschaft (LBBW AM) has been investing in sustainable companies since 2006 and values holistic company development with a focus on the ESG pro/file.\n\n## Why is Symrise such a good /fit for your portfolio?\n\nCompliance with the UN Global Compact and reducing CO2 intensity are at the heart of our sustainability funds. For us, targeted measures to reduce CO2 emissions along the value chain are more important than the status quo. We think Symrise performs very well in these areas. In addition to regularly assessing external rating agencies, we also compare key measurable ESG data with our own benchmarks, and Symrise performs above average in that area. We also conduct collaborative dialogues with companies through our Active Ownership activities.\n\n## What makes Symrise an attractive investment?\n\nContinuity and transparency! Symrise is characterized by a very high degree of transparency in its value chain. It reveals room for improvement in sustainability and, more importantly, introduces measures that can be used to further strengthen sustainability. As a whole, our analyses show that Symrise continues to make progress in improving its sustainability pro/file in terms of its products and operations, and throughout the value chain. Though of course, no global company is 'perfectly sustainable.' Impact investing will become increasingly important for companies like Symrise, so that Symrise should not only further reduce CO2 but also expand measurement of the social impact of its business activities.\n\n113",

At the same time, this is key to the company's long-term pro/fitability and innovative power. Products that are made from natural renewable raw materials and come from byproducts have always been an important starting point for our production, so that we view backward integration and product innovations as an opportunity to make unused resources reusable. One example is the new lily of the valley fragrance Lilybelle \u00ae , which Symrise produces using byproducts from the orange juice industry. The scent is thus made from 83 % renewable raw materials.\n\n15.1\n\n15.5\n\n## Responsible use of raw materials\n\nOur goal is to achieve sustainable sourcing of all strategic biological raw materials by 2025. We're also looking to further reduce our waste volumes. In accordance with SDG 12.3, food waste is to be reduced by 50 % in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, and sensitive waste e/fficiency will be increased by 4 % per year by 2025. Backward integration is also an important approach to the minimization of our consumption of raw materials. This also means that we need to more intensively monitor consumption along our supply chains.\n\n## Symrise is committed to making food systems more sustainable and increases the accountability of suppliers\n\nSymrise joined in the Business Declaration for Food System Transformation in 2021. With this declaration, companies support the call of the UN Food System Summit 2021 to work together to make food systems sustainable. These companies campaign for food systems that ensure balanced nutrition for all people, enable farmers to earn fair wages and contribute to protecting the environment and climate. Symrise has also joined the 10x20x30 initiative. With this, more than ten of the world's largest food retailers and providers have combined forces to each obligate at least 20 suppliers to reduce their food losses and waste by half by 2030.",

Its clients include manufacturers of perfumes, cosmetics, food and beverages, the pharmaceutical industry and producers of nutritional supplements and pet food.\n\nWith sales of \u20ac 3.8 billion in the 2021 fiscal year and a market share of around 10 %, Symrise is one of the leading global suppliers. Headquartered in Holzminden, Germany, the Group is represented by more than 100 locations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the United States and Latin America. The Symrise Group originally resulted from a merger between the German companies Haarmann & Reimer and Dragoco in 2003. The roots of Symrise date back to 1874 and 1919, when the two companies were founded. In 2006, Symrise AG entered the stock market with its initial public offering (IPO). Since then, Symrise shares have been listed in the Prime Standard segment of the German stock exchange in Frankfurt/Main. With a market capitalization of about \u20ac 18 billion at the end of 2021, Symrise shares have been listed on the DAX \u00ae index since September 2021. Currently, about 95 % of the shares are in free float.\n\nOperational business is the responsibility of Taste, Nutrition & Health and Scent & Care segments. As of April 1, 2021, the previously separate segments of Flavor and Nutrition were transformed into one newly structured segment. This transformation is necessary above all due to the continued focus on the needs of Symrise customers and the resulting customer loyalty. It also reflects the overlap in raw materials, production processes and customers. Both segments have areas such as research and development, purchasing, production, quality control, marketing and sales. This allows processes to be accelerated. The goal is to simplify procedures while making them customer-oriented and pragmatic. The focus is on fast and flexible decision-making.\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n5\n\nBASIC INFORMATION ON THE SYMRISE GROUP\n\nThe Taste, Nutrition & Health segment includes the Food & Beverage and Pet Food divisions as well as the two smaller units Aqua Feed and Probi. The Scent & Care segment breaks down into the Fragrance, Cosmetic Ingredients and Aroma Molecules divisions.\n\nThe Group's business activities are also organized into four regions: EAME (Europe, Africa and Middle East), North America, Asia/Pacific and Latin America.\n\nThe Group has a Corporate Center where the following central functions are carried out: Accounting, Controlling, Taxes, Treasury, Corporate Communications/Sustainability, Investor Relations, Legal Affairs, Human Resources (HR), Group Compliance, Corporate Internal Audit and Information Technology (IT). Other supporting functions such as technology, energy, safety, environment and logistics are bundled in independent Group companies. They also maintain business relationships with customers outside the Group.\n\nSymrise AG's headquarters are located in Holzminden, Germany. At this site, the Group's largest, Symrise employs 2,585 people in the areas of research, development, production, marketing and sales as well as in the Corporate Center. Symrise has regional headquarters in Germany (Holzminden), the United States (Teterboro, New Jersey), Brazil (S\u00e3o Paulo) and Singapore. Important production facilities and development centers are located in Germany, France, Madagascar, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, China, India, Japan and the USA.

Examples of how food ingredients and perfume oils are combined with other innovative components include flavors that enable the sugar or salt content of foods to be reduced or a moisturizing cosmetic ingredient that lowers the proportion of preservatives in care products.\n\nOn the basis of these products, Symrise customers can set themselves apart from competitors with their tailor-made end products in the rapidly changing consumer goods market. The extensive research and development (R & D) undertaken at the company, which is supplemented by a wide-reaching external network of partnerships with research institutes and scientific facilities, forms the basis of product development. Given the strong differences in sensory preferences from region to region, comprehensive consumer research is also an important part of the R & D activities at Symrise.\n\nDetails on cooperation between the Executive and Supervisory Boards as well as on corporate governance at Symrise can be found in the Supervisory Board and corporate governance statements.\n\n## BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND PRODUCTS\n\n## The value chain of Symrise\n\nSymrise manufactures about 34,000 products from around 10,000 - mostly natural - raw materials such as vanilla, citrus products or flower and plant materials. The value chain of the two segments extends across research and development, purchasing, production, and the sale of products and solutions. The natural food ingredients, flavors, perfume oils and active ingredients are generally central functional components in Symrise customers' end products and often play a decisive role in consumers' purchasing decisions. Along with the typical product characteristics such as fragrance and taste,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Majority shareholder in the Swedish company Probi AB.\n\n123",

In some cases, Symrise has longerterm delivery contracts for obtaining important raw materials. Symrise main tains close ties with its suppliers and establishes uniform standards to guarantee that the quality of its base materials remains the same.\n\n## Taste, Nutrition & Health\n\nAs part of a strategic realignment, the previously separately controlled  Flavor and Nutrition segments were transformed into one newly structured Taste, Nutrition & Health segment. This transformation serves above all the continued focus on the needs of Symrise customers and the resulting customer loyalty. It also reflects the overlap in raw materials, production processes and customers. The Taste, Nutrition & Health segment uses its combined expertise as well as scientific research to offer customers and partners unique, natural ingredient-based and sustainable solutions in the areas of taste, nutrition and health. With more than 100 sites in over 40 countries, the segment serves the markets of the food and beverage industry as well as manufacturers of pet food and fish food. The segment is divided into the two core Food & Beverage and Pet Food di visions as well as the two smaller Aqua Feed and Probi units.\n\nFood & Beverage: In close cooperation with food producers, the Food & Beverage division develops differentiated ingredients and flavor solutions that meet consumer needs for naturalness and distinctive taste experiences. The division supplies individual tonalities and complete solutions for use in the final product, which, apart from the actual taste, can contain additional functional ingredients to protect taste and promote health. The Food & Beverage division's range comprises more than 14,000 products marketed in four application areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBeverages: Symrise advises and supports the international beverage industry with global expertise in non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. The authentic and innovative taste solutions from Symrise are used in soft drinks, juice-based drinks, tea and coffee products, spirits and fermented beverages.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSweet: In the Sweet business unit, Symrise creates innovative taste solutions for sweets, chocolates, chewing gum, baked goods, cereals, ice cream and milk products, as well as for the health care sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSavory: Savory flavors made by Symrise are used in two major categories: In the Culinary category for soups, sauces, ready meals, instant noodles and meat products and in the Snack Food category with seasonings for snacks. In both categories, Symrise can rely on its core flavor competency in meat and vegetables, which is characterized by cutting-edge food technology and research as well as sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNaturals: The business unit offers a wide range of innovative, natural and sustainable ingredients for food and beverage manufacturers, as well as products for baby food and dietary supplements. In-house agronomists carefully select raw materials and apply responsible sourcing practices to preserve the best natural qualities of conventional and organic fruit, vegetables, meat, seafood, vanilla and plants. Gentle, industrial processing methods, in combination with technological expertise, are used to provide standardized clean label ingredients for food products that ensure safety, the highest quality and traceability along the entire value chain. Consequently, Symrise customers achieve the best results in terms of taste performance, health benefits, sensory properties and the shelf life of their products.\n\nThe food-specific products from ADF/IDF were assigned to the Naturals business unit as part of the transformation of the Flavor and Nutrition segments into the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment.",

In doing so, the business unit relies on a global network of science and technology experts.\n\nProbi: The Swedish company Probi, in which Symrise holds a majority interest, develops, produces and markets effective probiotics for food supplements and functional foods. Probi specializes in handling live bacterial cultures, from research and development through to the production process. This makes the health-promoting effects of probiotics accessible to the general public.\n\nThe segment also operates a Business Incubation Group (BIG).

The division's unique approach is based on more than 100 years of experience in the development and marketing of cosmetic raw materials. In addition, the division is able to combine the best of nature, science and chemistry as well as skin and hair biology. Based on intensive consumer research, the division understands the needs of modern consumers. The research centers in Holzminden and in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, work closely with the respective regional sales and application technology teams to offer customers and consumers tailor-made solutions and products for different regional requirements. The Cosmetic Ingredients division is a recognized innovation leader that has received 35 innovation awards for new substances over the past ten years. During the same period, 119 patent applications were filed, 9 of them in 2021 alone.\n\nAroma Molecules: The division includes the business units Menthols and Fragrance Ingredients. In the Menthols business unit, Symrise manufactures nature-identical menthol, which is primarily used in manufacturing oral care products, chewing gum and shower gels. Fragrance Ingredients manufactures aroma chemicals (intermediate products for perfume oils) of especially high quality. These aroma chemicals are used both in Symrise's own production of perfume oils as well as marketed to companies in the consumer goods industry and other companies in the fragrance and flavor industry. This business unit additionally offers terpene-based products obtained from renewable and sustainable raw materials.\n\n## MARKET AND COMPETITION\n\nMARKET STRUCTURE\n\nThe Symrise Group is active in many different markets around the world. These include the traditional market for flavors and fragrances (F & F market), whose volume should amount to \u20ac 29.9 billion in 2021, according to calculations made by the IAL Consultants market research institute (12th Edition, September 2020). In addition, with the Cosmetic Ingredients and Aroma Molecules divisions, the company is active in the market for aroma chemicals and cosmetic ingredients, which, according to reports of IAL (2nd Edition, December 2020), should achieve sales of approximately \u20ac 7.6 billion in the reporting year. The markets have many trends and characteristics in common. The market relevant for Symrise (the AFF 1 market) therefore has a total volume of \u20ac 37.5 billion. According to its own estimates, it will grow by an average of approximately 3 to 4 % per annum in the long-term. In 2021, growth reached around 4.8 % according to estimates by IAL Consultants.\n\nMore than 500 companies are active in the market worldwide. The four largest providers, which include Symrise, together have a market share of 54 %.\n\nThe F & F market is characterized worldwide by high barriers to entry. There is increasing customer demand for higher quality and more differentiated products with ever-shorter product life cycles. The majority of products and recipes are manufactured specially for individual customers. Furthermore, local taste preferences often dictate that there are many different recipes for a single end product that vary depending on the country in which it is marketed. Moreover, customer relations are often characterized by intensive cooperation in product development.\n\nIn addition to varying local taste preferences and consumer behaviors, there are other factors that also influence the demand for end products in which Symrise products are used: The population's increasing income in emerging markets is having a positive impact on the development of demand for products containing fragrances and flavorings or cosmetic ingredients. Market growth also depends on more basic products that meet everyday needs and already have an established presence in the markets of industrialized nations. In the developed Western European, Asian and North American markets, consumer trends such as beauty, health, well-being, convenience and naturalness determine the growing demand for products containing Symrise ingredients.",

        "page_content": "## THE MARKET POSITION OF SYMRISE\n\nSymrise is one of the largest companies in the AFF industry. In relation to the relevant market of \u20ac 37.5 billion, the market share of Symrise is roughly 10 % in terms of 2021 sales. Symrise has expanded its traditional business segments to include additional applications: Scent & Care, for example, offers cosmetic active ingredients, and Taste, Nutrition & Health focuses on pet food. Greater value creation can be achieved on the basis of these more complex product solutions. In submarkets such as food supplements, sun protection filters or other cosmetic ingredients, Symrise also stands in competition with companies or product segments of these companies that do not belong to the traditional AFF industry.\n\nSymrise has leading positions in certain market segments worldwide, for example, in mint and vanilla flavor compositions. Furthermore, Symrise is one of the leading companies in the manufacturing of nature-identical L-menthol and also holds a leading position in the segment of UV sun protection filters, fragrance ingredients, and in baby and pet food.\n\n## GOALS AND STRATEGY\n\n## GOALS\n\nIn the long term, Symrise wants to strengthen its market position and ensure the independence of Symrise. At the same time, Symrise recognizes its responsibility toward the environment, its employees and society at large. Symrise intends to increase its sustainability regarding its footprint, innovation, sourcing and care, thereby reducing risks for the company and promoting economic success.\n\n- Market position: With long-term organic growth of 5 to 7 % per year (CAGR), 1 sales growth at Symrise should exceed the growth of the market, which is expanding by about 3 to 4 % per year on average. This will enable Symrise to gradually increase the distance between it and smaller competitors and to gain market share.\n- Value orientation: Symrise wants to consistently be counted among the most profitable companies in the industry. The Group aims to achieve an average EBITDA margin of 20 to 23 %.\n\nPerformance results are described in greater detail in the company development section. Symrise ensures that its shareholders have an appropriate share in the company's success.

It incorporates aspects of sustainability at all levels in order to enhance the Group's value over the long term and minimize risks. In this way, Symrise is making sustainability an integral part of its business model and turning it into a clear competitive advantage. The goal is a completely integrated corporate strategy.\n\n- Growth: Symrise strengthens cooperation with its strategic customers around the world and expands its business in emerging markets. The Group makes sure that it remains an innovation leader in its core competencies. This ensures its continued growth.\n- Efficiency: Symrise works continually to improve its processes and focuses on products with a high level of value creation. With backward integration for key raw materials, Symrise ensures a consistent, high-quality supply of these materials in sufficient quantities and at set delivery conditions. Symrise works cost-consciously in every division. This is how the Group ensures its profitability.\n- Portfolio: Symrise enhances its product portfolio and taps into new markets and segments. The Group continues to expand its expertise outside the traditional flavor and fragrances industry. This ensures its prominent market position.\n\n## Goals by 2025\n\nSales in \u20ac billion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSymrise grows organically. When it makes sense, the Group engages in expansive acquisitions or enters into strategic partnerships for product development. At the same time, Symrise wants to ensure that the Group remains capable of taking advantage of any growth opportunities that arise without jeopardizing the company's financial stability.\n\n## VALUE-ORIENTED MANAGEMENT\n\nDifferent variables are at play within the framework of valueoriented corporate governance. The company is aiming for average organic sales growth of between 5 and 7 % per year (CAGR) 1 in the long-term. The EBITDA margin, for which Symrise has defined a strategic target of 20 to 23 % (by 2025), serves as an indicator of the company's profitability. In addition, the company introduced business free cash flow in 2018 as the primary internal control variable to assess its performance in order to strengthen the Group's cash flow orientation. Symrise aims to continuously increase the business free cash flow, which consists of EBITDA, investments (including cash effects from leasing) and changes in working capital. Increasing the value of the company is accounted for in the remuneration system for the Executive Board and selected managerial staff. In addition, Symrise attaches great importance to the Group's financial stability. Management's focus, therefore, is guided by these financial control parameters.

The two segments at Symrise each manage their own R & D activities due to the varying requirements of their respective markets and customers. At the same time, technologies, processes and findings are made available to all segments, in order to achieve synergies and improve resource efficiency. Multiple R & D centers around the world ensure that the regional activities of the segments are optimally supported. The research activities of the Scent & Care segment, especially the centers for development and application technologies, are located in Holzminden (Germany), Teterboro (USA), Singapore, Shanghai (China), Tokyo (Japan), Chennai (India), Paris (France), Antananarivo (Madagascar), S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) and Cuautitlan (Mexico). In addition, a hair research center was established at the S\u00e3o Paulo site. In addition, the Cosmetic Ingredients division has expanded its core competencies through the acquisition of Cutech in Padua, Italy, with highly innovative skin models for basic skin biology research and for the development of new cosmetic active ingredients. In the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment, R & D activities are organized according to the Food & Beverage and Pet Food divisions as well as the smaller Aqua Feed and Probi units. The majority of this segment's R & D activities are located in Holzminden (Germany), Teterboro (USA), Singapore, Shanghai (China), Tokyo (Japan), Paris (France), Rennes (France), Elven (France), S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil), and Lund (Sweden).\n\n## EXTERNAL COOPERATIONS\n\nExternal cooperations and networks (Open Innovation) bring a considerable amount of additional approaches and ideas into the development process. Along with ideas from Open Innovation, Symrise also maintains a global project network with industrial, institutional and academic partners that covers every step of the innovative process - from basic research to marketing concepts.\n\nSymrise participates in numerous scientific research projects that are supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the German Federal Ministry of Economics (BMWi), via the Research Group of the Food Industry (FEI)/Working Group for Industrial Research (AiF), the European Union (EU, Horizon 2020), TKI (Top Consortium for Knowledge and Innovation, Netherlands) the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), the French research tax credit (CIR) and other public and private funding institutions. Topics in the following areas play a key role: Sustainability, the targeted development of information sources on the effects\n\ncurement, employees and innovation are reported separately in the Corporate Report. Further information on the non-financial benchmarks can be found in the separate non-financial report pursuant to Section 289b of the German Commercial Code (HGB), which is published on the website of Symrise AG. It can be found at: https://symrise.com/corporatereport/ 2021/en/sustainability-responsibility/sustainabilityrecord.html .\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## GUIDELINES\n\nIn research and development (R & D), Symrise aims to connect the individual components of product development, such as market and consumer research, R & D and creation, throughout the Group. Through the close linkup of R & D with marketing and business units, purchasing and manufacturing, product development, quality assurance and regulatory issues, Symrise checks early on to see whether new products and technologies can be implemented, digitized and if they are profitable, in addition to assessing their sustainability aspects. Strategic research fields are the area of sustainable processes and products, such as green chemistry, the increased demand for perfumery ingredients based on renewable raw materials, the area of taste optimization (taste balancing), sensory optimization of preparations based on plant protein and the development of sustainable, resource-saving manufacturing processes. Essential research results are secured by way of stringent IP management, such as protective rights. Furthermore, all R & D activities are geared to the guidelines of mega trends, consumer needs, customer requirements, naturalness and authenticity, sustainability, digitalization, innovation and cost efficiency.\n\n## ORGANIZATION\n\nFrom idea to marketable product, the innovation process at Symrise is organized around a uniform, stage gate process with decision filters, which has been implemented across the company. Here, more and more elements of agile project management are being used. A business plan containing exact project descriptions, including the project's costs and resource usage, is developed for every project. The research and development projects are also regularly evaluated based on criteria from the four pillars of the sustainability strategy (FISC) and prioritized accordingly. As part of this process in 2021, in particular, the area of fair use of biodiversity was further developed according to the provisions of the Nagoya Protocol. One future field is the utilization of legacy varieties of known agricultural raw materials in order to preserve and expand biodiversity. Symrise has joined the OP2B consortium of vari-",

A large number of key topics are being worked on with a special focus on sustainability aspects. In the Food & Beverage division, examples include: the development and adaptation of new, gentle and environmentally friendly separation technologies, as well as the expansion and elaboration of raw material sources for sustainable and natural product solutions for the Symrise Code of Nature \u00ae platform, which are primarily used for healthy food concepts; the continuous development of natural and sustainable raw materials for flavor solutions that lead to the sensory-preferred reformulation of low-sugar, low-salt and low-fat food concepts; and the development of ener gy-efficient and low-solvent methods for concentration, beginning with plant-based raw materials. In 2021, a special focus was placed on the challenge of improving the taste of plant proteins as meat substitutes or for use in dairy products. An other focus is on reducing sugar in beverages and dairy products as well as in savory applications. In this context, the se lection of varieties and new cultivation methods for a sustainable supply chain were developed for specific plant-based raw materials for the Taste Balancing product platform. Another focus of research in the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment is the development and application of modern digital tools for the rapid and targeted development of flavor solutions for  selected food applications. The ProtiScan\u2122 process - developed by Symrise for recording the flavor release from innovative food preparations with vegetable protein - is noteworthy in this context. This process enables a significant reduction in project development times and forms a solid foundation for IT-based development concepts. In addition, product safety is being continuously improved and flavor solutions are being optimized for application in reduced sugar and plant protein-based foods. Furthermore, the focus was on developing usage of the bone waste stream as well as vegetable and chicken byproducts.\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n15\n\nBASIC INFORMATION ON THE SYMRISE GROUP\n\nIn the Pet Food division, the Elven site has been provided with state-of-the-art extrusion equipment to develop higher-performance and safer products. In addition, the VIDEKA \u00ae laboratory in Elven was designed for EAME customer support with shelf-life studies, research and development and analytical requirements. This laboratory is used to perform shelf-life studies of pet food and pet care preparations using state-of-the-art analytical tools.\n\nIn the Aqua business, an important focus of product development was on the utilization of shrimp shells as raw materials or functional ingredients. Projects on the development and application of flavor enhancers for carnivorous fish species were continued.\n\nProbi and Naturals have jointly launched a project to develop new symbiotic products containing live microorganisms and polyphenols extracted from fruits.\n\nThe Scent & Care segment focuses its R & D strategy on raw materials for perfumery according to the aspects of green chemistry and based on natural and renewable raw materials through suitable processes to natural extracts. For example, with the Garden Lab, a disruptive approach was taken using the SymTrap \u00ae process to make vegetable scents accessible for perfumery as well. The SymTrap \u00ae platform was further expanded with new products. In the field of extraction from natural raw materials, new qualities were developed and included in the perfumery range. New and sustainable captives have also been developed. Among them is Pearadise \u00ae , which is produced on the basis of biotechnologically derived raw materials and using green chemistry. With Flowerpool \u00ae , a captive was developed that smells of white blossoms and purity. Diviniris is an iris-scented captive with velvety notes. Symrise has also added Natural Neofresh \u00ae to its Neofresh platform to meet the customers' desire for sustainable products made from renewable raw materials.",

In application technology, certain technologies were developed to improve the performance of perfume oils. By combining the expertise of Symrise in fragrance development with that of Pet Food, the product category was further developed specifically for dogs and cats.\n\nA total of five research platforms exist in the areas of cosmetic ingredients, encapsulation and release systems for perfumery, green chemistry for sustainable products, bad odor management and oral care. Supporting platforms in the areas of sensory and analytical research, raw materials and byproducts from sustainable sources, performance, and receptor research form the basis for the capabilities at Symrise and for a constant innovation process. Newly developed technologies support the understanding of perfume oils in terms of long-lasting fragrance experiences and blooming effects. The growing population in large cities is causing the issue of anti-pollution to play an increasingly important role. Here Symrise also benefits from the close cooperation of various groups in Fragrance and Cosmetic Ingredients research. In the Cosmetic Ingredients division, an interdisciplinary research group of cell, molecular and microbiologists is looking at the human microbiome. The new research area is investigating the benefits and\n\n## Core functions of research and development at Symrise\n\n## Sustainability aspects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrisks of interactions between humans and microorganisms, and is providing scientific and cross-divisional support in the development of new products for skin, scalp and oral care, or in the area of nutrition. The first products and product concepts have already been introduced to the market. Crinipan \u00ae PMC green, for example, was developed to positively influence the scalp's microbiome and reduce dandruff. The anti-dandruff ingredient, which is based on natural raw materials, changes the microbiome in favor of a healthy symbiosis of microorganisms with the skin cells.\n\n## PATENTS AND AWARDS\n\nThe number of patents filed (42 new applications in 2021) is used to measure innovation results and quality and to evaluate global coverage and competitive impact.\n\nIn 2021, as in previous years, Symrise research was recognized with awards for its high level of innovation. For example, Symrise received a European BSB Innovation Award for SymDStress\u2122 100 as an innovative cosmetic raw material in the category Raw Materials and Anti-Aging/Soothing. This is a combination of cannabidiol (CBD), produced from a byproduct of the orange juice industry, and the particularly highly purified bisabolol (Dragosantol \u00ae 100). This combination has been shown to synergistically reduce skin irritation. The nat-",

Hydrolite \u00ae 7 green is a multifunctional cosmetic raw material produced based on the principles of green chemistry. It is applicable in a wide range of products and characterized in particular by its properties of enhancing antioxidants and solubilizers and proving product protection.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES\n\nTotal R & D expenditures amounted to \u20ac 221 million in the 2021 fiscal year (previous year: \u20ac 212 million), comprising 5.8 % of sales (previous year: 6.0 %). R & D expenditure in the reporting year was 4 % above the  level of the previous year and developed in a manner that could be described as slightly underproportional to the originally planned sales. The positive sales trend has diluted the share of sales accordingly, however. Symrise aims to return the share of R & D expenditures of sales to the level of previous years in the future in order to further strengthen its innovative power.\n\n## R & D  expenses  2017 - 2021 in \u20ac million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n133",

In comparison to December 31, 2020 (10,531 employees), this represents an additional 620 employees. The Taste, Nutrition & Health segment saw the largest increase in the number of its employees (+ 368 employees). At 125, the number of apprentices and trainees was below the previous year's figure of 134.\n\nSymrise continually reviews the demographic development of the workforce. Development of demographics will be very steady over the next ten years. The annual reduction of the workforce due to retirement will be around 1 to 2 % per year until 2022. 37 % of the Symrise Group's employees have been with the company for at least ten years - at German sites, this group accounts for 58 % of the workforce. The employee turnover rate remained very low in Germany in 2021, totaling 2.3 % in 2021. Globally, the figure was 6.4 %.\n\n## Number of employees by segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PERSONNEL STRATEGY\n\nThe personnel strategy supports Symrise's growth and ensures that the segments have the required skills available to them. A particular focus is on efficient digital mapping of core HR management processes throughout the world.\n\n## Group strategic development of senior executives and employees\n\nSince mid-2020, Symrise has launched the new career development and succession planning process digitally for the first two management levels as well as a wide range of focus groups, for example Flavorists and Key Account Managers, on a global scale. The aim of this cross-segment program is to sharpen and develop the job-related skills of the employees, to identify talent and prepare them to take on responsibility in key positions at Symrise. At the same time, the company uses talent development to ensure effective succession planning for business-crucial positions. Specifically, the process focuses on deriving company-wide training and development priorities, identifying talent and developing such talent through talent conferences with executives, along with succession planning for key business-crucial positions.\n\n## Number of employees by position\n\n<!-- image -->",

The plan for 2022 is to continue to optimize the process and to make it available to a larger group of employees. All employees have the opportunity to discuss and agree on a development plan with their supervisor since the program was introduced in 2020.\n\nIn December 2021, Symrise further expanded the topic area of 'modern and digital learning.' Employees were provided with a new, globally available 'Learning Management System' (LMS) and a digital learning platform ('Skillsoft'). Both tools are intended to bridge the gap between Group-wide skill development needs, the individual development plans of employees and a modern range of training measures that support lifelong learning. The training content is categorized into various subjects such as leadership training, efficient and effective working, language training, project management or occupational safety and sustainability. The topic of 'social learning' will also become more important in the coming years - the foundation for this was laid by the launch of Microsoft 365 and MS Teams.\n\n## Age structure of the workforce in %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, approximately 1,700 employees from all regions and both segments were involved in this talent development process. Symrise sees career development as an offer for the employees involving structured feedback. 75 % of the employees involved had a direct interest in engaging in a dialogue with their manager and HR about their development, which can be considered a success given the challenges faced by communication as a result of the coronavirus. The process yielded valuable results:\n\n- Assessment of Group-wide competency development needs to achieve the strategic goals\n- Identification of the top talents and their individual development  plans\n- Nomination of top talent for strategic development programs, such as the Leadership Accelerator Program\n- Robust succession planning in business-crucial positions\n\nSymrise continued this process in 2021. The focus was on development discussions and implementation of development measures as well as succession planning. Symrise specified\n\n## Number of employees by region\n\n<!-- image -->",

For this reason, it is in Symrise's own interest to employ the best women and men at all levels of management. Up to this point, however, there have been fewer women than men in management positions. Symrise has set ambitious goals for itself to change the situation in the long term. Symrise has therefore put a special focus on fostering the careers of women as part of its personnel strategy.\n\nTo better leverage the potential of women at Symrise, the company is planning to develop a strategy to ensure that  Symrise will be able to advance the careers of its female employees. As a first step, the current situation was thoroughly assessed in 2021. At the same time, interviews were conducted with women in various levels of seniority and age groups who have shown a great deal of potential. In 2022, Symrise will compile and implement the findings from this process in an action plan for further development of promising female employees.\n\n## Equitable remuneration for women and men\n\nIn 2021, Symrise carried out a gender-specific analysis of the wages for most of the employees at its largest site in Germany. In the in-depth analysis on the subject of equal pay, comparable job groups were formed and pay differences were analyzed against the backdrop of whether there is possible discrimination in this area. For this purpose, aspects such as length of service, age, schooling and vocational training and instruction were considered, along with the requirements level and professional position.\n\nIt was found that the average remuneration for women is not significantly different from the average remuneration for men. The unadjusted equal pay gap is 1.2 %. The remaining insignificant differences result from production-specific components of remuneration such as hardship allowances or activity-related wages such as foremen's or master craftsmen's allowances, or are prescribed by the various remuneration levels specified by wage agreements for commercial or technical professions.\n\nThe non-profit FPI Fair Pay Innovation Lab recognized Symrise for its fair pay in the 2021 reporting year.\n\nHR strategy at Symrise\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is evidenced by multiple awards in company comparisons over the past four years. On the one hand, Symrise recruits qualified young individuals who it specifically trains with the company's needs in mind. And with this commitment, Symrise is fulfilling an obligation that society as a whole has toward the next generation. As of December 31, 2021, a total of 125 apprentices and trainees were employed at the sites in Germany.\n\nDepending on the occupation, training lasts two to three years. All trainees are taken on at least temporarily after completing their training if they meet the minimum requirements regarding the success of their training. With its investment in training, Symrise is meeting the demand for future specialists in chemical production and in the laboratories as well as in commercial, marketing and sales positions.\n\nSymrise has structured its training capacity in a way that allows around 40 young people to begin their training at Symrise every year. Of these, 24 are trained in the chemical-technical professions, about ten for technical and logistics occupations and ten young people in commercial careers. Beyond initial training, Symrise opens up prospects through cooperative studies in business administration (five employees per year/ a total of 15 on the path to a Bachelor of Business Administration). Due to what has now become a noticeable shortage of skilled workers, Symrise has added further occupational fields to its spectrum of vocational training. In 2021, the second year of training as a Production Specialist for Food Technology began in Braunschweig. Distillers are regularly trained in N\u00f6rd lingen and training as a Technical Product Designer is offered in Holzminden since 2021. In cooperation with the Holzminden District Adult Education Center (Kreisvolkshochschule Holzminden), 14 young people also successfully completed the training program for chemical production specialists in June 2021. Most of them were hired after their training, bolstering the personnel at the mixing plants.  Symrise is thus working consistently to mitigate the demographic shift in the company. Furthermore, Symrise is currently preparing training in IT professions in the company for 2022.\n\nSymrise generally offers highly sophisticated training programs in all its regions. The pandemic has made it impossible to meaningfully compare the 2021 training measures with the previous year. On the one hand, classroom training was canceled or postponed to protect the health of our employees. On the other hand, Symrise provided employees with e-learning courses outside of its Learning Management System at\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n21\n\nBASIC INFORMATION ON THE SYMRISE GROUP\n\nshort notice in order to make sensible use of times of reduced work volumes due to the coronavirus.\n\nIn addition to general training programs, Symrise usually also trains its employees via international assignments. However, pandemic-related travel restrictions caused these to be postponed in 2021.\n\nAt its own flavorist and perfumer school, Symrise is constantly training experts on raw materials and their applications in the products over a period of around three years and then successfully integrating them into the product development teams. In addition, our employees have diverse opportunities for completing a bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree alongside their work through cooperation agreements with universities, academies and institutes.\n\n## Remuneration and wage agreements\n\nSymrise generally remunerates its employees on the basis of collective wage agreements concluded with the respective labor unions. For non-tariff employees, there is a job grade concept that classifies non-tariff roles and positions in accordance with clear principles and objective criteria. Each initial classification or later reclassification is subject to review by the works council. Through this double-checking, the Group ensures that gender plays no role in determining remuneration.\n\nIn Germany, Symrise takes guidance from the pay increases in the chemical industry. Employees received a 2.0 % increase in pay in July 2021, which was higher than the pay increases negotiated in the collective bargaining process.\n\nSymrise will also give its employees in Germany's collective bargaining sector a share of the company's profits in 2021. If 100 % of EBITDA is achieved, the profit-sharing bonus is \u20ac 600 for full-time employees (with a pro rata share of this awarded to part-time employees). Employee performance should pay off at Symrise. With this profit-sharing scheme, outstanding performance at the German site is being acknowledged. Furthermore, employees covered by collective agreements were granted a special bonus of \u20ac 500 as a result of coronavirus.\n\nA separate Global Performance Bonus Plan that supports reaching company goals by means of variable remuneration geared toward results and performance applies to about 300 managers with global or regional responsibilities. Employees in creative departments are also included in this management and incentive system.",

        "page_content": "## COMPANY DEVELOPMENT AT A GLANCE\n\nIMPORTANT EVENTS\n\nAs part of a strategic realignment, the two segments of Flavor and Nutrition were transformed into one newly structured segment in April 2021 and renamed Taste, Nutrition & Health. This transformation of the previously separate Flavor and Nutrition segments was necessary above all due to the continued focus on the needs of Symrise customers and the resulting customer loyalty. It also reflects the overlap in raw materials, production processes and customers. Technologies as well as product knowledge and expertise are to be combined going forward to ensure optimum service and thus increase customer satisfaction. This is done with the intention of increasing the company's competitiveness and securing and expanding employment in the long term. In this context, the previous year's figures have been summarized in the following paragraphs.\n\nEffective September 20, 2021, Symrise AG was included in the leading German index DAX \u00ae as part of the expansion of the DAX \u00ae from 30 to 40 companies. After 14 years of continuous listing in the MDAX \u00ae , Symrise was promoted to the leading index with a market capitalization of over \u20ac 16 billion.\n\nIn the 2021 fiscal year, the Symrise Group also continued its growth strategy through targeted portfolio management.\n\n- From the Group Management Report and from the Consolidated Financial Statements -\n\n23\n\nECONOMIC REPORT\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to changing consumer behavior and shifts in the portfolio in 2021 as well, with significant increases in Fine Fragrances, Beverages and Pet Food.\n\n## GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE COURSE OF BUSINESS AND ON THE GROUP'S NET ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe Symrise Group generated sales of \u20ac 3,826 million in the 2021 fiscal year. Sales increased 8.7 % in the reporting currency over the previous year. Excluding portfolio effects, organic sales growth amounted to 9.6 %. At a total of \u20ac 814 million, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were significantly higher than the previous year of \u20ac 742 million (EBITDA). This corresponds to a sales margin of 21.3 % (previous year: 21.1 %).\n\nNet profit amounted to \u20ac 375 million and therefore was \u20ac 68 million higher than the figure from the previous year. Earnings per share rose to \u20ac 2.74 (2020: \u20ac 2.27).\n\nGiven this positive development, Symrise AG's Executive Board will, in consultation with the Supervisory Board, propose raising the dividend from \u20ac 0.97 in the previous year to \u20ac 1.02 per share for the 2021 fiscal year at the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2022.\n\n## Achievement of targets in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* Organic growth without Sensient\n\n139",

In light of the good business performance, the sales expectations for the full year were initially raised to over 7 % and then to around 9 %. According to estimates by IAL Consulting, the growth of the market amounted to approximately 4.8 % in 2021 due to the pandemic.\n\nFor 2021, Symrise had expected an EBITDA margin of around 21 % despite slightly rising raw material prices. In the course of the fiscal year, the expectation for the EBITDA margin was increased to over 21 %. Debt, as measured in terms of the key figure of net debt (including provisions for pensions and similar obligations and lease liabilities) to EBITDA, was expected to reach the range of 2.3 to 2.5. The business free cash flow in 2021 was projected to achieve a value of over 14 % in relation to sales.\n\nWith sales growth of 9.6 % (excluding portfolio effects and currency translation effects), Symrise significantly surpassed its sales goal in 2021. The EBITDA margin of 21.3 % is within the expected range for 2021, as is net debt at 2.4 times EBITDA. The business free cash flow as of the reporting date was 12.7 %. Symrise was unable to reach its target due to the cybersecurity attack at the end of 2020, the strong sales growth in the reporting period as well as the expansion of safety stocks at the end of 2021.\n\nTaste, Nutrition & Health segment EBITDA in \u20ac million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DEVELOPMENT IN THE SEGMENTS AND REGIONS\n\n## TASTE, NUTRITION & HEALTH SEGMENT\n\nThe Taste, Nutrition & Health segment saw a normalization of consumer behavior in 2021 due to progress in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Taking into account exchange rate effects, sales in the reporting currency were \u20ac 2,335 million. This corresponds to an increase of 8.5 % and organic growth of 10.6 % compared to the previous year.\n\nThe Food & Beverage division achieved high single to low double-digit percentage sales growth in all regions. An exceptionally strong result was achieved by the Beverages business unit, which benefited from an increase in out-of-home consumption and a resulting rise in demand for beverages. Increased demand for savory products since the start of the pandemic helped this business unit to gain particularly positive momentum. The Sweet business recorded slight sales growth, and the Naturals business unit also contributed to the increase in sales with high single-digit growth.\n\nThe Pet Food business continued its strong growth compared to the already excellent previous year. The development of the Pet Food division benefited from an increasing pet population and consequently a high demand for pet food. The division achieved strong double-digit percentage organic sales growth in all regions.",

Sales remained slightly below the previous year.\n\nThe probiotics business, which includes the majority interest in the Swedish company Probi AB, was unable to maintain the level of the strong previous year and recorded a slight decline in sales.\n\nEBITDA Taste, Nutrition & Health: EBITDA of the Taste, Nutrition & Health segment amounted to \u20ac 531 million in the reporting year, significantly higher than in the previous year (2020: \u20ac 471 million). The EBITDA margin of 22.7 % also exceeded the level of the previous year (2020 EBITDA margin: 21.9 %).\n\n## SCENT & CARE SEGMENT\n\nIn the 2021 fiscal year, the Scent & Care segment generated sales of \u20ac 1,491 million. Compared to the previous year, this represents an increase of 8.9 %. Excluding portfolio and currency translation effects, organic sales growth amounted to 7.9 %. The portfolio effect from the acquisition of Sensient in the last nine months of the 2021 fiscal year amounted to \u20ac 40.9 million.\n\nThe Fragrance activities recorded solid single-digit percentage organic growth with sales increases in all regions and business units. The Fragrance division benefited in particular from strong demand in the Fine Fragrances business unit. Driven by the resumption of international travel on the one hand\n\nand the normalization of consumer demand following the end of exit restrictions on the other, demand in this area recovered. The Consumer Fragrance and Oral Care business units also performed well and increased sales again compared to the exceptionally high levels of the previous year. Both areas showed organic growth in the single-digit percentage range.\n\nStrong demand for fragrances and menthols led to a good sales performance in the Aroma Molecules division with growth in the high single digits. The highest growth rates were achieved in the North America and Asia/Pacific regions with organic growth in the double-digit percentage. The Menthols business unit achieved double-digit percentage growth due to continued robust demand and successful capacity expansions.\n\nThe Cosmetic Ingredients division also benefited from increased travel activity and demand for high-quality cosmetic products. The strong demand for sun protection products and products with active cosmetic ingredients led to high organic growth in the double-digit percentage range. All regions developed dynamically with double-digit percentage sales growth.\n\nEBITDA Scent & Care: Scent & Care generated an EBITDA that was 4.1 % higher than in the previous year with \u20ac 283 million in 2021 (2020: \u20ac 272 million). The EBITDA margin therefore amounted to 19.0 %, compared to 19.8 % in 2021.",

In North America, organic sales growth was 8.5 %. The Asia/Pacific region achieved high organic sales growth of 10.3 % compared to the previous year. Sales development in Latin America was dynamic and recorded an increase of 13.5 % compared to the previous year.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIAL LINE ITEMS IN THE INCOME STATEMENT\n\nOn the whole, earnings performance in the 2021 fiscal year was good in the second year of the pandemic. The cost of goods sold increased slightly more than proportionately to sales since both raw material and manufacturing costs rose. The gross margin in the reporting year was 38.7 %, which puts it 0.8 percentage points below the previous year's level (39.5 %). The share of selling and marketing expenses in Group sales amounted to 14.7 % after 15.2 % in the previous year. The R & D rate\n\namounted to 5.8 % (previous year: 6.0 %) of sales. The development of the sales and R & D costs compared to the previous year's level is mostly due to reduced activities such as travel, trade shows, conferences, etc. as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Administration expenses as a share of Group sales remained stable at 5.8 %.\n\nThe increase in other operating income is mainly attributable to the positive one-time effect of \u20ac 12.5 million from the sale of the Color business and the recognition of negative goodwill of \u20ac 20.8 million from the purchase price allocation of the Sensient business combination.\n\nFurthermore, one-time costs in connection with the acquisition and disposal of companies or parts of companies in the amount of \u20ac 8.7 million were incurred in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nAt 21.3 %, the EBITDA margin was slightly higher than the previous year's value of 21.1 %.",

The Group remains confident that it will continue to grow at a faster pace than the relevant market. The forecast long-term growth according to IAL Consultants is around 3 to 4 % worldwide. For the Group, expected longterm growth of 5 to 7 % (CAGR) remains unchanged and is also anticipated to be achieved in 2022.\n\nThe disciplined cost management and focus on high-margin business will be continued to further increase earnings. This includes initiatives to reduce the complexity of processes and workflows and the development of innovative, sustainable products and technologies. Assuming a noticeable increase in raw material costs, the Group expects an EBITDA margin of approximately 21 % in 2022. The ratio of net debt (including provisions for pensions and similar obligations as well as lease liabilities) to EBITDA(N) should be between 2.5 and 2.7 at the end of 2022.

A proven strategy will be used to achieve the goals set. The three pillars of the strategy remain unchanged. They stand for the continued improvement of the competitive position and the sustainable expansion of the business:\n\n- Growth: Close cooperation with select customers, particularly as a way to further expand the share of sales in emerging markets.\n- Efficiency: The continuous improvement of processes and the expansion of backward integration with renewable raw materials.\n- Portfolio: Tapping into new markets and market segments beyond the traditional business with flavors and fragrances.\n\nSymrise aims to grow primarily organically. Where it is sensible and creates added value, the Group will make acquisitions or forge strategic alliances to ensure access to new technologies, new markets and customers or ensure that it can obtain sustainable, renewable raw materials.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Corporate Governance Statement has been made available on the Symrise AG website at: https://www.symrise.com/ corporate-governance-statement .",
