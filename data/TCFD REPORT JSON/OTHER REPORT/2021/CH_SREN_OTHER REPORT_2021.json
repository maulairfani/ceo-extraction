Even before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the COVID-19 pandemic has already tested the resilience of societies, companies and every one of us for two years.\n\nWhile the global economy rebounded in 2021 from lockdown lows, growth remains uneven across countries. Inflation is rising to levels not seen in years. This is leading some of the major central banks to start normalising their extremely accommodative monetary policies and reining in asset purchase programmes that have helped inflate asset prices since the global financial crisis.\n\nAt the same time, extreme weather events continue to wreak havoc in many areas around the world. Global insured losses from natural catastrophes have been rising at\n\nOur focus on executing the Group strategy has remained relentless.'\n\n5-7% per year over the recent decades, propelled by wealth accumulation and urban sprawl into disaster-prone areas at a time when climate change is making smaller extreme-weather events - so called 'secondary perils' such as floods or wildfires - more frequent. 2021 was the fourthcostliest year for the insurance industry in terms of natural catastrophes, nearly 50% above the decennial average, and the protection gap remains vast, with most economic losses uninsured.\n\nFrom pandemics to natural disasters, Swiss Re was designed to withstand large-risk events, to provide cover and share knowledge, thus contributing to a more resilient world. In 2021, as every year since Swiss Re's foundation in 1863, we provided coverage to support the business of our clients. We paid out COVID-19-related claims of USD 2.0 billion, with the vast majority going to tens of thousands of deceased persons' family members. At the same time, our property and casualty businesses successfully absorbed USD 2.4 billion in natural catastrophe claims.\n\nWe are pleased that despite these claims, Swiss Re's businesses improved their performance, delivering a Group net income of USD 1.4 billion for the year. This is important not just for the shareholders, but also because we can only contribute to global resilience if Swiss Re itself remains resilient. Excluding COVID-19 losses, Group net income increased 39% to USD 3.0 billion, with a return on equity (ROE) of 11.6%.\n\nOur focus on executing the Group strategy has remained relentless. Our strong emphasis on portfolio quality in the hardening property and casualty market is bearing fruit for Reinsurance. We turned Corporate Solutions into a business that not only delivers attractive profitability but also acts as a gateway for the Group to partnerships with corporate clients. We are investing into the digital transformation of Swiss Re, while maintaining cost discipline. And we are developing promising future business ventures by focusing on risk insights and risk partnerships to augment our core risk transfer business. You can find more information on all three pillars of our strategy in the dedicated chapters of the 2021 Business Report.\n\nAll our businesses continued to grow, with net premiums earned and fee income for the Group increasing by 4.8% compared with the previous year to USD 42.7 billion. We achieved a strong return on investment of 3.2%, despite the current low-yield environment. The Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio was at 223% as of 1 January 2022 - well within the target range of 200-250%. The Group's very strong capital position and positive business outlook led the Board of Directors to propose a stable dividend of CHF 5.90 per share at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.",

        "page_content": "In the natural catastrophe as well as other markets, we were ahead of the curve on many underwriting decisions, and the results speak for themselves.'\n\n## Performance of the businesses\n\nLet us now turn to the 2021 results of the individual businesses. Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re) reported a net income of USD 2.1 billion for the year, compared with a net loss of USD 247 million in 2020, thanks to the improved portfolio quality, materially diminished COVID-19 impacts as well as strong investment results.\n\nThis strong performance was achieved as the business absorbed large natural catastrophe claims and reflects the benefits of the deep knowledge and proprietary models. We build on 30 years of continuous advancements on the back of dedicated research and claims data experience to capture the present-day risk landscape and climate trends. This enables highly bespoke underwriting and risk-taking. We are a leading reinsurer for natural catastrophes and this line of business has been profitable over the past decade, with a combined ratio around 75%, despite its inherent volatility and rising industry losses.\n\nIn the natural catastrophe as well as other markets, we were ahead of the curve on many underwriting decisions, and the results speak for themselves. Portfolio actions, price increases as well as tightened terms and conditions have improved P&C Re's normalised1 combined ratio to 94.7%, in line with the target of less than 95% for the year. This is an improvement of 5 percentage points since 2018, translating into about USD 1 billion in additional annual pre-tax underwriting profits for the business.\n\nThe January 2022 renewals were another success for P&C Re, as we delivered a 6% volume increase compared with the business that was up for renewal. Property and specialty lines saw particularly strong\n\ngrowth, with natural catastrophe-related premium volume up by 24%. P&C Re achieved a price increase of 4% in this renewal round. This fully offset more conservative loss assumptions, which reflect a prudent view on inflation and other changes in exposure.\n\nLife & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) remained impacted by significant COVID-19 claims and reported a net loss of USD 523 million for 2021, down from a net income of USD 71 million in 2020. This reflected significantly higher mortality from COVID-19 around the world, with the total number of deaths in 2021 at almost double the 2020 level, according to the official WHO data. Furthermore, the US experienced heightened excess mortality2 among the working-age population, which is more likely to have life insurance, in the second half of 2021 as the Delta variant spread.\n\nExcluding COVID-19 losses, L&H Re improved its net income by 26% to USD 1.1 billion in 2021. This was driven by the strong underwriting performance across all regions, favourable investment results and positive one-off effects from in-force management actions.\n\nCorporate Solutions over-delivered on its business turnaround objectives and posted net income of USD 578 million in 2021, compared with a net loss of USD 467 million in 2020. Its combined ratio improved to 90.6%, with the normalised combined ratio coming in at 95.0% and surpassing the target of less than 97% by a wide margin. The Business Unit achieved risk-adjusted price increases of 12%3 for the year in the context of the continued focus on underwriting quality and selective new business growth.\n\n- 1 Normalised combined ratio assumes average large natural catastrophe loss burden and excludes prior-year reserve development as well as the COVID-19 impact.\n- 2 Excess mortality is an indicator of deaths from all causes that are above what one would have expected under normal conditions.\n- 3   Risk-adjusted price increases for Corporate Solutions in 2021 exclude elipsLife.",

Gross premiums written for the core business rose by 95% from the previous year to USD 723 million, with good contributions across all markets and particularly from the property and casualty business in the EMEA region, which was launched in 2020. Having grown dynamically since its inception, iptiQ is on track to become a leading player in its field, and we continue to invest in growing this business.\n\n## Progress on environmental, social and governance topics\n\nThe Group pushed ahead towards reaching net-zero emissions from own operations by 2030 and from investment and underwriting portfolios by 2050. To help curb operational emissions, as of 2021 Swiss Re stepped up its internal carbon levy to USD 100 per tonne and will gradually increase it to USD 200 by 2030. We are actively reducing emissions, for example from flights, but the only way to reach net zero is to balance the unavoidable emissions with an equivalent amount of negative emissions. While carbon removal technologies are still evolving, we are pleased that we were already able to compensate 35% of residual emissions in this way in 2021.\n\nSwiss Re's Asset Management is pursuing a 35% reduction in carbon intensity of its listed equity and corporate bond portfolio by 2025 and has achieved a decrease of 34% since 2018. On the underwriting side, tightened policies for providing re/insurance support to businesses with thermal coal, oil and gas exposure corroborate the firm's push for making a real-world impact in driving sustainable business practices. And we\n\nengage in an active dialogue with all industries to encourage the transition, as well as regularly review and adapt our policies as necessary and to the extent possible.\n\nAmong social issues, we have been particularly focused on supporting efforts to improve access to healthcare and financial protection. To enable the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines across the globe, Swiss Re is one of several leading insurers supporting the COVAX vaccine procurement facility by providing insurance cover for 21 self-paying countries participating in the programme. Separately, in 2021 we launched the Swiss Re Life and Health Sustainability Initiative, which aims to improve access, affordability and availability of life and health insurance products to populations that have been traditionally underserved by our industry.\n\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) also remains at the top of our agenda. At Swiss Re, we embrace and build a diverse workforce that brings together the best of multiple generations, cultures, skillsets and thinking. We firmly believe that an inclusive\n\nculture is key to our business success. Our approach spans all aspects of DEI: from Gender, LGBTI+ and Race & Ethnicity to Inclusive Leadership & Culture and Mental Health. The Group Executive Committee members have committed to increasing the number of employees at Swiss Re from underrepresented groups, addressing equal pay issues and driving more DEI activities in their respective business units and functions. For the Board of Directors, we are removing the unwritten age limit of 70 years for board members to avoid age discrimination and instead propose to introduce a tenure limit of 12 years. Furthermore, gender diversity is of utmost importance for the composition of the Board of Directors, and we are committed to reach female representation at the board level of 30% or more by the annual shareholder meeting in 2023.\n\nYou can find more information about these and other initiatives in the 2021 Sustainability Report.\n\nThe Group pushed ahead towards reaching net-zero emissions from own operations by 2030 and from investment and underwriting portfolios by 2050.'",

With regards to the pandemic, the emergence of the Omicron variant at the end of 2021 has led to yet another surge in the number of new COVID-19 cases around the world. And despite the apparently lower fatality rates associated with Omicron, the higher infectivity of this variant may still result in excess mortality remaining elevated. We have already included assumptions for 2022 COVID-19 mortality claims in our Group SST ratio calculations as of 1 January 2022.\n\nOn the geopolitical front, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has created tectonic shifts in the entire macro environment believed impossible until very recently. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by this egregious conflict. We continue to carefully monitor the situation and abide by applicable sanctions regimes.\n\nWith regard to the macroeconomic outlook, we remain vigilant to the effects of resurgent inflation and tightening monetary conditions. Swiss Re economists expect inflation to increase even further and remain very elevated in the US and Europe throughout 2022 and likely stay structurally higher in the longer term versus the last decade. Consumer price inflation impacts mainly business lines such as property and specialty re/insurance, where we can adjust prices quickly to reflect new realities. We did so in 2021 and again at the January 2022 renewals.\n\nCasualty re/insurance on the other hand, is less affected by consumer price inflation, but is much more exposed to social inflation the increase in legal claims above normal economic trends, which is partly being driven by the emergence of a third-party litigation finance industry. We are concerned that third-party litigation finance is an expensive and blunt tool to enable legal disputes, with potentially harmful economic and ethical consequences. Greater protection for consumers is required, as well as better regulation of the industry and more transparency about the involvement of third-party litigation finance in a case. However, social inflation is a known phenomenon and one that we have been incorporating to the extent possible into our reserving and pricing assumptions for several years now and will continue to do so.",

Its risk transfer capacity is supported by the ability to place risks in the capital markets via the Alternative Capital Partners unit. Further, Swiss Re offers products that de-risk industries such as renewable energy, providing the risk transfer necessary for participants in these industries to access financing and pursue projects.\n\n## Consultation and engagement\n\nAs a global leader in the insurance industry, Swiss Re has a role in supporting other organisations in their efforts to reduce global warming and climate change.\n\nTo this end, Swiss Re is a member of the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance and Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance. In 2021, Swiss Re also joined the Taskforce on Nature-related\n\nrising property values, urbanisation in exposed areas and changing claims behaviour. Climate change does, however, play a significant role in the increasing severity and frequency of secondary perils, such as floods and wildfires.\n\nFinancial resilience is being tested by climate change as property insurance pricing is adjusted upwards to accommodate increasing losses, thereby making insurance protection less affordable. Furthermore, the impact of climate change on human life and health needs to be further understood in order to develop adequate insurance products and close protection gaps.\n\n## The opportunity\n\nCurrently, the majority of climate-related economic losses are uninsured, presenting a significant opportunity for insurers to close\n\nFinancial Disclosures to commit to better and more transparent reporting on nature-related risks.\n\n## Underwriting\n\nSwiss Re's underwriting for climate risks remains robust. The work is underpinned by its global Catastrophe Perils (Cat Perils) team, which comprises more than 50 experts. The team develops Swiss Re's proprietary models for natural catastrophe risks worldwide. These models reflect current and evolving risk drivers such as climate change, urbanisation and various socio-economic trends.\n\nThe Cat Perils team provides more than 190 models across a range of perils, including key exposures such as tropical cyclones in Northern America, winter storms in Europe or earthquakes in Japan. Their work also covers emerging\n\nthis important protection gap. Reinsurers play a key role in providing risk transfer capacity, risk knowledge and long-term investment.\n\nIn recent years, governments have been increasingly entering into public-private partnerships to develop disaster financing solutions for climate risks. This work is continuing to grow, particularly in emerging markets. In addition, there is the opportunity to expand the available insurance capacity via innovative risk transfer transactions with the capital markets.\n\nAs large asset holders, re/insurers can also contribute to climate change mitigation through responsible investing. Swiss Re has already established an ESG investment policy, which includes measures to reduce the carbon impact of our investment portfolio.\n\nsecondary perils such as river flooding in China or hailstorms in Europe.\n\nSwiss Re's models are an important steering tool for property natural catastrophe underwriting. They enable Swiss Re to benchmark business opportunities against profitability hurdles, to determine risk appetite and to assess the level of capital required to support the global property portfolio.\n\nSwiss Re's models ensure underwriters globally have the same knowledge basis for assessing risks, whether they are underwriting risks for smaller clients in the US or working with a global broker in EMEA. This consistency builds confidence in both the accuracy of Swiss Re's costing and the comparison of actual loss experience to modelled and expected losses.",

The increase in remote working via less secure private networks has made people and organisations more vulnerable to opportunistic attacks. Cyber risks are by now ubiquitous and affect almost all areas of our lives and working environments.\n\n## The risk\n\nBusinesses, individuals and all kinds of organisations face cyber risks in a number of ways, from classical data privacy breaches to the interruption of operations or extortion.\n\nA cyber attack on critical infrastructure, for example, could pose a serious threat to society.\n\nCyber insurance has a significant potential for risk accumulation and its impact could spread across an insurer's portfolio. It is also important for insurers to be aware of issues such as 'silent-cyber', where cyber risks may be covered in insurance policies without specific wordings to that effect.\n\n## The opportunity\n\nPremiums for cyber insurance increased from USD 5.5 billion in 2020 to USD 8 billion in 2021 and continue to grow at a fast pace.\n\nAs cyber exposure evolves, Swiss Re continuously increases its risk knowledge and data capabilities in order to better understand and model the risks. This helps us to develop the best insurance and reinsurance products for our clients.\n\n## Managing cyber risks\n\nAs cyber threats are unlikely to abate in the foreseeable future, organisations must allocate sufficient resources to training their people and enhancing cyber security processes, policies and technology. Furthermore, governments and regulators need to set up the right framework for economies and societies to become more resilient against cyber threats.\n\nInsurers can support policyholders with tailored risk management services and by encouraging good risk management practices.\n\nSwiss Re is able to respond quickly to developments in the cyber insurance space, for example, by adjusting underwriting guidelines or costing parameters to account for changes in the risk landscape.\n\nGiven the importance of this risk class, Swiss Re has a dedicated Cyber Centre of Competence responsible for modelling and overseeing cyber risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPremiums for cyber insurance grew to USD 8 billion in 2021 from USD 5.5 billion in 2020\n\nThe centre's team uses two types of risk models: Probabilistic models determine the expected frequencies with which certain levels of loss might hit our portfolio. Deterministic tools, our second approach, are scenario-based, assessing the potential impact of single large events, such as major cyber attacks threatening society at large.\n\nThis team is Swiss Re's guardian for underwriting cyber risks, overseeing steering capacity, costing, governing certain exclusions and ensuring a thorough understanding of accumulation in the portfolio. They also identify and ring-fence 'silent cyber' risks, ensuring that cyber-induced losses in the traditional lines of business are kept under control.\n\nTo further ensure a solid data-led underwriting, the Cyber Centre of Competence is developing the 'Cyber Data Ocean', a proprietary repository for information on cyber incidents, risk drivers and cyber threat intelligence.",

For example, the unpredictability of the virus, the enforced isolation and the resulting financial instability have had adverse impacts on people's physical and mental health.\n\nAccording to a WHO survey from 2020, more than half of 163 countries surveyed have experienced disrupted health services due to COVID-19 as they switched to crisis mode.\n\n## The risk\n\nThe reduction in health services is potentially dangerous for individuals. With fewer people actively seeking help for critical medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular emergencies and cancer treatment, there is a risk that health care, morbidity and mortality costs could increase in the future.\n\n## The opportunity\n\nMental health is an excellent example of how life and health insurance can go beyond covering the costs of treatments by offering policyholders access to preventative solutions, including minimally disruptive, low-cost interventions. These types of services can both offset and mitigate higher claims. In 2021, for example, Swiss Re developed solutions specifically for mental health. This included a partnership with mental health platform Wysa to develop an app that includes improved monitoring of mental health and supports insurers in their goal of improving products and the consumer experience.\n\nSwiss Re is seeing opportunities to deploy its knowledge on lifestyle factors, pandemic costs and public-private partnerships directly to its clients. This work includes updating Life Guide, Swiss Re's own life and health underwriting manual, so that clients can incorporate COVID-19-specific factors as well as lifestyle factors into their underwriting.\n\nOne area of concern is the rise in anxiety and depression that is strongly associated with the pandemic. This has been observed especially among the younger population, with several studies showing clear agedependent differences in stress and depression rates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## L&H underwriting innovation\n\nSwiss Re is well-equipped to respond to evolving health trends. L&H Underwriting Research and Development is a global team of underwriters, medical officers and research analysts that helps Swiss Re and its clients to address developments.\n\nThe team has three priorities: carrying out research and development to drive growth and protect against risk, developing underwriting tools and maintaining underwriting standards and governance.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the team's research on the virus' impact on L&H underwriting meant that Swiss Re was the first re/insurer to provide underwriting guidance on this issue.\n\nOne of the team's chief tasks is to maintain the medical underwriting guidelines in Life Guide. For example, in 2021, the team implemented a new 'cardiometabolic calculator', which incorporates Swiss Re's research around mental well-being, physical activity, environment, sleep, nutrition and substance use into our underwriting guidelines.\n\nOne important area for the team is how to make underwriting more precise, personalised and forward-looking. This includes investigating how data might be used to encourage policyholders to adopt healthier lifestyle habits.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Social inflation\n\n## The issue\n\nThe term social inflation refers to an increase in litigation, plaintiff-friendly judgements and higher jury awards. This is resulting in legal compensation costs over and above basic economic trends. Social inflation is driven by non-economic factors which include the increasing sophistication of plaintiff attorneys, negative sentiment towards corporations and an increased propensity to sue. Its effects are most strongly felt in the US due to a rise in verdicts where settlements exceed USD 10 million. These are mostly driven by outsized awards for non-economic damages.\n\n## The risk\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis is likely to amplify rather than alleviate contributing societal factors, such as economic, educational and health inequality. This could lead to a hardening of public sentiment and attitudes towards insurers' interpretation of coverage levels and limits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWithout a broader policy reset to reduce inequality, social inflation is here to stay.'\n\nFurther, the rising use of litigation financing, where legal costs are funded by a third party in exchange for a portion of the awards, could impact future claims trends by contributing to an increase in court cases - especially class actions. Of the USD 17 billion investment into litigation funding globally in 2020, more than half was deployed in the US, according to a recent Swiss Re Institute study. Currently, major risks such as the increasing and long-term use of opioids and talcum powder are being litigated in US courts. Without a broader policy reset to reduce inequality, social inflation is here to stay.\n\n## The opportunity\n\nThe costs of social inflation are ultimately borne by consumers through higher prices for goods that reflect the higher costs of litigation and insurance. There is an opportunity for governments to create positive change for society, such as through the revision of legislation to create more predictable trials or through measures to reduce social, educational and health inequality.\n\nSwiss Re has taken a cautious stance by reducing exposure to social inflation over the past two years and continues to tightly manage it.\n\n## Understanding new societal risks\n\nUnderstanding the factors that contribute to social inflation will provide corporations and insurers with the skill set to better predict potential risks and losses that could result from certain claims and suits.\n\nStandardised data sets on the drivers of this issue are not yet available. Swiss Re's Casualty Research and Development team is developing techniques to monitor trends and to anticipate the next wave of social inflation. For example, they have analysed the increase in legal companies' use of advertising and how this is helping them to recruit plaintiffs for class actions.\n\nThe team comprises 22 members in Zurich, Bangalore and Armonk. With their expertise in quantitative sciences, they build forwardlooking risk models in areas where historical data is difficult to find or simply non-existent - such as trends connected to social behaviours and legal changes.\n\nThe rapid rise in social inflation has been the team's biggest challenge over the past years. They have contributed to advancing the development of forward-looking underwriting, managing liability exposure and strengthening the detection capabilities of early warning signals.\n\nFurthermore, Swiss Re Institute recently published a research paper, 'US litigation funding and social inflation: the rising costs of legal liability', which explores how litigation funding is contributing to social inflation in the US by incentivising litigants to initiate and prolong lawsuits.\n\nHigher claims costs drive up insurance premiums, reduce the availability of liability cover and lead to higher uninsured legal liability risks for US businesses. These costs are ultimately paid by consumers.",

Events like this can impact life insurers, who carry the risk on life insurance policies. Risk transfer through reinsurance is an important way of managing these peak risks.\n\nSource: Center for Disease Control and Prevention, data until 5 June 2021 as of 22 July 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk transfer is at the heart of all Swiss Re businesses, from Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions to Swiss Re's digital white-labelling platform iptiQ.\n\nRisk transfer begins when someone has something valuable that they cannot afford to lose. This could be tangible, such as a house, a car, or even a mobile phone. Life insurance serves the need for people to ensure the ongoing financial well-being of their family should they pass away, or become ill or unable to work.\n\nThe global insurance industry has grown from this simple need for people to protect things that are of value to them.\n\nFor nearly 160 years, Swiss Re has been successfully supporting the insurance industry. From cyber attacks to natural\n\ncatastrophes, pandemics and many other risks, clients can rely on Swiss Re to assist them in times of crisis.\n\nSwiss Re's business model works because the company has built up the knowledge and financial strength to understand and absorb the costs of peak risks.

This comprised a P&C Re net profit of USD 2.1 billion, which offset L&H Re's net loss of USD 523 million as the segment was impacted by high COVID-19 claims.\n\nThese results are testament to the strength of Swiss Re's diversified business model. A similar proof of the value of diversification occurred in 2017, when L&H Re's USD 1.1 billion in net income helped to offset the USD 413 million loss in P&C Re, caused by losses from the Harvey, Irma and Maria trio of hurricanes.\n\nThat year, the Group absorbed the P&C natural catastrophe losses for the year and delivered on its commitment to return USD 2.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and a share buyback.\n\n## 2021: Proof of concept for Reinsurance\n\nIn a year dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Swiss Re's Reinsurance provided strong support for clients. In 2021, Reinsurance served its clients with USD 28.4 billion in claims support and reserves for future expected claims. In 2021, Reinsurance set aside almost USD 2 billion in mortality claims and reserves related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 impact is significant, it represents an additional claims burden of only 7% of Reinsurance's total claims support for clients for the year.\n\nIn fact, Swiss Re's business is designed to withstand pandemics. Since 2006, Swiss Re has been using its own pandemic model to estimate the potential impact on our portfolios from lethal pandemics and inform key business decisions, such as setting risk appetite, pricing for pandemic risk and managing capital. The pandemic model is constantly improved and updated, as new knowledge emerges, and is regularly audited.\n\nFurther, peak events such as COVID-19 strengthen ties to clients, as Swiss Re delivers not only claims support, but valuable research and technical knowledge.\n\n## Supporting a trillion-dollar global market\n\nThe scale of the global insurance industry is vast. In 2021 alone, global insurance premiums reached USD 7 trillion. The life insurance industry's part of that pool was USD 3.1 trillion.\n\nThe opportunities for growth are attractive. In 2021, the global primary life market grew by 5% to a total of USD 3.1 trillion. Swiss Re Institute forecasts continuing growth of 3% in 2022 and 2023 for primary life business.\n\nLife reinsurance premiums, which are currently estimated at USD 110 billion globally, are forecast to have similar growth rates.\n\nAn important factor behind the growth in reinsurance premium is the increasing demand for large transactions, where insurance clients require a tailor-made reinsurance solution for a specific issue.\n\nThis type of reinsurance plays directly to Swiss Re's strengths of innovation combined with in-depth knowledge of our clients' needs built up over a long-term relationship.\n\nUSD 3.1 tr\n\nGlobal life premiums in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSwiss Re Institute's projected growth rate for life insurance in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSwiss Re's business is designed to withstand large shocks such as pandemics and natural catastrophes.'",

        "page_content": "## Beyond 'insurance for insurers'\n\nReinsurance's core function is to act as an 'insurer for insurers'. However, this is only one part of the value for clients. Swiss Re's Reinsurance Business Unit has two further strategic pillars that complement the core traditional risk transfer business.\n\nThe first pillar, 'Transactions', provides tailored reinsurance transactions to solve a client's specific strategic need. The 'Solutions' pillar provides clients with access to new technologies, products and ideas to grow their business or improve profitability. Together, these two additional pillars open up important new business opportunities for Swiss Re.\n\n## Tailored transactions\n\nTailored reinsurance covers are designed to transfer risk in a way that helps a client realise a specific strategic goal. Although tailored reinsurance covers can be complex, they can make all the difference for the underlying financial goals of the client.\n\nFirstly, a client may have a very specialised type of business that requires equally specialised protection. For example, in 2021, Swiss Re structured a longevity deal for an\n\n## Vita: ILS and risk transfer\n\nInsurance-linked securities (ILS) transfer insurance-related risks to the capital markets. Investors in these securities usually receive an attractive fixed interest rate, and in return, the funds they pay can be used to pay out an underlying reinsurance contract if and when it is needed. This effectively allows an insurance or reinsurance company to tap into the additional risk capacity offered by capital markets.\n\nILS is most well known for catastrophe bonds, where re/insurers share the risks of natural catastrophes. Typically, under such agreements, if a hurricane or earthquake of a defined strength occurs in a certain\n\ninsurer covering the annual pension payments for a large UK manufacturer. This specialised reinsurance agreement covers the insurer against the risk that people invested in the pension fund live longer than what is budgeted for.\n\nAnother reason to use a tailored risk transfer arrangement is to unlock statutory capital. In 2021, Swiss Re worked with a US life insurer to develop a strategic, tailored reinsurance agreement covering term life insurance policies issued over the past 12 years. This reserve transaction unlocked USD 1 billion of statutory capital for the client.\n\nTailored reinsurance covers helped several clients in 2021 in the wake of man-made disasters and natural catastrophes, where Swiss Re's expertise can ensure the long-term stability of the client's capital adequacy following large payouts.\n\ngeographical region, the bond is triggered, and the funds can be used to pay the reinsurance obligations stipulated in the contract.\n\nSince 1997, the catastrophe bond market has proven very attractive for both investors and re/insurers. In fact, 2021 saw a record issuance of USD 12.8 billion in cat bonds to the world market.\n\nAlthough small, the Life ILS market is an innovative way for life reinsurers to transfer peak risks to the capital markets. Often, life risks can be combined with other risks to make a catastrophe bond more diversified.\n\nSwiss Re also helps clients with so-called 'long-tail business', for example, where a casualty insurer has built up a portfolio covering claims decades into the past. This type of insurance business can be capital intensive to maintain and requires significant operational resources. Swiss Re's tailored reinsurance helps clients to better structure their legacy portfolios and make the best possible use of their capital and operations.\n\nSwiss Re's Reinsurance Business Unit completed a record number of  tailored reinsurance covers in 2021. By providing this highly specialised expertise, and sharing in the risk, tailored transactions give Swiss Re a significant market advantage.\n\n## 'Solutions': Technology and expertise\n\nReinsurance is also a great source of risk knowledge for insurers.\n\nFor example, Swiss Re is transforming the life insurance business through its automated underwriting solutions. Its suite of automated underwriting tools creates a much more streamlined onboarding process for life insurance customers. This can cut costs for insurers by reducing their workload. It can also grow their business by making life insurance more accessible for new customers.\n\nSwiss Re's original Vita programme, launched in 2003, was the pioneer for Life ILS globally.\n\nIn 2021, Swiss Re issued Vita VI. This bond gives Swiss Re USD 120 million of extreme mortality protection against losses in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US, running from 2021 until the end of 2025. Although COVID-19 deaths are excluded in 2021, the bond will cover deaths from COVID-19 as of 2022.",

However, there are applicants who will not be accepted through this simplified process because they have certain medical conditions.\n\nSmart Access is a solution that evaluates these more complex cases in a cost-effective manner. The application builds on Magnum to further assess an application at the point of sale. Smart Access can assess any insurance request by asking the customer basic questions about their condition.",

The images on these pages show satellite data captured by Swiss Re's partner ICEYE. This highly granular flood data provided the insights for Swiss Re's experts to deliver an initial risk assessment for clients just three days after the start of the flooding.\n\nSource: ICEYE, Google Maps\n\nSwiss Re's risk insights fuel the models and tools that underwriters use to assess risk, write profitable business and enable cutting-edge, innovative risk solutions, thereby creating value for our shareholders, clients and society.\n\nThe following pages demonstrate Swiss Re's risk insights in action. The journey starts with a suitcase-sized satellite delivering climate data that can be overlaid onto Swiss Re's insurance portfolios.\n\nBy combining this data with the latest portfolio analytics, Swiss Re's teams have been able to drastically cut the time needed to analyse major flood claims from months to only a few days.\n\nThe ability to price risk makes Swiss Re a valuable knowledge partner for governments and corporations as they respond to issues such as climate change or pandemics.\n\nThe work in this area goes beyond risk transfer. Swiss Re is a thought leader in the discussion around how to mitigate the impact of risk, protecting insured assets from damage through cost-effective measures.\n\nSwiss Re's risk insights take the business model beyond conventional reinsurance into new products, services and even entirely new models for risk business.\n\nThis work is opening up new solutions, partnerships and business opportunities to monetise risk knowledge.",

Given the complexity and size of the modern global risk pool, a high-tech approach to claims and underwriting is essential for the future of the insurance industry.\n\nOrbiting 500 kilometres above the earth's surface, Swiss Re's partner ICEYE, a Finnish microsatellite manufacturer, has a fleet of suitcase-sized satellites collecting real-time data on the behaviour of water and the earth's surface.\n\nUsing advanced radar-based technology, these satellites can peer through cloud cover, volcanic ash and even the most violent of hurricanes to measure how floods and other natural catastrophes are impacting specific regions as they occur.\n\nThe data-driven revolution is already yielding results for Swiss Re's clients. In March 2021, for example, Swiss Re used satellite images of large-scale flooding in eastern Australia to provide clients with a damage assessment of the emergency. This work combined satellite data analysis of the depth of the flood water with an in-depth portfolio analysis of the insured risks in the affected area.\n\nWithout needing to access the flood region, Swiss Re's experts could accurately calculate the impact across clients' portfolios. This analysis took three days. Previously, the process would have taken months, with experts needing to first gain access to the region before conducting lengthy assessment processes.\n\nICEYE is just one cutting-edge data partner working with Swiss Re to develop new products and services. For example, together with Dutch satellite data provider, VanderSat, Swiss Re has developed drought covers based on satellite measurements of soil moisture. Another initiative includes livestock protection based on publicly available satellite data in Kenya.\n\n## CatNet\u00ae and climate solutions\n\nSwiss Re's flagship underwriting platform CatNet\u00ae is the backbone of its natural catastrophe risk business. This platform is an online atlas that allows insurance experts to understand exposure to a variety of natural catastrophe hazards anywhere in the world.\n\nIn 2021, CatNet\u00ae was upgraded to provide even more accurate real-time insights into natural catastrophe risks such as floods, storms and earthquakes.\n\nWith the latest upgrades to CatNet\u00ae Premium, clients can upload 10 000 single locations to give them a customised view of their global portfolios. This makes it one of the richest and most versatile climate risk insight platforms in the insurance industry.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The tool combines forwardlooking climate data with known risk zones to create a high-resolution assessment of climate risk on a company's assets. Advice on mitigation techniques and risk transfer options are offered as part of the Climate Risk Score solutions suite.\n\n## Mitigation as a risk service\n\nIn recent years, many governments and their agencies have drawn on Swiss Re's risk knowledge to better prepare for disasters and develop strategies to minimise the impact of natural catastrophes.\n\nThis work has a rich history beginning with the ground-breaking 'Economics of Climate Adaptation' methodology from 2009, which laid out an approach for calculating the cost efficiency of climate mitigation measures.\n\nIn 2021, Swiss Re could draw on this experience to support the mitigation of bushfire losses for AusNet Services, which operates electricity networks in some of the most bushfire-prone areas of Australia.\n\nThe energy and utilities sector is highly exposed to wildfire losses. In one case, a Californian energy company was driven into bankruptcy following more than USD 15 billion of losses resulting from wildfire liability claims.\n\nAfter the Australian bushfires in the summers of 2019 and 2020, AusNet wanted to better understand the key risk drivers of bushfire, including the impact of climate change on this peril.\n\nSwiss Re's team drew on its risk insights from related work in California as well as its expertise on the climate science behind increasing wildfire risks.\n\nSwiss Re recommended a host of mitigation measures, as well as novel risk transfer possibilities for AusNet to explore, particularly around the latest technologies such as drone and satellite imagery, as well as making use of insurance-linked securities.\n\n## Stronger business\n\nA high-tech, data-driven and scientific approach to claims and underwriting is critical for the future of the insurance industry. This is especially so in areas such as urbanisation\n\nor changing social liability trends where historical data may not give an accurate picture of the current vulnerability of a certain risk.\n\nAs a result, Swiss Re's underwriting teams continue to push for rich data sources that can improve their risk knowledge. In many cases, the teams need to think outside of the box. Swiss Re's Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Index, for example, maps the economic decline of reduced biodiversity. This data now feeds directly into CatNet\u00ae.\n\nSwiss Re's Casualty Research and Development team have also been tracking the spend of US law firms and incorporating this data into forward-looking casualty models for liability business.\n\nWhether powered by a suitcase-sized satellite or via public data sources, Swiss Re's risk insights keep us at the forefront of the re/insurance industry, driving innovation and supporting underwriting across Swiss Re's entire portfolio.",

Swiss Re Institute regularly examines the underwriting approach to climate-related risks. In 2021, the analysis was positive for this business segment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSwiss Re Institute's work centred on assessing the so-called technical profitability of the business. In simple terms, this is whether the pricing for a portfolio of risks is enough to cover the claims, capital costs and operating expenses that come from the business.\n\nThe analysis focused on the 13 years from 2009 to 2021, where the underlying data was comparable and robust. In this period, the premium income for natural catastrophe business was adequate to cover claims in 11 of those years.\n\nThere were two extraordinary years when claims exceeded premiums during that period. In 2011, there was extensive flooding in Thailand and Australia, an earthquake in New Zealand and an earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\n\nThe second year was 2017, when hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria occurred, as well as Cyclone Debbie, wildfires in California and an earthquake in Mexico. Both years resulted in claims of more than USD 4 billion each.\n\nWhen considering the entire 13-year period, the analysis showed that profits from the natural catastrophe book remained strong. Over the period, Swiss Re paid out more than USD 23.6 billion in natural catastrophe claims. However, the Group's risk insights, reflected in its pricing approach, allowed Swiss Re to absorb those claims and achieve a technical underwriting margin of USD 16.4 billion.\n\nProviding accurate underwriting is critical for Swiss Re to support clients and deliver returns to shareholders.\n\nRisk modelling for natural catastrophe risks is becoming broader and more sophisticated, with a data-driven approach that builds on vast and constantly updated data sets.\n\nOngoing analysis helps to identify long-term trends that are often masked by high volatility across single years.\n\nIn-depth risk insight is also instrumental in helping Swiss Re grow its property insurance book, which is the main driver for Swiss Re's natural catastrophe business.\n\nUSD 23.6 bn Swiss Re's gross claims payments for large natural catastrophes from 2009-2021\n\nUSD 16.4 bn Swiss Re's technical margin on\n\nnatural catastrophe-related business from 2009-2021\n\nThe business opportunity is there: over the next 20 years, Swiss Re Institute estimates that property insurance premium globally will triple to USD 1.3 trillion. Swiss Re's underwriting provides an excellent basis to continue as the world's leading reinsurer for climate-related natural catastrophe risks.",

Swiss Re's research ensures that it is well-positioned to achieve profitable long-term growth in this segment.\n\n## Urbanisation and urban sprawl: the key drivers of future claims\n\nRapid change to human settlement is the leading driver of natural catastrophe loss increases. This makes it a priority for Swiss Re's research around climate risks.\n\nUrbanisation is a concern for reinsurers for two main reasons. Firstly, cities concentrate insured assets in a relatively small area - often along coastlines or major rivers exposed to flooding or windstorms. High concentrations of value in an exposed area mean that a single event can cause very high insured losses for property and business interruption.\n\nSecondly, urbanisation and urban sprawl bring significant changes to the vulnerability of a built-up environment.\n\nUrban sprawl into former flood plains can seal ground surfaces, diminishing nature's ability to retain flood water and increasing the impact of flooding.\n\nUnderstanding urbanisation trends is important for natural catastrophe risk models because our models need to be calibrated on the cities of today or the near future.\n\nFor this reason, Swiss Re has invested into techniques that move our underwriting away from a reliance on historical claims that are based on very different urban landscapes. This modelling is key to provide underwriters with an accurate view of the risks.\n\n## Underwriting can factor in climate change over the long term\n\nAlthough climate change is well-researched, the potential consequences for weatherrelated catastrophes remain highly uncertain over the long term. For property underwriting, however, there is the advantage that changes to natural catastrophe activity are taking place slowly - over decades.\n\nThis is an important point for Swiss Re's underwriting approach. As a rule, most property reinsurance contracts are generally renewed yearly and can be repriced to consider both the actual losses that occur as well as any updated model assumptions.\n\nThis regular update on the pricing for business affected by natural catastrophes effectively gives us the means to price in the effects of climate change as existing business is renewed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key publication in 2021: Economics of Climate Change\n\nIn 2021, the 'Economics of Climate Change' publication presented Swiss Re's Climate Economics Index - a stress test of climate risks on 48 countries, representing 90% of the world economy.\n\nThe report found that the world stands to lose as much as 18% of total economic value from climate change if temperature increases stay on the current trajectory, and both the Paris Agreement and 2050 net-zero emissions targets are not met.\n\nThe publication was Swiss Re's most downloaded publication to date and was covered by the New York Times, The Guardian and CNN.",

        "page_content": "## Partnering to get insurance closer to our clients\n\nFor large industrial clients, traditional insurance solutions are often one step removed from their manufacturing processes. Insurance is usually thought of as protection and a means to pay the costs of repair or lost income if a machine is damaged or some other operational disruption occurs.\n\nThis traditional model of insurance has worked well for corporations for more than 400 years. However, there are inefficiencies that technology can address. For example, the claims process can still be timeconsuming and costly, with the insured party remaining out of pocket until the muchneeded payout is approved.\n\nBut this is changing. New ways of providing protection are bringing insurance closer to overall risk management processes. Through strategic partnerships between insurers and the companies they cover, insurance is becoming more efficient and user-friendly.\n\nSwiss Re Corporate Solutions' collaboration with Hitachi in 2021 is a good example of this.\n\nTogether with Hitachi, Swiss Re created a more holistic risk-management framework by developing a so-called 'embedded insurance' product that works with Hitachi's Lumada APM (Asset Performance Management) software. Lumada monitors the health of a client's equipment, predicting the likelihood of equipment malfunction and automating maintenance routines. As a result, operators running Hitachi's software know the condition of their machines in near real-time, and the software diagnoses what the condition will be in the future.\n\nSwiss Re's role is to help Hitachi and its corporate customers protect themselves against the unlikely event of a failure in the predictive maintenance software - and to cover repair and interruption costs should the software falter and provide a wrongful prognosis resulting in operational downtime.\n\nBy reducing the likelihood of unexpected equipment failure, Lumada APM helps both the insured and insurance companies increase the economic efficiency of insurance schemes. This new solution is set to create significant further business for both Swiss Re and Hitachi as hundreds of different types of machines globally can run Lumada APM. The partnership is key to activating machinesensor data and continuous diagnostics across the industrial sector.\n\nThis gives Swiss Re access to new risk pools from the manufacturing sector, thereby generating additional business and creating value for Swiss Re.\n\n## Embedding insurance to improve the customer experience\n\nEmbedded insurance is also a rising trend in consumer lines - especially in areas where people buy insurance digitally. A well-known example of this is the 'add-on' cover for travel insurance purchased along with air tickets for a particular journey. This simple action of adding insurance to the online purchase is a much more efficient process than subscribing to a long-term travel insurance policy.\n\nSwiss Re has partnered with a number of digital platforms to incorporate insurance solutions into their online business sales model. For example, in 2021 Swiss Re's iptiQ and ImmoScout24, Germany's leading online real estate platform, launched a loss of rent insurance product for the property owner that integrates seamlessly into ImmoScout24's digital ecosystem.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmbedding insurance can also improve the user experience and promote safer behaviours that reduce risk. In 2021, Swiss Re partnered with BlaBlaCar, the world's leading community-based travel platform, and motor insurance specialist L'olivier Assurance, the French branch of Admiral Group, to co-create BlaBlaCar Coach, an innovative smartphone app that offers drivers personalised coaching and tips for safer driving, and is available with an annual car insurance.\n\nSwiss Re's risk partnerships strategy puts us at the forefront of insurance innovation. For our partners, it opens up new business models based around risk that many companies may not have thought possible. For Swiss Re, partnerships open up new value streams that were previously inaccessible - and provide new opportunities to monetise risk knowledge and risk transfer expertise.",

It has since deepened these relationships and signed several other partnership agreements. The team is now involved in over 60 projects with 17 strategic partners.\n\nAs technology continues to drive changes in consumer behaviour and needs, Corporate Partnerships is bringing new partners from the technology space into the insurance ecosystem. In 2021, the team collaborated with Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides on-demand, pay-as-you-go cloud computing services to millions of customers, including fast-growing startups, large\n\nenterprises and leading government agencies. Building on their long-standing relationship - AWS is the cloud provider for iptiQ - Swiss Re and AWS are now working together to launch innovative solutions in the cloud computing space.\n\nIn 2021, the team partnered with Yara, a Norwegian chemical and agricultural solutions company and the world's largest producer of fertiliser. Yara's mission is to responsibly feed the world and protect the planet. The collaboration is focused on developing a range of new solutions such as risk solutions in the digital and sustainable farming space.\n\nCorporate Partnerships also works with Ikano, an international group of companies active in banking, real estate, production, insurance, data analytics and retail within the IKEA group. The aim of the partnership is to help manage the risk of investing in the circular economy, such as recycling or sustainable waste management companies. These types of investments are typically difficult to insure and so Swiss Re and Ikano, with their shared vision for a sustainable future, aim to change this and thereby encourage growth in this area.",

Worldwide protection levels against such risks are still limited, with over 65% of economic losses caused by uninsured natural catastrophes and even larger gaps in healthcare and life risks.\n\nSwiss Re's Public Sector Solutions (PSS) is the first division in the reinsurance industry fully dedicated to the public sector. Set up in 2011, the team has since completed over 800 transactions with governments and other public sector entities around the world and an average of more than 100 transactions per annum over the last five years.\n\nPSS works with governments across the world to protect public assets against disasters by providing traditional risk transfer solutions and preventative measures that enable better adaptation to risks. This work has created an extra premium income of around USD 1.5 billion over the past five years for the Group. In 2021, PSS generated USD 364 million in premiums. The division also brought in USD 109 million from new business opportunities during the year, showing that its client base and solutions portfolio continues to grow. The business has been growing at an average annual rate of around 10% over the past five years and meets or exceeds the group underwriting\n\ntargets, which reflects Swiss Re's ability to sustainably and profitably serve the everincreasing demand for risk transfer from the public sector globally.\n\nPSS pursues a three-level approach:\n\n- 1. Working with public sector clients to insure against large losses. PSS's risk transfer solutions allow public sector risk owners to meet their fiscal resilience objectives, even after a shock event.\n- 2. Producing unique, science-informed risk insights through technology platforms tailored to the public sector.\n- 3. Partnering with development banks as well as technology and industry leaders and non-profit organisations to create sustainable, comprehensive and inclusive responses to the global agenda of governments.\n\nMuch of PSS's work is highly innovative and collaborative. For example, in 2021 the PSS team was involved in the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) programme, which contributes to increased COVID-19 vaccination rates in developing countries across the world. The insurance aspect of this programme protects against the risk of non-payment for the vaccinations.",

Through these partnerships, Swiss Re can manage its peak underwriting risks while providing its partners with access to its strong underwriting expertise.\n\nThe team also provides a one-stop shop for our clients for their alternative capital needs. Clients include re/insurers, governments and corporations with expertise provided in both the property and casualty and life and health risk markets.\n\nACP is Swiss Re's centre of expertise for the alternative capital markets. The ACP team manages risk exposure by ceding excess risks to partner investors. This limits the Group's risk exposure and enhances Swiss Re's capital position, while allowing investors to benefit from Swiss Re's leading risk assessments. In addition, ACP itself invests in capital market instruments, allowing Swiss Re further access to risks in an alternative format to the traditional reinsurance business.\n\nAs a registered broker-dealer, ACP also offers ILS trading support via our broker-dealer unit Swiss Re Capital Markets (SRCM). This unit is one of the current leading arrangers in the ILS market, and has also consistently ranked among the top underwriters since the market's inception. ACP has raised approximately USD 40 billion in ILS capital since 1997, more than any other arranger.\n\nIn 2020, Swiss Re's subsidiary Swiss Re Insurance-Linked Investment Management Ltd received authorisation from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) for an asset management licence for funds. The company now manages a standalone fund company, 1863 Fund Ltd, providing investors with a new way of accessing Swiss Re's natural catastrophe business.\n\nThis marked the first time Swiss Re opened its natural catastrophe portfolio to investors through a permanent fund format. It gives investors the opportunity to invest in the same book of business as Swiss Re, thus benefitting from Swiss Re's global reach, client access, risk knowledge and underwriting expertise.\n\nACP's regular insurance-linked securities updates are the industry benchmark for ILS reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of 1 January 2022, she also assumed responsibility for Corporate Services, comprising Group Communications and Corporate Real Estate & Services. Prior to this, she was Chief People Officer driving business operating model transformation and cultural evolution at Sodexo in Paris, before which she held a number of senior international HR roles at GE from 1998 to 2018. We spoke to her about her vision for the company, the big challenges and successes she sees ahead, and the real value of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.\n\nCathy Desquesses Group Chief Human Resources Officer & Head Corporate Services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## You recently joined Swiss Re. Can you tell us your first impressions of the company?\n\nMy first impressions are that our teams are extremely talented and we have some of the top experts in the global re/insurance industry. Furthermore, people at Swiss Re are inspired and engaged. They have a deep sense of purpose and are proud to work for the firm.\n\n## Why did you choose to join Swiss Re?\n\nThree things inspired me to join Swiss Re: firstly, its mission to make the world more resilient for the benefit of our society and environment. Secondly, I am very drawn to the people, whom I find to have that great balance of being competitive, talented and experienced along with a real sense of collaboration, care and respect. Thirdly, I am inspired by the vision and the direction that the company is heading in. I believe I can contribute to the journey ahead and help build a sustainable workplace.\n\n## What is your vision for the people strategy at Swiss Re? What do you think we could do better?\n\nWe collectively need to better anticipate the next steps and stay ahead of the curve. That means looking at what is needed for the company in the next three to five years in terms of skills, talent, leadership, footprint and capabilities. Swiss Re is a knowledge company and so, quite simply, Human Resources needs to shape a strategy around attracting, retaining and inspiring the brightest and best employees. We are in a very competitive market and we need to differentiate to remain the global employer of choice.\n\n## Why is a solid people strategy so important for creating value for our shareholders, clients and employees?\n\nPromoting a performance-led culture is a big part of our business strategy and Swiss Re's Human Resources community enables this through every stage of the employee lifecycle. To be successful, the firm focuses on building and nurturing a diverse and inspired talent pool who can learn, grow and drive financial performance.\n\nFor people to perform at their best, we need to provide them with the appropriate ingredients to thrive; tell them what is expected and help them to get there through relevant experience, coaching, learning and ongoing care - so that they are empowered to take ownership of their work and be accountable. Continuous open dialogue and constructive feedback between employees and management are key.\n\n## In 2020, COVID-19 had a big impact on businesses and society. What were the big challenges in 2021 for us at Swiss Re and how are we equipping our people to deal with them?\n\nThe main challenge for the HR community as well as for managers and teams was two-fold: 1) enhancing and promoting the firm's culture with less in-person interaction and physical gathering (which was even more challenging when we onboarded new employees); and 2) mitigating the global spike in mental health issues as a result of isolation.\n\nWe therefore sent out a survey to gauge how people at the company were handling the situation. Based on the feedback, we massively invested in programmes and initiatives to support both managers and employees around mental and physical health, resilience and well-being. One example was our global Swiss ReSilience Day in January 2021, where all of our employees were given the day off and a one-time award of around USD 200 to help them recharge their batteries. At a more specific level, all line managers were invited\n\nPeople at Swiss Re are inspired and engaged. They have a deep sense of purpose and are proud to work for the firm.'",

More than 1 100 people took part.\n\nDuring the course of 2021, where possible, we gradually reopened our offices, while maintaining strict health and safety standards. We also reinforced our Own The Way You Work TM guiding principles to allow each and every employee to make the right choices for them, both personally and professionally.\n\n## What were our biggest successes in 2021?\n\nThere are so many! Despite a very challenging situation, we have delivered for our clients and continued to keep strong relationships internally and externally. While face-to face interaction is important, there are so many other ways to build connections and collaborate with people.\n\nOur employee engagement survey scores were also very high. For example, our leaders were rated as being highly responsive and caring, which is great news given the challenges of the past two years. And of course, we received awards and positive recognition externally.\n\n## Looking at the bigger picture: why does Diversity, Equity & Inclusion matter for our company?\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are essential to any company's performance. A diverse workforce produces better results by getting the best out of everyone\u2026 more creative thinking, more resilience, more curiosity and more humility as well. We reflect the communities we serve. An equitable work environment enables equal access to roles, promotions and pay. It creates a sense of justice and fairness, where everyone can thrive if they perform and embrace the values.\n\nOur strong sense of purpose and culture of inclusion are a massive differentiator for us as an employer and as an organisation.'\n\nAn inclusive culture is a performing and a resilient culture. When it comes to our financial investments, we diversify our portfolio and don't put all our risk into one asset. It's the same for people. Companies that are diverse are more competitive and successful.\n\nWe cannot expect people to perform if we don't have all these elements in place.\n\n## Which Swiss Re value do you identify the most with: client centricity, agility, team spirit, passion to perform or integrity?\n\nThat's a hard question, as all these values contribute to a successful company culture much like a symphony. But if I had to pick one, it is the passion to perform. I'm very competitive and I like to win! I believe that success is most often the result of building on things as a team rather than striving for glory in isolation.\n\n## What motivates you?\n\nWhat motivates me the most both in my personal and professional life is change. It's stepping outside of my comfort zone, learning and trying to make an impact. It provides me with a sense of humility and freshness. You can shake up your outside environment while remaining inwardly grounded. Inspiring others to cultivate change is one of the most challenging tasks there is and is therefore a good test of leadership. If you succeed in doing this, I think you can move mountains.\n\nAs a family, we have changed countries, homes and cultures almost every three years. By changing your environment, you suddenly look at things differently and you feel reenergised. If you are open to the 'new' you continuously accumulate knowledge, experience and contacts. You get the best from all worlds!\n\n## What is your main goal for 2022 and beyond?\n\nNaturally, I aim to contribute to driving sustainable performance for Swiss Re. To do this, we need to be proactive about getting the best talent into the right jobs at the right time. Our strong purpose and culture of inclusion are a massive differentiator for us as an employer and as an organisation. I want to ensure that we continue to live and breathe them as we further grow and evolve, ensuring our values do not become diluted.\n\nOn the personal side, my goal is to continue to learn because when you stop asking questions, you stop making progress. Staying curious is rejuvenating and humbling. I look forward to continuing to work with the talented teams of Swiss Re and a terrific HR team to maintain the high standards that they have set - and, together, to raise the bar even higher.",

Through its active participation, Swiss Re is contributing to driving economic inclusion and opening up opportunities for previously disadvantaged people across the country.\n\nWhile being a shining example of Swiss Re's global inclusion and diversity efforts, this achievement also demonstrates the company's commitment to its local markets. Swiss Re has a long history of prioritising the socio-economic development of South Africans in the way we conduct business, and the Swiss Re Africa team went the extra mile to support this important local social initiative and secured the top rating within a very short time frame.\n\nSwiss Re Africa is now leading the way in this area by promoting social integration, education and professional enablement programmes in South Africa. Key initiatives include procuring the services of local small\n\nand medium-sized enterprises and supporting their business development, hiring ethnically diverse staff at all levels of seniority and spearheading skills development for youth.\n\nFor example, Swiss Re is among a group of businesses who coach school principals from under-resourced schools in a bid to strengthen education in underprivileged communities.\n\nThe B-BBEE Level 1 rating not only benefits Swiss Re and the community in which we operate, it is also advantageous for our clients.

        "page_content": "## Why flexible working is part of our DNA\n\nWhen COVID-19 spread across the globe in early 2020, many companies and their employees had to adapt to remote working.\n\nThanks to Swiss Re's flexible working principle, Own The Way You Work TM (OTWYW), our business and employees were able to quickly adapt to this new environment. Swiss Re employees are empowered to choose how and where they work, giving everyone, regardless of their circumstances, the chance to shine.\n\nAs remote working became the new normal everywhere, Swiss Re updated its long-term OTWYW principles based on employee feedback and lessons learned during the COVID-19 crisis. The aim is to empower all individual staff and teams and encourage them to connect and communicate openly with each other, wherever they are located. The Group strives for a hybrid approach and asks employees to reflect on what makes sense in each situation. For instance, working from home\n\ncan be preferable for certain focused activities and can save time and CO2 emissions from travel. Meeting face to face, however, can help to create a more personal connection with clients or colleagues.\n\nSwiss Re's state-of the art offices - from the eye-catching old-meets-new style of the Zurich headquarters to the iconic Londonbased Gherkin - form part of the company's creative and collaborative culture. To that end, in September 2021, Swiss Re launched the Living Lab workplace pilot in its Adliswil office in Switzerland. The new inspiring workspaces are designed to boost innovation and enhance teamwork and knowledge exchange. The concept will later be rolled out to other locations such as the new Swiss Re office in Singapore and the Lake building in Zurich.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In April 2021, our Human Resources team sent out a survey to employees globally to understand more about their experiences at the company and how they were handling these challenging times overall. An impressive 82% of the company took the time to share their thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe survey showed that a majority of respondents were confident about the company's overall resilience in the face of the crisis. It also revealed that COVID-19 has tested Swiss Re employees' personal resilience, in particular regarding new ways of working and workload. However, 73% of employees stated they continue to feel resilient in the face of the pandemic and many felt that people worked well together, stayed connected and that Swiss Re was actively looking after their well-being.\n\nTo support employees in boosting their resilience during the pandemic, Swiss Re has launched a number of mental health and well-being initiatives over the past years. Most recently, Swiss Re signed the Leadership Pledge for the Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental Health. This new business-led collaboration, founded by BHP, Clifford Chance, Deloitte, HSBC, Salesforce and Unilever, aims to raise awareness of the importance of mental health in the workplace, break down stigmas and facilitate the adoption of best practices for helping employees.\n\nEmployee support programmes are nothing new for the company. Swiss Re offers external independent and confidential advice and counselling to those in difficult circumstances in every location, free of charge via its Employee Assistance Providers programme. The Group also runs an internal initiative via its global employee network Pathways, where dedicated Mental Health Champions from the company take the time to listen, advocate the importance of mental health in their circles and refer people to professional help if necessary. Pathways also organises a variety of mental health-related events throughout the year, such as health first aider trainings, mindfulness sessions and regular mental health talks. For example, in the lead-up to World Mental Health Day 2021, Swiss Re employees took part in the atlasGO challenge, engaging in diverse activities to care for one's own mental health while helping raise money for the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nDespite progress over the past years, there remains workplace stigma and bias attached to mental ill health. Swiss Re recognises that it is important to break down stigmas and support our employees' mental health.\n\n## The Leadership Pledge for Mental Health\n\nThe Leadership Pledge is a call to action for global business leaders to increase mental health awareness and foster a supportive working environment. As a responsible business leader, Swiss Re pledges to:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1    Develop and deliver an action plan to support good mental health in our organisation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2    Promote an open culture around mental health, working towards eliminating stigma\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3     Take proactive steps to develop our culture and ways of working towards positive mental health and reducing mental ill-health\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4     Empower all our people to manage and prioritise their own mental health, and to support one another\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5     Signpost our people to mental health tools and support they need\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6     Regularly measure the impact of our efforts, while being open about our progress, to influence and inspire change in our organisation and beyond",

        "page_content": "## Our sustainability mission\n\nSwiss Re insures, invests, operates and shares knowledge in a way that tackles sustainability challenges and creates long-term value.\n\nThe mission ties the Group's sustainability thinking directly to its business practices. As both a direct insurer and a reinsurer, Swiss Re wants to ensure it understands the risks it is writing, and also how those risks contribute to the overall vision of making the world more resilient.\n\nFor over a decade, the company has been continuously defining minimum environmental and social standards for conducting business. Having screened our portfolios for business that has unintended negative social and environmental consequences, we have developed an exclusion and engagement framework to manage such sustainability risks.\n\nIn 2021, Swiss Re further strengthened its approach to managing nature and biodiversity-related risks by introducing an agriculture, forestry and food policy. The Group also formally introduced a third umbrella policy on governance, fully reflecting all three risk dimensions of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.\n\nThe aim is not only to steer away from less sustainable business, but to steer towards more sustainable business where\n\nopportunities lie. Swiss Re has, for example, written re/insurance cover for more than 8 870 wind and solar farms in 2021.\n\nWith over USD 121.2 billion of assets under management, the company can contribute to shifting the global institutional asset base towards more sustainable investments. The Asset Management team integrates ESG considerations along the entire investment process. In addition, Swiss Re focuses on the role it can play as an asset owner by engaging with the real economy on the further integration of sustainability and, in particular, climate change considerations.\n\nSwiss Re wants to lead in sustainable operations. Bringing CO2 emissions to net zero by 2030 is a key target. That's why the company introduced a triple-digit real internal carbon price for its own operations - the first multinational company to do so. Currently at USD 100 per tonne of CO2, our Carbon Steering Levy incentivises low-carbon decision-making across the Group, allowing the move from carbon offsetting to carbon removal to compensate for the remaining footprint. The levy will be gradually raised to USD 200 per tonne of CO2 by 2030.\n\nSwiss Re's sustainability mission helps steer its risk research, especially in areas where the company engages with broader society. For example, we have helped decisionmakers to understand the economic impact of climate change, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.\n\n## Our sustainability principles\n\nSwiss Re has three sustainability principles:\n\n## 1. We embed sustainability in all of our business activities.\n\nThis has tangible consequences for key activities. For example, Swiss Re applies exclusions to underwriting and investments and has an integrated referral process for sustainability risks.\n\n## 2. We are a leader in developing sustainability-linked solutions and embracing opportunities in this area.\n\nThis means that we help our clients address their sustainability challenges. For example, Swiss Re's parametric solutions have a strong track record in the emerging markets where they are particularly helpful for the agricultural sector.\n\n## 3. We quantify sustainability performance and impact.\n\nSwiss Re discloses, for example, its operational carbon footprint and investment carbon intensity and has co-developed a methodology to measure the carbon footprint of the underwriting portfolio. Swiss Re has also established a clear connection between sustainability targets and compensation for all employees, based on sustainability key performance indicators.\n\nDetailed reporting on sustainability at Swiss Re is available in the Sustainability Report 2021 and in the Financial Report's section on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD).",

Only by reducing CO\u2082 emissions massively and across entire value chains can we prevent the worst scenarios from emerging. Swiss Re is committed to reaching net-zero emissions from underwriting and investing by 2050.\n\nSwiss Re continuously reviews measures to assist the transition to a low-carbon economy. Examples include a new exit strategy for thermal coal and a shift away from the most carbon-intensive oil and gas production.\n\nSwiss Re also supports the development of clean energy projects. For example, in 2021 we helped a renewable energy provider in India consolidate insurance cover for its entire portfolio of solar (80%) and wind (20%) energy plants across India, supporting its ambition to generate 25 GW of renewable energy by 2025. The energy generated is expected to benefit approximately 35 million households.\n\nAlongside massive cuts in emissions over the next decades, the rapid deployment of carbon removal capacities will be needed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and to stay net-negative thereafter.\n\nIn 2021, Swiss Re entered into a partnership with carbon removal leader Climeworks, with whom it signed the world's first long-term purchase agreement for direct air capture and storage, worth USD 10 million over ten years. The partnership demonstrates Swiss Re's\n\nsupport for the carbon removal industry and sends an important demand signal to developers, investors and other buyers.\n\nAlso in 2021, Swiss Re launched its NetZeroYou2 Programme, which enables its employees and their families to measure their own carbon footprint and advises them to cut their emissions and offset them using Swiss Re's own carbon certificate purchasing campaign.\n\nClimate change has become a strategic issue for many clients. Swiss Re is delivering the solutions and knowledge to address this. For example, our Climate Risk Solutions enable corporations to quantify the impact of climate risk on their portfolios.\n\n## Building societal resilience\n\nSwiss Re's work in the areas of health and longevity, food security and infrastructure represent some of the ways that it helps to build societal resilience.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected health workers globally. For example, in Kenya, the company is working with a consortium of top health insurers to provide medical reimbursement cover to frontline workers, which is not just restricted to COVID-19 protection.\n\nThe pandemic has also severely impacted people's mental health as well as their physical health. Through its partnership in 2021 with Wysa, a leading mental health platform, Swiss Re is supporting prevention, designing flexible customer-centric offerings and sharing insights.\n\n## Driving affordable insurance with digital solutions\n\nDigital solutions help increase the accessibility, availability and affordability of insurance. Through facilitating access to\n\ninsurance, the company aims to grow the resilience of low-income groups and societies and thereby help to close the protection gap. Big data and cloud computing enable the creation of new insurance models thanks to real-time connectivity and access to vast amounts of data.\n\nAs an example, the Group is creating an online platform for corporates: the platform, dubbed Sustainability Compass, will simplify the assessment, monitoring and reporting of climate-related risks. It will help clients navigate regulatory and investor reporting requirements related to climate risk and improve climate-related decisionmaking on a global as well as on a project or property level.\n\nSwiss Re also seeks to understand and proactively address ethical challenges surrounding the digital transformation, including developing digital best practices and digital responsibility principles for its solutions and businesses.\n\nFor instance, Swiss Re is a partner in the 'Digital Trust Label' (DTL) pilot of the Swiss Digital Initiative, a process to safeguard ethical standards in the digital world through concrete projects. Swiss Re's automated underwriting engine designed for life insurance, Magnum Go, was recently certified with the DTL.\n\nSwiss Re also seeks to understand how to ethically use behavioural economics in insurance. Swiss Re Institute published a research report in 2021, 'To BE or not to BE. The ethical application of behavioural economics in insurance', which provides tools and tips on this issue to assist and inspire insurance industry professionals.",

To emphasise its commitment to decarbonising its business, Swiss Re is a founding member of two alliances: the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA) and the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA). In alignment with the AOA's inaugural Target Setting Protocol released in 2021, Swiss Re set ambitious intermediate targets to reduce the carbon intensity of its listed equities and corporate bond portfolio by 2025. In addition, the NZIA will enable insurers to individually set science-based intermediate decarbonisation targets for their underwriting portfolios.\n\n## WEF Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders:\n\nThe WEF Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders is the largest CEO-led alliance in the world and is currently co-chaired by Swiss Re's Group CEO Christian Mumenthaler. The alliance works on concrete climate action aligned with the Paris climate agreement and is a catalyst to lead and drive change in the race to net zero. Mumenthaler represented the alliance at COP26 to encourage world leaders to take decisive and more aggressive steps towards reaching net zero.\n\n## Full phase-out of thermal coal has begun:\n\nIn 2021, Swiss Re moved ahead with its new exit strategy for thermal coal in treaty re/insurance, complementing its existing strategy for direct and facultative business established in 2018. In 2023, Swiss Re will tighten its coal policy by introducing new thermal coal exposure thresholds for treaty re/insurance across property, engineering, casualty, credit & surety and marine cargo lines of business. The thresholds will be tightened gradually and will lead to a complete phase-out of thermal coal exposure in OECD countries by 2030 and in the rest of the world by 2040.\n\n## Partnering with Climeworks:\n\nIn 2021, Swiss Re partnered with Climeworks, a leading specialist in carbon dioxide air capture technology. As part of the collaboration, Swiss Re buys carbon removal services and gains access to the new carbon removal risk pool and asset class. This is the world's first long-term purchase agreement for direct air capture and storage, worth USD 10 million over ten years, providing Climeworks with future revenue that improves the bankability of their scale-up roadmap.",
