        "page_content": "## 2020 sustainability focus areas\n\nAt 3M, we look at sustainability in terms of shared global needs. To have a sustainable future, many challenges must be addressed, including limited availability of natural resources, lack of access to education and health care, inadequate food supplies, rapid urbanization, stressed water systems, and the global climate crisis. With 2020 came the additional challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and an increased focus on social justice, racial equity and inclusion. According to research conducted every even numbered year and again in 2020, a wide range of stakeholders determined the following areas to be of priority focus for 3M - climate change, plastic and packaging waste, toxic substances, waste from operations, air quality, spread of human disease, availability of sustainable product and services, energy use, water quality, water availability, and human rights. Most of these focus areas were perceived to have increased in importance since 2018, along with scarcity of raw materials, water quality, social equity and other ethical business practices and confirmed the legitimacy of our sustainability strategy and three priority focus areas: Science for Circular, Science for Climate, and Science for Community.\n\n2020 also marked the full first year for the Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors. As a science-based company that relies on investments and capabilities in R&D, commercialization and sustainability for our success, this committee aligns with 3M's strategic priorities and enables the Board greater focus and engagement on a critical element of our strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Science for Circular\n\n## Science for Climate\n\n## Science for Community\n\n2020 was the second year 100% of products entering 3M's new product commercialization process included a Sustainability Value Commitment (SVC), demonstrating how they drive impact for the greater good. The SVC builds on 3M's history of creating sustainable products and collaborating with our customers to help them reach their own sustainability goals. Sample SVC benefits for products launched in 2020 include solvent-free adhesive formulas, improved air quality in living spaces and increased energy efficiency.\n\nIn response to the outbreak of COVID-19, 3M innovation pivoted to develop circular solutions that would help reduce the spread. Examples include re-purposing plastic materials for use in face shields, redesigning respirator manufacturing lines to expand capacity by reducing waste and developing a reusable face mask.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3M signed on in support of reporting the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nTo advance our commitment to transition our global footprint to 100% renewable sources of electricity, all 3M locations in Poland recently shifted to 100% renewable electricity. 3M also continues to support the global renewable energy sector by providing customers with solutions that help improve reliability and efficiency.\n\nThrough select 3M product platforms, we helped our customers avoid emitting nearly 60 million metric tons of CO 2 in the last four years alone. Examples include helping customers in electronics, automotive, and construction industries reduce their energy use, improve their energy efficiency and reduce waste through the use of 3M materials and solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo advance the social impact/justice agenda we created an equity and communication organization that will manage the company's social justice and equity initiatives. In addition, we are committed to investing $50 million over 5 years to address racial opportunity gaps in our communities and workplaces.\n\nExpanding our partnership with the UN Global Compact, 3M became a Patron Sponsor of the SDG Ambition, a program to accelerate global business action to achieve the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n3M employees responded early and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, supplying critical products to dedicated frontline health care workers and first responders. In 2020, we produced more than 2 billion N95 respirators globally more than three times the amount we manufactured in 2019. 3M partnered with other companies and organizations to find innovative solutions in the fight against the pandemic. 3M also responded with cash and product donations including respirators, surgical masks and hand sanitizer - through local and global humanitarian aid partners.",

Although the vote was non-binding, the Compensation Committee believes this level of approval indicates that shareholders strongly support our executive compensation programs and policies. The Compensation Committee will consider the results of this year's say-on-pay proposal, as well as feedback from our shareholders, when making future executive compensation decisions.\n\nFor information concerning our investor outreach efforts, see 'Shareholder outreach and engagement' on page 11.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For more information, see 'Annual incentive' beginning on page 65.\n- \u00b7 Appointed Monish Patolawala as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and approved his initial compensation arrangements (consisting of an annual base salary of $885,000, target annual incentive compensation of $885,000, make-whole and inducement equity awards with an aggregate target grant value of $4,765,246, and prorated 2020 long-term incentive compensation awards with an aggregate target grant value of $1,625,000). Mr. Patolawala's compensation arrangement includes no employment agreement or supplemental retirement benefits. For more information, see 'Section V: 2020 compensation decisions and performance highlights Monish Patolawala ' on page 75.\n- \u00b7 Approved implementation of a program under which the Company's executives (other than the Company's Chief Executive Officer) will be offered the opportunity to indicate a preference to receive 25 percent of the target grant value of their annual long-term incentive compensation awards in the form of restricted stock units rather than stock options, beginning with the annual grants made in 2021. For more information about the Named Executive Officers 2020 annual long-term incentive compensation arrangements, see '2020 long-term incentive awards' on page 70.\n- \u00b7 Amended and restated the 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, subject to shareholder approval, to increase the number of shares available for future awards and make certain other changes. For more information, see 'Proposal 4: Approval of the Amended and Restated 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan' on page 102.\n\nProposal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Approval of the Amended and Restated 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\n(page 102)\n\n- \u00b7 Approve the Amended and Restated 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n- \u00b7 The Board recommends that shareholders approve the amendment and restatement of the 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan in order to increase the number of shares available for future awards and implement other charges.\n\n## Special note regarding COVID-19 impact on incentive compensation arrangements\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created both challenges and opportunities for 3M that were not reflected in the 2020 performance goals established for the Named Executive Officers' annual and long-term incentive compensation arrangements. Although the Compensation Committee believes that the pandemic had a significant, adverse impact on the ability of executives to meet certain performance goals, the Committee determined not to adjust the targets or payouts for any of the Named Executive Officers. Similarly, the Committee determined not to make any design changes to the Company's 2021 executive compensation program based on the pandemic. The Committee believes this approach is consistent with the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'FOR'",

Each nominee elected as a director will continue in office until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or retirement.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee reviewed the Board Membership Criteria (described on page 26) and the specific experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills of each nominee, including membership(s) on the boards of directors of other public companies. The following pages contain biographical and other information about the nominees. Following each nominee's biographical information, we have provided information concerning the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills that are deemed most critical to 3M's long-term success and led the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board to determine that each nominee should serve as a director. In addition, the majority of our directors serve or have served on boards and board committees (including as committee chairs) of other public companies, which the Board believes provides them with additional board leadership and governance experience, exposure to best practices, and substantial knowledge and skills that further enhance the functioning of our Board.",

The Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews with the Board the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members given the current Board composition. It is the intent of the Board that the Board, itself, will be a high-performance organization creating competitive advantage for the Company. To perform as such, the Board will be composed of individuals who have distinguished records of leadership and success in their arena of activity and who will make substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively represent the interests of all shareholders. The Committee's and the Board's assessment of Board candidates includes, but is not limited to, consideration of:\n\n- \u00b7 Roles in and contributions valuable to the business community;\n- \u00b7 Personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment, and whether the candidate possesses and maintains throughout service on the Board a reputation in the community at large of integrity, trust, respect, competence, and adherence to the highest ethical standards;\n- \u00b7 Relevant knowledge and diversity of background and experience in business, manufacturing, technology, finance and accounting, marketing, international business, government, and other areas; and\n- \u00b7 Whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time required for preparation, participation, and attendance at all meetings.\n\nIn addition to these minimum requirements, the Committee will also evaluate whether the nominee's skills are complementary to the existing Board members' skills, the Board's needs for particular expertise in certain areas, and will assess the nominee's impact on Board dynamics, effectiveness, and diversity of experience and perspectives.\n\n## Director nominees - diversity of skills and experience\n\nThe diagram below summarizes the director nominees' key skills and experiences in the areas that are most relevant to 3M and shows the number of director nominees who possess each of the skills and experiences:\n\nLeadership\n\n12\n\nLeadership.

The current composition of our Board reflects those ongoing efforts and the continued importance of diversity to the Board.\n\n## Board self-evaluation process\n\nThe Board conducts a multi-step annual self-evaluation to determine whether it, its committees and its directors are functioning effectively, consider opportunities for continual enhancement, and as part of its annual director nomination process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evaluations by Board Leadership\n\n- \u00b7 Chairman/Lead Director/Nominating and Governance (N&G) Committee Chair meet around the time of the November Board meeting to evaluate the performance and skills of each director\n- \u00b7 Information is shared and discussed with the N&G Committee and considered in the nomination process at the February meeting\n\n## One-on-One Discussions with N&G Chair\n\n- \u00b7 N&G Chair meets individually with each director prior to the February meeting to discuss:\n- \u01c6 Effectiveness of Board and committees\n- \u01c6 Opportunities for improvement\n- \u01c6 Director's self-evaluation\n- \u01c6 Director's evaluation of other Board members\n- \u01c6 Other topics selected by director\n- \u00b7 N&G Chair shares comments and feedback with the Board and N&G Committee\n\n## Annual Questionnaires\n\n- \u00b7 Following the February meeting, each director completes a questionnaire on the functioning of the Board and committees\n- \u00b7 Results are discussed at the April Board and committee meetings\n\n## Feedback Incorporated\n\n- \u00b7 As a result of this process:\n- \u01c6 The Board and its committees identify potential areas for improvement, as well as existing practices which have contributed to high effectiveness\n- \u01c6 Items requiring follow-up are monitored on a going-forward basis by the full Board, committees and/or committee chairs, as applicable\n- \u01c6 The N&G Committee considers the performance and contributions of each director as part of its annual nomination process to ensure our directors continue to possess the necessary skills and experience to effectively oversee the Company; on occasion, the N&G Committee has not re-nominated a director\n\nWhile this formal self-evaluation is conducted on an annual basis, directors share perspectives, feedback, and suggestions year-round.

        "page_content": "## Shareholder nominations - advance notice bylaw\n\nIn addition, 3M's Bylaws permit shareholders to nominate directors at an annual meeting of shareholders or at a special meeting at which directors are to be elected in accordance with the notice of meeting. Shareholders intending to nominate a person for election as a director must comply with the requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws. With respect to nominations to be acted upon at our 2022 Annual Meeting, our Bylaws would require, among other things, that the Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the record shareholder no earlier than November 24, 2021, and no later than December 24, 2021. The notice must contain the information required by the Bylaws, a copy of which is available on our website at www.3M.com , under Investor Relations - Governance. Nominations received after December 24, 2021, will not be acted upon at the 2022 Annual Meeting.\n\n## Proxy access nominations\n\nFurther, pursuant to the proxy access Bylaw adopted by the Board in November 2015, a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, continuously owning for three years at least three percent of our outstanding common shares may nominate and include in our proxy materials up to the greater of two directors and 20 percent of the number of directors currently serving, if the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the Bylaw requirements. For eligible shareholders to include in our proxy materials nominees for the 2022 Annual Meeting, proxy access nomination notices must be received by the Company no earlier than November 24, 2021, and no later than December 24, 2021. The notice must contain the information required by the Bylaws.\n\n## Director orientation and continuing education\n\nOur orientation programs familiarize new directors with 3M's businesses, strategic plans, and policies, and help prepare them for their role on their assigned committees. Continuing education programs assist directors in maintaining skills and knowledge necessary for the performance of their duties. These programs may be part of regular Board and Committee meetings or provided by academic or other qualified third parties. The programs have also included visits to the Company's laboratories and manufacturing facilities.\n\n## Director independence\n\nThe Board has adopted a formal set of Director Independence Guidelines with respect to the determination of director independence, which either conform to or are more exacting than the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE') listing standards, and the full text of which is available on our website at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations - Governance. In accordance with these Guidelines, a director or nominee for director must be determined to have no material relationship with the Company other than as a director. The Guidelines specify the criteria by which the independence of our directors will be determined, including strict guidelines for directors and their immediate family members with respect to past employment or affiliation with the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm. The Guidelines also prohibit Audit and Compensation Committee members from having any direct or indirect financial relationship with the Company, and restrict both commercial and not-for-profit relationships of all directors with the Company. Directors may not be given personal loans or extensions of credit by the Company, and all directors are required to deal at arm's length with the Company and its subsidiaries, and to disclose any circumstance that might be perceived as a conflict of interest.\n\nIn accordance with these Guidelines, the Board undertook its annual review of director independence. During this review, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each director, or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in each of the most recent three completed fiscal years. The Board also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between the Company and a director or any members of a director's immediate family (or any entity of which a director or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner, or significant equity holder). The Board considered that in the ordinary course of business, transactions may occur between the Company and its subsidiaries and companies at which some of our directors are or have been officers. In particular, the Board considered the annual amount of sales to 3M for each of the most recent three completed fiscal years by each of the companies where directors serve or have served as an executive officer, as well as purchases by those companies from 3M. The Board determined that the amount of sales and purchases in each fiscal year was below one percent of the annual revenues of each of those companies, the threshold set forth in the Director Independence Guidelines. The Board also considered charitable contributions to not-for-profit organizations with which our directors or immediate family members are affiliated, none of which approached the threshold set forth in our Director Independence Guidelines.",

The Audit Committee has adopted procedures to receive, retain, and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential and anonymous submission by employees or others of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. Information on how to submit any such communications can be found on 3M's Investor Relations website, under Governance Governance Documents - Employee Business Conduct Policies - 'Report a concern or ask a question.' Our Chief Compliance Officer, who has direct reporting obligations to the Audit Committee, periodically reports to the Audit Committee on compliance with the Company's Code of Conduct, including the effectiveness of the Company's compliance program.\n\nThe Board also has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors of the Company. This Code incorporates long-standing principles of conduct the Company and the Board follow to ensure the Company's business and the activities of the Board are conducted with integrity and adherence to the highest ethical standards, and in compliance with the law. The Company's Code of Conduct for employees and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors are available on our website at www.3M.com under Investor Relations - Governance Governance Documents.\n\n## Public policy engagement\n\nThe Company believes that transparency with respect to the consideration, processes, and oversight of our engagement with lawmakers is important to our shareholders, and continuously makes efforts to give our shareholders useful information about our public policy engagement. Since 2007, the Company has voluntarily published a detailed explanation of the Company's political activities which is available on our website at www.3M.com under Investor Relations - Governance - Governance Documents - 'Lobbying and Political Activities Governance.' There, the Company explains its principles and governance procedures and provides detailed information about 3M's lobbying, political activities, and engagement with industry associations. We discuss our positions on important public policy issues, the factors we consider when evaluating contribution proposals, and the processes we use for legal, financial, executive, and Board oversight of our political activities and contributions. We also provide links to the reports the 3M Political Action Committee files monthly with the Federal Election Commission and the Company's quarterly Lobbying Disclosure reports, as well as a detailed list of our contributions to state candidates and political parties, and contributions to '527' political organizations. The Company also discloses on its website the trade associations the Company joined where $25,000 or more of the dues are allocated for lobbying purposes by the trade association. Certain tax-exempt organizations, organized under U.S. Internal Revenue Code \u00a7501(c)(4) and known as 'social welfare' organizations, may engage in lobbying activities related to their primary purpose. If the portion of any of our dues or other contribution in excess of $25,000 are allocated to lobbying activities, we will disclose the association and amount so allocated. The Company believes that these disclosures on our website, which exceed the disclosures required by law, offer transparency respecting the Company's public policy engagement and political activities.\n\n## Related person transaction policy and procedures\n\nThe Board of Directors has adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy and Procedures which is administered by the Nominating and Governance Committee. This Policy applies to any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a Related Person (as that term is defined in the Policy) has a direct or indirect material interest and which is required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Transactions that fall within this definition are referred to the Committee for approval, ratification, or other action. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Committee decides whether or not to approve a transaction and approves only those transactions that are in the best interests of the Company. In the course of its review and approval or ratification of a transaction, the Committee considers:\n\n- \u00b7 The nature of the Related Person's interest in the transaction;\n- \u00b7 The material terms of the transaction, including whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances;\n- \u00b7 The significance of the transaction to the Related Person;\n- \u00b7 The significance of the transaction to the Company;\n- \u00b7 Whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in the best interest of the Company; and\n- \u00b7 Any other matters the Committee deems appropriate.",

There were no Related Person Transactions that were referred to the Committee in 2020.\n\n## Policy on adoption of a rights plan\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, a 3M shareholder submitted a shareholder proposal to 3M regarding the approval process for adopting a shareholders' rights plan (also known as a 'poison pill'). 3M does not have a rights plan and is not currently considering adopting one. The Board continues to believe, however, that there may be circumstances under which adoption of a rights plan would give the Board the negotiating power and leverage necessary to obtain the best result for 3M shareholders in the context of a takeover effort.\n\nFollowing consideration of the favorable vote the shareholder proposal received and in light of this belief, the Board adopted and has reaffirmed a statement of policy on this topic. The Board's policy is that it will only adopt a rights plan if either: (1) shareholders have approved adoption of the rights plan; or (2) the Board (including a majority of the independent members of the Board), in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, makes a determination that, under the circumstances existing at the time, it is in the best interests of 3M's shareholders to adopt a rights plan without the delay in adoption resulting from seeking shareholder approval.\n\nThe Board has directed the Nominating and Governance Committee to review this policy statement on an annual basis and to report to the Board on any recommendations it may have concerning the policy. The terms of the policy, as in effect, are included in 3M's published Corporate Governance Guidelines and its Proxy Statement.\n\n## Key areas of Board oversight\n\n## Board's role in strategy\n\nEach year management presents to the Board, and the Board discusses and approves, detailed long-term strategic plans for the Company. In addition to the Company's overall strategic plan, financial strategic plan, enterprise strategic plans and priorities including Enterprise Operations and environmental, social and governance (ESG), the discussions also focused on breakout sessions with the directors on strategic plans and priorities for each of the four business groups.\n\nOur Company's long-term strategy is outlined in the 3M Value model.\n\n## The 3M Value Model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a9 3M 2021. All Rights Reserved.\n\nOur Value Model differentiates 3M. It represents how we apply science to life, and deliver premium value for our stakeholders: customers, shareholders, employees, communities and business partners. The model is built around our vision, strengths, priorities and values.",

As a company driven by both performance and purpose, we are committed to applying 3M Science to improve every life.\n\n## Our Strengths\n\nOur strengths are the foundation of 3M. They are deep competitive advantages that we leverage across the enterprise, and make 3M greater than the sum of our parts. All 3M businesses are connected and bolstered by our strengths: unique technologies, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands.\n\nWe apply and combine our 51 technology platforms - from adhesives and abrasives, to microreplication and nonwoven materials. We leverage our manufacturing capabilities: one-third of our technology platforms and one-quarter of our patents relate to process engineering. 3M's global reach allows us to serve markets around the world, where we have operations in 70 countries and sales in nearly all countries. Finally, our brand adds value in each of our businesses. We do this while maintaining close engagement with our customers and end-markets, to gain insights that guide our innovation.\n\n## Our Priorities\n\n3M constantly builds on our foundation through four priorities - Portfolio, Transformation, Innovation, and People & Culture - which position us for long-term success. The ongoing review and reshaping of our portfolio - including prioritization within 3M, and acquisitions and divestitures - is key to maximizing value. We are transforming 3M with new business processes, service models and digitalization capabilities. Innovation remains at the center of our model, and is constantly fueled by investments in research and development and capital. Developing our people and enhancing our culture is foundational to each priority, and our ability to grow, evolve and succeed.\n\n## Advancing our Operating Model in 2020\n\n3M has been on a journey to transform how we serve customers, work and compete. The deployment of our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system has enabled us to improve our operations and accelerate the digitalization of 3M, and in January 2020 we implemented the next phase of our transformation: a new global operating model to further align our business groups with customers and go-to-market models. 3M business groups now have full responsibility for strategy, portfolio optimization and resource prioritization across their global operations. The new model is designed to improve growth and operational effectiveness, while empowering employees with more autonomy, reducing layers and streamlining structure. It has enabled us to respond to COVID-19 with agility - from our significant expansion of respirator production, to our ability to maintain business continuity and serve customers.\n\n## Our Values\n\nOur values bind us together as one 3M and are the center of our culture. 3M is strengthening our commitment to our values, including around environmental, social and governance (ESG). We are implementing new goals and initiatives to advance diversity, equity and inclusion within 3M and in our communities. Similarly, 3M is strengthening our long record of environmental stewardship, including new goals to achieve carbon neutrality, further reduce water use and improve water quality. Underpinning everything 3M does is our code of conduct, and 3M has been recognized by Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies for eight consecutive years.",

The Auditor, through consultation with the Company's senior management, periodically assesses the major risks facing the Company and works with those executives responsible for managing each specific risk. The Auditor periodically reviews with the Audit Committee the major risks facing the Company and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate those risks. The Auditor's risk management report, which is provided in advance of the meeting, is reviewed with the entire Board by either the chair of the Audit Committee or the Auditor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management\n\n- \u00b7 Provides consultation to the Auditor when he or she assesses the major risks facing the Company\n- \u00b7 Manages and mitigates risks (e.g., a new, holistic Equity & Community organization was formed to advance social justice and equity in our workplaces, business practices and communities globally)\n- \u00b7 Reports, as needed, to the full Board on how a particular risk is being managed and mitigated\n\nThe Board believes that its oversight of risks, primarily through delegation to the Audit Committee, but also through delegation to other committees to oversee specific risks within their areas of responsibility and expertise, and the sharing of information with the full Board, is appropriate for a diversified technology and manufacturing company like 3M. The chair of each committee that oversees risk provides a summary of the matters discussed with the committee to the full Board following each committee meeting. The minutes of each committee meeting are also provided to all Board members. The Board also believes its oversight of risk is enhanced by its current leadership structure (further discussed below) because the CEO, who is ultimately responsible for the Company's management of risk, also chairs regular Board meetings. Given his in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, the CEO is best able to bring key business issues and risks to the Board's attention.\n\n## Compensation committee\n\n- \u00b7 Oversees risks associated with the Company's compensation practices, including by performing an annual review of the Company's risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices for its employees, including pay equity, diversity and inclusion\n\n## Nominating and governance committee\n\n- \u00b7 Oversees risks associated with the Company's overall governance (e.g., Board diversity, social responsibility, political activities and contributions) and its succession planning process to ensure that the Company has a slate of future, qualified candidates for key management positions\n\n## Science, technology & sustainability committee\n\n- \u00b7 Oversees risks associated with the Company's environmental and product stewardship efforts, including EHS legal and regulatory compliance, as well as significant emerging science and technology, disruptive innovations, materials vulnerability, and geopolitical issues that may impact the company's overall strategy, global business continuity and financial results",

To assist the Board, the Chairman, CEO and Senior Vice President of Human Resources annually assess senior managers and their succession potential for the position of Chairman/CEO and other senior management positions. The Board also reviews the Company's strategies and plans to recruit, retain, develop, protect and fairly compensate its global workforce, with focuses on health and safety, development, diversity, equity and inclusion, and compensation and benefits.\n\n## Commitment to sustainability\n\nAt 3M, we are inspired and motivated by Our Vision of advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life. In collaboration with our employees, customers, partners, government and communities, we apply our expertise and technology to help solve shared global challenges. Sustainability is a core commitment of our company. It plays an important role in our purpose-driven innovation in products, manufacturing processes and new technologies-and we recognize and consistently seek opportunities to do more. It is our ambition to meet the increasing expectations of our customers, employees, investors and stakeholders-and grow our business-by continuing to make bold sustainability commitments and taking stronger actions.\n\n3M has a long-standing commitment to sustainability, from our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program that began in 1975 to our increasingly ambitious set of 2025 Sustainability Goals, which are designed to improve the footprint of our own operations, help our customers meet their own sustainability goals and drive action on global environmental and social issues. We report on these efforts annually in our Sustainability Report. As a global corporation, contributing to society through diverse markets, we believe that we have a significant responsibility to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals across the world. We are also a participant of the United Nations Global Compact, a policy initiative for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to ten principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. We align our Sustainability Report to the guidelines of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations for helping businesses disclose climate-related financial information. Together with our ambition of improving every life and our strong set of 3M values, these commitments drive and inform our formalized approach to sustainability-the 3M Strategic Sustainability Framework. Announced by CEO Mike Roman on Investor Day in November 2018, the Framework directs our efforts to areas where we can make the greatest impact: Science for Circular, Science for Climate and Science for Community.\n\nOur commitment to sustainability encompasses stewardship of water discharges, air emissions and physical waste to minimize our manufacturing processes' environmental impact, including active management of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances).\n\nIn doing so, we are guided by the principles of sound science, corporate responsibility and transparency; and we are committed to engaging in discussions with interested stakeholders about this topic. We have a robust governance framework that guides our sustainability and stewardship actions, with primary Board-level oversight by our Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee, established in late 2019.\n\n| Board of Directors                                                          | \u00b7  Receives regular sustainability updates at Board meetings \u00b7  Reviews sustainability-related risks as part of 3M's enterprise risk program                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Science, Technology  & Sustainability  Committee of the  Board of Directors | \u00b7  Provides primary oversight of 3M's sustainability and stewardship activities \u00b7  Reviews 3M's sustainability policies and program to identify and analyze significant  sustainability, materials vulnerability and geopolitical issues that may impact 3M's  overall business strategy, global business continuity and financial results |\n| Innovation Steering  Committee                                              | \u00b7  Provides leadership, oversight and strategy to encourage and ensure sustainability  opportunities are recognized \u00b7  Develops and monitors adherence with strong sustainability-related policies and procedures \u00b7  Includes 3M's CEO, CTO & SVP Environmental Responsibility, General Counsel, SVP                                       |\n| Chief Sustainability  Officer                                               | \u00b7  Leads 3M's sustainability activities \u00b7  Reports to the Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee, the Innovation  Steering Committee and other internal and external groups                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Sustainability  leaders in business,  areas, and  enterprise-wide           | \u00b7  Drives Strategic Sustainability Framework priorities and initiatives consistent with the  scope of their role \u00b7  Leads customer relationships to solve shared global challenges                                                                                                                                                         |",

At the core is an opportunity to develop technologies and business models that are restorative and regenerative by design. At 3M, we see circular economy as an opportunity to inspire leadership, innovation and disruptive change, all driving impact for a more sustainable future.\n\n## Goals\n\nReduce global water use by an additional 10%, indexed to sales by 2022, 20% by 2025, and 25% by 2030. 1,2\n\nReturn higher quality water to the environment after use in 3M manufacturing operations. In our largest water-using locations, we expect to install state-of-art water purification technology by the end of 2023 and fully operational by 2024. 2\n\nEngage 100% of water-stressed/scarce communities where 3M manufactures, on community-wide approaches to water management by 2025.\n\nDrive supply chain sustainability through targeted raw material traceability and supplier performance assurance by 2025.\n\nReduce manufacturing waste by an additional 10%, indexed to sales by 2025.\n\nAchieve zero landfill status at more than 30% of manufacturing sites by 2025.\n\nRequire every new product that enters 3M's new product commercialization process to have a Sustainability Value Commitment, demonstrating how it drives impact for the greater good.\n\nAt 3M, we support the global consensus set forth in the 2015 Paris Agreement and we are acting on the 2018 findings of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change into our goals, operations and actions. The global climate crisis impacts businesses, our communities and our families. We believe that by working together, we can drive necessary system change.

We know we need new technologies, creative scientists, and evidence-based policies and decisions to drive impactful change. We recognize the importance of well-trained science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates and the critical need for equitable access to STEM education and careers which drives us to advance diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice within our company and community. We believe in the power of science, sharing our expertise, and investing in the bright minds of tomorrow. Together we will lead and design a sustainable future for all.\n\n## Goals\n\nInvest cash and products for education, community, and environmental programs by 2025.\n\nDouble the pipeline of diverse talent in management to build a diverse workforce by 2025.\n\n100% participation in employee development program to advance individual and organizational capabilities by 2025.\n\n## Board structure and processes\n\n## Board's leadership structure\n\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines allow the independent directors flexibility to split or combine the Chairman and CEO responsibilities. The independent directors annually review our leadership structure to determine the structure that is in the best interest of 3M and its shareholders.\n\nThe Board's current leadership structure is characterized by:\n\n- \u00b7 A combined Chairman of the Board and CEO;\n- \u00b7 A strong, independent, and highly experienced Lead Independent Director with well-defined responsibilities that support the Board's oversight responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 A robust committee structure consisting entirely of independent directors with oversight of various types of risks; and\n- \u00b7 An engaged and independent Board.\n\nThe Board believes that this leadership structure provides independent board leadership and engagement while deriving the benefits of having our CEO also serve as Chairman of the Board. As the individual with primary responsibility for managing the Company's day-to-day operations and with in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, the CEO is best positioned to chair regular Board meetings as the directors discuss key business and strategic issues. Coupled with the Lead Independent Director, this combined structure provides independent oversight while avoiding unnecessary confusion regarding the Board's oversight responsibilities and the day-to-day management of business operations.\n\nThe Board believes that adopting a rigid policy on whether to separate or combine the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO would inhibit the Board's ability to provide for a leadership structure that would best serve shareholders. As a result, the Board has rejected adopting a policy permanently separating or combining the positions of Chairman and CEO in its Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are reviewed at least annually and available on our website at www.3M.com , under Investor Relations - Governance. Instead, the Board adopted an approach that allows it, in representing the shareholders' best interests, to decide who should serve as Chairman or CEO, or both, under present or anticipated future circumstances.\n\nProvide 300,000 work hours of skillsbased volunteerism by 3M employees to improve lives and help solve society's toughest challenges by 2025.\n\nProvide training to five million people globally on worker and patient safety by 2025.",

The Board believes that to drive change and continuous improvement within the Company, tempered by respect for 3M's traditions and values, the CEO must have maximum authority. The CEO is primarily responsible for effectively leading significant change, improving operational efficiency, driving growth, managing the Company's day-to-day business, managing the various risks facing the Company, and reinforcing the expectation for all employees of continuing to build on 3M's century-old tradition of uncompromising integrity and doing business the right way.\n\nThe Board also believes that the Company's corporate governance measures ensure that strong, independent directors continue to effectively oversee the Company's management and key issues related to executive compensation, CEO evaluation and succession planning, strategy, risk, and integrity. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide, in part, that:\n\n- \u00b7 Independent directors comprise a substantial majority of the Board;\n- \u00b7 Directors are elected annually by a majority vote in uncontested director elections;\n- \u00b7 Only independent directors serve on the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Science, Technology & Sustainability Committees;\n- \u00b7 The committee chairs establish their respective agendas;\n- \u00b7 The Board and committees may retain their own advisors;\n- \u00b7 The independent directors have complete access to management and employees;\n- \u00b7 The independent directors meet in executive session without the CEO or other employees during each regular Board meeting; and\n- \u00b7 The Board and each committee regularly conduct a self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees function effectively.\n\nThe Board has also designated one of its members to serve as Lead Independent Director, with responsibilities that are similar to those typically performed by an independent chairman.\n\n## Lead Independent Director\n\nSince 2012, our Lead Independent Director has been Michael Eskew, a highly experienced director. He currently serves on the boards of The Allstate Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, and International Business Machines Corporation, and is the former Chairman and CEO of United Parcel Service, Inc.

The Board reviews the recommendations of the Committee and determines the form and amount of director compensation.\n\nIn developing its recommendations, the Nominating and Governance Committee is guided by the following goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Compensation should fairly pay directors for work required in a company of 3M's size and complexity;\n- \u00b7 A significant portion of the total compensation should be paid in common stock (or common stock equivalents) to align directors' interests with the long-term interests of shareholders; and\n- \u00b7 The structure of the compensation should be simple and transparent.\n\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee works with an independent compensation consultant to support its objectives of maintaining a reasonable and appropriate program. For 2020, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ('FW Cook') provided the Committee with expert advice on the compensation of non-employee directors, in addition to analyzing market data on director compensation at the same peer group of companies approved by the Compensation Committee for evaluating Named Executive Officer compensation. Neither the Company nor the Nominating and Governance Committee has any arrangement with any other compensation consultant who has a role in determining or recommending the amount or form of director compensation. For more information on the peer group, see 'Executive peer group' beginning on page 63.\n\nDirectors who are employees of the Company do not receive payment for their Board service.\n\n## Elements of annual compensation for non-employee directors\n\nOur non-employee directors receive an annual retainer, as summarized below, that is intended to approximate the peer-group median mix (cash vs. equity) and overall target total direct compensation that is consistent with 3M's size and market-capitalization value relative to its peers. To better align the interests of our directors with those of our shareholders, the annual stock retainer is subject to a rigorous hold-until-termination requirement. For more information on the peer group, please see the section entitled 'Executive peer group' beginning on page 63 of this Proxy Statement.\n\nIn May 2020, the Nominating and Governance Committee considered a director compensation study prepared by FW Cook and recommended no changes to non-employee director compensation, which the Board accepted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Unless a director elects otherwise (see 'Alternative Times and Forms of Payment' below), the annual cash retainer, annual Lead Director fee and annual Committee Chair fee are paid in cash on a quarterly basis, and the annual stock retainer is paid shortly after the Annual Meeting in deferred stock units ('DSUs'). All such cash fees are prorated based on the number of days of relevant service during the calendar quarter in which the fees are earned, and directors joining the Board after the Annual Meeting receive a prorated annual stock retainer.\n\nDSUs. Each DSU represents the right to receive one share of 3M common stock at a future date. For fees paid in DSUs, the number of units credited to the director's recordkeeping account is determined by dividing the target value of the fees to be paid by the closing sales price for a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for the last trading day immediately preceding the earliest date such amount otherwise could have been be paid to the director if taken on a current basis. The Company also credits the director's account with an additional number of DSUs for each ordinary",

Appropriate adjustments to the DSUs credited to each director's account will be made for stock splits, stock dividends, mergers, consolidations, payments of dividends other than in cash, and similar circumstances affecting 3M common stock. Unless deferred (see 'Alternative Times and Forms of Payment' below), the shares of 3M common stock underlying the DSUs will be distributed in a single lump sum during the month of January in the first year after the director leaves the Board.\n\nAlternative Times and Forms of Payment. In lieu of receiving all or a portion of the annual stock retainer in DSUs, a director may elect to receive shares of 3M common stock on a current basis, but the net after-tax portion of such shares must be retained by the director until he or she leaves the Board. Similarly, in lieu of cash fees, a director may opt to receive 3M common shares, DSUs or deferred cash. Directors also may elect to receive distribution of their deferred cash or settlement of their DSUs as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a single lump sum during the month of January in the first or second year following the year in which they leave the Board; or\n- \u00b7 in a series of three, five, or ten annual installments beginning during the month of January in the first year after they leave the Board.\n\n## 2020 director compensation table\n\nThe table below shows the amounts earned by our non-employee directors (other than Mr. Fitterling) in 2020.

The Company does not grant stock options to non-employee directors. Since all stock awards vest on the grant date, there are no unvested stock awards outstanding at year end.\n- (3) This column includes the incremental cost of complimentary products and matching gifts. Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Company's matching gift program on the same terms as 3M employees. Under this program, the 3M Foundation will match up to $5,000 a year in contributions made by the director to eligible educational institutions and up to $1,000 a year in contributions by the director to eligible charitable organizations.\n\n## Reasonableness of non-employee director compensation\n\nAs described above, our philosophy on director compensation is to pay directors fairly for work required in a company of our size and complexity, make a significant portion of the total compensation equity based to align directors' interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders, and structure compensation in a simple and transparent manner. We believe that the application of this philosophy has resulted in a non-employee director compensation program that reflects best-in-class design with the following provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Retainer-only compensation delivered in a combination of cash and stock-based awards with no fees for attending meetings that are an expected part of board service.\n- \u00b7 Additional retainers for special roles having greater responsibilities, such as Lead Director and committee chairs, to recognize the incremental additional time and effort required.\n- \u00b7 Equity delivered in the form of current or deferred full-value shares, where annual grants are based on a competitive fixed-value formula and immediate vesting helps avoid director entrenchment.\n- \u00b7 A requirement that directors hold until termination from Board service all annual stock retainers earned on or after October 1, 2007, which includes net after-tax shares attributable to current payments and pre-tax shares attributable to deferrals.\n- \u00b7 Flexible voluntary deferral provisions.\n- \u00b7 No material benefits or perquisites.\n- \u00b7 Our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting, includes a $600,000 annual compensation limit on all forms of compensation for non-employee directors.\n\n## Stock retention requirement\n\nThe Board requires each director to hold the net after-tax shares (or, if deferred, a number of DSUs equal to the number of pre-tax shares underlying the DSUs) attributable to all annual stock retainers earned on or after October 1, 2007, until the director leaves the Board. Information regarding accumulated stock and DSUs is set forth under 'Security ownership of management' beginning on page 121.\n\n3M's directors are subject to rigorous hold-until-termination requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Prohibition of hedging, pledging, and other actions\n\nThe Company's stock trading policies prohibit the Company's directors and executive officers from (1) purchasing any financial instrument that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's common stock, including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds; (2) engaging in short sales related to the Company's common stock; (3) placing standing orders; (4) maintaining margin accounts; and (5) pledging 3M securities as collateral for a loan. All transactions in 3M securities by directors and executive officers must be pre-cleared with the Company's General Counsel.\n\n- \u00b7 No hedging\n- \u00b7 No short sales\n- \u00b7 No standing orders\n- \u00b7 No margin accounts\n- \u00b7 No pledging",

Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted ' FOR ' ratification unless a shareholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.\n\nThe Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation (including approval of all fees), retention, and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm ('Independent Accounting Firm') retained to perform the audit of our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ('PwC') to serve as 3M's Independent Accounting Firm for 2021. PwC has been 3M's Independent Accounting Firm since 1998. Prior to that, 3M's Independent Accounting Firm was Coopers & Lybrand from 1975 until its merger with Price Waterhouse in 1998. In accordance with SEC rules and PwC policy, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide service to our Company. For lead and concurring audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of the Company's lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation policy involves a meeting between the Chair of the Audit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well as discussion by the full Committee and with management.\n\nThe Audit Committee annually reviews PwC's independence and performance in connection with the Audit Committee's determination of whether to retain PwC or engage another firm as our Independent Accounting Firm. In the course of these reviews, the Audit Committee considers, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 PwC's historical and recent performance on the 3M audit, including input from those 3M employees with substantial contact with PwC throughout the year about PwC's quality of service provided, and the independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism demonstrated throughout the engagement by PwC and its audit team;\n- \u00b7 an analysis of PwC's known legal risks and significant proceedings;\n- \u00b7 external data relating to audit quality and performance, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ('PCAOB') reports on PwC and its peer firms;\n- \u00b7 PwC's independence;\n- \u00b7 the appropriateness of PwC's fees, on both an absolute basis and as compared to its peer firms;\n- \u00b7 PwC's tenure as our independent auditor and its familiarity with our global operations and businesses, accounting policies and practices and internal control over financial reporting; and\n- \u00b7 PwC's capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of our global operations, including the Company's phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning system on a worldwide basis over the next several years.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the Audit Committee believes that PwC is independent and that it is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders to retain PwC to serve as our Independent Accounting Firm for 2021.",

Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of PwC to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. If the selection of PwC is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another Independent Accounting Firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may in its discretion select a different Independent Accounting Firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.\n\nPwC representatives are expected to attend the Annual Meeting where they will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement.\n\n## Audit Committee report\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The management of the Company is responsible for (i) the preparation of complete and accurate annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements ('financial statements') in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (ii) maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and internal controls designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and laws and regulations, and (iii) an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Independent Accounting Firm is responsible for planning and conducting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ('PCAOB') an audit of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and a review of the Company's quarterly financial statements and expressing opinions on the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting based on the integrated audits.\n\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the Independent Accounting Firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of the Company's results and the assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed significant accounting policies applied by the Company in its financial statements, as well as alternative treatments. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated audited financial statements with management and the Independent Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee has discussed with the Independent Accounting Firm matters required to be discussed pursuant to the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and the Securities and Exchange Commission with Audit Committees.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with the Independent Accounting Firm the auditor's independence from the Company and its management. As part of that review, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letters required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the Independent Accounting Firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed the Independent Accounting Firm's independence from the Company.\n\nThe Audit Committee also has considered whether the Independent Accounting Firm's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that the Independent Accounting Firm is independent from the Company and its management.\n\nThe Audit Committee has discussed with the Company's Internal Audit Department and Independent Accounting Firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel, and representatives of the Independent Accounting Firm in regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting and compliance programs.\n\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for filing with the SEC.\n\nSubmitted by the Audit Committee\n\nDavid B.

The Audit Committee has established a policy requiring its pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Accounting Firm.\n\nThe policy identifies the guiding principles that must be considered by the Audit Committee in approving services to ensure that the Independent Accounting Firm's independence is not impaired; describes the Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services that may be provided and the non-audit services that may not be performed; and sets forth the pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. The policy provides for the pre-approval of specific types of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other services and a limited fee estimate range for such services on an annual basis. The policy also requires specific pre-approval of all permitted services not already included in the annual pre-approval. The Independent Accounting Firm is required to report periodically to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided in accordance with their pre-approval and the fees for the services performed to date.\n\nThe Audit Committee's policy delegates to its Chair the authority to address requests for pre-approval of services in certain limited circumstances between Audit Committee meetings. The chair, in his discretion, must either seek immediate approval by e-mail from the other Audit Committee members, or report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee for its approval at its next scheduled meeting.\n\nThe Audit Committee may not delegate to management the Audit Committee's responsibility to pre-approve permitted services of the Independent Accounting Firm.\n\nAll Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services described below were approved by the Audit Committee before services were rendered.\n\n## Fees of the independent accounting firm\n\nThe following table represents fees billed for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ('PwC') for the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, and fees billed for other services rendered by PwC during those periods.\n\n## Audit and non-audit fees ($ in millions)\n\n|                    | 2019   | 2020   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Audit Fee:         | $ 18.8 | $ 19.1 |\n| Audit-Related Fee: | 1.3    | 0.4    |\n| Tax Fee:           | 0.7    | 0.5    |\n| All Other Fee:     | 0.1    | 0.0    |\n| Total              | $ 20.9 | $ 20.0 |\n\nIn the above table, in accordance with SEC rules, 'Audit' fees consisted of audit work and review services, as well as work generally only the independent registered public accounting firm can reasonably be expected to provide, such as statutory audits, comfort letters, consents, and review of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'Audit-related' fees consisted principally of carve out audit procedures, internal control and system audit procedures for periods prior to the rollout of the ERP system, agreed-upon procedures, employee benefit plan audits, and other attestation services. 'Tax' fees consisted principally of tax compliance services in foreign jurisdictions, assistance with transfer pricing documentation, and advice on foreign and domestic tax related matters. 'All Other' fees consisted of general industry and accounting training, licenses for accounting research software, and other permissible services that do not fall into the three categories listed above.",

Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted 'FOR' this proposal unless a shareholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.\n\nSection 14A of the Securities Exchange Act provides our shareholders with the opportunity to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as described in this Proxy Statement. This is the eleventh year that the Company is asking shareholders to vote on this type of proposal, known as a 'say-on-pay' proposal.\n\nWe believe that our executive compensation program is consistent with our core compensation principles and is structured to assure that those principles are implemented. At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 12, 2020, approximately 93 percent of the votes cast on this issue voted to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in last year's Proxy Statement. Although the vote was non-binding, the Compensation Committee believes this level of approval percentage indicates that our shareholders strongly support our core compensation principles and our executive compensation program.\n\nThus, the Company is submitting to shareholders the following resolution for their consideration and approval:\n\n'RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and related narrative).'\n\nWe encourage you to read the entire Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement to learn more about our executive compensation program and the impact that our financial performance has on the annual and long-term incentive compensation earned by our leadership team.\n\nWhile the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee intend to carefully consider the results of the voting on this proposal when making future decisions regarding executive compensation, the vote is not binding on the Company or the Board and is advisory in nature. The Company currently holds advisory votes on the compensation of named executive officers annually. Accordingly, the next such advisory vote is expected to occur at the 2022 Annual Meeting.\n\n## Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation",

We achieve this alignment by:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that a substantial portion of our executives' target Total Direct Compensation (cash plus long-term incentives) is performance-based.\n- \u00b7 90 percent for our Chief Executive Officer\n- \u00b7 78-82 percent for our other Named Executive Officers\n- \u00b7 Using multiple performance-based metrics focused primarily on revenue and earnings performance, increase in 3M's common stock price, efficient use of capital, and free cash flow conversion, which 3M believes drive long-term value.\n\n## Selected 2020 financial performance results\n\n3M's 2020 financial performance was impacted by global macroeconomic uncertainty throughout the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This uncertainty affected most of the Company's end markets, customers, and global operations. Throughout 2020, the Company delivered strong operational execution, aggressively managed costs, generated robust free cash flow while maintaining disciplined capital allocation, and strengthened its financial flexibility. The table below reflects the Company's performance against the key metrics underlying the Company's performance share awards, both as determined in accordance with GAAP and as adjusted consistent with the terms of the Company's 2020 incentive compensation arrangements to better reflect the Committee's view of the Company's 2020 operating performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEarnings Per\n\nShare Growth\n\nOrganic Local Currency\n\nSales Growth\n\nReturn on Invested Capital\n\nFree Cash Flow Conversion\n\nResults determined in accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable)\n\n18.4%\n\n-1.7%\n\n18.2% *\n\n123%*\n\nResults as adjusted to better reflect the Committee's view of the Company's 2020 operating performance\n\n-5.7% *\n\n-1.7%\n\n17.1% *\n\n132%*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * See Appendix A to this Proxy Statement for a reconciliation of earnings per share, operating margin performance, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion to our results for the most directly comparable financial measures as reported under GAAP, and the calculation of return on invested capital.",

For more information concerning the 2020 annual incentive payouts made to the Named Executive Officers, see '2020 AIP attainments and payouts' on page 68.\n\n## Performance share award payouts and accruals (long-term incentive compensation)\n\nThe three-year performance period for the 2018 Performance Share Awards issued to the Named Executive Officers ended on December 31, 2020. Based on the financial results achieved during 2018 - 2020 and excluding dividend equivalents, the Named Executive Officers received 79.3 percent of the target performance shares subject to their 2018 Performance Share Awards. After considering the change in the market value of 3M's common stock over the three-year performance period and the additional shares delivered pursuant to the dividend equivalent rights granted as part of the 2018 Performance Share Awards, the value of the total number of 3M shares delivered to the Named Executive Officers in settlement of these awards (determined using the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 31, 2020) equaled 59.9 percent of the initial target grant value approved by the Committee.\n\nWhen evaluating the payouts for these awards against the Company's performance, it is important to keep in mind the weightings applied to each year (2018 - 50 percent; 2019 - 30 percent; and 2020 - 20 percent) and each metric (Relative Organic Volume Growth - 40 percent; Return on Invested Capital - 20 percent; Earnings per Share Growth 20 percent; and Free Cash Flow Conversion - 20 percent). As illustrated in the charts below, the payout of 2018 Performance Share Awards reflects the mixed results achieved during the performance period.",

To illustrate this point, the charts below show the percent of target performance shares accrued each year during the relevant performance period based on the Company's performance.\n\n## Percent of target performance shares accrued by year (excluding dividend equivalents)\n\n## 2018 Performance Share Awards (actual)\n\n79.3% Total (actual)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2019 Performance Share Awards\n\n## 2020 Performance Share Awards\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe final payout percentage for each performance share award equals the sum of the payout percentages for each year during the performance period based on the Company's performance against the financial goals established by the Committee at the beginning of the performance period.",

Our stock ownership guidelines require covered executives, including the Named Executive Officers, to own amounts of Company stock having a value exceeding a specified multiple of their base salary. If the market price of 3M's stock declines, so does the value of the stock they own. Similarly, stock options and other long-term incentive awards held by our Named Executive Officers increase or decrease in value along with increases and decreases in the value of 3M's common stock.\n\nThe stock and stock options held by our Named Executive Officers throughout 2020 decreased in value during the year as the closing price for a share of the Company's common stock on the NYSE decreased from $176.42 on December 31, 2019, to $174.79 on December 31, 2020.\n\n## Total shareholder return\n\nThe graphs below illustrate 3M's stock performance relative to the stock performance of the S&P 500 and the peer companies included in the Company's executive peer group, as described under 'Use of market data' beginning on page 63.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: 5-year period = Five years ending 12/31/20; 3-year period = Three years ending 12/31/20; 1-year period = One year ending 12/31/20\n\nSource: Bloomberg",

In 2020, approximately 93 percent of the votes cast on our say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in last year's Proxy Statement. Although the vote was non-binding, the Committee believes this level of approval indicates that shareholders strongly support our executive compensation programs and policies.

For more information, see 'Annual incentive' beginning on page 65.\n- \u00b7 Appointed Monish Patolawala as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and approved his initial compensation arrangements (consisting of an annual base salary of $885,000, target annual incentive compensation of $885,000, make-whole and inducement equity awards with an aggregate target grant value of $4,765,246, and prorated 2020 long-term incentive compensation awards with an aggregate target grant value of $1,625,000). Mr. Patolawala's compensation arrangement includes no employment agreement or supplemental retirement benefits. For more information, see 'Section V: 2020 compensation decisions and performance highlights - Monish Patolawala' on page 75.\n- \u00b7 Approved implementation of a program under which the Company's executives (other than the Company's Chief Executive Officer) will be offered the opportunity to indicate a preference to receive 25 percent of the target grant value of their annual long-term incentive compensation awards in the form of restricted stock units rather than stock options, beginning with the annual grants made in 2021. For more information about the Named Executive Officers 2020 annual long-term incentive compensation arrangements, see '2020 long-term incentive awards' on page 70.\n- \u00b7 Amended and restated the 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, subject to shareholder approval, to increase the number of shares available for future awards and make certain other changes. For more information, see 'Proposal 4: Approval of the Amended and Restated 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan' on page 102.\n\nSpecial note regarding COVID-19 impact on incentive compensation arrangements\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created both challenges and opportunities for 3M that were not reflected in the 2020 performance goals established for the Named Executive Officers' annual and long-term incentive compensation arrangements. Although the Committee believes that the pandemic had a significant, adverse impact on the ability of executives to meet certain performance goals, the Committee determined not to adjust the targets or payouts for any of the Named Executive Officers. Similarly, the Committee determined not to make any design changes to the Company's 2021 executive compensation program based on the pandemic. The Committee believes this approach is consistent with the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy.",

These principles align with the Company's vision and strategies, balance both individual and enterprise performance, and seek to provide competitive wages and benefits with consistent positioning in the median range of the most-relevant markets to employees based on roles, responsibilities, skills, and performance.\n\nWith respect to 3M's executive compensation program, we use the following core principles, which are intended to support our pay-for-performance philosophy:\n\n- \u00b7 Total Direct Compensation should be competitive to attract the best talent to 3M, motivate executives to perform at their highest levels, reward individual contributions that improve the Company's ability to deliver outstanding performance, and retain those executives with the leadership abilities and skills necessary for building long-term shareholder value;\n- \u00b7 The portion of Total Direct Compensation that is at-risk and performance-based should increase with the level of an individual's responsibility;\n- \u00b7 The program should balance incentives for delivering outstanding long-term, sustainable performance against the potential to encourage inappropriate risk-taking;\n- \u00b7 The metrics and targets for earning performance-based incentives should be consistent with, and aligned to, increasing shareholder value over the long term; and\n- \u00b7 A significant portion of each executive's personal net worth should be tied to the value of 3M common stock as further motivation to build long-term shareholder value and mitigate the risk of inappropriate risk-taking.\n\n- X Have employment or change in control agreements with any of our executive officers.\n- X Provide tax gross-ups on executive perquisites, other than for taxable relocation benefits.\n- X Have agreements that would provide automatic 'single-trigger' accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to any of our executive officers upon a change in control.\n- X Pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned equity awards.\n- X Reprice stock options without the approval of 3M shareholders, except for 'anti-dilution' adjustments (such as adjustments in connection with a stock split, spinoff, etc.).",

The companies in this executive peer group were selected because (1) their performance was monitored regularly by the same market analysts who monitor the performance of 3M (investment peers) and they are considered major business-segment competitors used internally for performance comparisons, or (2) they met criteria based on similarity of their business and pay models, market capitalization (based on an eight-quarter rolling average), and annual revenues and compete with 3M for talent.\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n## Latest Four Quarters Revenues (1)\n\n## Trailing Eight-Quarter Average Market Capitalization (1)\n\n| Johnson & Johnson                   | $82,584   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|\n| General Electric Company            | $79,619   |\n| United Technologies Corporation (2) | $77,453   |\n| The Procter & Gamble Company        | $73,975   |\n| Caterpillar Inc.                    | $41,748   |\n| Deere & Company                     | $36,995   |\n| Honeywell International, Inc.       | $32,637   |\n| 3M Company                          | $32,184   |\n| Medtronic plc                       | $27,926   |\n| Danaher Corporation                 | $22,284   |\n| Johnson Controls International plc  | $22,082   |\n| Kimberly-Clark Corporation          | $19,140   |\n| Eaton Corporation plc               | $17,858   |\n| Emerson Electric Co.                | $16,795   |\n| Illinois Tool Works Inc.            | $12,574   |\n| TE Connectivity Ltd.                | $12,526   |\n| Corning Incorporated                | $11,303   |\n| 75th Percentile                     | $49,805   |\n| Mean                                | $36,719   |\n| Median                              | $25,105   |\n| 25th Percentile                     | $17,592   |\n| 3 M Percentile Rank                 | 59%       |\n\n| Johnson & Johnson                   | $379,274   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|\n| The Procter & Gamble Company        | $307,585   |\n| Medtronic plc                       | $140,905   |\n| Danaher Corporation                 | $125,618   |\n| Honeywell International, Inc.       | $122,110   |\n| United Technologies Corporation (2) | $109,112   |\n| 3M Company                          | $ 94,833   |\n| Caterpillar Inc.                    | $ 82,536   |\n| General Electric Company            | $ 81,912   |\n| Deere & Company                     | $ 64,451   |\n| Illinois Tool Works Inc.            | $ 55,937   |\n| Kimberly-Clark Corporation          | $ 46,662   |\n| Emerson Electric Co.                | $ 41,734   |\n| Eaton Corporation plc               | $ 39,627   |\n| TE Connectivity Ltd.                | $ 32,365   |\n| Johnson Controls International plc  | $ 31,179   |\n| Corning Incorporated                | $ 23,464   |\n| 75th Percentile                     | $122,987   |\n| Mean                                | $105,279   |\n| Median                              | $ 73,181   |\n| 25th Percentile                     | $ 41,207   |\n| 3M Percentile Rank                  | 63%        |\n\nThe Committee, with assistance from its independent compensation consultant, periodically reviews the composition of the executive peer group to determine whether any changes are appropriate. Following its review in August 2020, FW Cook recommended, and the Committee approved, the changes below to ensure that 3M's size positioning remains balanced in the executive compensation peer group. These changes did not affect 2020 compensation decisions made by the Committee.",

Although the number and identity of the companies varies from year to year and from survey to survey, each of the companies included in the survey peer group had annual revenue exceeding $10 billion. All of the companies in the survey peer group also participate in one or more executive compensation surveys obtained from three consulting firms: Aon, FW Cook, and Willis Towers Watson. Pay data for the survey peer group is statistically regressed to recognize the different sizes of the comparator companies (based on annual revenues) as compared to the size of 3M. The Committee does not review the identity of the companies in the survey peer group.\n\n## How the Committee establishes target compensation levels\n\nThe Committee considers the pay data from the Peer Groups as a reference point to inform its decisions about overall compensation opportunities and specific compensation elements. The Committee also uses multiple reference points when establishing targeted compensation levels. The Committee does not benchmark specific compensation elements or total compensation to any specific percentile relative to the Peer Groups or the broader United States market. Instead, the Committee applies informed judgment in establishing targeted pay levels for the Named Executive Officers, considering not only pay data from the Peer Groups, but also factors such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the breadth and complexity of the executive's duties and responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 the quality of the executive's leadership;\n- \u00b7 the financial and operational performance of the business activities for which the executive is responsible;\n- \u00b7 the executive's ability to successfully achieve assigned goals related to company culture;\n- \u00b7 the annual performance evaluation that Mr. Roman, assisted by 3M's Senior Vice President, Human Resources, and other Company employees, completes for each Named Executive Officer (other than himself) and the annual performance evaluation that the Compensation Committee completes for Mr. Roman;\n- \u00b7 the executive's ability to successfully achieve assigned goals related to environmental, social, and governance matters, including sustainability goals;\n- \u00b7 the executive's performance rating for the prior year;\n- \u00b7 experience and time in their current position (or other positions with comparable duties and responsibilities); and\n- \u00b7 internal pay equity.\n\nThe Committee also uses information on the executive compensation practices at companies in the executive peer group when considering design changes to the Company's executive compensation program. Overall, the Company believes that use of this information from the Peer Groups enables the Committee to create better alignment between executive pay and performance and to help ensure that 3M can attract and retain high-performing executive leaders.",

Participation in the AIP is intended to align a significant portion of participants' Total Cash Compensation with the near-term financial performance of the Company and its business units. Each executive is assigned a target amount of annual incentive compensation as part of his or her target Total Cash Compensation, but the actual amount paid under the AIP depends on the financial performance of 3M and its relevant business units and the executive's individual performance, in each case, measured against preestablished goals and objectives.\n\nBasic calculation. The amount a participant earns under the AIP is calculated by multiplying his or her weighted-average target annual incentive compensation opportunity for the plan year by a business performance factor and an individual performance multiplier.\n\n## Total WeightedAverage Target AIP Payout\n\nBusiness Performance Factor\n\nIndividual Performance Multiplier\n\nCalculated amount that takes into account any mid-year changes in the participant's target annual incentive compensation opportunity\n\nCorporate and business unit results adjust AIP pay based on performance against preestablished goals\n\nPayouts generally increased 20 percent, decreased 30 percent, or left unchanged based on individual performance against preestablished goals and objectives, which can be both quantitative and qualitative\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n=\n\nAnnual Incentive Payment\n\nFinal payment amount may range from 0% to 200% of an individual's total weighted-average target AIP payout",

The amount of annual incentive compensation paid to an eligible employee generally is increased 20 percent, reduced 30 percent, or left unchanged depending on his or her performance during the year. When determining the individual performance multipliers to be used for the Named Executive Officers, the Committee considers the individual performance of the Named Executive Officers using the performance evaluations described under 'How the Committee establishes target compensation levels' on page 64.\n\n## Long-term incentives\n\n## 2020 performance share awards\n\nPerformance shares awarded in 2020 will result in the issuance of actual shares of 3M common stock to 3M's Named Executive Officers if the Company achieves certain financial goals over the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. The number of shares of 3M common stock that will be issued for each 2020 performance share is linked to the Company's performance as measured by the criteria of Earnings per Share Growth (20 percent weighting), Relative Organic Volume Growth (40 percent weighting), Return on Invested Capital (20 percent weighting), and Free Cash Flow Conversion (20 percent weighting). These performance criteria were selected because they are aligned with 3M's operating plan and the financial objectives communicated to shareholders, and the Committee believes that they are important drivers of long-term shareholder value. Attainment of these four independent performance criteria is measured separately for each calendar year during the three-year measurement period, with each year weighted as follows: 2020 - 50 percent; 2021 - 30 percent; and 2022 - 20 percent. However, the targets by which the Company's performance is measured do not change over the three-year performance period.\n\nExcluding shares issued pursuant to dividend equivalent rights, the actual number of shares of 3M common stock that will be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2022, may be anywhere from 0 percent to 200 percent of the target number of performance shares awarded, depending on the performance of the Company during the performance period. However, an executive may forfeit all or a portion of such shares if he or she does not remain employed by the Company throughout the three-year performance period.\n\nFor awards tied to the achievement of performance goals over the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, the Committee approved the targets shown below for determining the number of shares of 3M common stock to be delivered for each target performance share awarded, with the total number of shares actually delivered being the sum of the number of shares earned as a result of the Company's achievement of each of the four financial goals, plus the number of shares issued pursuant to dividend equivalent rights granted with respect to the shares earned. In the event that the Company's performance as measured by any of these performance criteria falls between any of the percentages listed below, the number of shares of 3M common stock earned will be determined by linear interpolation.",

The sole purpose of these formulas, which were approved by the Committee in February 2020, is to establish a method for determining the number of shares of 3M common stock to be delivered for the performance share awards described above. 3M is not providing any guidance, nor updating any prior guidance, of its future performance with the disclosure of these formulas, and you are cautioned not to rely on these formulas as a prediction of 3M's future performance.\n\n## 2020 stock options\n\nStock options granted to the Named Executive Officers in 2020 as part of their long-term incentive compensation have the following features:\n\n- \u00b7 an exercise price equal to the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for the date of grant;\n- \u00b7 a ratable three-year vesting schedule; and\n- \u00b7 a maximum term of 10 years.\n\n## Other awards\n\nOur Named Executive Officers also may receive other equity awards on an ad hoc basis as new hires or for recognition and retention, promotions, or other purposes.\n\n## Benefits and perquisites\n\nThe Company's Named Executive Officers participate in the same health care, disability, life insurance, pension, and 401(k) benefit plans available to most of the Company's U.S. employees. They also are eligible to receive certain additional benefits and perquisites that are provided for the executives' convenience (relocation assistance for moves required by 3M, financial planning assistance, and meals when attending to 3M business, for example), financial security (nonqualified deferred compensation plans and additional group term life insurance coverage, for example), personal security (home security equipment/monitoring, for example) or personal health (on-site exercise facilities and physical exams, for example). Our Named Executive Officers and other employees also may receive Company tickets for sporting or other events. The Company believes that the benefits and perquisites offered generally are similar to those of our peers and assist in attracting and retaining executives. In some cases, there is no incremental cost to the Company associated with providing these additional benefits and perquisites (physical exams and certain tickets to events, for example) or the executives pay all or a substantial portion of the incremental costs incurred by the Company (on-site exercise facilities, for example).\n\nThese additional benefits and perquisites generally are provided on a consistent basis only to a limited group of our most senior U.S. employees (including all of the Named Executive Officers), although enhanced personal security equipment and monitoring is provided only to our Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Company also operates aircraft that are used by our senior officers and other employees to conduct company business. For personal security reasons, the Board of Directors requires our Chief Executive Officer to use the Company's aircraft for all air travel, both business and personal. Our Chief Executive Officer's spouse and other guests also may accompany him on flights.\n\nThe incremental cost to the Company of providing these additional benefits to the Named Executive Officers is reflected in the All Other Compensation Table. No tax gross-ups are provided on any of these additional benefits and perquisites other than taxable relocation benefits.",

Each Named Executive Officer's target annual incentive for the year equaled the difference between his or her target Total Cash Compensation and annual base salary (weighted to reflect mid-year adjustments, if appropriate).\n\nBusiness performance factor. For purposes of measuring business performance against the targets established for 2020 and converting that performance into a business performance factor determined in accordance with the terms of the AIP, each Named Executive Officer was assigned to an appropriate business unit for each metric (the entire Company, in some cases). The metrics, relevant business unit, goals, and attainments used to calculate the business performance factor for each Named Executive Officer are shown below.\n\n## Business performance factor calculation for all Named Executive Officers other than Ms. Poul and Mr. Vale\n\nDollar amounts in millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Performance  Metrics                          | Business  Unit              | Threshold ($)   | Target ($)   | Maximum ($)   | Actual vs.   |     | Target Payout % Weighting   | Weighted  Payout %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| Local  Currency                               | 3M  Worldwide               |                 | 32,845       |               | 97%          | 85% | 50%                         | 42.5%                |\n| Sales vs. Plan                                | 3M  Worldwide               | 28,492          | 33,520       |               | 97%          | 85% | 50%                         | 42.5%                |\n| Business Unit   Economic                      | 3M                          |                 | 4,698        | 4,698         |              | 80% |                             |                      |\n| Profit 1  vs. Plan                            | Worldwide                   | 4,330           | 5,094        |               | 5,603 92%    | 80% | 20%                         | 16.0%                |\n| Total 3M  Economic  Profit 1  vs. Prior  Year | 3M  Worldwide               | 1,647 2,286     |              | 3,229         | 4,844 71%    | 80% | 42% 30%                     | 12.6%                |\n| Business Performance Factor                   | Business Performance Factor |                 |              |               |              |     |                             | 71.1%                |\n\n## Business performance factor calculation for Ms. Poul\n\nDollar amounts in millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Performance  Metrics              | Business  Unit                            | Threshold ($)   | Target ($)   | Maximum ($)   | Actual vs.   |     | Target Payout % Weighting   | Weighted  Payout %   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-----|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| Local  Currency   Sales vs. Plan  | Health  Care  Business  Group             | 7,551 8,563     | 8,883        | 9,950         | 96%          | 80% | 50%                         | 40.0%                |\n| Business Unit  Economic  Profit 1 | Health  Care                              | 1,291           |              |               | 83%          | 0%  | 20%                         | 0.0%                 |\n| vs. Plan 1  vs. Prior             | Business  Group                           | 1,324 2,286     | 1,558        | 1,714         |              |     |                             |                      |\n| Total 3M  Economic  Profit Year   | 3M  Worldwide Business Performance Factor | 1,647           | 3,229        | 4,844         | 71%          | 42% | 30%                         | 12.6% 52.6%          |",

See Appendix A for a reconciliation of local currency sales to our results for the most directly comparable financial measure as reported under GAAP, and the calculation of 2019 and 2020 Economic Profit.\n\nIndividual performance multiplier. The amount of annual incentive compensation paid to an eligible employee generally is increased 20 percent, reduced 30 percent, or left unchanged depending on his or her performance during the year. The Committee determined the individual performance multiplier for each Named Executive Officer, as shown in the table under 'Final 2020 AIP payouts' below, based upon the annual performance evaluation completed for each Named Executive Officer other than Mr. Gangestad. The Committee generally does not conduct detailed performance assessments for executives who depart the Company before the end of the year, but instead discusses the former executive's performance with the Company's Chief Executive Officer to determine whether a sufficient basis exists to increase or decrease the executive's AIP payout for the year on the basis of individual performance. Following this approach, the Committee discussed Mr. Gangestad's 2020 performance with Mr. Roman and decided not to increase or decrease the amount of his prorated 2020 AIP payout based on individual performance. For a listing of selected 2020 performance highlights of each Named Executive Officer (other than Mr. Gangestad), see 'Section V: 2020 compensation decisions and performance highlights' beginning on page 73.\n\nFinal 2020 AIP payouts. At its meeting in February 2021, the Committee approved (and with respect to Mr. Roman, the independent members of the Board of Directors ratified) a payment under the AIP to each executive, as shown below.\n\n| Named Executive Officer   | Target 2020  Annual Incentive*  ($)   | Business  Performance  Factor   | Individual  Performance  Multiplier   | Approved 2020  AIP Payout**  ($)   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Michael F.

For example, the performance goals for 2020 Performance Share Awards relate to the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. Similarly, the performance goals for 2019 Performance Share Awards relate to the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, and so on, as shown below. Performance against the goals established for each award are measured separately for each calendar year during the measurement period, with each year weighted as shown below in parenthesis. The Committee believes this structure reduces motivation to maximize performance in any one period by providing the highest-level rewards only by building sustainable long-term results.\n\n| Award    | 2018         | 2019         | 2020         | 2021         | 2022         |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 2018 PSA | Year 1 (50%) | Year 2 (30%) | Year 3 (20%) |              |              |\n| 2019 PSA |              | Year 1 (50%) | Year 2 (30%) | Year 3 (20%) |              |\n| 2020 PSA |              |              | Year 1 (50%) | Year 2 (30%) | Year 3 (20%) |\n\nThe Committee periodically reviews the Company's performance against the goals established for each performance share award throughout the duration of its measurement period.

Roman\n\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Selected 2020 performance highlights\n\n- \u00b7 Provided steady leadership to 3M in the context of a global, transformative pandemic crisis that called for unprecedented expansion of N95 respirator production capacity, agile management of global/local supply chain constraints and logistics challenges, and frequent engagement with government officials, key partners, and media on sensitive pandemic-related issues. Drove timely implementation of efficient short-term crisis response and led efforts to develop a plan to address long-term pandemic issues and safely return employees to the workplace. Championed community relief globally leading to more than $30M donated in products and cash from 3M and 3Mgives.\n- \u00b7 Led efficient operation of 3M resulting in adjusted free cash flow conversion of 132 percent and strong financial returns in the context of a challenging macro environment.*\n- \u00b7 Refocused efforts to expand and accelerate new product development in high growth segments and improve the quality of our new product pipeline.\n- \u00b7 Continued to provide the vision and strategy for the deployment of the Company's multi-year business model transformation (referred to as 'Advance 3M') that is intended to deliver efficiency through simplicity and standardization with deep market engagement.\n- \u00b7 Established 3M's new social justice agenda, including launching platforms for change (racial justice for the future of work and empowering an inclusive culture). Established a new community coalition and announced a plan to invest $50M over five years to address racial opportunity gaps through workforce development initiatives. Committed to a listen, understand, act agenda inside 3M. Increased 3M's internal inclusion index score from 70 percent to 76 percent through this agenda.\n- \u00b7 Oversaw the continued development of the senior leadership team, including the appointment of a new Senior Vice President and Chief Finance Officer. Created a learning environment in which 92 percent of people leaders (and 68 percent of all employees) received development training. Introduced a new performance management system (referred to as 'Performance Everyday') that is intended to ensure employees receive timely and effective feedback in a cost-effective and efficient manner.\n- * See Appendix A to this Proxy Statement for a reconciliation of free cash flow conversion to our results for the most directly comparable financial measures as reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\n\n## 2020 Compensation decisions\n\nIn February 2020, the Committee approved, and the independent members of the Board ratified, the following compensation actions with respect to Mr. Roman:\n\n- \u00b7 holding base salary at $1,299,948 per year;\n- \u00b7 a six percent increase to target total cash compensation (from $3,380,000 to $3,575,000), effective April 1, 2020, all of which was allocated to Mr. Roman's target annual incentive compensation opportunity; and\n- \u00b7 the issuance of long-term incentive awards with an aggregate performance-adjusted target grant value of $10 million, which was split equally between performance shares and stock options.\n\nThe increase to Mr. Roman's target total cash compensation was intended to progress Mr. Roman's compensation closer to the market median and align a greater percentage of his cash compensation with the near-term operational performance of the Company.\n\nIn February 2021, the Committee approved a 2020 AIP payout for Mr. Roman in the amount of $1,582,901, which represented 71 percent of his target.

At the time of his appointment, this target Total Cash Compensation approximated the median value of the corresponding compensation paid to chief financial officers at companies in the executive peer group. The Committee believed that this amount was appropriate in view of Mr. Patolawala's strong history of successful performance at positions of increasing responsibility (including his previous position as chief financial officer of GE Healthcare and vice president of operational transformation of General Electric Company) and was necessary to attract Mr. Patolawala to join 3M. In addition, the Committee approved relocation benefits and a $700,000 hiring bonus payable in two installments: $400,000 payable within 30 days of his start date and the remainder payable within 30 days of the first anniversary of his start date, assuming continued employment.\n\nUpon Mr. Patolawala's commencement of employment, he entered into an agreement that protects 3M's confidential information and includes noncompetition and non-solicitation covenants (referred to as the 'Protective Covenant Agreement'). In consideration of Mr. Patolawala's execution of the Protective Covenant Agreement and as an inducement for him to join 3M, the Committee granted Mr. Patolawala (i) a special one-time make-whole restricted stock unit award (referred to as the 'Special Make-whole RSU Award') with a target grant value of $2,765,246, vesting in a series of equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, (ii) a special one-time inducement restricted stock unit grant (referred to as the 'Special Inducement RSU Award') with a target grant value of $1,000,000 vesting in a single installment on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, (iii) a special one-time inducement 2020 performance share award (referred to as the 'Special Inducement PSA') with a target grant value of $1,000,000, vesting in a single installment on December 31, 2022, (iv) a prorated 2020 performance share award (referred to as the 'Prorated 2020 PSA') with a target grant value of $812,500, vesting in a single installment on December 31, 2022, and (v) a prorated 2020 stock option award with a target grant value of $812,500, vesting in a series of equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Mr. Patolawala may forfeit all or a portion of the equity awards described above if he does not remain employed by the Company through the applicable vesting date. The performance period and goals for both the inducement and prorated 2020 Performance Share Awards are the same as those of other grants made to 3M's executive officers on March 2, 2020.\n\nMr. Patolawala is eligible to participate in the Severance Plan, the benefits of which and the circumstances under which they will be made available are summarized under 'Potential payments upon termination or change in control' beginning on page 96. In the event that Mr. Patolawala voluntarily resigns from employment with the Company for 'Good Reason' (as defined in the Severance Plan and described on page 98) or his employment is terminated by the Company other than for 'Misconduct' (as defined in the 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan and described on pages 102-103), he also will be entitled to receive (i) accelerated payment of any then unpaid portion of the hiring bonus and (ii) accelerated vesting of the Special Make-whole RSU Award and the Special Inducement RSU Award and continued vesting of a prorated portion of the Special Inducement PSA, in each case, subject to his execution of an effective and irrevocable general release of all claims against the Company and its affiliates.",

Although each such Named Executive Officer (other than Mr. Roman and Mr. Patolawala) has until December 31, 2022, to acquire beneficial ownership of any additional shares required as a result of the recalculation, each such individual beneficially owned a sufficient number of shares on December 31, 2020, to comply with the new ownership levels required.\n- ** As a result of Mr. Roman's appointment to the position of Chief Executive Officer and the resulting increase in his required level of ownership, effective July 1, 2018, from a multiple of three times his annual base salary to a multiple of six times his annual base salary, Mr. Roman has until June 30, 2023, to acquire beneficial ownership of any additional shares required as a result of the December 31, 2019, recalculation. Mr. Roman beneficially owned a sufficient number of shares on December 31, 2020, to comply with the new ownership level required.\n- *** At the time Mr. Patolawala joined the Company as its Chief Financial Officer, effective July 1, 2020, he became subject to a stock multiple of three times his annual base salary. Mr. Patolawala has until June 30, 2025, to acquire beneficial ownership of a sufficient number of shares to comply with the ownership level required. Mr. Patolawala beneficially owned a sufficient number of shares on December 31, 2020, to comply with the new ownership level required.\n\nCalculation of Required Ownership . The number of shares required to be beneficially owned in order to comply with the guidelines is determined by dividing the specified multiple of the executive's annual base salary on the calculation date by the closing trading price of 3M common stock on such date.\n\nCalculation Dates . The number of shares required to comply with the guidelines is calculated (or recalculated) on each of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the date an executive first becomes subject to the guidelines;\n- \u00b7 the date an executive's target ownership multiple increases or decreases due to a change in position; and\n- \u00b7 every third anniversary of December 31, 2019.\n\nGrace Period . Each covered executive is expected to attain beneficial ownership of the required number of shares of 3M stock by the later of the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment to the position triggering the calculation date or, if an executive's required ownership level increases as a result of a triennial recalculation, the third anniversary of the calculation date.\n\nShares Counted . For purposes of determining compliance with the stock ownership guidelines, the following shares are considered to be beneficially owned by the covered executive:\n\n- \u00b7 shares owned directly by a covered executive or by members of the covered executive's immediate family;\n- \u00b7 shares owned indirectly through a covered executive's account in the Company's 401(k) plan or another deferred compensation plan;\n- \u00b7 outstanding shares of restricted stock owned by a covered executive; and\n- \u00b7 shares underlying outstanding restricted stock units held by a covered executive.\n\nStock Holding Requirements . If a covered executive is not making adequate progress to meet the specified level of ownership by the end of the grace period, the guidelines provide that he or she must hold a sufficient number of the after-tax 3M shares received upon the next payout of performance shares to be on track to satisfy the required ownership level.",

        "page_content": "Other remedial actions . Whether or not an executive's actions trigger a potential clawback, 3M also may take other remedial actions to appropriately address employee conduct that is considered detrimental to the Company. Depending on the circumstances, such other actions may include, without limitation, reducing the executive's duties and responsibilities, limiting the progression of the executive's career with 3M, reducing the executive's base salary or target total cash compensation, reducing the target grant value of the executive's future long-term incentive compensation awards, causing the forfeiture of the executive's outstanding long-term incentive awards, or terminating the executive's employment with 3M.\n\n## Assessment of risk related to compensation programs\n\nFollowing completion of a recent compensation risk assessment, the Company concluded that none of its compensation policies and practices is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In connection with this assessment, the Company completed an inventory of its executive and non-executive compensation programs globally, with particular emphasis on incentive compensation plans or programs. The scope of the fiscal 2020 risk assessment generally was consistent with that conducted in recent years, except that risks related to COVID-19 also were considered. Based on this assessment, the Company evaluated the primary components of its compensation plans and practices to identify whether those components, either alone or in combination, properly balanced compensation opportunities and risk.\n\nThe Company believes that its overall cash versus equity pay mix, balance of shorter-term versus longer-term performance focus, balance of revenue- versus profit-focused performance measures, stock ownership guidelines, forfeiture provisions, and 'clawback' policy all work together to provide our employees and executives with incentives to deliver outstanding performance to build long-term shareholder value, while taking only necessary and prudent risks. In this regard, the Company's strong ethics and its corporate compliance systems, which are overseen by the Audit Committee, further mitigate against excessive or inappropriate risk taking. In addition, our employee sales plans are designed under global guidelines, where oversight of plan terms, administration, and operation is stronger and governance roles are segregated.\n\nThe Compensation Committee, with assistance from its independent compensation consultant, George B. Paulin of FW Cook, reviewed a risk assessment that Mr. Paulin conducted for the Committee on the Company's executive compensation policies and practices. Based on its consideration of these assessments, the Committee concurred with the Company's determination that none of its compensation policies and practices is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n## Tally sheets\n\nThe Committee periodically reviews a report comparing the amounts of compensation actually received by the Company's Named Executive Officers to the amounts reported in its annual proxy statement and summarizing the compensation that would be owed to such individuals in the event of the termination of their employment under various circumstances. Reviewing this report helps the Committee better understand the Company's potential obligations to the Named Executive Officers following the termination of their employment. It also helps the Committee better assess the risk of any of the Named Executive Officers leaving the Company prematurely because the Company is not providing sufficient retention incentives.\n\n## Tax considerations\n\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation paid in any given year in excess of $1 million to certain current and former executive officers of the Company (although there historically was an exception to this $1 million annual limitation for performance-based compensation meeting certain requirements set forth in Section 162(m) and the applicable regulations and for compensation paid to a company's chief financial officer and former executive officers). As a result, we expect that compensation paid per year to our Named Executive Officers and certain other current and former executive officers in excess of $1 million generally will not be deductible, subject to limited exceptions. Interpretations of and changes in applicable tax laws and regulations as well as other factors beyond the control of the Committee can affect deductibility of compensation, and there can be no assurance that compensation paid to our executive officers will be tax deductible. The Committee has in prior years considered the tax implications (including the potential lack of deductibility under Section 162(m)) when making compensation decisions but reserves the right to make future compensation decisions based on other factors. The Committee also reserves the right to make changes or amendments to existing compensation programs and arrangements, including changes or amendments that may result in the loss of tax deductions, if the Committee believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.",

        "page_content": "value of these awards at the grant date would be as follows: Mr. Roman - $10,000,164; Mr. Patolawala - $3,675,920; Mr. Hammes - $2,913,500; Ms. Poul - $2,330,800; Mr. Vale - $2,268,368; and Mr. Gangestad - $3,542,720. In addition, the amounts related to his performance share awards, the amount shown for Mr. Patolawala includes $3,817,827 attributable to two separate, one-time restricted stock unit awards granted to him in connection with his commencement of employment.\n\n- (3) The amounts in the Option Awards column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of such awards computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. Assumptions made in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 18 to the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 4, 2021.\n- (4) The amounts in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column reflect the annual incentive compensation earned by each individual during the year specified pursuant to the Company's Annual Incentive Plan.\n- (5) Except with respect to Mr. Gangestad, the amounts in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column reflect the actuarial increase in the present value (if any) of each individual's pension benefits (if any) under all defined benefit pension plans of the Company, determined using the same interest rate and mortality assumptions as those used for financial statement reporting purposes. See Note 13 to the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 4, 2021. Pension valuations for our executives may fluctuate (up or down) over time due to multiple factors. The 2020 amount reported for Mr. Roman was higher than the amount shown for 2019 not because of a change in plan terms but entirely as a result of a significant year-over-year 125 basis points reduction in the average of the daily interest rate on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities used as the discount rate when calculating the hypothetical lump sum benefit Mr. Roman would have received if he terminated employment on December 31, 2020. The 2020 amounts reported for Mr. Hammes and Mr. Vale also were impacted in a similar manner. If the daily average interest rate on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities instead equaled the rate used to calculate the amounts reported for 2019, the 2020 amounts shown in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column for Mr. Roman, Mr. Hammes, and Mr. Vale would instead have been $5,038,859, $710,513, and $1,194,280, respectively. The actual amount of the benefit each such executive ultimately becomes entitled to receive will depend on the average of the daily interest rate on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities over a calendar quarter determined based on their actual separation date. Mr. Gangestad commenced his pension benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Plan during 2020 and, as such, the change in pension value of his benefit under such plan was determined using his final benefit amount and payment form selected. There were no above-market earnings on deferred compensation under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation programs.\n- (6) See the All Other Compensation table below for details of the amounts reported for 2020.\n- (7) Mr. Roman was appointed Chief Executive Officer, effective July 1, 2018. Prior to that, Mr. Roman served as the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer from 2017 to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer.\n- (8) Mr. Patolawala joined the Company and was appointed Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective July 1, 2020.\n- (9) No amounts are reported for Mr. Patolawala, Mr. Hammes, or Ms. Poul for the years 2018 and 2019, since they first became Named Executive Officers after those years.\n\n## 2020 all other compensation table\n\n| Name                  | 401(k)  Company  Contributions  ($) (1)   | VIP  Excess  Company  Contributions  ($) (2)   | Executive  Life  Insurance  ($) (3)   | Financial  Planning  ($) (4)   | Personal  Aircraft  Use  ($) (5)   | Security  Systems/  Services  ($) (6)   | Other  ($)   | Total  ($)   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Michael F.

This aggregate incremental cost was calculated by combining the variable operating costs of such travel, including the cost of fuel, landing fees, parking fees, trip preparation fees, en route communication charges, en route navigation charges, on-board catering, and crew travel expenses. The Compensation Committee required Mr. Roman to use the corporate aircraft for all business and personal travel. Mr. Vale's use of the corporate aircraft was permitted in order to safely return Mr. Vale and his family from vacation in March 2020 in light of the onset of the global pandemic and the potential disruption to commercial air travel.\n- (6) This amount reflects the expenses incurred by 3M during 2020 for home security equipment and monitoring services at the personal residence of Mr. Roman.",

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company amended the ERIP to include a pension equity formula for (1) employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2001, and (2) employees who voluntarily elected the pension equity formula during the one-time choice election period in 2001. The ERIP was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009, meaning that employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2009 (including Mr. Patolawala and Ms. Poul), do not participate in the plan. Of the Named Executive Officers, Mr. Roman, Mr. Hammes, and Mr. Gangestad participate under the non-pension equity formula of the ERIP (referred to as the Portfolio I Plan), while Mr. Vale participates under the pension equity formula of the ERIP (referred to as the Portfolio II Plan). Retirement benefits under the ERIP are based on an employee's years of service and average annual earnings during the employee's four highest-paid consecutive years of service. As applied to the Named Executive Officers, earnings for purposes of the ERIP include base salary and target annual incentive compensation. All benefits earned under the ERIP by the Named Executive Officers will be payable in the form of life annuities, unless an individual elects at the time their employment ends to receive the entire amount of his or her earned pension benefits in the form of a single lump-sum cash payment.\n\nUnder the Portfolio I Plan, employees earn annual benefits payable at retirement generally equal to 1.15 percent of their high-four average annual earnings multiplied by their years of service plus 0.35 percent of their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security breakpoint multiplied by their years of service (up to a maximum of 35 years). The Social Security breakpoint is an average of the Social Security taxable wage bases for each of the 35 years ending with the year each employee qualifies for receiving unreduced Social Security retirement benefits. Under the Portfolio I Plan, an employee may retire with an unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62 for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively). If the employee's age and service at the time of retirement total at least 90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively) the employee also would receive a Social Security bridge payment until age 62. Mr. Roman is eligible to retire with unreduced retirement benefits. Mr. Gangestad was eligible to receive reduced retirement benefits, which he elected to take in a single lump-sum cash payment.\n\nUnder the Portfolio II Plan, employees earn pension credits (from 3 percent to 12 percent) for each year of employment based on their age and accumulated years of service under the plan. Once their employment ends, these accumulated pension credits are multiplied by their high-four average annual earnings and added to an amount determined by multiplying one-half of these accumulated pension credits by their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security integration level (70 percent of the Social Security taxable wage base in the year employment ends). The sum of these two amounts is then converted into an annuity payable over the lifetime of the employee using fixed conversion factors. The Portfolio II Plan does not provide any subsidies for early retirement.",

        "page_content": "As a tax-qualified plan, the ERIP is subject to a variety of limits that apply to both the amount of any employee's earnings that may be considered when determining the benefits earned under the plan as well as the maximum amount of benefits that any employee may earn. The Nonqualified Pension Plan is designed to provide additional benefits to employees, including the Named Executive Officers, affected by these limits. The amount of benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan generally equals the amount of benefits an employee was not able to earn under the ERIP as a result of the limits imposed by Federal tax laws. The benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan generally are paid in the form of a single lump-sum cash payment following the termination of their employment (subject to any applicable delay under Federal tax laws). Each of the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Hammes) was given a one-time opportunity during 2008 to elect to receive their benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan in the form of a life annuity following their retirement, and none of them elected to receive their benefits in the form of a life annuity.\n\n## Nonqualified deferred compensation\n\nThe following table reflects the participation during 2020 by the Named Executive Officers in three nonqualified deferred compensation plans offered by the Company. The Deferred Compensation Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until retirement from the Company the receipt of a portion of their base salary and annual incentive compensation. The Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until retirement from the Company the payout of their performance share awards under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The VIP Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer until retirement from the Company the receipt of a portion of their base salary and annual incentive compensation. All three plans generally allow the eligible employees to elect to receive payment of their account balances in the form of either a single lump sum payment or in up to ten annual installments. With the exception of deferrals of performance shares under the Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan, earnings are credited to the amounts deferred under all three plans based on the returns paid on the investment funds available to participants in 3M's qualified 401(k) plan or a fixed rate of return based on corporate bond yields (as selected by each participant).

The Summary Compensation Table does not reflect any portion of the contributions from the payout of Mr. Roman's and Mr. Vale's performance share awards for the 2017-2019 performance period because those awards were granted in 2017 and does not reflect any portion of the contributions from Mr. Hammes's and Ms. Poul's 2019 annual incentive payment because those amounts were earned prior to the first year each became a Named Executive Officer.\n- (2) The amounts shown reflect 3M contributions under the VIP Excess Plan, a nonqualified defined contribution plan. Eligibility for this plan and the Company contributions is limited to employees whose compensation exceeds a limit established by Federal income tax laws for tax-qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits eligible employees to save additional amounts from their current cash compensation beyond the contribution limits established by Federal tax laws, and to receive Company contributions similar to the Company contributions provided under the tax-qualified 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. With the exception of 3M contributions to Mr. Hammes's and Ms. Poul's VIP Excess Plan account in respect of their 2019 annual incentive payments (paid in 2020), all amounts contributed by the Company on behalf of these individuals during 2020 are included in the 'All Other Compensation' column of the Summary Compensation Table. The Summary Compensation Table does not reflect any portion of the 3M contributions made to Mr. Hammes's and Ms. Poul's VIP Excess Plan account in respect of their 2019 annual incentive payments because those amounts were earned prior to the first year each became a Named Executive Officer.\n\n- (4) Includes the following amounts that were reported as compensation for 2018 and 2019 in the Summary Compensation Table: Mr. Roman - $572,230; Mr. Patolawala - $0; Mr. Hammes - $0; Ms. Poul - $0; and Mr. Vale - $577,747; Mr. Gangestad - $533,797.\n\n## Potential payments upon termination or change in control\n\nAs reflected in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, 3M has no employment agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers nor does it have any change in control plans or arrangements that would provide benefits to any of the Named Executive Officers solely in the event of a change in control of the Company. We also do not have any agreements that would provide automatic 'single-trigger' accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to any of our Named Executive Officers in the event of a change in control of the Company. 3M does maintain a severance plan that provides separation benefits to eligible U.S. employees (including the Named Executive Officers) who incur a qualifying termination. In addition, certain of the Company's executive compensation and benefit plans provide all participants (including the Named Executive Officers) with certain rights or the right to receive payments in the event of the termination of their employment or upon a change in control of the Company. The terms applicable to these potential rights or payments in various situations are described below. Payments or benefits under other plans and arrangements that generally are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated employees of the Company upon the termination of their employment are not described, including:\n\n- \u00b7 accrued base salary;\n- \u00b7 annual incentive earned with respect to completed performance periods;\n- \u00b7 retiree welfare benefits provided to substantially all of the Company's U.S. employees, including retiree medical benefits;\n- \u00b7 distribution of vested account balances under the Company's qualified 401(k) plan;",

        "page_content": "## Rights and payments upon a qualifying termination not in connection with a change in control\n\nThe Company maintains the 3M Executive Severance Plan (which we refer to as the 'Severance Plan') to provide separation benefits for certain U.S. executives (including our Named Executive Officers) in the event an eligible employee's employment is terminated by 3M other than for Misconduct or an eligible employee resigns for Good Reason. An eligible employee who becomes entitled to benefits under the Severance Plan receives the following:\n\n- \u00b7 continued payment of his or her annual base salary for a number of months (24 months for the Chief Executive Officer, and 18 months for all other Named Executive Officers);\n- \u00b7 continued payment of annual incentive payments that would have been paid if the participant remained employed through the end of the severance payment period, calculated based on actual results for the relevant year, using the participant's final performance rating as of the end of the applicable year (or if none, a performance rating of 'fully meets expectations' or equivalent), and prorated based on the number of days in the year preceding the end of the severance period (if the severance payment period ends prior to the end of a year);\n- \u00b7 an opportunity to exercise all vested stock options and stock appreciation rights following the participant's termination and prior to the expiration date of such award;\n- \u00b7 accelerated vesting and payment of a prorated portion of the participant's outstanding 'annual' restricted stock units, with proration based on the number of full years of the participant's completed service over the number of years required to vest under the original vesting schedule;\n- \u00b7 outstanding performance share awards will not be forfeited solely as a result of the participant's termination, and the target number of shares under each award will be prorated based on the number of months the participant worked during the applicable performance period;\n- \u00b7 full vesting of the participant's VIP company contribution account; and\n- \u00b7 outplacement services in accordance with 3M's policy.\n\nIn addition, if Mr. Patolawala voluntarily resigns from employment with the Company for Good Reason or his employment is terminated by the Company other than for Misconduct, he also will be entitled to receive (i) accelerated payment of any then unpaid portion of the hiring bonus and (ii) accelerated vesting of the Special Make-whole RSU Award and the Special Inducement RSU Award and continued vesting of a prorated portion of the Special Inducement PSA, in each case, subject to his execution of an effective and irrevocable general release of all claims against the Company and its affiliates and without duplication of any benefits to which he may become entitled under the Severance Plan. These additional benefits are not part of the Severance Plan, but were negotiated in connection with Mr. Patolawala's commencement of employment. For more information concerning Mr. Patolawala's hiring bonus, the Special Make-whole RSU Award, the Special Inducement RSU Award, and the Special Inducement PSA, see 'Section V: 2020 compensation decisions and performance highlights - Monish Patolawala' beginning on page 75.\n\nAny severance payments under the Severance Plan will reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis (but not below $0) any amounts the participant may otherwise be eligible to receive under his or her non-competition agreement with 3M. In addition, severance payments will cease in the event the participant becomes reemployed by 3M.\n\nThe Severance Plan does not provide severance benefits to employees who terminate pursuant to a mandatory retirement policy adopted by the Board. Employees who terminate in connection with a spinoff, divestiture or similar transaction involving the employee's business unit may be eligible to participate at the discretion of the Company. To be eligible to receive benefits under the Severance Plan, an employee must execute and not revoke a general release of claims in favor of the Company in a form approved by the Company.\n\nIn the event a Named Executive Officer's payments under the Severance Plan would be subject to an excise tax on 'parachute payments' in connection with a change in control of the Company due to the application of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the Named Executive Officer will not be entitled to a 'gross-up.' Instead, the Named Executive Officer's 'parachute payments' may be reduced if such reduction would provide the Named Executive Officer with a greater post-tax benefit than he or she would receive if the excise taxes were to apply.\n\nFor purposes of the Severance Plan and Mr. Patolawala's special equity benefits, the terms 'Misconduct' and 'Good Reason' mean the following:\n\n'Misconduct' means (i) the employee's willful failure to substantially perform his or her duties (other than a failure resulting from his or her disability); (ii) the employee's willful failure to carry out, or comply with any lawful and reasonable directive of the Board or his or her immediate supervisor; (iii) the occurrence of any act or omission by the",

If the voluntary termination does not occur within 18 months following a change in control, 'Good Reason' means (i) a material diminution in the employee's base salary or annual planned cash compensation, other than an across-the-board reduction that applies to all comparable positions, or (ii) a change in excess of 100 miles in the primary work location at which the employee is required to perform services for his or her employer. For terminations that do not occur within 18 months following a change in control, the employee will be required to provide written notice to the Company of the grounds for a Good Reason termination within 30 days of the initial existence of such grounds, and the Company has 30 days from the date of such notice to cure such circumstances. An employee must terminate employment for Good Reason within 60 days after the first occurrence of the applicable grounds.\n\n## Rights and payments upon a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control\n\nIf the Company terminates a Named Executive Officer's employment for reasons other than Misconduct (or for awards granted prior to May 10, 2016, reasons other than Cause) or if a Named Executive Officer resigns for Good Reason, in any such case within 18 months following a 'change in control event' of the Company (as defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), then in addition to any benefits provided under the Severance Plan and the special benefits provided to Mr. Patolawala described above, all of the Named Executive Officer's outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock units granted under the Company's stock plans will be immediately vested and all of such Named Executive Officer's outstanding performance shares will be prorated and settled in accordance with the terms of the plan.\n\nFor purposes of our outstanding long-term incentive awards, the terms 'Misconduct,' 'Cause,' and 'Good Reason' mean the following:\n\n'Misconduct' means (i) the Named Executive Officer's willful failure to substantially perform his or her duties (other than a failure resulting from his or her disability); (ii) the Named Executive Officer's willful failure to carry out, or comply with any lawful and reasonable directive of the Board or his or her immediate supervisor; (iii) the occurrence of any act or omission by the Named Executive Officer that could reasonably be expected to result in (or has resulted in) his or her conviction, plea of no contest, plea of nolo contendere, or imposition of unadjudicated probation for any felony or indictable offense or crime involving moral turpitude; (iv) the Named Executive Officer's commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, misconduct, or breach of fiduciary duty against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their officers, directors, employees, customers, suppliers, insurers or agents; (v) the Named Executive Officer's material breach of any material provision of any written agreement with the Company or any subsidiary; or (vi) any other intentional misconduct by the Named Executive Officer that significantly affects the business or affairs of the Company or any subsidiary in an adverse manner.\n\n'Cause' means a material violation of any policy of the Company, or embezzlement or theft of property belonging to the Company.\n\n'Good Reason' means (i) a material diminution in the Named Executive Officer's position, authority, duties, or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to the change in control; (ii) a material diminution in the Named Executive Officer's base salary or annual planned cash compensation; or (iii) a material change in the geographic location at which the Named Executive Officer is required to perform services for the Company.",

Share values are based on the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 31, 2020 ($174.79).\n- (3) The amounts in this column reflect the intrinsic value on December 31, 2020, of unvested, in-the-money 3M stock options that will vest upon the occurrence of the respective triggering events in accordance with the existing contractual terms of the stock options. Intrinsic values are based on the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 31, 2020 ($174.79).\n- (4) The amounts in this column reflect the group term life insurance proceeds that would be payable to each individual's beneficiary or beneficiaries pursuant to the policies obtained for them under the Executive Life Insurance Plan.\n\n## Pay ratio\n\nPresented below is the ratio of annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our CEO) for 2020. The ratio reflects a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIn identifying our median employee (a full-time production employee in the Midwestern United States), we calculated the target annual total cash compensation of each employee as of December 31, 2020. For these purposes, annual total cash compensation included base salary or hourly wages, cash incentives, commissions, and comparable cash elements of compensation in non-U.S. jurisdictions and was calculated using internal human resources records. All amounts were annualized for permanent employees who did not work for the entire year, such as new hires, employees on paid or unpaid leave of absence and employees called for active military duty. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation.\n\nWe selected the median employee from among 96,902 full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal workers who were employed as of December 31, 2020. We did not exclude any employees (whether pursuant to the de minimis exemption for foreign employees or any other permitted exclusion) when making this determination.\n\nAs determined in accordance with Item 402 of Regulation S-K, the 2020 annual total compensation was $20,700,347 for our CEO and $67,109 for our median employee. Among other things, these amounts include base salary, overtime, incentive payments, stock-based compensation (based on the grant date fair value of awards granted during 2020), changes in pension values and retirement plan contributions. As calculated in this manner, the ratio of our CEO's total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal year 2020 is 308 to 1.",

Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted 'FOR' this proposal unless a shareholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.\n\n3M's Board of Directors (the 'Board') is seeking shareholder approval of the amendment and restatement of the 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 'Existing Plan'). The amendment and restatement of the Existing Plan is referred to herein as the 'Restated Equity Plan.' The Restated Equity Plan was adopted by our Board on February 2, 2021, subject to shareholder approval. The Restated Equity Plan will become effective on the day of the Annual Meeting, assuming approval of this proposal by 3M's shareholders.\n\nThe Restated Equity Plan implements the following proposed material amendments to the Existing Plan:\n\n- \u00b7 Increase in the Share Reserve. We are asking our shareholders to approve an increase of 26,633,508 in the number of shares available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan over the existing share reserve under the Existing Plan. As of March 1, 2021, there were 10,649,303 shares available for future grants under the Existing Plan (with performance awards counted at 'target'). Assuming shareholder approval, as of the effective date of the Restated Equity Plan, there will be 37,282,811 shares available for future awards, less any grants made under the Existing Plan after March 1, 2021, and prior to shareholder approval of the Restated Equity Plan (with any 'Full Value Awards' counted as 2.5 shares for every one share actually granted, as described below). Accordingly, when the new share request is added to the shares previously authorized under the Existing Plan, the Restated Equity Plan will authorize an aggregate of 65,719,806 shares of common stock for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan (plus any shares subject to awards outstanding under the Prior Plan as of the effective date of the Restated Equity Plan that become available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan due to forfeiture or cancellation of such awards in accordance with the terms of the Restated Equity Plan (as described in more detail below under the heading 'Authorized Shares')); however, as of March 1, 2021, awards covering a total of 22,097,531 shares were subject to outstanding awards under the Existing Plan (with performance awards counted assuming 'target' performance). Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, the 65,719,806 shares includes shares subject to awards granted and settled in prior years and is not a reflection of availability for new, future awards following the effective date of the Restated Equity Plan.\n\nFor purposes of calculating the shares that remain available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan, grants of options and stock appreciation rights will be counted as the grant of one share for each one share actually granted, as described above. However, to protect shareholders from potentially greater dilutive effect of awards other than an option or stock appreciation right (or other award subject to an exercise price, strike price or similar concept) (a 'Full Value Award'), all grants of Full Value Awards will be deducted from the Restated Equity Plan's share reserve as 2.5 shares for every one share actually granted.",

        "page_content": "The proposed increase in shares available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan (over the existing share reserve under the Existing Plan) has been reviewed and approved by our Board. In the process, the Board determined that the existing number of shares available for issuance under the Existing Plan was insufficient to meet our ongoing needs to provide long-term incentive grants on an ongoing and regular basis to motivate, reward and retain key employees who create shareholder value. The increase in shares has been necessitated by the hiring of new employees, and by granting additional stock awards to current employees as long-term incentives. The increase will enable us to continue our policy of equity ownership by employees and directors as an incentive to contribute to our continued success.\n\n- \u00b7 Elimination of Liberal Share Recycling for Options and Stock Appreciation Rights . Under the Restated Equity Plan, the following shares shall not become or again be available for award grants under the Restated Equity Plan: (a) shares delivered to the Company or withheld by the Company to satisfy the applicable exercise price of an option under the Restated Equity Plan or the Prior Plan or to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an option or stock appreciation right under the Restated Equity Plan or the Prior Plan (including shares retained by the Company from the award being exercised and/or creating the tax obligation), (b) shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the settlement or exercise, as applicable, of the stock appreciation right, and (c) shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options.\n- \u00b7 Increase in the Limit on Incentive Stock Options. Under the Restated Equity Plan, no more than 44,000,000 shares may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options, or ISOs, subject to adjustment for changes in our capitalization and certain corporate transactions, as described below under the heading 'Certain Transactions.'\n- \u00b7 Extend the Term . The Restated Equity Plan will have a term of ten years from the date it was adopted by our Board.\n- \u00b7 Limitations on Dividend Payments on Unvested Awards . The Restated Equity Plan provides that dividends and dividend equivalents may not be paid on awards subject to vesting conditions unless and until such conditions are met.\n- \u00b7 Removal of Section 162(m) Provisions . Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the 'TCJA'), allowed performance-based compensation that met certain requirements to be tax deductible regardless of amount. This qualified performance-based compensation exception was repealed as part of the TCJA. We have removed certain provisions from the Restated Equity Plan which were otherwise required for awards to qualify as performance-based compensation under the Section 162(m) exception prior to its repeal, except that the Restated Equity Plan will continue to include the limits on the size of awards that an individual may receive each calendar year that applied under the Existing Plan.\n\nThe following description of the Restated Equity Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Restated Equity Plan, which is attached hereto as Appendix C .\n\n## Why shareholders should approve the Restated Equity Plan\n\n## Equity incentive awards are an important part of 3M's compensation philosophy\n\n3M believes that the adoption of the Restated Equity Plan is essential to its success. Equity awards are intended to motivate high levels of performance, align the interests of 3M's employees and directors with those of its shareholders by giving employees and directors the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the Company and providing a means of recognizing their contributions to the success of the Company. The Board and Company management believe that equity awards are necessary to remain competitive in the industry and are essential to recruiting and retaining the highly qualified individuals who help the Company meet its goals.\n\n## Our existing equity plan will no longer have shares available for grant\n\nUnder the Company's current forecasts, we expect the share reserve under the Existing Plan would be exhausted prior to our 2023 annual shareholder meeting. This assumes 3M continues to grant awards consistent with its historical usage and current practices, as reflected in its historical burn rate discussed below, and noting that future circumstances may require the Company to change its current equity grant practices. While 3M could increase cash compensation if it is unable to grant equity incentives, 3M anticipates that it will have difficulty attracting, retaining and motivating its employees and directors if it is unable to make equity grants to them.",

In calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020, 3M's annual equity burn rates (calculated by dividing (1) the number of shares subject to equity awards granted during the year by (2) the weighted-average number of shares outstanding at the end of the applicable year) under the Existing Plan were 0.66 percent, 0.73 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively. If each Full Value Award is multiplied by 2.5 (consistent with the methodology employed by certain proxy advisory firms), the 'adjusted' annual burn rate under the Existing Plan would be 0.83 percent, 0.94 percent and 1.25 percent for calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n- \u00b7 3M expects the share reserve under the Restated Equity Plan will provide the Company with enough shares for awards through 2029, assuming 3M continues to grant awards consistent with its current practices and historical usage, as reflected in its historical burn rate, and further dependent on the price of 3M shares and hiring activity during the next few years, forfeitures of outstanding awards under the Prior Plan and Restated Equity Plan, and noting that future circumstances may compel 3M to change its current equity grant practices. 3M cannot predict its future equity grant practices, the future price of its shares or future hiring activity with any degree of certainty at this time, and the share reserve under the Restated Equity Plan could last for a shorter or longer time.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 The potential dilution to our shareholders that may result from the issuance of shares pursuant to outstanding awards and awards to be issued under the Restated Equity Plan. In calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020, the end of year overhang rate (calculated by dividing (1) the sum of the number of shares subject to equity awards outstanding at the end of the calendar year plus shares remaining available for issuance for future awards at the end of the calendar year by (2) the number of shares outstanding at the end of the calendar year) was 11.0 percent, 10.1 percent, and 9.3 percent, respectively. If the Restated Equity Plan is approved, 3M expects its overhang at the end of 2021 will be approximately 12.9 percent (excluding approximately 21,584,455 shares estimated to be available for issuance under the General Employees Stock Purchase Plan).\n- \u00b7 Analysis indicating that, based on generally accepted evaluation methodologies used by proxy advisory firms, the number of shares to be reserved under the Restated Equity Plan is within generally accepted standards as measured by an analysis of the Restated Equity Plan cost relative to industry standards.\n\nIn light of the factors described above, and the fact that the ability to continue to grant equity compensation is vital to 3M's ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified individuals in the competitive labor markets in which it competes, the Board has determined that the size of the share reserve under the Restated Equity Plan is reasonable and appropriate at this time.\n\n## 3M believes that the design of the Restated Equity Plan reflects a number of equity compensation best practices and protections for shareholders\n\nThe Restated Equity Plan contains a number of provisions that 3M believes are consistent with best practices in equity compensation and protect its shareholders' interests.\n\n- \u00b7 Continued Broad-Based Eligibility for Equity Awards. 3M grants equity awards to a significant number of its service providers. By doing so, 3M links their interests with shareholder interests throughout the organization and motivates these individuals to act as owners of the business. As of March 1, 2021, 6,100 of 3M's 95,884 employees and all of our 11 non-employee directors held outstanding equity awards.\n- \u00b7 Shareholder Approval is Required for Additional Shares. The Restated Equity Plan does not contain an annual 'evergreen' provision. The Restated Equity Plan authorizes a limited number of shares, so that shareholder approval is required to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock which may be issued under the Restated Equity Plan.\n- \u00b7 No Discount Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. All stock options and stock appreciation rights will have an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of 3M's common stock on the date the stock option or stock appreciation right is granted; provided, that discount stock options may be granted in the event stock options are assumed or substituted in connection with certain corporate transactions. For purposes of the Restated Equity Plan, the fair market value of a share of common stock as of any given date generally will be the closing sale price for a share of our common stock on the stock exchange or national market system on which our common stock is listed on such date or, if no sale occurred on the date in question, the closing sale price for a share of our common stock on the last preceding date for which such quotation exists, as reported in The Wall Street Journal or another source the Company deems reliable. The closing sale price for a share of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, on March 1, 2021, was $176.41, as reported in The Wall Street Journal .\n- \u00b7 No Automatic Single-Trigger Vesting of Awards. The Restated Equity Plan does not provide for automatic 'single-trigger' accelerated vesting upon a change in control.\n- \u00b7 Limitations on Dividend Payments on Awards. Dividends and dividend equivalents may be paid on awards subject to vesting conditions only to the extent such conditions are met.\n- \u00b7 Limitations on Grants. Individual limits on awards granted to any participant pursuant to the Restated Equity Plan during any calendar year apply as follows: (i) a maximum of 500,000 shares of common stock may be subject to all options and stock appreciation rights granted to a participant; (ii) a maximum of 500,000 shares of common stock may be earned subject to all restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and other stock- or cash-based awards granted to a participant that are denominated in shares and intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m); and (iii) a maximum of $10,000,000 may become payable (in cash, shares or any combination thereof) pursuant to performance bonus awards granted to a participant; provided that, these numbers may be adjusted to take into account equity restructurings and certain other corporate transactions as described below and will be multiplied by two with respect to awards granted to a participant during the calendar year in which the participant commences",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will more than the authorized number of shares available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan be granted to any one person during any calendar year with respect to one or more awards denominated in shares. For purposes of these limits, each share subject to an award (including a Full Value Award) will count as one share against the specified limit.\n- \u00b7 Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit. An annual limit of $600,000 per calendar year applies to the sum of all cash and other compensation and the value of all equity, cash-based and other awards granted to a non-employee director for services as a member of the Board.\n- \u00b7 Reasonable Limit on Full Value Awards. For purposes of calculating the shares that remain available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan, grants of options and stock appreciation rights will be counted as the grant of one share for each one share actually granted, as described above. However, to protect shareholders from potentially greater dilutive effect of Full Value Awards, all grants of Full Value Awards will be deducted from the Restated Equity Plan's share reserve as 2.5 shares for every one share actually granted.\n- \u00b7 Reasonable share counting provisions; no 'liberal' share recycling for options or stock appreciation rights. In general, when an award granted under the Restated Equity Plan or the Prior Plan expires, lapses or is terminated, exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased, canceled without having been fully exercised or forfeited in any case, in a manner that results in 3M acquiring shares covered by the award or Prior Plan award at a price not greater than the price (as adjusted to reflect any equity restructuring) paid by the participant for the shares or not issuing one or more shares covered by the award or Prior Plan award, the unused shares covered by the award or Prior Plan award will, as applicable, become or again be available for award grants under the Restated Equity Plan in an amount corresponding to the reduction in the share reserve previously made with respect to such award. Further, shares delivered (either by actual delivery or attestation) to 3M by a participant or withheld by 3M to satisfy any applicable tax withholding obligation with respect to a Full Value Award (including shares retained by 3M from the Full Value Award creating the tax obligation) will, as applicable, become or again be available for award grants under the Restated Equity Plan. However, the following shares will not be returned to the share reserve under the Restated Equity Plan: shares delivered to 3M or withheld by 3M to satisfy the applicable exercise price of an option under the Restated Equity Plan or the Prior Plan or to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an option or stock appreciation right under the Restated Equity Plan or the Prior Plan (including shares retained by 3M from the award being exercised and/or creating the tax obligation); shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the settlement or exercise, as applicable, of the stock appreciation right; and shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options.\n- \u00b7 No Repricing of Awards. Awards may not be repriced, replaced or regranted through cancellation or modification without shareholder approval if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the shares under the award.\n- \u00b7 No Tax Gross-Ups. The Restated Equity Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups.\n\n## Shareholder approval requirement\n\nIn general, shareholder approval of the Restated Equity Plan is necessary in order for 3M to meet the shareholder approval requirements of the principal securities market on which shares of its common stock are traded, and grant stock options that qualify as incentive stock options, or ISOs, as defined under Section 422 of the Code. Shareholder approval also may be required to grant certain restricted stock units to French employees that provide more favorable tax and social treatment to the local employer subsidiary and its employees than would otherwise apply.\n\nIn August 2015, a French law (loi n\u00b0 2015-990 du 6 ao\u00fbt 2015 pour la croissance, l'activit\u00e9 et l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances \u00e9conomiques, also known as 'Loi Macron') introduced changes that provide more favorable income and social tax treatment of restricted stock units (including performance-based restricted stock units) meeting certain requirements (we refer to restricted stock units meeting such requirements as 'French-qualified RSUs' and to performance shares meeting such requirements as 'French-qualified Performance Shares'). This Loi Macron was subsequently amended most recently by the Finance Law for 2018 (loi n\u00b0 2017-18337 du 30 d\u00e9cembre 2017 de finances pour 2018). The changes provide benefits for both the local employer subsidiary (a reduced rate of social security contributions) and the employees receiving the awards (deferral of the taxable event and a reduced rate of income tax). Among other requirements, under the amended law, French-qualified RSUs and French-qualified Performance Shares must provide for a minimum vesting period of one year from the grant date and restrict the sale of shares for a minimum of two years from the grant date. The Restated Equity Plan contains provisions that would allow the administrator to grant restricted stock units and performance shares on such terms and authorizes the adoption of one or more subplans to address differences in laws (including differences relating to tax matters), but the amended law also provides that grants of French-qualified RSUs and French-qualified Performance Shares must be authorized by the shareholders at a meeting after January 1st, 2018. As a result, shareholder approval of the Restated Equity Plan is being requested for purposes",

        "page_content": "of the amended French law in order to provide the administrator with the ability to grant French-qualified RSUs and French-qualified Performance Shares. The administrator will not, however, be obligated to grant French-qualified RSUs or French-qualified Performance Shares and may choose, at its discretion, to grant restricted stock units and/or performance shares that are not considered French-qualified RSUs or French-qualified Performance Shares.\n\nTherefore, 3M is asking shareholders to approve the terms of the Restated Equity Plan for purposes of complying with the requirements of the NYSE and satisfying the shareholder-approval requirements of Sections 422, and satisfying the shareholder-approval requirements of the new French law (Loi Macron) discussed above.\n\n## Description of the Restated Equity Plan\n\nThe following sets forth a description of the material features and terms of the Restated Equity Plan.\n\nAuthorized Shares. The Restated Equity Plan authorizes an increase of 26,633,508 in the number of shares available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan over the existing share reserve under the Existing Plan. Accordingly, when the new share request is added to the shares previously authorized under the Existing Plan, the Restated Equity Plan will authorize the issuance of the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 65,719,806 shares of common stock; plus\n- \u00b7 for each award that is outstanding under the Prior Plan as of the effective date of the Restated Equity Plan, (i) one share for each share subject to an award that is an option or stock appreciation right and (ii) 2.5 shares for each share subject to a Full Value Award, in each case, that subsequently becomes available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan pursuant to the share counting provisions described below.\n\nAs of March 1, 2021, awards covering a total of 22,097,531 shares were subject to outstanding awards under the Existing Plan (with performance awards counted assuming 'target' performance). Therefore, for the avoidance of doubt, the 65,719,806 shares includes shares subject to awards granted and settled in prior years and is not a reflection of availability for new, future awards following the effective date of the Restated Equity Plan. A maximum of an additional 18,200,593 shares could become available for future issuance under the Restated Equity Plan in respect of outstanding awards under the Prior Plan pursuant to the terms of the Restated Equity Plan.\n\nThe aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan will be reduced by 2.5 shares for each share delivered in settlement of any Full Value Award and by one share for each share delivered in settlement of any option or stock appreciation right. Shares issued under the Restated Equity Plan may be authorized but unissued shares, shares purchased on the open market, or treasury shares.\n\nIn no event will more than 44,000,000 shares of common stock be issuable pursuant to the exercise of ISOs under the Restated Equity Plan during its ten-year term.\n\nShare Counting Provisions. If, following the effective date of the Restated Equity Plan, an award under the Restated Equity Plan or the Prior Plan expires, lapses or is terminated, exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased, canceled without having been fully exercised or forfeited, in any case, in a manner that results in 3M acquiring shares covered by the award or Prior Plan award at a price not greater than the price (as adjusted to reflect any equity restructuring) paid by the participant for the shares or not issuing one or more shares covered by the award or Prior Plan award, the unused shares covered by the award or Prior Plan award will, as applicable, become or again be available for award grants under the Restated Equity Plan. Further, shares delivered (either by actual delivery or attestation) to 3M by a participant or withheld by 3M to satisfy any applicable tax withholding obligation with respect to a Full Value Award (including shares retained by 3M from the Full Value Award creating the tax obligation) after the effective date of the Restated Equity Plan will, as applicable, become or again be available for award grants under the Restated Equity Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the effective date of the Restated Equity Plan, the following shares shall not become or again be available for award grants under the Restated Equity Plan: (a) shares delivered to the Company or withheld by the Company to satisfy the applicable exercise price of an option under the Restated Equity Plan or the Prior Plan or to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an option or a stock appreciation right under the Restated Equity Plan or the Prior Plan (including shares retained by the Company from the award being exercised and/or creating the tax obligation), (b) shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the settlement or exercise, as applicable, of the stock appreciation right, and (c) shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options. For any shares granted pursuant to an award under the Restated Equity Plan or the Prior Plan, the shares available under the Restated Equity Plan will be increased by 2.5 shares for each share subject to a Full Value Award and by one share for each share subject to an option or stock appreciation right, in each case, that become or again be available for issuance pursuant to the foregoing share counting provisions of the Restated Equity Plan. Dividend equivalents paid in cash will not be counted against the number of shares reserved under the Restated Equity Plan.",

        "page_content": "Administration. The Restated Equity Plan will be administered by the compensation committee or a subcommittee thereof (or by the Board or another Board committee as may be determined by the Board from time to time). The administrator of the Restated Equity Plan (the 'Administrator') or its delegate will have the authority to determine which service providers receive awards and set the terms and conditions applicable to the award within the confines of the Restated Equity Plan's terms. The Administrator will have the authority to make all determinations and interpretations under, prescribe all forms for use with, and adopt rules for the administration of, the Restated Equity Plan.\n\nAward Limits for Employees. The Restated Equity Plan includes annual limits on awards that may be granted to any individual participant. For participants other than non-employee directors, the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock with respect to all options and stock appreciation rights that may be granted to any one person during any calendar year is 500,000 and the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be earned with respect to all restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and other stock- or cash-based awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code and are denominated in shares that may be granted to any one person during any calendar year is 500,000. The maximum aggregate amount that may become payable (in cash, shares of common stock, or any combination thereof) pursuant to all performance bonus awards that may be paid to any one person during any calendar year is $10,000,000. These numbers will be multiplied by two with respect to awards granted to a participant during the calendar year in which the participant commences employment with the Company or its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will more than the authorized number of shares available for issuance under the Restated Equity Plan be granted to any one person during any calendar year with respect to one or more awards denominated in shares. These numbers may be adjusted to take into account equity restructurings and certain other corporate transactions as described below. For purposes of these individual award limits, each share subject to an award (including a Full Value Award) will be counted as one share against the specified limit.\n\nCompensation Limit for Non-Employee Directors. The sum of all cash or other compensation and the value (determined as of the grant date in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 (or any successor thereto)) of all awards granted to a nonemployee director under the Restated Equity Plan during any calendar year for services as a member of the Board may not exceed $600,000. This limit applies to all compensation provided as a non-employee director, whether or not such compensation is provided under the Restated Equity Plan.\n\nEligibility. Employees and non-employee directors of 3M or any of its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the Restated Equity Plan. As of March 1, 2021, 3M and its subsidiaries had approximately 6,075 active employees and 11 non-employee directors who were eligible to receive awards under the Existing Plan, and would have been eligible to receive awards under the Restated Equity Plan had it been in effect on such date. Service providers other than employees and non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in the Existing Plan or the Restated Equity Plan.\n\nTypes of Awards. The Restated Equity Plan provides for the grant of stock options (including ISOs and nonqualified stock options), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance bonus awards, performance shares and other stock- or cash-based awards. Awards to eligible individuals will be subject to the terms of an individual award agreement between 3M and the individual. A brief description of each award type follows.\n\n- \u00b7 Stock Options. Stock options may be granted under the Restated Equity Plan, including both ISOs and non-qualified stock options, which provide the holder a right to purchase shares of common stock at a specified exercise price. The exercise price per share for each stock option will be set by the Administrator, but will not be less than the fair market value on the date of grant (or 110 percent of the price of an ISO in the case of an individual who, on the date of grant, owns or is deemed to own shares representing more than 10 percent of the stock of 3M or any 'parent corporation' or 'subsidiary corporation' within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code); provided, that the Administrator may grant stock options with an exercise price that is less than the fair market value on the date of grant in the event stock options are assumed or substituted in connection with certain corporate transactions. The term of any option award may not be longer than ten years (or five years in the case of an ISO granted to a 10 percent shareholder of 3M). The Administrator will determine the time period for exercise of each award, including the time period for exercise following a termination of service by the recipient, subject to the maximum ten-year term.\n- \u00b7 Stock Appreciation Rights. The Administrator is authorized to grant stock appreciation rights to eligible recipients in its discretion, on such terms and conditions as it may determine, consistent with the Restated Equity Plan. A stock appreciation right entitles the holder to exercise the stock appreciation right to acquire shares of 3M's common stock upon exercise within a specified time period from the date of grant. Subject to the provisions of the stock appreciation right award agreement, the recipient may receive from the Company an amount determined by",

The maximum term for which stock appreciation rights may be exercisable under the Restated Equity Plan is ten years.\n\n- \u00b7 Restricted Stock. The Administrator may make awards of restricted stock to eligible individuals in such amounts and at purchase prices (if any) to be established by the Administrator in connection with each award. Such awards will be subject to restrictions and other terms and conditions as are established by the Administrator. Upon issuance of restricted stock, recipients generally have the rights of a shareholder with respect to such shares, subject to the limitations and restrictions established by the Administrator in the individual award agreement. Such rights generally include the right to receive dividends and other distributions in relation to the award; however, dividends may be paid with respect to restricted stock subject to vesting only to the extent vesting conditions have been satisfied and the restricted stock vests.\n- \u00b7 Restricted Stock Units. The Restated Equity Plan authorizes awards of restricted stock units to eligible individuals in amounts and at purchase prices (if any) and upon such other terms and conditions as are established by the Administrator for each award. Restricted stock unit awards entitle recipients to acquire shares of 3M's common stock in the future under certain conditions. Holders of restricted stock units generally have no rights of ownership or as shareholders in relation to the award, unless and until the restrictions lapse and the restricted stock unit award vests in accordance with the terms of the grant. Restricted stock units may be accompanied by the right to receive the equivalent value of dividends paid on shares of the Company's common stock prior to the delivery of the underlying shares (i.e., dividend equivalent rights); however, dividend equivalents with respect to an award subject to vesting that are based on dividends paid prior to the vesting of such award will only be paid out to the holder to the extent that the vesting conditions are subsequently satisfied and the award vests. The Administrator may provide that settlement of restricted stock units will occur upon or as soon as reasonably practicable after the restricted stock units vest or will instead be deferred, on a mandatory basis or at the participant's election.\n- \u00b7 Performance Shares. The Administrator is authorized to grant performance shares under the Restated Equity Plan. Performance shares will be denominated in shares of common stock, unit equivalents and/or units of value (including a dollar value of shares of common stock) and may be linked to any one or more of the performance criteria listed below, or other specific criteria determined by the Administrator, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Administrator.\n- \u00b7 Performance Bonus Awards. Performance bonus awards will be denominated in cash and will be initially payable in cash, but may be paid in cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares in the discretion of the Administrator. Performance bonus awards will be payable upon the attainment of performance goals that are established by the Administrator and relate to any one or more of the performance criteria listed below, or other specific criteria determined by the Administrator, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Administrator.\n- \u00b7 Other Stock- or Cash-based Awards. Other stock- or cash-based awards are awards of cash, fully vested shares of 3M's common stock and other awards valued wholly or partially by referring to, or otherwise based on, shares of 3M's common stock. Other stock- or cash-based awards may be granted to participants and may also be available as a payment form in the settlement of other awards, as standalone payments and as payment in lieu of compensation otherwise payable to any individual who is eligible to receive awards. The Administrator will determine the terms and conditions of other stock- or cash-based awards, including any purchase price, performance goals (which may be based on performance criteria or otherwise), transfer restrictions and vesting conditions.\n\nPerformance-Based Awards. Any awards granted pursuant to the Restated Equity Plan may be subject to performancebased vesting conditions. The value of performance awards may be linked to any one or more of the performance criteria listed below, or other specific criteria determined by the Administrator, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Administrator. The goals are established and evaluated by the Administrator and may relate to performance over any periods as determined by Administrator.\n\nFor purposes of the Restated Equity Plan, the pre-established performance goals may be based on one or more performance criteria (either for the entire Company or a subsidiary, division, business segment, business unit or an individual, and may be used in setting performance goals applicable to other stock- or cash-based awards), which may include, but are not limited to: (i) net earnings or losses (either before or after one or more of (A) interest, (B) taxes, (C) depreciation, (D) amortization, and (E) non-cash equity-based compensation expense); (ii) gross or net sales or revenue or sales or revenue growth; (iii) gross or net organic sales volume or organic sales volume growth; (iv) net income (either before or after taxes) or adjusted net income; (v) sales from one or more products (or categories of products) as a percentage of total sales or revenue; (vi) profits (including but not limited to gross profits, net profits, profit growth, net operation profit or economic profit), profit return ratios or operating margin; (vii) operating earnings (either before or after taxes or before or after allocation of corporate overhead and bonus); (viii) cash flow (including",

Any performance goals that are financial metrics may be determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP'), in accordance with accounting principles established by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB Principles'), or may be adjusted when established to include or exclude any items otherwise includable or excludable under GAAP or under IASB Principles.\n\nThe Restated Equity Plan also permits the Administrator to provide for objectively determinable adjustments to the applicable performance criteria in setting performance goals for performance-based awards, including, but not limited to, adjustments for (i) restructurings, discontinued operations, special items, and other unusual, infrequently occurring or non-recurring charges, events or items; (ii) asset sales or write-downs; (iii) litigation or claim judgments or settlements; (iv) acquisitions or divestitures; (v) reorganization or change in the corporate structure or capital structure of the Company; (vi) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company, subsidiary, division, business segment or business unit or not within the reasonable control of management; (vii) foreign exchange gains and losses; (viii) a change in the fiscal year of the Company; (ix) the refinancing or repurchase of bank loans or debt securities; (x) unbudgeted capital expenditures; (xi) the issuance or repurchase of equity securities and other changes in the number of outstanding shares; (xii) conversion of some or all of convertible securities to common stock of the Company; (xiii) any business interruption event; (xiv) changes in pricing; (xv) changes in foreign currency exchange rates; (xvi) the cumulative effects of tax or accounting changes in accordance with GAAP; (xvii) unusual tax transactions; or (xviii) the effect of changes in other laws or regulatory rules affecting reported results.\n\nProhibition on Repricing. Under the Restated Equity Plan, the Administrator may not, without the approval of 3M's shareholders, authorize the repricing of any outstanding option or stock appreciation right to reduce its price per share, cancel any option or stock appreciation right in exchange for cash or another award when the price per share exceeds the fair market value of the underlying shares, or take any other action with respect to an option or stock appreciation right that the Company determines would be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of the principal U.S. national securities exchange on which the shares of common stock are listed.\n\nCertain Transactions. The Administrator has broad discretion to take action under the Restated Equity Plan, as well as make adjustments to the terms and conditions of existing and future awards, to prevent the dilution or enlargement of intended benefits and facilitate necessary or desirable changes in the event of certain transactions and events affecting 3M's common stock, such as dividends or other distributions (whether in the form of cash, common stock, other securities, or other property), reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, change in control events and other corporate transactions. In addition, in the event of certain non-reciprocal transactions with 3M's shareholders known as 'equity restructurings,' the Administrator will make equitable adjustments to outstanding awards and/or with respect to which awards may be granted under the Restated Equity Plan and the individual award limits under the Restated Equity Plan. No automatic 'singletrigger' vesting acceleration applies under the Restated Equity Plan in connection with a change in control event.\n\nAmendment and Termination. The Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Restated Equity Plan at any time and from time to time. No amendment, other than an amendment that increases the number of shares available under the Restated Equity Plan, may materially and adversely affect the economic benefits to be delivered under an outstanding award as of the date of such amendment without the consent of the affected participant. Shareholder approval is required for any amendment to the Restated Equity Plan to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws. The Restated Equity Plan provides that in no event may an award be granted pursuant to the Restated Equity Plan after ten years from the date of the Board's approval of the Restated Equity Plan.\n\nForfeiture and Claw-backs. All awards (including the gross amount of any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit obtained in connection with any award) made under the Restated Equity Plan are subject to recoupment by",

The Restated Equity Plan is intended to conform to all provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any and all regulations and rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder, including, without limitation, Rule 16b-3. The Restated Equity Plan will be administered, and awards will be granted and may be exercised, only in such a manner as to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.\n\n## United States federal income tax consequences\n\nThe following is a general summary under current law of the material federal income tax consequences to an employee or non-employee director granted an award under the Restated Equity Plan. This summary deals with the general federal income tax principles that apply and is provided only for general information. Some kinds of taxes, such as state, local and foreign income taxes and federal employment taxes, are not discussed. Tax laws are complex and subject to change and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. The summary does not discuss all aspects of federal income taxation that may be relevant in light of a holder's personal circumstances. This summarized tax information is not tax advice and a holder of an award should rely on the advice of his or her legal and tax advisors.\n\nISOs. No income will be recognized by a participant upon the grant or exercise of an ISO. The basis of shares transferred to a participant upon exercise of an ISO is the price paid for the shares. If the participant holds the shares for at least one year after the transfer of the shares to the participant and two years after the grant of the option, the participant will recognize capital gain or loss upon sale of the shares received upon exercise equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and the basis in the shares. Generally, if the shares are not held for that period, the participant will recognize ordinary income upon disposition in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the amount paid for the shares, or if less (and if the disposition is a transaction in which loss, if any, will be recognized), the gain on disposition. Any additional gain realized by the participant upon the disposition will be a capital gain. The excess of the fair market value of shares received upon the exercise of an ISO over the option price for the shares is an item of adjustment for the participant for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. Therefore, although no income is recognized upon exercise of an ISO, a participant may be subject to alternative minimum tax as a result of the exercise.\n\nNon-Qualified Stock Options. No income is expected to be recognized by a participant upon the grant of a nonqualified stock option. Upon exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the amount paid for the shares. Income recognized upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option will be considered compensation subject to withholding at the time the income is recognized, and, therefore, the participant's employer must make the necessary arrangements with the participant to ensure that the amount of the tax required to be withheld is available for payment. Non-qualified stock options generally provide the employer with a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant at the time of the recognition by the participant, subject to the deduction limitations described below.\n\nStock Appreciation Rights. Participants are not expected to recognize income upon receiving a grant of stock appreciation rights. Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of payment pursuant to stock appreciation rights in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value of any common stock received. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.\n\nRestricted Stock. If the restrictions on an award of shares of restricted stock are of a nature that the shares are both subject to a 'substantial risk of forfeiture' and are not freely transferable (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code), the participant will not recognize income at the time of the award unless the participant affirmatively elects to include the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on the date of the award, less any amount paid for the shares, in gross income for the year of the award pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. In the absence of this election, the participant will be required to recognize income on the date the shares either become freely transferable or are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code), the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on such date, less any amount paid for the shares. The employer will be entitled to a deduction at the time of income recognition to the participant in an amount equal to the amount the participant is required to include in income with respect to the shares, subject to the deduction limitations described below.",

        "page_content": "If a Section 83(b) election is made within 30 days after the date the restricted stock is received, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of the receipt of the restricted stock, and the employer will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time, less the amount paid, if any, by the participant for the restricted stock. If a Section 83(b) election is made, no additional income will be recognized by the participant upon the lapse of restrictions on the restricted stock, but, if the restricted stock is subsequently forfeited, the participant may not deduct the income that was recognized pursuant to the Section 83(b) election at the time of the receipt of the restricted stock.\n\nDividends paid to a participant holding restricted stock before the expiration of the restriction period will constitute additional compensation taxable as ordinary income to the participant subject to withholding, unless the participant made an election under Section 83(b). Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the dividends includible in the participant's income as compensation. If the participant has made a Section 83(b) election, the dividends will be dividend income, rather than additional compensation, to the participant.\n\nIf the restrictions on an award of restricted stock are not of a nature that the shares are both subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not freely transferable, within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of the transfer of the shares in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on the date of the transfer, less any amount paid therefore.\n\nThe employer will be entitled to a deduction at that time in an amount equal to the amount the participant is required to include in income with respect to the restricted shares, subject to the deduction limitations described below.\n\nRestricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units. A recipient of restricted stock units or deferred stock units generally should not recognize ordinary income at the time of grant. Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of cash and/or transfer of shares of common stock in payment of the restricted stock units or deferred stock units in an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash received and the fair market value of the common stock so transferred. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.\n\nA participant generally will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the payment of any dividend equivalents paid with respect to an award in an amount equal to the cash and the fair market value of any common stock the participant receives. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.\n\nPerformance Shares and Performance Bonus Awards. Participants are not expected to recognize income upon the grant of performance shares or performance bonus awards. Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding at the time of payment, vesting or settlement of the award based on the fair market value of the award on that date. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.\n\nLimitations on the Employer's Compensation Deduction. In general, under Section 162(m), income tax deductions of publicly-held corporations may be limited to the extent total compensation (including base salary, annual bonus, stock option exercises and non-qualified benefits paid) for certain executive officers exceeds $1 million (less the amount of any 'excess parachute payments' as defined in Section 280G of the Code) in any one year. Prior to the TCJA, covered employees generally consisted of our Chief Executive Officer and each of the next three highest compensated officers serving at the end of the taxable year other than our Chief Financial Officer, and compensation that qualified as 'performance-based' under Section 162(m) was exempt from this $1 million deduction limitation. As part of the TCJA, the ability to rely on this exemption was, with certain limited exceptions, eliminated; in addition, the definition of covered employees was expanded to generally include all named executive officers. Certain awards under the Existing Plan granted prior to November 2, 2017 may be grandfathered from the changes made by the TCJA under certain limited transition relief, however, for grants after that date and any grants which are not grandfathered, we will no longer be able to take a deduction for any compensation in excess of $1 million that is paid to a covered employee. There is no guarantee that we will be able to take a deduction for any compensation in excess of $1 million that is paid to a covered employee under the Existing Plan or the Restated Equity Plan.\n\nExcess Parachute Payments. Section 280G of the Code limits the deduction that an employer may take for otherwise deductible compensation payable to certain individuals if the compensation constitutes an 'excess parachute payment.' Excess parachute payments arise from payments made to disqualified individuals that are in the nature of compensation and are contingent on changes in ownership or control of the employer or certain affiliates. Among other things, excess",

In addition to the deduction limitation applicable to the employer, a disqualified individual receiving an excess parachute payment is subject to a 20 percent excise tax on the amount thereof.\n\nApplication of Section 409A of the Code. Section 409A of the Code imposes an additional 20 percent tax and interest on an individual receiving non-qualified deferred compensation under a plan that fails to satisfy certain requirements. For purposes of Section 409A, 'non-qualified deferred compensation' includes equity-based incentive arrangements, including some stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards and other awards that may be granted under the Restated Equity Plan. Generally speaking, Section 409A does not apply to ISOs, non-discounted non-qualified stock options and stock appreciation rights if no deferral is provided beyond exercise, or restricted stock.\n\nThe awards made pursuant to the Restated Equity Plan are expected to be designed in a manner intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent the awards granted under the Restated Equity Plan are not exempt from coverage. However, if the Restated Equity Plan fails to comply with Section 409A in operation, a participant could be subject to the additional taxes and interest.\n\nState, local and foreign tax consequences may in some cases differ from the United States federal income tax consequences described above. The foregoing summary of the United States federal income tax consequences in respect of the Restated Equity Plan is for general information only. Interested parties should consult their own advisors as to specific tax consequences of their awards.\n\nThe Restated Equity Plan is not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and is not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.\n\n## New plan benefits\n\n3M's non-employee directors are eligible to receive certain compensation each year, a portion of which is payable in the form of common stock or deferred stock units, as described above under ' Director compensation ' beginning on page 45. If the Restated Equity Plan is approved, the non-employee director compensation payable in the form of common stock or deferred stock units will be issued under the Restated Equity Plan following the effective date of the Restated Equity Plan. All other future grants under the Restated Equity Plan are within the discretion of the Administrator and the benefits of such grants are, therefore, not determinable. No shares of common stock have been issued with respect to the share increase for which shareholder approval is sought under this Proposal 4.",

Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted 'AGAINST' this proposal unless a shareholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.\n\n3M has received a shareholder proposal from the United Steelworkers, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, 60 Boulevard of the Allies, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, the owner of 68 shares of 3M common stock (the 'Proponent'). The Proponent has requested that the Company include the following proposal and supporting statement ( in italics ) in its proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The proposal may be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by the Proponent or the Proponent's qualified representative. For the reasons set forth following the Proponent's statement, your Board of Directors recommends that you vote 'AGAINST' this proposal.\n\nRESOLVED: Shareholders of 3M Corporation (the 'Company'') request that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors take into consideration the pay grades and/or salary ranges of all classifications of Company employees when setting target amounts for CEO compensation. The Compensation Committee should describe in the Company's proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings how it complies with this requested policy. Compliance with this policy is excused if it will result in the violation of any existing contractual obligation or the terms of any existing compensation plan.\n\n## SUPPORTING STATEMENT\n\nLike at many companies, our Company's Compensation Committee uses peer group benchmarks of what other companies pay their CEOs to set its target CEO compensation. These target pay amounts are then subject to performance adjustments. To ensure that our Company's CEO compensation is reasonable relative to our Company's overall employee pay philosophy and structure, we believe that the Compensation Committee should also consider the pay grades and/or salary ranges of Company employees when setting CEO compensation target amounts.\n\nThis proposal does not require the Compensation Committee to use other employee pay data in a specific way to set CEO compensation targets. Under this proposal, the Compensation Committee will have discretion to determine how other employee pay should impact CEO compensation targets. The Compensation Committee also will retain authority to use peer group benchmarks and/or any other metric to set CEO compensation target amounts.\n\nOver time, using peer group benchmarks to set CEO compensation can lead to pay inflation. Although many companies target CEO compensation at the median of their peer group, certain companies have targeted their CEO's pay above median. In addition, peer groups can be cherry-picked to include larger or more successful companies where CEO compensation is higher. (Charles Elson and Craig Ferrere, 'Executive Superstars, Peer Groups and Overcompensation,' Journal of Corporation Law, Spring 2013).",

        "page_content": "The current system of using peer group benchmarks, without taking into account the pay grades or salary ranges of all company employees, when determining CEO compensation has had the effect of CEO pay far outpacing that of average employees. In 2019, the average S&P 500 CEO made 264 times that of their median employee. For our Company, the CEO/median employee ratio calculated in 2019 was 319 to 1. According to the 2006 report The State of Working America the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay has risen from 35 to 1 in 1979, to 71 to 1 in 1989, to 248 to 1 in 1998. The current system of determining CEO compensation without taking into account the pay of average company employees has led to glaring inequality between the workers who make our company what it is and the person who sits at the top.\n\nFor those reasons, we urge you to vote in favor of this proposal.\n\n## Board's statement opposing the proposal\n\nAfter careful consideration, and for the reasons set forth below, the Board believes that it is not in the best interests of 3M or its shareholders to approve the proposed resolution.\n\n- 1. The Company already maintains global compensation principles that are intended to ensure that its compensation practices are fair and reasonable as applied to both executive and non-executive employees. These principles align with the Company's vision and strategies, balance both individual and enterprise-wide performance and seek to provide competitive wages and benefits with consistent positioning in the median range of the markets that are most relevant to employees based on roles, responsibilities, skills, and performance. To monitor and support the effectiveness of this program, the Company also periodically compares its pay components to those of other premier companies, and adjusts them as necessary to stay competitive and attract, retain, and motivate a highly qualified, diverse workforce at all levels throughout the organization, not just for its executives.\n- 2.  The Board of Directors believes that the overwhelming majority of our shareholders support the Company's current executive compensation program. As described in more detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, the current program emphasizes a strong pay-for-performance philosophy and seeks to align the compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers with the interests of long-term 3M shareholders. In 2020, approximately 93 percent of the votes cast on the Company's say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in last year's Proxy Statement.\n- 3.  The Compensation Committee already reviews and considers the ratio of annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our Chief Executive Officer), as reported in the proxy statement, which the Company believes provides a similar perspective to the Compensation Committee at no incremental cost to the Company. 3M has operations and different compensation programs in about 70 countries around the world. Compliance with the proposal would require substantial coordination with local employees in foreign countries to collect and transmit the necessary data on 'all classifications' of the Company's approximately 97,000 employees worldwide, all of which would need to be carefully analyzed and summarized. The Company believes that the time, cost, and resource burden associated with implementing the proposal is not warranted by any incremental benefit that the resulting information may be able to offer.",

Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted 'AGAINST' this proposal unless a shareholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.\n\n3M has received a shareholder proposal from John Montgomery as trustee of The John Bishop Montgomery Trust, the owner of 534 shares of 3M common stock (the 'Proponent'). The Proponent has requested that the Company include the following proposal and supporting statement ( in italics ) in its proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The proposal may be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by the Proponent or the Proponent's qualified representative. For the reasons set forth following the Proponent's statement, your Board of Directors recommends that you vote 'AGAINST' this proposal.\n\nItem 6 - Transition to Public Benefit Corporation\n\nRESOLVED: 3M Company ('Company') shareholders request our Board of Directors take steps necessary to amend our certificate of incorporation and, if necessary, bylaws (including presenting such amendments to the shareholders for approval) to become a public benefit corporation (a 'PBC') in light of its adoption of the Business Roundtable Statement of the Purpose of a Corporation (the 'Statement''). 1\n\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: The Company signed the Statement, which proclaims 'we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders. . . . We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.'\n\nHowever, the Company is a conventional Delaware corporation, so that directors' fiduciary duties emphasize the company and its shareholders, but not stakeholders (except to the extent they create value for shareholders over time). Accordingly, when the interests of shareholders and stakeholders such as workers or customers clash, the Company's legal duty excludes all but shareholders.\n\nAs one Delaware law firm reported to another signatory considering conversion, directors may consider stakeholder interests only if 'any decisions made with respect to such stakeholders are in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders.' 2 That contradicts the commitment made in the Statement.\n\nIn contrast, directors of a PBC must 'balance' the interests of shareholders, stakeholders and a specified benefit 3 , giving legal status to the Statement's empty promise.\n\nThis matters. A recent study determined that listed companies create annual social and environmental costs of $2.2 trillion 4 . These costs have many sources, including pollution, climate change and employee stress. 5 A company required to balance stakeholder interests could prioritize lowering these costs, even if doing so sacrificed higher return\n\nThat matters to our shareholders, the majority of whom are beneficial owners with broadly diversified interests. As of the 2020 proxy statement, the Company's top three holders were Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, which are generally indexed or otherwise broadly diversified.",

At 3M, we are inspired and motivated by our Vision of 'advancing every company, enhancing every home and improving every life.' In collaboration with our employees, customers, partners, government and communities, we apply our expertise and technology to help solve shared global challenges. Sustainability is at the heart of our company, and it anchors our purpose-driven innovation in products, manufacturing processes and new technologies. We remain focused on executing our plans and continuing to deliver exceptional value for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders.\n\nConsistent with this purpose-driven mission, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer signed on to The Business Roundtable Statement of Purpose of a Corporation (the BRT Statement), which reflects 3M's fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders. Here is how we work every day striving to fulfill our commitment to the five principles of the BRT Statement.\n\n- 1. Delivering value to our customers. Whether it's technology, manufacturing, global capabilities, or our brand, we are committed to connecting our fundamental strengths to our customers. We engage them and delve into their processes, their problems, and their promises to their customers. We bring our technology to them, along with a deep domain of expertise, and we deepen it further by working side by side with them as partners.\n- Throughout the process, we not only meet their expressed needs - we are often able to identify and address unarticulated needs. At 3M, many of our products are either specified (designed for the customer) or regulated (meeting specific performance and other requirements). Working in both categories carries us through multiple commerce channels, distribution models, direct models, retail models, and, increasingly, e-commerce. In every channel, we maintain a customer-first focus, making sure we're in a position to deliver value when, where, and how they want it.\n- 2.  Investing in our employees. This starts with compensating our employees fairly and providing important benefits. Our total employee compensation includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits, such as access to medical, dental, vision, savings and retirement plans for eligible employees.\n\nWe also provide learning opportunities for all employees to help them develop new skills for a rapidly changing world. With the Company's global online employee learning platform, employees can access unique, just-intime development resources in over 15 languages to support their career aspirations and advance their skills. A diverse, global workforce and inclusive culture that provides fair and equitable opportunities helps 3M remain",

        "page_content": "- competitive, advance its innovation culture, and serve customers. We focus on attracting and advancing top talent and have publicly committed to advance global diversity in management across all dimensions, with additional specific goals to increase the diversity of underrepresented groups. 3M supports these values with a CEO Inclusion Council, a forum led by senior management to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\n- 3.  Dealing fairly and ethically with our suppliers. Our supply chain is an extension of our commitment to sustainability. Each step in the supply chain includes benefits (like employment and community-building) as well as the potential for negative impacts (such as pollution or unsafe or unfair labor practices). Our commitment is to maximize the positives and mitigate the potential negatives by aligning our supplier expectations with our own corporate values. We expect our suppliers to be transparent about their environmental and social practices, provide improvement ideas, and work with us to transform our shared value chain.\n- At 3M, we set a high bar for our company regarding environmental and social governance, and we expect the same from our suppliers. 3M follows the OECD Due Diligence framework for all of our responsible sourcing activities. The 3M Supplier Responsibility Code (SRC) is based on 3M's corporate values for sustainable and responsible operations and aligns with the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact, of which 3M is a participant. The SRC is also consistent with the Code of Conduct of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). The SRC, available in 15 languages, outlines 3M's foundational social and environmental expectations in the areas of labor practice (aligned with the 3M Human Rights Policy), environmental, health and safety, ethics (aligned with the 3M Code of Conduct), and management systems for continuous improvement.\n- 4.  Supporting the communities in which we work. 3M recognizes the importance of science and uses it every day to improve the lives of people in our communities and around the world. We know that in order to solve global challenges we need new technologies, creative scientists, and evidence-based policies and decisions to drive impactful change. We also recognize the importance of well-trained science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates and the critical need for a diverse workforce with advanced manufacturing and vocational skills. We believe in the power of science, sharing our expertise, and investing in the bright minds of tomorrow.\n- To advance social justice within our community, 3M has committed to investing $50 million over 5 years to address racial opportunity gaps through workforce development initiatives in the communities in which our employees live and our business operates. Expanding our partnership with the UN Global Compact, 3M became a Patron Sponsor of the SDG Ambition, a program to accelerate business action to achieve the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals. 3M continues to partner in innovative ways to help in the fight against COVID-19. To bring innovation home to students who were suddenly learning remotely, we created 3M's Science at Home program, designed to provide fun, educational science experiments for students aged 6-12.\n- 5.  Generating long-term value for shareholders. We are committed to good corporate governance, transparency and effective engagement with shareholders, who provide the capital that allows us to invest, grow and innovate. We believe that good corporate governance practices serve the long-term interests of our shareholders and other stakeholders, strengthen the Board and management, and further enhance the public trust 3M has earned from more than a century of operating with uncompromising integrity and doing business the right way.\n- Shareholder engagement is fundamental to our commitment to good governance and essential to maintaining our strong corporate governance practices. We engage regularly with our global investors to gain valuable insights into the governance issues about which they care most, and we aim to ensure our governance practices remain industry-leading from their perspectives. During 2020, members of senior management, joined by our Lead Independent Director and Chair of our Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee, met with a crosssection of shareholders representing approximately 50% of shares owned by our institutional shareholders, or 30% of our outstanding shares. The feedback from these meetings were shared with the Board and helped inform on shareholder interests, corporate governance practices and trends.\n\nOur commitment to all stakeholders has manifested itself during the global health crisis. We aggressively responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, given our critical role as a provider of personal protective equipment in the U.S. and across the world. Our response to the pandemic continues to focus on protecting employees and healthcare workers, serving customers, and maintaining business continuity, while investing in growth, productivity and sustainability to position the company for success coming out of the crisis.\n\nAs the actions discussed above demonstrate, 3M is already carrying on its purpose-driven mission by taking all stakeholders into consideration in our long-term strategies and business operations, and living the five principles of the BRT Statement, all of which are consistent with the General Corporation Law of Delaware under which 3M is organized.",

BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates provide investment management services to several employee benefit plans sponsored by the Company and its Canadian affiliate. The 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the 3M Savings Plan and the 3M Canada Company Master Trust utilize these investment management services. In total, the various employee benefit plans paid fees of $3.9 million in 2020 to BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates, a majority of which was paid by the participants in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. In addition, the Trustee (BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.) will charge the funds held by the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings Plan an annual administration fee and transaction fees which are incorporated into the funds' NAV. The fees paid are reviewed by the fiduciaries of the employee benefit plans and are determined to be reasonable for the services provided.\n- (3) In a Schedule 13G filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 5, 2021, State Street Corporation reported that, as of December 31, 2020, it had shared voting power with respect to 21,953,597 shares of 3M common stock and shared dispositive power with respect to 30,047,988 shares of 3M common stock. Of these shares, 40,256 shares were held as investment manager for certain 3M savings plans, including the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings Plan, which are 401(k) retirement savings plans. State Street Bank and Trust Company provides corporate finance services to the Company. During 2020, State Street Bank and Trust Company had also provided custody and investment management services to the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings Plan. These services were no longer in place as of December 31, 2020. The 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the 3M Savings Plan, and the 3M Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan utilize State Street Global Advisors, an affiliate of State Street Bank and Trust Company, as an investment manager. Further, State Street Bank and Trust Company is a participant of 3M Company's $3 billion five-year credit agreement dated November 15, 2019. In total, the Company and the various employee benefit plans paid fees of $2.0 million in 2020 to State Street Bank and Trust Company and its affiliates, a majority of which was paid by the participants in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. In addition, during 2020, the Trustee charged the funds held by the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings Plan an annual administration fee and transaction fees which are incorporated into the funds' NAV.

If you are a record date shareholder with a 16-digit control number, you may submit questions both in advance of and during the meeting. If you wish to submit a question in advance of the meeting, you may use your 16-digit control number to access www.proxyvote.com . Questions may also be submitted shortly before or during the meeting, by logging into the virtual meeting platform at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ MMM2021 , select the 'Q&A' button and type your questions into the 'Submit a Question' field, and click 'Submit.' Questions relevant to meeting matters will be answered during the meeting, subject to time constraints. To allow us to address questions from as many shareholders as possible, each shareholder will be limited to two questions. Questions from multiple shareholders on the same topic or relating to the same topic may be grouped, summarized and answered together. We ask that all shareholders provide their name and contact details when submitting questions through the virtual meeting platform, so that we may address any individual concerns or follow up matters directly. Responses to questions relevant to meeting matters that we do not have time to respond to during the meeting will be posted to our Investor Relations website at https://investors.3M.com as soon as practicable after the meeting. Questions regarding personal matters or matters not relevant to meeting matters will not be answered.

As a result, we are mailing to many of our shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. In addition, we are providing the notice and proxy materials by e-mail to some of our shareholders who previously consented to electronic delivery of proxy materials. Those shareholders should have received an e-mail containing a link to the website where the proxy materials are available, as well as a link to the proxy voting website. All shareholders receiving the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and to request to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found in the notice. In addition, the notice contains instructions on how you may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or to access them electronically in connection with future distributions of proxy materials. Distributing proxy materials electronically conserves natural resources and reduces the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials.\n\n## Why did I receive a printed copy of the proxy materials and not the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?\n\nWe are providing some of our shareholders, including shareholders who have previously requested to receive paper copies of the proxy materials, with paper copies of the proxy materials instead of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.\n\n## How do I view the proxy materials online?\n\nGo to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions to view the materials. You will need to provide the control number printed in the box marked by the arrow located on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (see example below - the information in the box is an example only - your number will be different and is unique to you).\n\n1234 5678 9012 3456",

If you choose to access future proxy materials electronically, you will receive an e-mail with instructions containing a link to the website where those materials are available and a link to the proxy voting website. Your election to access proxy materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it.\n\nPlease note that you MAY NOT USE your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to vote your shares; it is NOT a form for voting. If you return the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in an attempt to vote your shares, that vote will not count.\n\nFor more information about the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, please visit: www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxymatters/e-proxy.shtml\n\n## Shareholders entitled to vote\n\nEach share of our common stock outstanding as of the close of business on March 16, 2021, the record date, is entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting on each matter properly brought before the meeting. As of that date, there were 579,417,201 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.\n\nMost 3M shareholders hold their shares through a broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee (which for simplicity we refer to as a 'broker or other nominee') rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially:\n\n## Shareholder of Record\n\n## Beneficial Owner\n\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name with 3M's transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered the shareholder of record of those shares and the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or if you requested paper delivery, a copy of these proxy materials are being sent directly to you by 3M. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to 3M or to vote electronically at the meeting. You may also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the heading 'Voting methods.'\n\nIf your shares are held by a broker or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker or other nominee who is considered the shareholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other nominee on how to vote and are also invited to attend the meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares electronically at the meeting, unless you obtain a legal proxy from the broker or other nominee. Your broker or other nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting instruction card for you to use. You may also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the heading 'Voting methods.' If you fail to provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee, it will have discretion to vote your shares with respect to Proposal 2, but not with respect to Proposals 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as described below under 'Voting requirements to elect directors and approve each of the proposals described in this Proxy Statement.'",

Abstentions and 'broker non-votes' are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum.  As discussed below, a 'broker non-vote' occurs when a broker or other nominee holding shares for  a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker or other nominee does  not have discretionary voting power for that proposal and has not received instructions from the  beneficial owner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Broker Voting | Under NYSE rules, brokers have discretionary authority to vote their clients' shares in 'routine' matters  (including Proposal 2, the ratification of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm) so  long as the beneficial owner of those shares did not provide voting instructions to the broker at least  ten days before the shareholder meeting. Director elections, shareholder proposals, and executive  compensation matters, including say-on-pay and equity compensation plan proposals, are not  considered 'routine' matters for these purposes. As a result, if you do not provide your broker with  instructions as to how to vote your shares, your broker will be prohibited from voting on Proposals 1,  3, 4, 5 and 6, resulting in a 'broker non-vote' with respect to those proposals.

        "page_content": "## Changing your vote\n\nYou may change your proxy voting instructions at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting. You may enter a new vote by using the Internet or the telephone or by mailing a new proxy card or new voting instruction card bearing a later date (which will automatically revoke your earlier voting instructions), so long as the new vote is received before the deadlines described above under the heading 'Voting methods.' You may also change your vote by granting a new proxy or by voting electronically at the virtual Annual Meeting.\n\n## Counting the vote\n\nIn the election of directors, you may vote 'FOR' or 'AGAINST' one or more of the nominees or you may 'ABSTAIN.' Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. For Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, you may vote 'FOR,' 'AGAINST,' or 'ABSTAIN,' but please note that abstentions will have the same effect as a vote 'AGAINST.' If you sign your proxy card or broker voting instruction card but provide no voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. Shares held in your account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan will be voted by the trustee as described in 'Shareholders entitled to vote' beginning on page 125.\n\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes and act as the inspectors of election.\n\n## Confidentiality\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors has a policy that all shareholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify shareholders are to be maintained in confidence. No such document will be available for examination, and the identity and vote of any shareholder will not be disclosed, except as necessary to meet legal requirements and allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of the shareholder vote. The policy also provides that inspectors of election for shareholder votes must be independent and cannot be employees of the Company. Occasionally, shareholders provide written comments on their proxy card that may be forwarded to 3M management.\n\n## Results of the vote\n\nWe will issue a press release announcing the preliminary voting results for items of business properly presented at the meeting and will disclose the results for those items in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days of the Annual Meeting date. The press release with voting results will also be available on our website at www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.jhtml .\n\n## Delivery of documents to shareholders sharing an address\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission rules allow us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to any household not participating in electronic proxy material delivery at which two or more shareholders reside, if we believe the shareholders are members of the same family (a practice called 'householding'). We believe that householding benefits both you and the Company by eliminating duplicate mailings to shareholders living at the same address and by reducing our printing and mailing costs. Each shareholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card.\n\nYour household may have received a single set of proxy materials this year. If you prefer to receive your own copy now or in future years, please request a duplicate set by calling 1-800-579-1639, by going to www.proxyvote.com , by e-mailing sendmaterial@proxyvote.com, or by writing to 3M Company, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Alternatively, if your household received multiple sets of proxy materials this year, and members of your household who are entitled to receive proxy materials would all prefer to receive only a single set of proxy materials, you may submit such a request as specified in the preceding sentence.\n\nIf a broker or other nominee holds your shares, you may continue to receive some duplicate mailings. Certain brokers will eliminate duplicate account mailings by allowing shareholders to consent to such elimination, or through implied consent if a shareholder does not request continuation of duplicate mailings. Since not all brokers and nominees may offer shareholders the opportunity this year to eliminate duplicate mailings, you may need to contact your broker or other nominee directly to discontinue duplicate mailings to your household.",

In addition to mailing these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by telephone, or by electronic communication by our directors, officers, and employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for these solicitation activities. We have hired Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of votes. We will pay Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. a fee of $22,000 plus expenses for these services. We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to beneficial owners of stock.\n\n## Transfer agent\n\nOur transfer agent is EQ Shareowner Services.

Such proposals must be sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the shareholder to determine when the proposal was received by the Company) to: Ivan K. Fong, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, 3M Company, 3M Center, Building 220-14W-08, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000. Such proposals must comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulations regarding the inclusion of shareholder proposals in Company sponsored proxy materials, such as the shareholder continuing to own a minimum number of shares until the Annual Meeting and appearing in person or through an authorized representative at the meeting to present the proposal.\n\nAlternatively, shareholders intending to present a proposal at next year's Annual Meeting without having it included in the Company's Proxy Statement must comply with the requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws, a copy of which is available at www.3M.com under Investor Relations - Governance. Our Bylaws require, among other things, that our Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the shareholder no earlier than the close of business on November 24, 2021, and no later than the close of business on December 24, 2021. The notice must contain the information required by our Bylaws.\n\nProposals received by the Corporate Secretary after the dates mentioned will not be included in the Proxy Statement or acted upon at next year's Annual Meeting.\n\nBy order of the Board of Directors.\n\nIvan K. Fong\n\nSenior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\n\n<!-- image -->",

Operating income, net income attributable to 3M (hereafter referred to as 'net income'), and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders (hereafter referred to as 'diluted earnings per share') are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure (excluding special items). Special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to an understanding of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the Company's operations. The Company believes that discussion of results excluding special items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe reconciliations provided below reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\n## Adjusted earnings per share\n\n## (non-GAAP measure)\n\n|                                                 | 2020                    | 2020                                                          | 2020                                              | 2020                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) | Reported  GAAP  Measure | Adjustment for  Significant  Litigation  Related  Charges (a) | DDSD Sale  Gain, net of  Restructuring  Items (b) | Adjusted  Non-GAAP  Measure |\n| Net Sales                                       | $32,184                 |                                                               |                                                   | $32,184                     |\n| Operating Income                                | $ 7,161                 | $ 17                                                          | $ (334 )                                          | $ 6,844                     |\n| Operating Income Margin                         | 22.3%                   |                                                               |                                                   | 21.3%                       |\n| Net income attributable to 3M                   | $ 5,384                 | $ (39 )                                                       | $ (257 )                                          | $ 5,088                     |\n| Earnings per diluted share                      | $ 9.25                  | $(0.07 )                                                      | $ ( 0.44 )                                        | $ 8.74                      |\n| Earnings per diluted share percent change       | 18.4%                   |                                                               |                                                   | -5.7%                       |",

The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $112 million that was reported within the Company's Safety and Industrial business.\n- (e) During the fourth quarter of 2019, in light of a slower than expected 2019 and to realign 3M's organizational structure and operating model to improve growth and operational efficiency, respectively, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions. The Company recorded a fourth quarter 2019 pre-tax charge of $134 million.\n- (f) In February 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of all of the ownership interests of the technology business of M*Modal for $0.7 billion of cash, net of cash acquired, and assumption of $0.3 billion of M*Modal's debt. In October 2019, 3M completed the acquisition of all of the ownership interests of Acelity Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries for consideration of $4.5 billion net of cash acquired as shown in the table below, and assumption of $2.3 billion of debt.",

        "page_content": "- (g) In February 2018, 3M reached an agreement with the State of Minnesota that resolved the previously disclosed Natural Resource Damages (NRD) lawsuit filed by the State against the Company with respect to the presence of PFAS (certain perfluorinated compounds) in the environment. Under the terms of the settlement, 3M agreed to provide an $850 million grant to the State for a special '3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund.' This Fund will enable projects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to residents and enhancing groundwater recharge to support sustainable growth. The projects will also result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space preservation. 3M recorded a charge of $897 million ($770 million after-tax), inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 associated with the resolution of this matter.\n- (h) During the first quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a tax expense of $217 million related to a measurement period adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). In the fourth quarter 2018, 3M finalized the tax impact related to TCJA with a reversal of previously recorded tax expense in the amount of $41 million.\n- (i) In June 2018, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets Division and reflected a pre-tax gain of $494 million as a result of this divestiture. Additionally, in December 2018, the Company completed the sale of the remaining telecommunications system integration services portion of the business based in Germany and reflected a pre-tax gain of $15 million as a result of this divestiture. Both divestitures were reported within the Company's Electronics and Energy business. During the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2018, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions related to addressing corporate functional costs following the Communication Markets Division divestiture. These actions resulted in a second quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $105 million and a fourth quarter 2018 pre-tax charge of $22 million, net of adjustments for reductions in cost estimates.\n- (j) Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under GAAP. Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion is meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by 3M's enactment of the TCJA, along with a U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by three percentage points.\n- (k) Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation.",

Subject to adjustment under Article VIII and the terms of this Article IV, Awards may be made under the Plan covering up to the Overall Share Limit. As of the effective date of the Original Plan, the Company ceased granting awards under the Prior Plan; however, Prior Plan Awards will remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plan. Shares issued or delivered under the Plan may consist of authorized but unissued Shares, Shares purchased on the open market or treasury Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by 2.5 Shares for each Share delivered in settlement of any Full Value Award, and by one share for every one share granted that is subject to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights.\n- 4.2 Share Recycling.  If all or any part of an Award or Prior Plan Award expires, lapses or is terminated, exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased, canceled without having been fully exercised or forfeited, in any case, in a manner that results in the Company acquiring Shares covered by the Award or Prior Plan Award at a price not greater than the price (as adjusted to reflect any Equity Restructuring) paid by the Participant for such Shares or not issuing any Shares covered by the Award or Prior Plan Award, the unused Shares covered by the Award or Prior Plan Award will, as applicable, become or again be available for Awards under the Plan. Further, Shares delivered (either by actual delivery or attestation) to the Company by a Participant or withheld by the Company to satisfy any applicable tax withholding obligation with respect to a Full Value Award (including Shares retained by the Company from the Full Value Award creating the tax obligation) will, as applicable, become or again be available for Award grants under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Restatement Effective Date, the following Shares shall not become or again be available for Award grants under the Plan: (a) Shares delivered (either by actual delivery or attestation) to the Company by a Participant or withheld by the Company to satisfy the applicable exercise price of an Option or a Prior Plan Award that is an option and/or to satisfy any applicable tax withholding obligation with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or a Prior Plan Award that is an option or a stock appreciation right (including Shares retained by the Company from the Option or Stock Appreciation Right or Prior Plan Award that is an option or a stock appreciation right being exercised and/or creating the tax obligation), (b) Shares subject to a Stock Appreciation Right that are not issued in connection with the settlement or exercise, as applicable, of the Stock Appreciation Right, and (c) Shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of Options. The payment of Dividend Equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding Awards or Prior Plan Awards shall not count against the Overall Share Limit. Any Shares that again become available for Awards under the Plan pursuant to this Section shall be added as (i) one Share for every one Share subject to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan or options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Prior Plan, and (ii) as 2.5 Shares for every one Share subject to Full Value Awards granted under the Plan or awards other than options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Prior Plan.\n- 4.3 Incentive Stock Option Limitations.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no more than 44,000,000 Shares (as adjusted to reflect any Equity Restructuring) may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options.\n- 4.4 Substitute Awards.  In connection with an entity's merger or consolidation with the Company or any Subsidiary or the Company's or any Subsidiary's acquisition of an entity's property or stock, the Administrator may grant Awards in substitution for any options or other stock or stock-based awards granted before such merger or consolidation by such entity or its affiliate. Substitute Awards may be granted on such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate, notwithstanding limitations on Awards in the Plan. Substitute Awards will not count against the Overall Share Limit (nor shall Shares subject to a Substitute Award be added to the Shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided above), except that Shares acquired by exercise of substitute Incentive Stock Options will count against the maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan. Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as appropriately adjusted to reflect the transaction) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant under the Plan (and Shares subject to such Awards (which, for the avoidance of doubt excludes Substitute Awards) may again become available for Awards under the Plan as provided under Section 4.2 above); provided that Awards using such available shares (or any Shares that again become available for issuance under the Plan under Section 4.2 above) shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to such acquisition or combination.",

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or in any policy of the Company regarding non-employee Director compensation, the Administrator may establish compensation for non-employee Directors from time to time, subject to the limitations in the Plan. The Administrator will from time to time determine the terms, conditions and amounts of all such non-employee Director compensation in its sole discretion and pursuant to the exercise of its business judgment, taking into account such factors, circumstances and considerations as it shall deem relevant from time to time, provided that the sum of any cash compensation, or other compensation, and the value (determined as of the grant date in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, or any successor thereto) of Awards granted to a non-employee Director as compensation for services as a non-employee Director during any calendar year may not exceed $600,000.\n\n## ARTICLE V.\n\n## STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS\n\n- 5.1 General.

The Administrator will determine the number of Shares covered by each Option and Stock Appreciation Right, the exercise price of each Option and Stock Appreciation Right and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of each Option and Stock Appreciation Right. A Stock Appreciation Right will entitle the Participant (or other person entitled to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right) to receive from the Company upon exercise of the exercisable portion of the Stock Appreciation Right an amount determined by multiplying the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price per Share of the Stock Appreciation Right by the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, subject to any limitations of the Plan or that the Administrator may impose and payable in cash, Shares valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise or a combination of the two as the Administrator may determine or provide in the Award Agreement.\n- 5.2 Exercise Price.  The Administrator will establish each Option's and Stock Appreciation Right's exercise price and specify the exercise price in the Award Agreement. The exercise price will not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the grant date of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right.\n- 5.3 Duration of Options.  Each Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable at such times and as specified in the Award Agreement, provided that the term of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right will not exceed ten years.\n\n## 5.4 Exercise.\n\n- (a) Exercise Procedure .  Options and Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised by delivering to the Company a notice of exercise, in a form and manner the Company approves (which may be electronic or telephonic), signed or authenticated by the person authorized to exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right, together with, as applicable, payment in full of (i) the exercise price for the number of Shares for which the Option is exercised in a manner specified in Section 5.5 and (ii) all applicable taxes in a manner specified in Section 9.5.\n- (b) Limited Automatic Exercise .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4(a), unless otherwise determined in the Award Agreement, the vested and exercisable portion of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that remains outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of its full term (or, if applicable, the limited posttermination exercise window) shall be deemed to have been exercised by the Participant at such time if (i) the Participant has accepted the Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (ii) the Fair Market Value of one Share exceeds the applicable exercise price per Share, and (iii) either (A) such Option or Stock Appreciation Right remains outstanding on the last day of its full term or (B) the Participant's Option or Stock Appreciation Right otherwise would terminate prior to the last day of its full term as a result of the Participant's death. For the avoidance of doubt, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that terminates upon the expiration of its limited post-termination exercise window shall not be deemed to have remained outstanding on the last day of its full term for purposes of clause (iii) in the preceding sentence. In the event an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is exercised pursuant to this Section 5.4(b), the Company shall deliver to the Participant the number of Shares for which the Option or Stock Appreciation Right was deemed exercised, less the number of Shares required to be withheld for the payment of the total purchase price and required withholding taxes. Unless the Company otherwise determines, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.",

Neither the Company nor the Administrator will be liable to a Participant, or any other party, if an Incentive Stock Option fails or ceases to qualify as an 'incentive stock option' under Section 422 of the Code. Any Incentive Stock Option or portion thereof that fails to qualify as an 'incentive stock option' under Section 422 of the Code for any reason, including becoming exercisable with respect to Shares having a fair market value exceeding the $100,000 limitation under Treasury Regulation Section 1.422-4, will be a Nonqualified Stock Option.\n\n## ARTICLE VI. RESTRICTED STOCK; RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\n\n- 6.1 General.  The Administrator may grant Restricted Stock, or the right to purchase Restricted Stock, to any Service Provider, subject to forfeiture or the Company's right to repurchase all or part of such shares at their issue price or other stated or formula price from the Participant if conditions the Administrator specifies in the Award Agreement are not satisfied before the end of the applicable restriction period or periods that the Administrator establishes for such Award. In addition, the Administrator may grant to Service Providers Restricted Stock Units, which may be subject to vesting and forfeiture conditions during the applicable restriction period or periods, as set forth in an Award Agreement. The Award Agreement for each Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Award shall set forth the terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as the Administrator shall determine.\n\n## 6.2 Restricted Stock.\n\n- (a) Dividends .

Such Other Stock or Cash Based Awards will also be available as a payment form in the settlement of other Awards, as standalone payments and as payment in lieu of compensation to which a Participant is otherwise entitled. Other Stock or Cash Based Awards may be paid in Shares, cash or other property, as the Administrator determines. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator will determine the terms and conditions of each Other Stock or Cash Based Award, including any purchase price, performance goal (which may be based on the Performance Criteria or otherwise), transfer restrictions, and vesting conditions, which will be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.",

In connection with any Equity Restructuring, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VIII the Administrator will equitably adjust the terms of the Plan and each outstanding Award as it deems appropriate to reflect the Equity Restructuring, which may include (i) adjusting the number and type of securities subject to each outstanding Award and/or with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in Article IV hereof on the maximum number and kind of shares that may be issued and the individual Award limitations in Section 10.18 hereof); (ii) adjusting the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price), and the performance goals or other criteria included in, outstanding Awards; and (iii) granting new Awards or making cash payments to Participants. The adjustments provided under this Section 8.1 will be nondiscretionary and final and binding on all interested parties, including the affected Participant and the Company; provided that the Administrator will determine whether an adjustment is equitable.\n- 8.2 Corporate Transactions.  In the event of any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, other securities, or other property), reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin off, combination, amalgamation, repurchase, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or sale or exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, Change in Control, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Common Stock or other securities of the Company, other similar corporate transaction or event, other unusual or nonrecurring transaction or event affecting the Company or its financial statements or any change in any Applicable Laws or accounting principles, the Administrator, on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, either by the terms of the Award or by action taken prior to the occurrence of such transaction or event (except that action to give effect to a change in Applicable Law or accounting principles may be made within a reasonable period of time after such change) and either automatically or upon the Participant's request, is hereby authorized to take any one or more of the following actions whenever the Administrator determines that such action is appropriate in order to (x) prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended by the Company to be made available under the Plan or with respect to any Award granted or issued under the Plan, (y) to facilitate such transaction or event or (z) give effect to such changes in Applicable Laws or accounting principles:\n- (a) To provide for the cancellation of any such Award in exchange for either an amount of cash or other property with a value equal to the amount that could have been obtained upon the exercise or settlement of the vested portion of such Award or realization of the Participant's rights under the vested portion of such Award, as applicable; provided that, if the amount that could have been obtained upon the exercise or settlement of the vested portion of such Award or realization of the Participant's rights, in any case, is equal to or less than zero, then the Award may be terminated without payment;\n- (b) To provide that such Award shall vest and, to the extent applicable, be exercisable as to all shares covered thereby, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or the provisions of such Award;\n- (c) To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation or entity, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted for by awards covering the stock of the successor or survivor corporation or entity, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and/or applicable exercise or purchase price, in all cases, as determined by the Administrator;\n- (d) To make adjustments in the number and type of shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards and/or with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in Article IV hereof on the maximum number and kind of shares which may be issued) and/or in the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price), and the criteria included in, outstanding Awards;\n- (e) To replace such Award with other rights or property selected by the Administrator; and/or\n- (f) To provide that the Award will terminate and cannot vest, be exercised or become payable after the applicable event.",

In the event of any pending stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other extraordinary transaction or change affecting the Shares or the share price of Common Stock (including any Equity Restructuring or any securities offering or other similar transaction) or for reasons of administrative convenience or to facilitate compliance with any Applicable Laws, the Company may refuse to permit the exercise or settlement of one or more Awards for such period of time as the Company may determine to be reasonably appropriate under the circumstances.\n- 8.4 General.  Except as expressly provided in the Plan or the Administrator's action under the Plan, no Participant will have any rights due to any subdivision or consolidation of Shares of any class, dividend payment, increase or decrease in the number of Shares of any class or dissolution, liquidation, merger, or consolidation of the Company or other corporation. Except as expressly provided with respect to an Equity Restructuring under Section 8.1 above or the Administrator's action under the Plan, no issuance by the Company of Shares of any class, or securities convertible into Shares of any class, will affect, and no adjustment will be made regarding, the number of Shares subject to an Award or the Award's grant or exercise price. The existence of the Plan, any Award Agreements and the Awards granted hereunder will not affect or restrict in any way the Company's right or power to make or authorize (i) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's capital structure or its business, (ii) any merger, consolidation, spinoff, dissolution or liquidation of the Company or sale of Company assets or (iii) any sale or issuance of securities, including securities with rights superior to those of the Shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares. The Administrator may treat Participants and Awards (or portions thereof) differently under this Article VIII.\n\n## ARTICLE IX.\n\n## PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS\n\n- 9.1 Transferability.  Except as the Administrator may determine or provide in an Award Agreement or otherwise for Awards other than Incentive Stock Options, Awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or, subject to the Administrator's consent, pursuant to a domestic relations order, and, during the life of the Participant, will be exercisable only by the Participant. References to a Participant, to the extent relevant in the context, will include references to a transferee approved by the Administrator.\n- 9.2 Documentation.  Each Award will be evidenced in an Award Agreement, which may be written or electronic, as the Administrator determines. Each Award may contain such terms and conditions as are not inconsistent with those set forth in the Plan.\n- 9.3 Discretion.  Except as the Plan otherwise provides, each Award may be made alone or in addition or in relation to any other Award. The terms of each Award to a Participant need not be identical, and the Administrator need not treat Participants or Awards (or portions thereof) uniformly.\n- 9.4 Changes in Participant's Status.  The Company will determine how the disability, death, retirement, authorized leave of absence or any other change or purported change in a Participant's Service Provider status affects an Award and the extent to which, and the period during which, the Participant, the Participant's legal representative, conservator, guardian or Designated Beneficiary may exercise rights under the Award, if applicable. Except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law or expressly authorized by the Company or by the Company's written policy on leaves of absence, no service credit shall be given for vesting purposes for any period the Participant is on a leave of absence.\n- 9.5 Withholding.  Each Participant must pay the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the Administrator for payment of, any taxes required by law to be withheld in connection with such Participant's Awards by the date of the event creating the tax liability. The Company may deduct an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations based on the minimum statutory withholding rates (or such other rate as may be determined by the Company after considering any accounting consequences or costs) from any payment of any kind otherwise due to a Participant. Subject to any Company insider trading policy (including blackout periods) and the terms of the applicable Award Agreement, Participants may satisfy such tax obligations (i) in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, by check made payable to the order of the Company; provided that the Company may limit the use of one of the foregoing methods if one or more of the exercise methods below is permitted, (ii) to the extent permitted by the Administrator, in whole or in part by delivery of Shares, including Shares delivered by attestation and Shares retained from the Award creating",

If any tax withholding obligation will be satisfied under clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence by the Company's retention of Shares from the Award creating the tax obligation and there is a public market for Shares at the time the tax obligation is satisfied, the Company may elect to instruct any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on the applicable Participant's behalf some or all of the Shares retained and to remit the proceeds of the sale to the Company or its designee, and each Participant's acceptance of an Award under the Plan will constitute the Participant's authorization to the Company and instruction and authorization to such brokerage firm to complete the transactions described in this sentence.\n\n- 9.6 Amendment of Award; Prohibition on Repricing.  The Administrator may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award, including by substituting another Award of the same or a different type, changing the exercise or settlement date, converting an Incentive Stock Option to a Nonqualified Stock Option and providing for cash settlement of an outstanding award. The Participant's consent to such action will be required unless (i) the action, taking into account any related action, does not materially and adversely affect the economic benefits to be delivered under the Award as of the date of such amendment, modification or termination, or (ii) the change is permitted under Article VIII or pursuant to Sections 10.5 or 10.6. Other than pursuant to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, the Administrator shall not without the approval of the Company's stockholders (a) lower the exercise price per Share of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right after it is granted, (b) cancel an Option or Stock Appreciation Right when the exercise price per Share exceeds the Fair Market Value of one Share in exchange for cash or another Award, or (c) take any other action with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that the Company determines would be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of the principal U.S. national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed.\n- 9.7 Conditions on Delivery of Stock.  The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Shares under the Plan or remove restrictions from Shares previously delivered under the Plan until (i) all Award conditions have been met or removed to the Company's satisfaction, (ii) as determined by the Company, all other legal matters regarding the issuance and delivery of such Shares have been satisfied, including any applicable securities laws and stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, (iii) any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable have been obtained, and (iv) the Participant has executed and delivered to the Company such representations or agreements as the Company deems necessary or appropriate to satisfy any Applicable Laws. The inability or impracticability of the Company to obtain or maintain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained, and shall constitute circumstances in which the Administrator may determine to amend or cancel Awards pertaining to such Shares, with or without consideration to the Participant.\n- 9.8 Acceleration.  The Administrator may at any time provide that any Award will become immediately vested and fully or partially exercisable, free of some or all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise fully or partially realizable.\n- 9.9 Fractional Shares.  Unless otherwise determined by the Company, fractional shares of Stock may be issued under the Plan. To the extent the Company determines that fractional shares of Stock will not be issued, the Company shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares shall be eliminated by rounding down.",

        "page_content": "## ARTICLE X. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n- 10.1 No Right to Employment or Other Status.  No person will have any claim or right to be granted an Award, and the grant of an Award will not be construed as giving a Participant the right to continue employment or any other relationship with the Company or a Subsidiary. The Company and its Subsidiaries expressly reserve the right at any time to dismiss or otherwise terminate their relationship with a Participant free from any liability or claim under the Plan or any Award, except as expressly provided in an Award Agreement.\n- 10.2 No Rights as Stockholder; Certificates.  Subject to the Award Agreement, no Participant or Designated Beneficiary will have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares to be distributed under an Award until becoming the record holder of such Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless the Company otherwise determines or Applicable Laws require, the Company will not be required to deliver to any Participant certificates evidencing Shares issued in connection with any Award and instead such Shares may be recorded in the books of the Company (or, as applicable, its transfer agent or stock plan administrator). The Company may place legends on any share certificate or book entry to reference restrictions applicable to the Shares (including, without limitation, restrictions applicable to Restricted Stock).\n- 10.3 Restatement Effective Date and Term of Plan.  This amended and restated Plan will become effective on the date it is approved by the Company's stockholders (the ' Restatement Effective Date '). The Plan will expire on, and no Award may be granted pursuant to the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the date of the Board's adoption of this amended and restated Plan, but Awards previously granted may extend beyond that date and shall remain in force according to the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement. If the Plan is not approved by the Company's stockholders within twelve (12) months following the Board's adoption of this amended and restated Plan, this amended and restated Plan will not become effective and the Original Plan will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.\n- 10.4 Amendment of Plan.  The Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time and from time to time; provided that no amendment, other than an increase to the Overall Share Limit, may materially and adversely affect the economic benefits to be delivered under any outstanding award as of the date of such amendment without the affected Participant's consent. No Awards may be granted under the Plan during any suspension period or after Plan termination. Awards outstanding at the time of any Plan suspension or termination will continue to be governed by the Plan and the Award Agreement, as in effect before such suspension or termination. The Board will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Laws.\n- 10.5 Provisions for Foreign Participants.  The Administrator may modify Awards granted to Participants who are foreign nationals employed or residing outside the United States or establish subplans or procedures under the Plan to address differences in laws, rules, regulations or customs of such foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax, securities, currency, employee benefit or other matters.\n\n## 10.6 Section 409A .\n\n- (a) General .  The Company intends that all Awards be structured to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A, such that no adverse tax consequences, interest, or penalties under Section 409A apply. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator may, without a Participant's consent, amend the Plan or Awards, adopt policies and procedures, or take any other actions (including amendments, policies, procedures and retroactive actions) as are necessary or appropriate to preserve the intended tax treatment of Awards, including any such actions intended to (A) exempt the Plan or any Award from Section 409A, or (B) comply with Section 409A, including regulations, guidance, compliance programs and other interpretative authority that may be issued after an Award's grant date. The Company makes no representations or warranties as to an Award's tax treatment under Section 409A or otherwise. The Company will have no obligation under this Section 10.6 or otherwise to avoid the taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A with respect to any Award and will have no liability to any Participant or any other person if any Award, compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to constitute noncompliant 'nonqualified deferred compensation' subject to taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A.",

        "page_content": "- (b) Separation from Service .  If an Award constitutes 'nonqualified deferred compensation' under Section 409A, any payment or settlement of such Award upon a Participant's Termination of Service will, to the extent necessary to avoid taxes under Section 409A, be made only upon the Participant's 'separation from service' (within the meaning of Section 409A), whether such 'separation from service' occurs upon or after the Participant's Termination of Service. For purposes of the Plan or any Award Agreement relating to any such payments or benefits, references to a 'termination,' 'termination of employment' or like terms mean a 'separation from service.'\n- (c) Payments to Specified Employees .  Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Plan or any Award Agreement, any payment(s) of 'nonqualified deferred compensation' required to be made under an Award to a 'specified employee' (as defined under Section 409A and as the Company determines) due to his or her 'separation from service' will, to the extent necessary to avoid taxes under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, be delayed for the six-month period immediately following such 'separation from service' (or, if earlier, until the specified employee's death) and will instead be paid (as set forth in the Award Agreement) on the day immediately following such six-month period or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter (without interest). Any payments of 'nonqualified deferred compensation' under such Award payable more than six months following the Participant's 'separation from service' will be paid at the time or times the payments are otherwise scheduled to be made.\n- 10.7 Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Plan and any Award granted or awarded to any Participant who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including any amendment to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or any successor rule) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule.\n- 10.8 Limitations on Liability.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no individual acting as a director, officer or other employee of the Company or any Subsidiary will be liable to any Participant, former Participant, spouse, beneficiary, or any other person for any claim, loss, liability, or expense incurred in connection with the Plan or any Award, and such individual will not be personally liable with respect to the Plan because of any contract or other instrument executed in his or her capacity as an Administrator, director, officer or other employee of the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each director, officer or other employee of the Company or any Subsidiary that has been or will be granted or delegated any duty or power relating to the Plan's administration or interpretation, against any cost or expense (including attorneys' fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the Company's approval) arising from any act or omission concerning the Plan unless arising from such person's own fraud or bad faith; provided that he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf.\n- 10.9 Data Privacy.  As a condition for receiving any Award, each Participant explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of personal data as described in this Section by and among the Company and its Subsidiaries and affiliates exclusively for implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan. The Company and its Subsidiaries and affiliates may hold certain personal information about a Participant, including the Participant's name, address and telephone number; birthdate; social security, insurance number or other identification number; salary; nationality; job title(s); any Shares held in the Company or its Subsidiaries and affiliates; and Award details (the ' Data '), to implement, manage and administer the Plan and Awards. The Company and its Subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer the Data amongst themselves as necessary to implement, administer and manage a Participant's participation in the Plan, and the Company and its Subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer the Data to third parties assisting the Company with Plan implementation, administration and management. These recipients may be located in the Participant's country, or elsewhere, and the Participant's country may have different data privacy laws and protections than the recipients' country. By accepting an Award, each Participant authorizes such recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, to implement, administer and manage the Participant's participation in the Plan, including any required Data transfer to a broker or other third party with whom the Company or the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares. The Company may cancel Participant's ability to participate in the Plan and, in the Company's sole discretion, the Participant may forfeit any outstanding Awards if the Participant refuses or withdraws the consents in this Section 10.9.\n- 10.10 Severability.  If any portion of the Plan or any action taken under it is held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provisions had been excluded, and the illegal or invalid action will be null and void.",

If any contradiction occurs between the Plan and any Award Agreement or other written agreement between a Participant and the Company (or any Subsidiary), the Plan will govern, unless such Award Agreement or other written agreement was approved by the Administrator and expressly provides that a specific provision of the Plan will not apply.\n- 10.12 Governing Law.  The Plan and all Awards will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, disregarding the choice-of-law principles of the State of Delaware and any other state requiring the application of a jurisdiction's laws other than the State of Delaware.\n- 10.13 Clawback Provisions.  All Awards (including the gross amount of any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit the Participant actually or constructively receives upon receipt or exercise of any Award or the receipt or resale of any Shares underlying the Award) will be subject to recoupment by the Company to the extent required to comply with Applicable Laws or any policy of the Company providing for the reimbursement of incentive compensation.\n- 10.14 Titles and Headings.  The titles and headings in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, if any conflict, the Plan's text, rather than such titles or headings, will control.\n- 10.15 Conformity to Applicable Laws.  Participant acknowledges that the Plan is intended to conform to the extent necessary with Applicable Laws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Plan and all Awards will be administered only in a manner intended to conform with Applicable Laws.

No payment under the Plan will be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary, except as expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.\n- 10.17 Broker-Assisted Sales.  In the event of a broker-assisted sale of Shares in connection with the payment of amounts owed by a Participant under or with respect to the Plan or Awards, including amounts to be paid under the final sentence of Section 9.5: (a) any Shares to be sold through the broker-assisted sale will be sold on the day the payment first becomes due, or as soon thereafter as practicable; (b) such Shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan in which all participants receive an average price; (c) the applicable Participant will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and by accepting an Award, each Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale; (d) to the extent the Company or its designee receives proceeds of such sale that exceed the amount owed, the Company will pay such excess in cash to the applicable Participant as soon as reasonably practicable; (e) the Company and its designees are under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price; and (f) in the event the proceeds of such sale are insufficient to satisfy the Participant's applicable obligation, the Participant may be required to pay immediately upon demand to the Company or its designee an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy any remaining portion of the Participant's obligation.\n- 10.18 Individual Award Limitations.  Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, and subject to adjustment as provided in Article VIII, (i) the maximum aggregate number of Shares with respect to all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that may be granted to any one person during any calendar year shall be 500,000; (ii) the maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be earned with respect to all Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Other Stock or Cash Based Awards that are intended to qualify as PerformanceBased Compensation and are denominated in Shares that may be granted to any one person during any calendar year shall be 500,000; and (iii) the maximum aggregate amount that may become payable (in cash, Shares or any combination thereof) pursuant to all Performance Bonus Awards that may be granted to any one person during any calendar year shall be U.S. $10,000,000; provided, however, that in no event will more than the Overall Share Limit be granted to any one person during any calendar year of the Company with respect to one or more Award denominated in Shares. For purposes of this Section 10.18, each Share subject to an Award (including a Full Value Award) shall be counted as one Share against the specified limit. Each of the limitations in this Section, other than the Overall Share Limit, shall be multiplied by two (2) with respect to Awards granted to a Participant during the calendar year in which the Participant commences employment with the Company and/or its Subsidiaries.",
