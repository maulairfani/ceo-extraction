        "page_content": "## EXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Apartment Investment and Management Company ('Aimco' or 'the Company') completed the separation of its business into two, separate and distinct, publicly traded companies, Aimco and Apartment Income REIT Corp. ('AIR'). The separation was effected by way of a pro rata distribution, in which stockholders of Aimco received one share of Class A common stock of AIR for every one share of Class A common stock of Aimco held as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. Apartment Income REIT, L.P. ('AIR Operating Partnership'), formerly known as 'Aimco Properties, L.P.' until July 7, 2021, also completed a pro rata distribution of all of the outstanding common limited partnership units of Aimco OP L.P. ('Aimco Operating Partnership' and such units, 'Aimco OP Units') to holders of AIR Operating Partnership common limited partnership units and AIR Operating Partnership Class I High Performance partnership units as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. The transactions described in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the 'Separation' and are governed by the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement').\n\nNotwithstanding  the  legal  form  of  the  Separation,  for  accounting  and  financial  reporting  purposes,  Aimco  is  presented  as  being  spun-off  from  AIR.  This presentation is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and is due primarily to the relative significance of Aimco's business, as measured in terms of revenue, net income, assets, and other relevant indicators, as compared to those indicators for AIR before the Separation. Therefore, Aimco is considered 'spun' for accounting purposes and AIR is considered the divesting entity and treated as the accounting spinner, or accounting predecessor. A separate capital structure did not exist since the assets, liabilities  and operations of Aimco prior to the Separation (Aimco and AIR together, as they existed prior to the Separation, 'Aimco Predecessor') were spread across multiple legal entities. Events noted in this filing as occurring before December 15, 2020, were those entered into by Aimco Predecessor. The historical financial statements of Aimco do not represent the financial position and results of operations of one legal entity, but rather a combination of entities under common control that have been 'carved out' from Aimco Predecessor's financial statements.\n\nThis filing combines the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, of Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership. Where it is important to distinguish between the two entities, we refer to them specifically. Otherwise, references to 'we,' 'us,' or 'our' mean collectively Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated entities.\n\nAimco, a Maryland corporation, is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ('REIT'). Aimco, through a wholly owned subsidiary, is the general partner and directly is the special limited partner of Aimco Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2021, Aimco owned 93.1% of the legal interest in the  common partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership and 95.0% of the economic interest in Aimco Operating Partnership. The remaining 6.9% legal interest in Aimco Operating Partnership is owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, Aimco has exclusive control of Aimco Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nAimco Operating Partnership holds all of Aimco's assets and manages the daily operations of Aimco's business. Pursuant to the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement, Aimco is required to contribute to Aimco Operating Partnership all proceeds from the offerings of its securities. In exchange for the contribution of such proceeds, Aimco receives additional interests in Aimco Operating Partnership with similar terms (e.g., if Aimco contributes proceeds of a stock offering, Aimco receives partnership units with terms substantially similar to the stock issued by Aimco).\n\nWe believe combining the periodic reports of Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 We present our business as a whole, in the same manner our management views and operates the business;\n- \u00b7 We eliminate duplicative disclosure and provide a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosures apply to both Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership; and\n- \u00b7 We save time and cost through the preparation of a single combined report rather than two separate reports.\n\nWe operate Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership as one enterprise, the management of Aimco directs the management and operations of Aimco Operating Partnership, and Aimco OP GP, LLC, Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner, is member managed by Aimco.\n\nWe believe  it  is  important  to  understand  the  few  differences  between  Aimco  and  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  in  the  context  of  how  Aimco  and  Aimco Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. Aimco has no assets or liabilities other than its investment in Aimco Operating Partnership. Also, Aimco is a corporation that issues publicly traded equity from time to time, whereas Aimco Operating Partnership is a partnership that has no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from stock offerings by Aimco, which are contributed to Aimco Operating Partnership in exchange for additional limited partnership interests (of a similar type and in an amount equal to the shares of stock sold in the offering), Aimco Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by its business. These sources include Aimco Operating Partnership's working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its revolving credit facility, the issuance of debt and equity securities, including additional partnership units, and proceeds received from the sale of real estate.",

        "page_content": "Equity, partners' capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of Aimco and those of Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in  Aimco Operating Partnership held by entities other than Aimco, which we refer to as Aimco OP Units, are classified within  partners'  capital  in  Aimco Operating  Partnership's  consolidated  financial  statements  and  as  noncontrolling  interests  in  Aimco's  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nTo help investors understand the differences between Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership, this report provides separate consolidated financial statements for  Aimco  and  Aimco  Operating  Partnership;  a  single  set  of  consolidated  notes  to  such  financial  statements  that  includes  separate  discussions  of  each  entity's stockholders' equity or partners'  capital,  and  earnings  per  share  or  earnings  per  unit,  as  applicable;  and  a  combined  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes discrete information related to each entity.\n\nThis report also  includes  separate  Part  II,  Item  9A.  Controls  and  Procedures  sections  and  separate  Exhibits  31  and  32  certifications  for  Aimco  and  Aimco Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that Aimco and Aimco Operating Partnership are both compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a71350.",

Certain information included in this Annual Report contains or may contain information that is forward-looking, within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding: the ongoing relationship between Aimco and AIR (the 'Separate Entities') following the Separation; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including interruptions in real estate development and redevelopment activities due to supply chain disruptions and on our ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental rate and property operating results; the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, developments, and redevelopments; our ability to meet budgeted costs and timelines, and achieve budgeted rental rates related to our development and redevelopment investments; expectations regarding sales of our apartment  communities  and  the  use  of  proceeds  thereof;  the  availability  and  cost  of  corporate  debt;  and  our  ability  to  comply  with  debt  covenants,  including financial coverage ratios.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on management's judgment as of this date, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to: the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on Aimco's business and on the global and U.S. economies and financial markets generally, and the ongoing, dynamic and uncertain nature and duration of the pandemic, all of which heightens the impact of the other risks and factors described herein, and the impact on entities in which Aimco holds a partial interest, including its indirect interest in the partnership that owns Parkmerced Apartments, and the impact of governmental measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on Aimco's residents, commercial tenants, and operations; real estate and operating risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in the markets in which we operate and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions, including the pace of job growth and the level of  unemployment;  the  amount,  location  and  quality  of  competitive  new  housing  supply;  the  timing  and  effects  of  acquisitions,  dispositions,  developments  and redevelopments;  expectations  regarding  sales  of  apartment  communities  and  the  use  of  proceeds  thereof;  insurance  risks,  including  the  cost  of  insurance,  and natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes; supply chain disruptions, particularly with respect to raw materials such as lumber, steel, and concrete; financing risks, including the availability and cost of financing; the risk that cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; the risk that earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants, including financial coverage ratios; legal and regulatory risks, including costs  associated  with  prosecuting  or  defending  claims  and  any  adverse  outcomes;  the  terms  of  laws  and  governmental  regulations  that  affect  us  and interpretations  of  those  laws  and  regulations;  possible  environmental  liabilities,  including  costs,  fines  or  penalties  that  may  be  incurred  due  to  necessary remediation of contamination of apartment communities presently owned by Aimco; the relationship between the Separate Entities after the Separation; the ability and willingness of the Separate Entities and their subsidiaries to meet and/or perform their obligations under any contractual arrangements that were entered into among the parties in connection with the Separation and any of their obligations to indemnify, defend and hold the other party harmless from and against various claims,  litigation  and  liabilities;  and  the  ability  to  achieve  some  or  all  the  benefits  that  we  expect  to  achieve  from  the  Separation;  and  such  other  risks  and uncertainties described from time to time in filings by the Separate Entities with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC').\n\nIn addition, our current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  'Code')  and  depends  on  our  ability  to  meet  the  various  requirements  imposed  by  the  Code,  through  actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.\n\nReaders should carefully review our financial statements and the notes thereto, as well as the section entitled 'Risk Factors' described in Item 1A of this Annual Report and subsequent documents we file from time to time with the SEC.\n\nAs used herein and except as the context otherwise requires, 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' refer to Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership and their consolidated entities, collectively.\n\nCertain financial and operating measures found herein and used by management are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP').

        "page_content": "## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## The Company\n\nAimco,  a  Maryland  corporation  incorporated  on  January  10,  1994,  is  a  self-administered  and  self-managed  real  estate  investment  trust  ('REIT').  Aimco, through  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  is  the  general  partner  and  directly  is  the  special  limited  partner  of  the  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  a  Delaware  Limited Partnership. Aimco conducts all of its business and owns all of its assets through the Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nOn  December  15,  2020,  Aimco  completed  the  Separation,  creating  two  separate  and  distinct,  publicly  traded  companies,  Aimco  and  AIR.  Additional information regarding the Separation is contained in the Explanatory Note.\n\nPlease refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion regarding our business segments.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nOur mission is to make real estate investments, primarily focused on the multifamily sector within the continental United States, where outcomes are enhanced through our human capital so that substantial value is created for investors, teammates, and the communities in which we operate.\n\nOur value proposition includes our national platform organized around four regional and two satellite offices, consisting of a cohesive, talented, and tenured team and our proven investment process;  a  diversified  portfolio,  consisting  of  high-performing  in-process  value-add  investments,  a  deep  and  growing  pipeline, alternative investments, and stabilized assets; and our capital redeployment plan of reallocating Aimco equity to higher returning investments and prudent recycling of capital. Our primary goal is outsized risk adjusted returns and accelerating growth for Aimco shareholders.\n\n- \u00b7 Platform: We have a talented leadership team with an average Aimco tenure of 10 years and nearly 20 years of diverse real estate industry experience combined with a disciplined and proven investment process.\n- \u00b7 Portfolio: We benefit from a deep and growing investment pipeline with $1 billion of development and redevelopment projects currently underway, over $2 billion  of  future  opportunities  under  Aimco-control  and  more  being  explored.  We  add  to  this  alternative  investment  strategies  and  a  diversified portfolio of stabilized real estate to provide risk management and produce predictable cash flow.\n- \u00b7 Growth Plan: We have more than $500 million of equity targeted for redeployment into high returning activities over the next 4-5 years offering investors a high performing, high return vehicle with expected annualized returns on equity from 12-16% once optimal capital allocation is achieved.\n\nWe are focused on providing superior total-return  performance  to  shareholders,  primarily  through  capital  appreciation  driven  by  accretive  investment  and active  portfolio  management  over  multi-year  periods.  We  plan  to  reinvest  earnings  to  facilitate  growth  and,  therefore,  do  not  presently  intend  to  pay  a  regular quarterly cash dividend.\n\nOur financial objectives are to create value and produce superior, project-level, risk-adjusted returns on equity as measured by the investment period Internal Rate of Return ('IRR') and the project-level Multiple on Invested Capital ('MOIC'). We measure broader performance based on Net Asset value ('NAV') growth over time.\n\nOur capital allocation strategy has been designed to leverage our investment platform and optimize risk adjusted returns for our shareholders.\n\nOverall, we target a growth-oriented capital allocation,  primarily  weighted toward direct  investment  in 'Value Add' and 'Opportunistic'  multifamily  real estate.\n\nFrom time to time, we will allocate a defined portion of our capital into alternative investments including passive debt and equity investments (both direct and indirect). Aimco may also utilize its established platform and existing relationships to generate fees through service offerings.\n\nWe have policies in place that support our strategy, guide our investment allocations, and manage risk, including to hold at all times a sizeable portion of its net equity in a diversified portfolio of 'Core' and 'Core-Plus' assets and before starting a project, require cash or committed credit necessary for completion.\n\n## PART I",

        "page_content": "Given our stated strategy, it is expected that at any point in time the value-creation process will be ongoing at numerous of our investments. Over time, we expect the Aimco enterprise to produce superior returns on equity on a risk-adjusted basis and it is our plan to do so by:\n\n- \u00b7 Benefiting from a national platform while leveraging local and regional expertise\n\nWe have corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado and Bethesda, Maryland. Our investment platform is managed by experienced professionals based in four regions: West Coast, Central and Mountain West, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and Southeast. By regionalizing this platform, we are able to leverage  the  in-depth  local  market  knowledge  of  each  regional  leader,  creating  a  comparative  advantage  when  sourcing,  evaluating,  and  executing investment opportunities.\n\n- \u00b7 Managing and investing in value-add and opportunistic real estate\n\nOur dedicated team will source and execute development and redevelopment projects, and various other direct investment strategies, across our national platform. The Aimco Development and Redevelopment portfolio currently includes $1 billion of projects in construction and lease-up, located across five major U.S. markets. In addition, we currently have $2 billion worth of pipeline opportunities under our control and have the opportunity to add to our investment  pipeline  based  on  strategic  relationships  and  through  sourcing  by  regional  investment  teams.  Generally,  we  seek  direct  investment opportunities in locations where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined and where we have a comparative advantage over others in the market.\n\n- \u00b7 Managing and investing in other alternative investments\n\nOur  current  allocation  to  alternative  investments  includes:  our  indirect  interest  mezzanine  loan  to  the  Parkmerced  partnership  which  owns  3,165 apartment homes and future development rights in San Francisco, California, and our passive equity investments in IQHQ, Inc. ('IQHQ'), a privately held life sciences real estate development company, and in property technology funds consisting of privately held entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry.\n\nWe expect to allocate a portion of our capital to passive debt and equity investments, both directly and at the entity level. These prove attractive when warranted by risk adjusted returns, when we have special knowledge or expertise relevant to the particular investment or when the opportunity exists for positive asymmetric outcomes whether through strategic partnerships or otherwise. In addition, from time to time, we will use our established platform and existing relationships to generate fees through service offerings to third party real estate investors, owners, and capital allocators.\n\n- \u00b7 Owning a portfolio of stabilized core and core plus real estate\n\nOur entire portfolio of operating properties includes 29 apartment communities (25 consolidated properties and four unconsolidated properties) located in ten major U.S. markets and with average rents in line with local market averages (generally defined as B class). We also own one commercial office building that is part of an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building. The target composition of our stabilized portfolio will continue to include primarily B multifamily assets, spread across a nationally diversified portfolio and with a bias toward long established residential neighborhoods that rank  highly  in  regard  to  schools,  employment  fundamentals  and  state  and  regional  governance.  Core  Plus  opportunities  offer  the  opportunity  for incremental capital investment while maintaining stabilized cashflow to accelerate income growth and improve asset values.\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining sufficient liquidity and utilizing safe financial leverage\n\nAt all times, we will guard our liquidity by maintaining sufficient cash and committed credit.\n\nFrom time-to-time, we will allocate capital to financial assets designed to mitigate risks elsewhere in the Aimco enterprise. Existing examples include our option  to  acquire  an  interest  rate  swap  designed  to  protect  against  repricing  risk  on  maturing  Aimco  liabilities  and  the  use  of  rate  caps  to  provide protection against increases in interest rates on in-place loans.\n\nWe expect to capitalize our activities through a combination of non-recourse property debt, construction loans, third-party equity, and the recycling of Aimco equity, including retained earnings. We plan to limit the use of recourse leverage, with a strong preference towards non-recourse property-level debt in order to limit risk to the Aimco enterprise. When warranted, we plan to seek equity capital from joint venture partners to improve our cost of capital, further leverage Aimco equity, reduce exposure to a single investment and, in certain cases, for strategic benefits.\n\n## Competition\n\nThere are many developers, managers, and owners of apartment real estate and underdeveloped land, as well as REITs, private real estate companies, and investors, that compete with us in acquiring, developing, obtaining financing for, and disposing of apartment communities. This competition affects our ability to realize our real estate development and transactional objectives.",

        "page_content": "In addition, our apartment communities compete for residents with other housing alternatives, including other rental apartments and condominiums, and singlefamily homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing, as well as household formation and job creation in a particular area, could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates.\n\n## Taxation\n\n## Aimco\n\nAimco has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), commencing with our initial taxable year, and intends to continue to operate in such a manner. The Code imposes various requirements related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income that must be met in order to continue to qualify as a REIT. If Aimco continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, Aimco will generally not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is currently distributed  to  stockholders.  This  treatment  substantially  eliminates  the  'double  taxation'  (at  the  corporate  and  stockholder  levels)  that  generally  results  from  an investment in a corporation.\n\nCertain of our operations, or a portion thereof, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a 'TRS'. A TRS is a corporate subsidiary that has elected to be a TRS instead of a REIT and, as such, is subject to United States federal corporate income tax.\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nAimco Operating Partnership is treated as a 'pass-through' entity for United States federal income tax purposes and is not subject to United States federal income taxation. Partners in Aimco Operating Partnership, however, are subject to tax on their allocable share of partnership income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits,  regardless  of  whether  the  partners  receive  any  actual  distributions  of  cash  or  other  property  from  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  during  the  taxable  year. Generally, the characterization of any particular item is determined by Aimco Operating Partnership rather than at the partner level, and the amount of a partner's allocable share of such item is governed by the terms of Aimco Operating Partnership's Partnership Agreement. Aimco Operating Partnership is subject to tax in certain states.\n\n## Regulation\n\n## General\n\nApartment development is subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including those concerning entitlement, building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales, and similar matters apply to or affect the real estate development industry.\n\nApartment communities and their owners are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including those related to real estate broker licensing and regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, activity centers, and other common areas.\n\nChanges in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on communities or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, as well as changes in laws affecting development, construction, and safety requirements, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows from operating activities.\n\nIn addition, existing rent control laws, as well as future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws, or other laws and ordinances regulating multifamily housing, such as eviction moratoriums and the impact of governmental measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, may reduce rental revenue or increase operating costs in particular markets.\n\n## Environmental\n\nVarious federal, state, and local laws subject real estate owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present. These materials may include lead-based paint, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, and petroleum-based fuels. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such materials. In connection with the ownership of real estate, we could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our real estate, whether currently owned, acquired in the future, or owned in the past. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors.",

As with all other aspects of our business, our corporate responsibility program focuses on continuous improvement, to the benefit of our stockholders, our residents, our team members and our communities.\n\n## Human Capital and Culture\n\nOur team is our most important asset, and our culture is key to our success. Our intentional focus on collaborative and productive culture based on respect for others and personal responsibility is reinforced by a preference for promotion from within. We focus on succession planning and talent development to produce a strong, stable team that is the enduring foundation of our success. We offer benefits reinforcing our value of caring for each other, including 16 weeks of paid time for parental leave to new mothers and fathers, a longstanding policy of workplace flexibility for our teammates to attend to personal and family matters during the workweek, office environments focused on natural light and ergonomic office furniture including adjustable height desks, paid time annually to volunteer in local communities, and a bonus structure at all levels of the organization.\n\nWe are responsible for and implement succession planning in all leadership positions, both in the short term and the long term.\n\nWe evaluate team engagement and retention and include those in our goals on which all teammates are compensated. Every team member is surveyed via a third-party, confidential survey on his or her annual anniversary of employment. The teammate engagement score consists of the average of the responses to the questions that comprise the engagement index, on a scale of 1 to 5, for all teammates who complete the survey during the year. Aimco's overall team engagement score for the 2021 Annual Lifecycle Surveys was 4.21, compared to the target of 4.20.\n\nAs of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  62  full-time  team  members,  approximately  60%  performing  development  or  transactional  services  with  the  balance managing  corporate  and  area  functions,  including  debt  and  capital  market  transactions,  legal,  finance,  accounting,  and  other  support  functions.  None  of  our employees are represented by labor unions.\n\nOur focus on our team and culture is recognized externally, as well. Out of hundreds of participating companies in 2021, we were one of only six recognized as a 'Top Workplace' in Colorado for each of the past nine years. We were also recognized as a 'Top Workplace' in Washington, D.C., where one of our headquarters is located in nearby Bethesda, Maryland. Additionally, in 2021, the Company was recognized as one of the Denver Area's Healthiest Employers in 2020.\n\n## Available Information\n\nOur combined Annual Report on Form 10-K, our combined Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by Aimco or Aimco Operating Partnership,  and  any  amendments  to  any  of  those  reports  that  we  file  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  are  available  free  of  charge  as  soon  as reasonably practicable through our website at www.aimco.com. The information contained on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report.\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nThe risk factors noted in this section, and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report, describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS\n\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could affect our ability to collect rents and late fees from tenants, and our ability to evict tenants, in addition to having other negative effects on our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAdverse economic and geopolitical conditions, local, regional, national, or international health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could negatively impact our tenants and our operations. For example, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The ongoing COVID19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. Both the global impact of the outbreak and the governmental measures taken in response to it continue to evolve.\n\nFactors that have negatively impacted, or would negatively impact, our operations or those of entities in which we hold a partial interest during the COVID-19 pandemic or another health crisis, adverse economic or geopolitical event or dislocation in the credit market include:\n\n- \u00b7 our ability to collect rents and late fees on a timely basis or at all, without reductions or other concessions;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 our ability to evict residents for non-payment and for other reasons;\n- \u00b7 our ability to ensure business continuity in the event our continuity of operations plan is not effective or improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption;\n- \u00b7 fluctuations in regional and local economies, local real estate conditions, and rental rates;\n- \u00b7 interruptions in real estate development and redevelopment activities due to supply chain disruptions;\n- \u00b7 our ability to control incremental costs associated with COVID-19, including increased costs resulting from higher inflation;\n- \u00b7 our ability to dispose of communities at all or on terms favorable to us;\n- \u00b7 our ability to complete developments and redevelopments and other construction projects as planned; and\n- \u00b7 potential litigation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains challenging to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, our residents and commercial tenants, our communities, and the operations of entities in which we hold an interest (including our economic interest in the partnership owning the 'Parkmerced Apartments'), or for how long disruptions are likely to continue. The extent of such impact will depend on developments, which are highly uncertain, rapidly evolving and cannot be predicted, including the ability to contain the virus, the emergence of  new  COVID-19  variants,  the  efficacy  and  availability  of  vaccines,  the  duration  of  measures  implemented,  and  the  overall  impact  of  these  measures.  Such developments, depending on their nature, duration, and intensity, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The COVID19 pandemic also may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\n\n## We do not have control over the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments, the operation of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur indirect interest in the partnership owning the Parkmerced Apartments is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, exposure to the skill and capital  of  the  controlling  party  and  those  resulting  from  fluctuations  in  San  Francisco  occupancy  rates,  the  operating  disruption  due  to  the  ongoing  COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental response, and the current economic situation which may result in all, or a portion of the loan not being repaid. Such risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Development, redevelopment, and construction risks could affect our profitability.\n\nDevelopment and redevelopment are subject to numerous risks, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third-party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities;\n- \u00b7 we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material, labor, or other factors and costs, such as those resulting from litigation, program changes, inflation, interest rate increases or supply chain disruptions;\n- \u00b7 we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of an apartment community on schedule, including as a result of global supply chain disruptions, resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues;\n- \u00b7 occupancy  rates  and  rents  at  an  apartment  community  may  fail  to  meet  our  expectations  for  a  number  of  reasons,  including  changes  in  market  and economic conditions beyond our control and the development of competing communities;\n- \u00b7 we  may  be  unable  to  obtain  financing,  including  construction  loans,  with  favorable  terms,  or  at  all,  which  may  cause  us  to  delay  or  abandon  an opportunity;\n- \u00b7 we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore, or stop projects we have already commenced, for a number of reasons, including changes  in  local  market  conditions  or  increases  in  construction  or  financing  costs,  and,  as  a  result,  we  may  fail  to  recover  costs  already  incurred  in exploring those opportunities;\n- \u00b7 we are required to pay rent to AIR on the Initial Leased Properties as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement with AIR (and any additional properties we may lease from them in accordance with the Master Leasing Agreement), regardless of whether our developments or redevelopments are successful;",

If market volatility causes economic conditions to remain unpredictable or to trend downwards, we may not achieve our expected returns on properties under development and we could lose some or all of our investments in those properties. In addition, the lead time required to develop, construct, and lease-up a development property may increase, which could adversely impact our projected returns or result in a termination of the development project.\n\nIn addition, we may serve as either the construction manager or the general contractor for our development projects. The construction of real estate projects entails unique risks, including risks that the project will fail to conform to building plans, specifications, and timetables. These failures could be caused by labor strikes, weather, government regulations, and other conditions beyond our control. In addition, we may become liable for injuries and accidents occurring during the construction process that are underinsured.\n\n## Failure to generate sufficient net operating income may adversely affect our liquidity, limit our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures, or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions.\n\nOur ability to fund necessary capital expenditures on our communities and make payments to our investors depends on, among other things, our ability to generate net operating income in excess of required debt payments and our ability to collect on interest and principal payments due to us. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures on our communities, we may not be able to preserve the competitiveness of our communities, which could adversely affect their net operating income and long-term value.\n\nOur net operating income and liquidity may be adversely affected by events or conditions beyond our control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the general economic climate;\n- \u00b7 an inflationary environment in which the costs to operate and maintain our communities increase at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents, which we can only do upon renewal of existing leases or at the inception of new leases;\n- \u00b7 competition from other apartment communities and other housing options;\n- \u00b7 local conditions, such as loss of jobs, unemployment rates, or an increase in the supply of apartments, that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates;\n- \u00b7 changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance;\n- \u00b7 changes in tax laws and housing laws, including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing; and\n- \u00b7 changes in interest rates and the availability of financing.\n\n## Our ability to continue to grow or maintain our pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities may be constrained.\n\nWe source development and redevelopment opportunities through various means, including from our operating portfolio, property acquisitions, and AIR. We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of properties compatible with our investment strategy. We may be unable to locate properties that will produce returns with a sufficient spread to our cost of capital.  The inability to source opportunities could impede our growth and could have a material adverse effect on us.",

        "page_content": "Our properties  are geographically  concentrated  in  California,  Chicago,  Florida,  and  in  the  Northeast  region  of  the  United  States,  which  makes  us  more susceptible to regional and local adverse economic and other conditions than if we owned a more geographically diversified portfolio.\n\nThe majority of our properties are located in California, Chicago, Florida, and in the Northeast region of the United States. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse economic or other conditions in these markets (such as periods of economic slowdown or recession, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases in real estate and other taxes, and the cost of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation), as well as to natural disasters (including earthquakes, storms, and hurricanes), potentially adverse effects of 'global warming,' and other disruptions that occur in these markets (such as terrorist activity or threats of terrorist activity and other events), any of which may have a greater impact on the value of our assets or on our operating results than if we owned a more geographically diversified portfolio.\n\nWe cannot assure  you  that  these  markets  will  grow  or  that  underlying  real  estate  fundamentals  will  be  favorable  to  owners,  operators,  and  developers  of multifamily, retail, or office assets, or future development assets. Our operations may also be affected if competing assets are built in these markets. Moreover, submarkets within our core markets may be dependent upon a limited number of industries. Any adverse economic or other conditions, or any decrease in demand for office, multifamily, or retail assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Our development projects may subject us to certain liabilities, and we are subject to risks associated with developing properties in partnership with others.\n\nWe may hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction, engineering, and various other services for development projects. Certain of these contracts may be structured such that we are the principal rather than the agent. As a result, we may assume liabilities in the course of the project and be subjected to, or become liable for, claims for construction defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions by third parties we have engaged.\n\nAdverse outcomes of disputes or litigation  could  negatively  impact  our  business,  results  of  operations,  and  financial  condition,  particularly  if  we  have  not limited the extent of the damages for which we may be liable, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance that we carry. Moreover, our tenants may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a legal matter, in which case we may determine it necessary to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the tenant or customer relationship or to protect our corporate brand. To the extent our tenants are obligated to reimburse us, acting as a principal may also mean that we pay a contractor before we have been reimbursed by our tenants. This exposes us to additional risks of collection in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, or a condominium purchaser default. The reverse can occur as well, where a contractor we have paid files for bankruptcy protection or commits fraud with the funds before completing a project that we have funded in part or in full.\n\nAdditionally, we use partnerships and limited liability companies to develop some of our real estate investments. Acting through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we typically will be the general partner or managing member in these partnerships or limited liability companies. There are, however, instances in which we may not control or even participate in management or day-to-day operations of these properties. The use of partnerships and limited liability companies involve special risks associated with the possibility that:\n\n- \u00b7 a partner or member may have interests or goals inconsistent with ours;\n- \u00b7 a  general  partner  or  managing  member  may  take  actions  contrary  to  our  instructions,  requests,  policies,  or  objectives  with  respect  to  our  real  estate investments;\n- \u00b7 a partner or member could experience financial difficulties that prevent it from fulfilling its financial or other responsibilities to the project; or\n- \u00b7 a partner may not fulfill its contractual obligations.\n\nIn the event any of our partners or members file for bankruptcy, we could be precluded from taking certain actions affecting our project without bankruptcy court approval, which could diminish our control over the project even if we were the general partner or managing member. In addition, if the bankruptcy court were to discharge the obligations of our partner or member, it could result in our ultimate liability for the project being greater than originally anticipated.\n\nFurther, disputes between us and a partner may result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent our management from focusing their time and attention on our business.\n\nTo the extent we are a general partner, we may be exposed to unlimited liability, which may exceed our investment or equity in the partnership. If one of our subsidiaries is a general partner of a particular partnership, it may be exposed to the same kind of unlimited liability.",

        "page_content": "## Development of properties may entail a lengthy, uncertain, and costly entitlement process.\n\nApproval  to  develop  real  property  sometimes  requires  political  support  and  generally  entails  an  extensive  entitlement  process  involving  multiple  and overlapping  regulatory  jurisdictions  and  often  requires  discretionary  action  by  local  governments.  Real  estate  projects  must  generally  comply  with  local  land development  regulations  and  may  need  to  comply  with  state  and  federal  regulations.  We  may  incur  substantial  costs  to  comply  with  legal  and  regulatory requirements. An increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs, or in some cases cause us to determine that the property  is  not  feasible  for  development.  In  addition,  our  competitors  and  local  residents  may  challenge  our  efforts  to  obtain  entitlements  and  permits  for  the development of properties. The process to comply with these regulations is usually lengthy and costly, may not result in the approvals we seek, and can be expected to materially affect our development activities.\n\n## Government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of the development of our communities, increase our expenses or limit our building of apartments or other activities.\n\nVarious  local,  state,  and  federal  statutes,  ordinances,  rules,  and  regulations  concerning  building,  health  and  safety,  site  and  building  design,  environment, zoning, sales, and similar matters apply to or affect the real estate development industry. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state, and local policies, rules and regulations, and their interpretations and application.\n\nMunicipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. If municipalities in which we operate take such actions, it could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs, or limiting our ability to operate in those municipalities. These measures may reduce our ability to develop apartment communities and to build and sell other real estate development projects in the affected markets, including with respect  to  land  we  may  already  own,  and  create  additional  costs  and  administration  requirements,  which  in  turn  may  harm  our  future  sales,  margins,  and earnings.\n\nIn addition, there is a variety of legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state, and local level relating to energy and climate change. This  legislation  relates  to  items  such  as  carbon  dioxide  emissions  control  and  building  codes  that  impose  energy  efficiency  standards.  New  building  code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct buildings. Such environmental laws may affect, for example, how we manage storm water runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. In addition, it is possible that some form of expanded energy efficiency legislation may be passed by the U.S. Congress or federal agencies and certain state legislatures, which may, despite being phased in over time, significantly increase our costs of building apartment communities and the sale price to our buyers and adversely affect our sales volumes. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law.\n\nEnergy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy-related taxes and regulations. Our noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations, other sanctions and reputational harm.\n\nGovernmental  regulation  affects  not  only  construction  activities  but  also  sales  activities,  mortgage  lending  activities,  and  other  dealings  with  consumers. Further, government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews, or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.\n\n## Competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes, increase or maintain rents or execute our development strategy.\n\nOur apartment communities compete for residents with other housing alternatives, including other rental apartments and condominiums, and, to a lesser degree, single-family homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing, as well as the lack of household formation and job creation in a particular area, could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates.\n\nIn addition, there are many developers, managers, and owners of apartment real estate and underdeveloped land, as well as REITs, private real estate companies, and investors, that compete with us, some of whom have greater financial resources and market share than us. If our competitors prevent us from realizing our real estate development objectives, our performance may fall short of our expectations and adversely affect our business.",

        "page_content": "## Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to sell apartment communities or other assets when appropriate.\n\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. REIT tax rules also restrict our ability to sell apartment communities. Thus, we  may  not  be  able  to  change  our  portfolio  promptly  in  response  to  changes  in  economic  or  other  market  conditions.  Our  ability  to  dispose  of  apartment communities in the future will depend on prevailing economic and market conditions, including the cost and availability of financing. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Potential liability or other expenditures associated with potential environmental contamination may be costly.\n\nVarious federal, state, and local laws subject real estate owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present in the land or buildings. Potentially hazardous materials may include polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleum-based fuels, lead-based paint, or asbestos, among other materials. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such materials. The presence of, or the failure to manage or remediate properly, these materials may adversely affect occupancy at such real estate as well as the ability to sell or finance such real estate. In addition, governmental agencies may bring claims for costs associated with investigation and  remediation  actions,  damages  to  natural  resources,  and  for  potential  fines  or  penalties  in  connection  with  such  damage  or  with  respect  to  the  improper management of hazardous materials. Moreover, private plaintiffs may potentially make claims for investigation and remediation costs they incur, or personal injury, disease, disability, or other infirmities  related to the alleged presence of hazardous materials at an apartment community. In addition to potential environmental liabilities or costs associated with our current real estate, we may also be responsible for such liabilities or costs associated with communities we acquire or manage in the future, or real estate we no longer own or operate.\n\n## Rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability.\n\nState and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates, which may affect our rental  income.  Especially  in  times  of  recession  and  economic  slowdown,  rent  control  initiatives  can  acquire  significant  political  support.  If  rent  controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties, our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected.\n\n## Laws benefiting disabled persons may result in our incurrence of unanticipated expenses.\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ('ADA'), all places intended to be used by the public are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 ('FHAA') requires apartment communities first occupied after March 13, 1991, to comply with design and construction requirements for disabled access. For those apartment communities receiving federal funds, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 also has requirements regarding disabled access. These and federal, state, and local laws may require structural modifications to our apartment communities or changes in policy/practice or affect renovations of the communities. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. Although we believe that  our  apartment  communities  are  substantially  in  compliance  with  present  requirements,  we  may  incur  unanticipated  expenses  to  comply  with  the  ADA,  the FHAA, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in connection with the ongoing operation or redevelopment of our apartment communities.\n\n## Moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly.\n\nAlthough we are proactively engaged in managing moisture intrusion and preventing the presence of mold at our apartment communities, it is not unusual for periodic moisture intrusion to cause mold in isolated locations within an apartment community. We have implemented policies, procedures, and training, and include a  detailed  moisture  intrusion  and  mold  assessment  during  acquisition  due  diligence.  We  believe  these  measures  will  manage  mold  exposure  at  our  apartment communities and will minimize the effects that mold may have on our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate mold conditions. We have only limited insurance coverage for property damage claims arising from the presence of mold and for personal injury claims related to mold exposure.\n\n## Although we are insured for certain risks, the cost of insurance, increased claims activity, or losses resulting from casualty events may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are insured for a portion of our real estate assets' exposure to casualty losses resulting from fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and other perils, which insurance is subject to deductibles and self-insurance retention. We recognize casualty losses or gains based on the net book value of the affected asset and the amount of any related insurance proceeds. In many instances, the actual cost to repair or replace the apartment community may exceed its net book value and any insurance proceeds. We recognize the uninsured portion of losses as casualty losses in the periods in which they are incurred. In addition, we are self-insured for a portion of our exposure to third-party claims related to our workers' compensation coverage and general liability exposure. With respect to our exposure to claims of third parties, we establish reserves at levels that reflect our known and estimated losses. The ultimate cost of losses and the impact of unforeseen events may vary materially from recorded reserves, and variances may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We purchase insurance to reduce our exposure to losses and limit our financial losses on large individual risks. The availability and cost of insurance are determined by market",

If we are not able to obtain or maintain insurance in amounts, we consider appropriate for our business, or if the cost of obtaining such insurance increases materially, we may have to retain a larger portion of the potential loss associated with our exposures to risks.\n\n## Natural disasters and severe weather may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather such as hurricanes may result in significant damage to our real estate assets. The extent of our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area. When we have geographic concentration of exposures, a single catastrophe (such as an earthquake) or destructive weather event (such as a hurricane) affecting a region may have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot accurately predict natural disasters or severe weather, or the number and type of such events that will affect us. As a result, our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next. Although we anticipate and plan for losses, there can be no assurance that our financial results will not be adversely affected by our exposure to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather in the future that exceed our previous experience and assumptions.\n\n## We depend on our senior management.\n\nOur success and our ability to implement and manage anticipated future growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts of our senior management team, who have extensive market knowledge and relationships, and exercise substantial influence over our operational, financing, acquisition, and disposition activity. Members of our senior management team have national or regional industry reputations that attract business and investment opportunities and assist us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants, and other industry participants. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain similarly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities, and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants, and industry participants, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\n\n## We rely on AIR to manage a majority of our properties. If AIR fails to efficiently manage such properties, tenants may not renew their leases, or we may become subject to unforeseen liabilities.\n\nA majority of our properties are managed by AIR. We do not supervise AIR or its managers and employees on a day-to-day basis and we cannot assure you that they will manage such properties in a manner that is consistent with their obligations under our agreements, that they will not be negligent in their performance or engage in any criminal or fraudulent activity, or that they will not otherwise default on their management obligations to us. If any of the foregoing occurs, the relationships with our tenants at such properties could be damaged, which may cause the tenants not to renew their leases, and we could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to the properties or to persons at the properties. If we are unable to lease the properties or we become subject to significant liabilities as a result of AIR's management performance, our financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\n\n## In addition to property management services, we depend on AIR to support certain of our property's operations, and any adverse changes in the financial health of AIR or our relationship with it could hinder AIR's ability to successfully manage our operations.\n\nWe are  dependent  on  AIR  to  support  certain  of  our  property's  operations  pursuant  to  the  Property  Management  Agreement.  Any  adverse  changes  in  the financial condition of AIR, AIR's ability to retain or replace its employees, or our relationship with AIR, could hinder AIR's ability to successfully manage our operations, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Our business and operations would suffer in the event of significant disruptions or cyberattacks of our information technology systems or our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations related to privacy and data protection.\n\nInformation technology, communication networks, and related systems are essential to the operation of our business. We use these systems to manage our vendor relationships, internal communications, accounting and record-keeping systems, and many other key aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks, which also depend on the strength of our procedures and the effectiveness of our internal controls. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks.",

We face risks associated with energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures,  and  cyberattacks  and  intrusions,  such  as  computer  viruses,  malware,  attachments  to  emails,  intrusion,  and  unauthorized  access,  including  from  persons inside our organization or from persons outside our organization with access to our systems. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful  or  damaging.  Any  compromise  of  our  security  could  also  result  in  a  violation  of  applicable  privacy  and  other  laws,  significant  legal  and  financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss, or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary, or commercially sensitive in nature), and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.\n\nWe also are subject to laws, rules, and regulations in the United States, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (the 'CCPA' (which became effective on January 1, 2020)), relating to the collection, use, and security of employee and other data. Evolving compliance and operational requirements under the CCPA and the privacy and data security laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. Our failure to comply with laws, rules, and regulations related to privacy and data protection could harm our business or reputation.\n\n## Third Party Purchase or Offer Rights, such as in our Master Leasing Agreement, may discourage third parties from negotiating with us with respect to the sale of our real property.\n\nDuring the term of the Master Leasing Agreement, AIR will have a purchase option on the direct or indirect transfer of any real property owned or, subject to the consent of the landlord, leased by us (including indirect transfers pursuant to a transfer of equity interests in any of our subsidiaries that owns or leases such real property)  and  any  rights  to  acquire  real  property,  but  excluding  any  property  leased  from  AIR  pursuant  to  the  Master  Leasing  Agreement,  with  respect  to  real property for which redevelopment has been substantially completed by Aimco (if applicable) and that has reached a specified occupancy for a minimum time period and a right of first offer with respect to stabilized properties that Aimco is under contract to purchase, but excluding any such transfers in respect of certain of the operating properties. This right of first offer and purchase option may discourage third parties from negotiating with us with respect to the sale of our real property and may limit  the  number  of  interested  buyers,  and  further  may  prevent  us  from  receiving  the  maximum  price  that  we  may  otherwise  have  obtained  for  such properties.\n\n## There may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR.\n\nThere may be, or there may be the appearance of, conflicts of interest in our relationship with AIR. The Separation was designed to minimize conflicts of interest between us and AIR (and we have formed the Aimco-AIR Transactions Committee to oversee prospective transactions between the two companies to ensure they are on arm's length terms), however, there can be no assurance that such conflicts don't exist.\n\nAlthough we and AIR each have an independent Board and independent management and are incentivized to make decisions that are in the best interests of its respective business, Mr. Considine serves on both our and AIR's Board, however, Mr. Considine will recuse himself from voting as a member of either Board during the approval or disapproval of any transactions between the two companies. In addition, as part of the Separation, AIR and Aimco entered into the Employee Matters Agreement, which provides that Mr. Considine will continue to serve Aimco with specific responsibilities for two years following the Separation to support the establishment and growth of the Aimco business, reporting directly to the Aimco Board.\n\nThe agreements between us and AIR generally do not limit or restrict AIR or its affiliates from engaging in any business or managing other entities that engage in business of the type conducted by us. Although we and AIR do not generally engage in the same business, AIR and its affiliates may in the future determine to redevelop or develop apartment communities and other real estate assets, some of which may be in close proximity to certain of our apartment communities. Certain business  opportunities  appropriate  for  us  may  also  in  the  future  be  appropriate  for  AIR  or  its  affiliates,  and  we  may  compete  with  AIR  for  certain  business opportunities. This may cause us to compete with AIR for business opportunities or result in a change in our current business strategy.",

Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential, actual, or perceived conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including causing a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us, a decrease in the prices of our equity securities, and a resulting increased risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\n\n## Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\n\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. Given our stockholder composition and other factors, it is possible our stockholders or future activist stockholders may attempt to effect such changes. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by such activist stockholders or others would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board and senior management team from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or changes to the composition of the Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability, or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential lenders, partners, or others with whom we do business, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING\n\n## Our debt financing could result in foreclosure of our apartment communities, prevent us from making distributions on our equity, or otherwise adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, a significant number of our apartment communities serve as collateral for our credit facility, property debt, construction loans, and two Notes Payable to subsidiaries of AIR ('Notes Payable to AIR'). Our secured credit facility matures in December 2023, subject to extension options. Certain of our subsidiaries have existing secured property-level debt equal to approximately $484.9 million and construction loans of approximately $168.4 million. Another is the  obligator  on  the  Notes  Payable  to  AIR  with  an  aggregated  principal  amount  equal  to  approximately  $534.1  million.  Over  time,  we  may  become  party  to additional  financing  arrangements,  including  credit  facilities  or  other  bank  debt,  bonds,  and  mortgage  financing.  Our  organizational  documents  do  not  limit  the amount of debt that we may incur, and we have significant amounts of debt outstanding. Payments of principal and interest may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our communities or pay distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT.\n\nIn connection with such financing activities, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that our indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of thenexisting  indebtedness.  If  we  fail  to  make  required  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  our  non-recourse  debt,  our  lenders  could  foreclose  on  the  apartment communities and other collateral securing such debt, which would result in the loss to us of income and asset value.\n\n## Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing and the cost of available financing and could adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing and the cost of such financing depends on the overall condition of the United States credit markets. During periods of economic uncertainty, the United States credit markets may experience significant liquidity disruptions, which may cause the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably and make obtaining financing, both non-recourse property debt secured by stabilized properties, construction loans, and corporate borrowings such as those under our credit facilities, more difficult. In particular, apartment borrowers have benefited from the historic willingness of the Federal National Mortgage Association ('Fannie Mae'), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ('Freddie Mac'), to make substantial amounts of loans secured by multifamily properties, even in  times  of  economic  distress.  These  two  lenders  are  federally  chartered  and  subject  to  federal  regulation,  which  is  subject  to  change,  making  uncertain  their prospects and ability to provide liquidity in a future downturn.\n\nIf our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected, we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of liquidity, which could result in a lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt and loss of income and asset value, both of which would adversely affect our liquidity.",

        "page_content": "## Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense and reduce our profitability, and the phasing out of LIBOR could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nOur revolving secured credit facility contains a variable interest rate which may be based, in part, on LIBOR. An increase or decrease in LIBOR would likely increase or decrease our interest expense. An increase in interest expense may affect our profitability.\n\nIn March 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, formally announced that the publication of LIBOR was ending and confirmed that USD LIBOR-indexed rates would cease to be published after June 30, 2023. Certain interbank offered rates ('IBOR') ceased on December 31, 2021. In 2018, the Alternative  Reference  Rates  Committee  identified  the  Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate  ('SOFR')  as  the  recommended  alternative  to  LIBOR.  However, uncertainty exists in the markets as to the adoption and implementation of alternative reference rates. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, and any establishment of alternative reference rates. Due to the broad use of LIBOR as a reference rate, all financial market participants, including us, are impacted by the risks associated with this transition. Certain of our debt agreements, including our revolving secured credit facility, bear interest at rates that are calculated based, in part, on LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist during the term of our agreements, the documents associated with our agreements contain language to address a transition to another benchmark rate. Accordingly, the phase-out of LIBOR and any other related changes or reforms, could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, and as a result, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\n\n## Covenant restrictions may limit our operations and impact our ability to make payments to our investors.\n\nSome of our existing and/or future  debt  and  other  securities  may  contain  covenants  that  restrict  our  activities.  These  may  include  covenants  that  limit  our operations or impact our ability to make distributions or other payments unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied, as well as certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants.\n\n## We may increase leverage in executing our development plan, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\n\nWe may decide to increase our leverage to execute our development plan. We will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. Although our credit facility may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, our governing documents do not limit the amount of debt we may incur, and we may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders. We may incur additional indebtedness from time to time in the future to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our indebtedness could intensify.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION\n\n## We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Separation.\n\nFollowing the Separation, we and AIR are two, focused and independent companies. We may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a company independent from AIR in the time we expect, if at all. For instance, it may take longer than anticipated for us to, or we may never, succeed in growing our revenues through our development and redevelopment business.\n\n## The Separation could give rise to disputes or other unfavorable effects, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with AIR, effective as of December 15, 2020 (the 'Separation Agreement'), which, among other things, contains the agreements among the parties regarding the principal transactions that were necessary to effect the Separation. It  also  sets  forth  other  agreements  that  govern  certain  aspects  of  the  parties'  ongoing  relationship  after  the  Separation.  The  Separation  may  lead  to  increased operating and other expenses, of both a nonrecurring and a recurring nature, and to changes to certain operations, which expenses or changes could arise pursuant to arrangements made between AIR and us or could trigger contractual rights of, and obligations to, third parties. Disputes with third parties could also arise out of these transactions, and we could experience unfavorable reactions to the Separation from employees, lenders, ratings agencies, regulators, OP unitholders or other interested parties. These increased expenses, changes to operations, disputes with third parties or other effects could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, disputes with AIR could arise in connection with each of the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Property Management Agreements, the Master Services Agreement, the Master Leasing Agreement, or certain other agreements.",

        "page_content": "## Although we have endeavored to enter into agreements on market terms, our agreements with AIR may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm'slength negotiations with unaffiliated third parties.\n\nThe agreements related to the Separation, including the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Property Management Agreements, the Master Services Agreement, the Master Leasing Agreement, and certain other agreements were entered into in the context of the Separation while both companies were under common control. As a result, although we endeavored to enter into these agreements on market terms, they may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements entered into in the context of the Separation concern, among other  things,  allocation  of  assets  and  liabilities  attributable  to  periods  prior  to  the  Separation  and  the  rights  and  obligations,  including  certain  indemnification obligations, of AIR and us after the Separation, certain services provided by us to AIR and by AIR to us after the Separation, and our lease from AIR of the Initial Leased Properties.\n\n## Following the Separation, we may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company.\n\nFollowing the Separation, AIR hired substantially all of Aimco's existing employees (including Aimco's existing property management employees), and Aimco retained approximately 50 employees. We have limited historical operations as a company independent from AIR and did not, following the Separation, have the infrastructure or personnel necessary to operate as an independent company without relying on AIR to provide certain services (such as those related to technology, payroll, etc.) on an ongoing basis. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Master Services Agreement with AIR pursuant to which AIR will provide certain services to us to allow us to benefit from certain cost efficiencies in sharing certain resources and personnel. As a separate publicly traded company, Aimco is subject to, and responsible for, regulatory compliance, including periodic public filings with the SEC and compliance with the NYSE continued listing requirements as well as compliance with generally applicable tax and accounting rules, certain elements of which may rely on services provided by AIR under the Master Services Agreement.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  we  will  be  able  to  successfully  implement  the  infrastructure  or  retain  or  hire  the  personnel  necessary  to  operate  as  an independent company or that we will not incur costs in excess of anticipated costs to establish such infrastructure and retain or hire such personnel. In the short term, we may pay rates for the services higher than those a third party would have paid or that we could have provided to ourselves.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\n## Aimco may fail to qualify as a REIT .\n\nIf Aimco fails to qualify as a REIT, Aimco will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income and will be subject  to  United  States  federal  income  tax  at  regular  corporate  rates.  This  would  substantially  reduce  our  funds  available  for  general  corporate  usage  or  for distribution to our investors. Unless entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, Aimco also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a REIT. In addition, Aimco's failure to qualify as a REIT may place us in default under our credit facilities.\n\nWe believe that Aimco operates, and has since its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, operated, in a manner that enables it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. However, qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited  judicial  and  administrative  authorities  exist.  Moreover,  even  a  technical  or  inadvertent  mistake  could  jeopardize  our  REIT  status.  Aimco's  continued qualification  as  a  REIT  will  depend  on  its  satisfaction  of  certain  asset,  income,  investment,  organizational,  distribution,  stockholder  ownership,  and  other requirements on a continuing basis. Aimco's ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we do not obtain independent appraisals. Aimco's compliance with the REIT annual income and quarterly asset requirements  also  depends  upon  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  the  composition  of  our  income  and  assets  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Moreover,  the  proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the 'IRS'), will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or other issuers constitutes a violation of the REIT requirements. Moreover, future economic, market, legal, tax, or other considerations may cause Aimco to fail to qualify as a REIT, or the Board of Aimco may determine to revoke its REIT status.",

        "page_content": "## REIT distribution requirements limit our available cash.\n\nAs a REIT, Aimco is subject to annual distribution requirements. Aimco pays distributions, including taxable stock dividends, intended to enable Aimco to satisfy its distribution requirements. This limits the amount of cash available for other business purposes, including amounts to fund our growth. Aimco generally must distribute annually at least 90% of its 'real estate investment trust taxable income,' which is generally equivalent to net taxable ordinary income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, in order for its distributed earnings not to be subject to United States federal corporate income tax. We intend to make distributions to Aimco's stockholders to comply with the requirements applicable to REITs under the Code (which may be all cash or combination of cash and stock satisfying the requirements of applicable law). However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell apartment communities or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the 90% distribution requirement of the Code.\n\n## Aimco may be subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in certain circumstances.\n\nEven as a REIT, Aimco may be subject to United States federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on its undistributed income. Aimco could also be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm's-length transactions between Aimco and a taxable REIT subsidiary ('TRS') and on any net income from sales of apartment communities that were held for sale primarily in the ordinary course. State and local tax laws may not conform to the United States federal income tax treatment, and Aimco may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions in which Aimco transacts business. Any taxes imposed on Aimco would reduce our operating cash flow and net income and could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends and distributions.\n\n## Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\n\nREITs are entitled to a United States federal income tax deduction for dividends paid to their stockholders. As compared to other taxable corporations, this ability to reduce or eliminate the REIT's taxable income by paying dividends to stockholders is a principal benefit of maintaining REIT status, generally resulting in a lower combined tax liability of the REIT and its stockholders as compared to that of the combined tax liability of other taxable corporations and their stockholders. Notwithstanding this combined benefit, dividends payable by REITs may result in marginally higher taxes to the stockholder.\n\nC-corporations are generally required to pay United States federal income tax on earnings. After-tax earnings are then available for stockholder dividends. The maximum United States federal tax rate applicable  to income from 'qualified  dividends'  payable  to United  States  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts,  and estates is currently 20%, plus the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. While dividends payable by REITs are generally not eligible for the qualified dividend reduced rates, stockholders that are individuals, trusts, or estates, and meet certain requirements, may generally deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary dividends from REITs. This deduction is available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, and will generally cause the maximum tax rate for ordinary dividends from REITs to be 29.6%, plus the 3.8% investment tax surcharge. The more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts, and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including Aimco Common Stock.\n\n## Complying with the REIT requirements may cause Aimco to forgo otherwise attractive business opportunities.\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, Aimco must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the  amounts  distributed  to  Aimco  stockholders,  and  the  ownership  of  Aimco  stock.  As  a  result  of  these  tests,  Aimco  may  be  required  to  make  distributions  to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when Aimco does not have funds readily available for distribution, forgo otherwise attractive investment opportunities, liquidate assets in adverse market conditions, or contribute assets to a TRS that is subject to regular corporate federal income tax.\n\n## Changes to United States federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect Aimco and Aimco's stockholders.\n\nThe present United States federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial, or administrative action at any time, which could affect the United States federal income tax treatment of an investment in Aimco Common Stock. The United States federal income tax rules dealing with REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, and the United States Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect Aimco or Aimco's stockholders. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect Aimco's ability to qualify as a REIT and the tax considerations relevant to an investment in Aimco Common Stock or could cause Aimco to change its investments and commitments.",

Until  the  expiration  of  a  one-year holding period, subject to certain exceptions, investors may not transfer OP Units without the consent of Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner. Thereafter, investors may transfer such OP Units subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the general partner's right of first refusal. In addition, after the expiration of the one-year holding period, investors have the right, subject to the terms of Aimco Operating Partnership's agreement, to require Aimco Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of such investor's OP Units (in exchange for shares of Aimco Common Stock or cash, in Aimco Operating Partnership's discretion) once per quarter on an exchange date set by Aimco Operating Partnership, provided such investor provides notice at least 45 days prior to the quarterly exchange  date.  See  'Description  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  Units  and  Summary  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  Agreement-Redemption  Rights  of Qualifying Parties'. There is no public market for the OP Units. Aimco Operating Partnership has no plans to list any OP Units on a securities exchange. It is unlikely that any person will make a market in the OP Units, or that an active market for the OP Units will develop. If a market for the OP Units develops and the OP Units  are  considered  'readily  tradable'  on  a  'secondary  market  (or  the  substantial  equivalent  thereof),'  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  would  be  classified  as  a publicly traded partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could have a material adverse effect on Aimco Operating Partnership and its unitholders.\n\nIn addition, Aimco Operating Partnership may issue an unlimited number of additional OP Units or other securities for such consideration and on such terms as it may establish, without the approval of the holders of OP Units. Such securities could have priority over the OP Units as to cash flow, distributions, and liquidation proceeds. The effect of any such issuance may be to dilute the interests of holders of OP Units.\n\n## Cash distributions by Aimco Operating Partnership are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with partnership performance.\n\nAimco Operating Partnership does not intend to make regular distributions to holders of OP Units (other than what is required for Aimco to maintain its REIT status). There can be no assurance regarding the amounts of available cash that Aimco Operating Partnership will generate or the portion that its general partner will choose to distribute. The actual amounts of available cash will depend upon numerous factors, including profitability of operations, required principal and interest payments on its debt, the cost of acquisitions (including related debt service payments), its issuance of debt and equity securities, fluctuations in working capital, capital  expenditures,  adjustments  in  reserves,  prevailing  economic  conditions,  and  financial,  business,  and  other  factors,  some  of  which  may  be  beyond  Aimco Operating Partnership's control. Cash distributions depend primarily on cash flow, including from reserves, and not on profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. Therefore, cash distributions may be made during periods when Aimco Operating Partnership records losses and may not be made during periods when it records profits.  Aimco Operating Partnership agreement gives the general partner discretion in establishing reserves  for the proper  conduct of the partnership's business that will affect the amount of available cash. Aimco Operating Partnership may be required to make reserves for the future payment of principal and interest under its credit facilities and other indebtedness. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership's credit facilities may limit its ability to distribute cash to holders of OP Units. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance regarding actual levels of cash distributions on OP Units, and Aimco Operating Partnership's ability to distribute cash may be limited during the existence of any events of default under any of its debt instruments.\n\n## Holders of Aimco OP Units have limited voting rights and are limited in their ability to effect a change of control.\n\nAimco Operating Partnership is managed and operated by its general partner, Aimco. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, holders of OP Units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting Aimco Operating Partnership's business. Such matters relate to certain amendments of the partnership agreement and certain transactions such as the institution of bankruptcy proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors and certain transfers by the general partner of its interest in Aimco Operating Partnership or the admission of a successor general partner. Holders of OP Units have no right to elect the general partner on an annual or other continuing basis, or to remove the general partner. As a result, holders of OP Units have limited influence on matters affecting the operation of Aimco Operating Partnership, and third parties may find it difficult to attempt to gain control over, or influence the activities of, Aimco Operating Partnership.",

In order to comply with specific REIT tax requirements, Aimco's charter has restrictions on the ownership of its equity securities. As a result, Aimco Operating Partnership limited partners and Aimco stockholders are limited in their ability to effect a change of control of Aimco Operating Partnership and Aimco, respectively.\n\n## Holders of OP Units may not have limited liability in specific circumstances.\n\nThe limitations  on  the  liability  of  limited  partners  for  the  obligations  of  a  limited  partnership  have  not  been  clearly  established  in  some  states.

At the same time, as the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, it has fiduciary duties to manage Aimco Operating Partnership in a manner beneficial to Aimco Operating Partnership and its  limited  partners.  The duties of the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership to Aimco Operating Partnership and its partners may therefore come into conflict with the duties of the directors and officers of the general partner to its sole stockholder, Aimco. Such conflicts of interest might arise in the following situations, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 decisions of the general partner with respect to the amount and timing of cash expenditures, borrowings, issuances of additional interests and reserves in any quarter, will affect whether or the extent to which there is available cash to make distributions in a given quarter;\n- \u00b7 whenever possible, the general partner seeks to limit Aimco Operating Partnership's liability under contractual arrangements to all or particular assets of Aimco Operating Partnership, with the other party thereto having no recourse against the general partner or its assets;\n- \u00b7 any agreements between Aimco Operating Partnership and the general partner and its affiliates will not grant to the holders of OP Units, separate and distinct from Aimco Operating Partnership, the right to enforce the obligations of the general partner and such affiliates in favor of Aimco Operating Partnership.  Therefore,  the  general  partner,  in  its  capacity  as  the  general  partner  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  will  be  primarily  responsible  for enforcing such obligations; and\n- \u00b7 under the terms of the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement, the general partner is not restricted from causing Aimco Operating Partnership to pay the general partner or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to Aimco Operating Partnership or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of such entities on behalf of Aimco Operating Partnership. Neither the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement nor any of the other agreements, contracts, and arrangements between Aimco Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership and its affiliates, on the other, are or will be the result of arm's-length negotiations.",

        "page_content": "## Provisions in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement may limit the ability of a holder of OP Units to challenge actions taken by the general partner.\n\nDelaware law provides that, except as provided in a partnership agreement, a general partner owes the fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the partnership and its limited partners. The Aimco Operating Partnership agreement expressly authorizes the general partner to enter into, on behalf of Aimco Operating Partnership, a right of first opportunity arrangement and other conflict avoidance agreements with various affiliates of Aimco Operating Partnership and the general partner, on such terms as the general partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, believes are advisable. The latitude given in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement to the general partner in resolving conflicts of interest may significantly limit the ability of a holder of OP Units to challenge what might otherwise be a breach of fiduciary duty.  The  general  partner  believes,  however,  that  such  latitude  is  necessary  and  appropriate  to  enable  it  to  serve  as  the  general  partner  of  Aimco  Operating Partnership without undue risk of liability.\n\nThe Aimco Operating Partnership agreement limits the liability of the general partner for actions taken in good faith. Aimco Operating Partnership's partnership agreement expressly limits the liability of the general partner by providing that the general partner, and its officers and directors, will not be liable or accountable in damages to Aimco Operating Partnership, the limited partners, or assignees for errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or omission if the general partner or such director or officer acted in good faith. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership is required to indemnify the general partner, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses, judgments, fines, and other actions incurred by the general partner or such other persons, provided that Aimco Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (i) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law or (ii) for any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement. The provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and the general partner has not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the Aimco Operating Partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict the fiduciary duties of the general partner that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries may be prohibited from making distributions and other payments.\n\nAll of Aimco Operating Partnership's real estate assets are owned by subsidiaries of Aimco Operating Partnership. As a result, Aimco Operating Partnership depends on distributions and payments from its subsidiaries in order to satisfy our financial obligations and make payments to our equity holders, as applicable. The ability of Aimco Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to make such distributions and other payments depends on their earnings and cash flows and may be subject to statutory or contractual limitations. As an equity investor in the REIT subsidiaries and our subsidiaries, our right to receive assets upon their liquidation or reorganization are effectively subordinated to the claims of their creditors and any holders of preferred equity senior to our equity investments. To the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiaries, our claims may still be subordinate to any security interest in or other lien on their assets and to any of their debt or other obligations that are senior to our claims.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

MARKET  FOR  THE  REGISTRANT'S  COMMON  EQUITY,  RELATED  STOCKHOLDER  MATTERS,  AND  ISSUER  PURCHASES  OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\n## Aimco\n\nAimco's Common Stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol 'AIV.'\n\nOn February 28, 2022, there were 152,556,271 shares of Common Stock outstanding, held by 774 stockholders of record. The number of holders does not include individuals or entities who beneficially own shares but whose shares are held of record by a broker or clearing agency but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one record holder.\n\n## Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities\n\nFrom time to time, Aimco may issue shares of common stock in exchange for OP Units, defined under the Aimco Operating Partnership heading below. Such shares  are  issued  based  on  an  exchange  ratio  of  one  share  for  each  common  OP  Unit.  Aimco  may  also  issue  shares  of  common  stock  in  exchange  for  limited partnership interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Please refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of such exchanges.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Aimco issued approximately 595,000 shares of common stock in exchange for OP Units in these transactions. Such shares were issued in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n## Repurchases of Equity Securities\n\nThere were no repurchases by Aimco of its common equity securities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Aimco's Board has, from time to time, authorized Aimco to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2021, Aimco was authorized to repurchase approximately 10.4 million  shares.  This  authorization  has  no  expiration  date.  These  repurchases  may  be  made  from  time  to  time  in  the  open  market  or  in  privately  negotiated transactions.\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nInterests in Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than Aimco are referred to as OP Units. OP Units are common partnership units ('common OP Units'). There is no public market for OP Units, and we have no intention of listing the common partnership units on any securities exchange. In addition, Aimco Operating Partnership's Partnership Agreement restricts the transferability of OP Units.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, there were 160,506,244 common partnership units and equivalents outstanding (152,556,271 of which were held by Aimco) that were held by 2,229 unitholders of record.\n\n## Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities\n\nAimco Operating Partnership did not issue any unregistered OP Units during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Repurchases of Equity Securities\n\nAimco Operating Partnership's Partnership Agreement generally provides that after holding common OP Units for one-year, limited partners other than Aimco have  the  right  to  redeem  their  common  OP  Units  for  cash  or,  at  our  election,  shares  of  Aimco  Common  Stock  on  a  one-for-one  basis  (subject  to  customary antidilution adjustments). During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 595,000 common OP Units were redeemed in exchange for shares of Common Stock. During the same period, approximately 13,000 common OP Units were redeemed in exchange for cash at an average price of $5.76.",

Aimco's Board determines and declares its dividends. In making a dividend determination, Aimco's Board considers a variety of factors, including REIT distribution requirements; current market conditions; liquidity needs; and other uses of cash, such as deleveraging and accretive investment activities. Aimco plans to reinvest earnings to facilitate growth and, therefore, does not presently intend to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend.\n\nStockholders receiving any dividend, whether payable in cash or cash and shares of Aimco Common Stock, will be required to include the full amount of such dividend as income to the extent of Aimco's current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes for the year of such dividend and may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividend in excess of the cash dividend received. With respect to certain non-United States stockholders, Aimco may be required to withhold United States tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in Common Stock.\n\nThe Board of Aimco Operating Partnership's general partner determines and declares distributions on OP Units. Aimco, through a wholly owned subsidiary, is the sole general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Aimco owned 93.1% of the legal interest in the common partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership and 95.0% of the economic interest of Aimco Operating Partnership. Aimco Operating Partnership holds all of Aimco's assets and manages the daily operations of Aimco's business. The distributions paid by Aimco Operating Partnership to Aimco are used by Aimco to fund the dividends paid to its stockholders. Accordingly, the per share dividends Aimco pays to its stockholders generally equal the per unit distributions paid by Aimco Operating Partnership to holders of its common partnership units.\n\nOur revolving credit agreement includes customary covenants, including a restriction on dividends and other restricted payments, but permits dividends and distributions as may be necessary to maintain Aimco's REIT status.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons of 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-toyear comparisons of 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nOur mission is to make real estate investments, primarily focused on the multifamily sector within the continental United States, where outcomes are enhanced through our human capital so that substantial value is created for investors, teammates, and the communities in which we operate.\n\nPlease refer to 'Item 1. Business' for additional discussion of our business organization and strategy and 'Item 2. Properties' and 'Schedule III - Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation' for details regarding the size, location, and key characteristics of our various properties.\n\n## The Separation\n\nOn December  15,  2020,  Aimco  completed  the  separation  of  AIR  from  Aimco,  creating  two  distinct,  independent  businesses.  Prior  to  the  Separation,  the consolidated  financial  statements  were  prepared  on  a  carve-out  basis  and  reflect  significant  assumptions  and  allocations.  The  consolidated  financial  statements reflect our historical financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The financial statements of Aimco are presented for all historical periods described and at the carrying value of such assets and liabilities reflected in Aimco Predecessor's books and records.\n\n## Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021\n\nThe results from the execution of our business plan during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, are described below.\n\n## Financial Results and 2021 Highlights\n\n- \u00b7 For the year ended December 31, 2021, net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders per common share was $0.04 compared to net loss per common share of $0.03 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n- \u00b7 For the year, revenue from our operating properties was up 4.2% compared to 2020, with occupancy up 160 basis points to 97.9%.\n- \u00b7 Also, during 2021, we invested approximately $215 million in eight distinctive development and redevelopment projects. Each of these projects are on-time, on-budget and on plan to create substantial value for shareholders.\n- \u00b7 We executed more than 630 leases on newly constructed apartment homes in 2021, almost 200 more leases than were planned at the start of the year and at rental rates averaging approximately 115% of target.\n- \u00b7 We also sourced and secured new investments in 2021 that provide the opportunity for more than $1 billion of highly accretive development in dynamic, high-growth markets.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, we closed $363 million in new financings including $251 million of loans committed for the development or redevelopment of properties, $60 million of property debt secured by operating properties, and a $52 million preferred equity commitment from an institutional equity partner to partially  fund the Upton Place development in Washington, D.C., freeing up Aimco capital for other accretive uses and improving the expected return on Aimco equity.\n- \u00b7 We ended the year with $395 million of liquidity, including cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility.\n\nOur business is organized around defined areas of strategic focus: value add and opportunistic real estate; alternative investments; investment activity; operating properties; balance sheet; and team and culture.\n\n## Value Add, Opportunistic and Alternative Investments\n\n## Development and Redevelopment\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we invested approximately $215 million in our development and redevelopment projects.",

The project is scheduled for completion in 2024, and NOI stabilization is targeted for 2026.\n- \u00b7 The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club on the Anschutz Medical and Life Sciences Campus in Aurora, Colorado, is on budget and on schedule for completion in early 2023, and NOI stabilization in late 2026.\n- \u00b7 In  Corte  Madera,  California,  development  activity  on  Oak  Shore,  a  community  with  16  luxury  single  family  rental  homes,  each  averaging approximately  3,200  square  feet,  plus  eight  accessory  dwelling  units,  is  underway  and  on  plan  with  deliveries  beginning  in  2023,  and  NOI stabilization occurring in 2025.\n- \u00b7 In the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami, Florida, Aimco is completely renovating The Hamilton and expects apartment homes coming back online in 2022 and NOI stabilization targeted for 2024.\n\n## Lease-up Progress\n\n- \u00b7 At 707  Leahy,  in  Redwood  City,  California,  all  apartment  homes  had  been  delivered  and  construction  was  complete  as  of  4Q  2020.  As  of December 31, 2021, the 110-unit property was 97% leased.\n- \u00b7 At The Fremont on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, all apartment homes had been delivered and construction was complete as of 4Q 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the 253-unit property was 83% leased.\n- \u00b7 At Prism, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all apartment homes had been delivered and construction was complete as of 1Q 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the 136-unit property was 96% leased.\n- \u00b7 At Flamingo Point North Tower in Miami Beach, Florida, at year end 56% units had been delivered. As of December 31, 2021, 83% of the 366 total units were leased.\n\n## Alternative Investments\n\n- \u00b7 Parkmerced Mezzanine Investment :  On  November  26,  2019,  we  made  a  five-year,  $275.0  million  mezzanine  loan  to  a  partnership  owning Parkmerced Apartments, located in southwest San Francisco (the 'Mezzanine Investment'). The loan bears interest at a 10% annual rate, accruing if not paid from property operations. The Separation Agreement provides for AIR to transfer, once third-party consents related to the transfer are received,  ownership  of  the  subsidiaries  that  originated  and  hold  the  mezzanine  loan,  a  related  equity  option  to  acquire  a  30%  interest  in  the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments and the interest rate option, or swaption, that provides partial protection against future refinancing risk through 2024 to Aimco. At the time of the Separation and as of the date of this report, legal title of these subsidiaries had not yet transferred to  Aimco.  Until  legal  title  of  the  subsidiaries  is  transferred,  AIR  is  obligated  to  pass  payments  on  such  loan  to  us,  and  we  are  obligated  to indemnify AIR against any costs and expenses related thereto. We have the risks and rewards of ownership of the Mezzanine Investment and have recognized an asset related to our right to receive the Mezzanine Investment from AIR. In 2021, operations at Parkmerced were stressed due to reduced in-person learning at the neighboring San Francisco State University and lower demand as the region navigates the pandemic and related restrictions. In spite of the challenges faced by the property, the borrower on our mezzanine loan has serviced its first mortgage debt as required and has reported that it expects to do the same in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Life Science Developer Investment : In the third quarter of 2020, we made a $50.0 million commitment to purchase common stock of IQHQ, a privately held life sciences real estate development company. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we funded a capital call of $11.2 million bringing our total investment to $35.8 million of the total commitment. Subsequent to year end, we funded our remaining commitment to IQHQ.\n- \u00b7 Property Technology Fund Investments: As of December 31, 2021, we have investments valued at $9.6 million in property technology funds consisting of privately held entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry.",

        "page_content": "## Investment Activity\n\n## Leasehold Agreements\n\n- \u00b7 On January 1, 2021, terms commenced on the leasehold agreements with AIR for 707 Leahy, The Fremont, Prism, and Flamingo Point North Tower. On June 1, 2021, terms commenced on the leasehold agreement with AIR for Oak Shore Land, a 15-acre plot of land in the San Francisco Bay Area on which we began construction of 16 single family rental homes and eight accessory dwelling units in June 2021.\n- \u00b7 The combined initial value of leasehold interest, as indicative of the initial fair market values of the leased assets at the time of lease inception, was $475.1 million. The combined annual leasehold payment for these five assets is $25.6 million.\n- \u00b7 The lease agreements provide Aimco the right, but not the obligation, to terminate each lease once the leased property is stabilized with AIR then having the option to retain ownership of the land and purchase the improvements from Aimco. Should AIR exercise its option, Aimco would be due the difference between the property's fair-market value at stabilization and the initial value of the leasehold interest, less a 5% discount.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the following acquisitions:\n\n- \u00b7 We acquired,  for  $40.0  million,  Eldridge  Townhomes,  a  58-unit  townhome  community  located  in  Elmhurst,  Illinois  that  Aimco  developed between 2018 and 2020. The Eldridge Townhomes are located adjacent to an existing 400-unit Aimco community and the acquisition provides for continued operational efficiencies and improved NOI margins. We plan to hold the Eldridge Townhomes within our portfolio of stabilized operating properties.\n- \u00b7 We acquired eight land parcels adjacent to The Hamilton apartment community, located in Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, for $19.3 million and we began major redevelopment of the existing apartment building at The Hamilton. The scope of our investment will completely renew the waterfront high-rise, which benefits from spacious apartment homes (averaging 1,411 square feet) and an abundance of outdoor and amenity space  that  was  previously  underutilized.  With  these  investments,  we  can  now,  in  total,  construct  more  than  1.1  million  square  feet  of  new development in this rapidly growing submarket.\n- \u00b7 We purchased seven acres of developable land in Colorado Springs, Colorado for $4.1 million that allows for the construction  of up to 119 apartments and townhomes.\n- \u00b7 We also acquired The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club ('Benson Hotel') development property for $6.2 million, net of outstanding construction liabilities of $0.9 million. The development property consists of land and initial construction costs. The project is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n## Joint Venture Transactions\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the following joint venture agreements:\n\n- \u00b7 We entered  into  a  joint  venture  agreement  with  Kushner  Companies  to  purchase  three  undeveloped  land  parcels  located  in  downtown  Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The total contract price for the land is $49.0 million ($25.0 million at Aimco's 51% share). Current zoning allows for the development of approximately three million square feet of multifamily homes and commercial space. The land purchase closed in January 2022.\n- \u00b7 We entered into a joint venture agreement with an institutional equity partner to fund the development of Upton Place in Washington, D.C. with a commitment for $52.2 million of preferred equity financing at an accruing 9.7% rate. Our partner made contributions of $29.4 million in 2021, and will continue to fund the development monthly at 49% of the limited partner equity required to fund the development.\n\n## Operating Property Results\n\nWe own a geographically diversified portfolio of operating properties that produce stable cash flow and serves to balance the risk and highly variable cash flows associated with its portfolio  of  development  and  redevelopments  and  value-add  investments.  Our  operating  properties  produced  solid  results  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2021.",

        "page_content": "Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2021, include:\n\n- \u00b7 Average daily occupancy at our operating properties of 97.9%, a 160-basis point increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n- \u00b7 Revenue, before utility reimbursements, of $136.3 million, up 4.2% year over year.\n- \u00b7 Expenses, net of utility reimbursements of $43.5 million, up 4.3% year over year, due primarily to higher real estate taxes and insurance.\n- \u00b7 Net operating income of our operating properties increased by 4.1% year over year.\n\n1001 Brickell Bay Drive, a waterfront office building in Miami, Florida owned as part of a larger assemblage, was 80.2% occupied on December 31, 2021.\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\nWe capitalize our activities through a combination of non-recourse property debt, construction loans, third-party equity, and the recycling of Aimco equity, including retained earnings. We plan to limit the use of recourse leverage, with a strong preference towards non-recourse property-level debt in order to limit risk to the Aimco enterprise. When warranted, we plan to seek equity capital from joint venture partners to improve our cost of capital, further leverage Aimco equity, reduce exposure to a single investment and, in certain cases, for strategic benefits.\n\nWe are highly focused on maintaining ample liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, we had access to $394.6 million, including $233.4 million of cash on hand, $11.2 million of restricted cash, and the capacity to borrow up to $150.0 million on our revolving credit facility. Please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information regarding our leverage.\n\nIn evaluating our financial condition and operating performance we use non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDAre, which we believe is useful to investors and creditors as a supplemental measure of our ability to incur and service debt. Our Adjusted EBITDAre for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $81.4 million. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section for further information about the calculation of Adjusted EBITDAre and our leverage ratios.\n\n## Financing Activity\n\nDuring the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  entered  into  a  $150.0  million  variable-rate  non-recourse  construction  loan  collateralized  by  our leasehold interest and AIR's fee ownership interest in Flamingo North Tower. The initial term of the loan is three years and bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 360 basis points subject to a minimum all-in per annum interest rate of 3.85%. As of December 31, 2021, we had $130.3 million of principal outstanding. Certain consolidated subsidiaries have indemnified AIR for any losses it incurs as a result of a default on the loan by Aimco.\n\nAlso,  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  $100.7  million  variable-rate  non-recourse  construction  loan  collateralized  by  our  fee ownership interest in The Hamilton. The initial term of the loan is three years and bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 320 basis points subject to a minimum allin per annum interest rate of 3.45%. As of December 31, 2021, we had $38.1 million of principal outstanding.\n\nWe also closed on two non-recourse loans for $60.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The loans have 10-year terms and a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.09%. Proceeds from the loans were used to fund the acquisition of Eldridge Townhomes and other investment activities.\n\nIf LIBOR ceases to exist during the term of these agreements, the documents associated with these agreements contain language to address a transition to another benchmark rate. It is anticipated LIBOR will be replaced with SOFR, however, if SOFR were to not be available the agreements contain alternate provisions.\n\nAdditionally, we closed a preferred equity financing arrangement with an institutional equity investor for $52.2 million, accruing at a 9.7% interest rate, related to the completion of construction activities at Upton Place.\n\n## Human Capital and Culture\n\nOur team is our most important asset, and our culture is key to our success. In connection with the Separation, we retained approximately 50 Aimco employees, including: Wes Powell, Chief Executive Officer; Lynn Stanfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Johnson, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel; each of whom has more than 17 years of Aimco experience. In addition, former Aimco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine has been actively engaged throughout the transition period with a particular focus on strategic guidance and new business.\n\nAimco benefits from having experienced leaders located in each of four regional hubs where they utilize their local knowledge and connections to source and execute on exceptional investment opportunities. We believe the talent of our team, and our ability to retain that talent through a rewarding and balanced work-life culture, will result in superior outcomes and is key to our long-",

We offer benefits reflecting this belief, including paid time for parental leave, paid time annually to volunteer in local communities, a bonus structure at all levels of the organization, and flexibility in work locations and schedules.\n\nOur focus on our team and culture is recognized externally, as well. Out of hundreds of participating companies in 2021, we were one of only six recognized as a 'Top Workplace' in Colorado for each of the past nine years. We were also recognized as a 'Top Workplace' in Washington, D.C., where one of our headquarters is located in nearby Bethesda, Maryland. Additionally, in 2021, the Company was recognized as one of the Denver Area's Healthiest Employers in 2020.\n\n## Financial Results of Operations\n\nWe have  three  segments:  (i)  Development  and  Redevelopment;  (ii)  Operating;  and  (iii)  Other.  Our  Development  and  Redevelopment  segment  includes properties  that  are  under  construction,  in  pre-construction,  or  have  not  achieved  stabilization,  as  well  as  land  assemblages  that  are  being  held  for  development adjacent to The Hamilton community and other land purchases. The Development and Redevelopment segment also includes our five leased properties; two are under construction and three are operational but have not achieved stabilization. Our Operating segment includes majority owned residential communities that have achieved stabilized level of operations as of January 1, 2020, and maintained it throughout the current year and comparable period. Our Other segment includes our recent Eldridge Townhomes acquisition, stabilized but not owned for a comparable reporting period, and 1001 Brickell Drive, our only office building.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n\nNet  loss  decreased  by  $0.8  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  compared  to  2020.  Net  income  decreased  by  $5.8  million  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2020 compared 2019.\n\nDetailed Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2021, Compared to 2020 and the Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared to 2019\n\n## Property Results\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our Development and Redevelopment segment included five properties that were under construction, one in planning, and three properties  in  lease-up.  Our  Operating  segment  included  24  communities  with  6,067  apartment  homes,  and  our  Other  segment  includes  our  recent  Eldridge Townhomes acquisition, and one office building.\n\nWe use proportionate  property  net  operating  income  to  assess  the  operating  performance  of  our  segments.  Proportionate  property  net  operating  income  is defined as our share of rental and other property revenues, excluding utility reimbursements, less direct property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements, for consolidated communities. In our consolidated statements of operations, utility reimbursements are included in rental and other property revenues, in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the results of operations of our segments discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis and exclude the results of four apartment communities  with  an  aggregate  142  apartment  homes  that  we  neither  manage  nor  consolidate,  notes  receivable,  our  investment  in  IQHQ  and  the  Mezzanine Investment.\n\nWe do not include property management costs and casualty gains or losses, reported in consolidated  amounts, in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below.\n\nPlease refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses.",

        "page_content": "For the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, our Operating proportionate property net operating income decreased by $1.0 million, or 1.1% as operations at Aimco properties were impacted by the pandemic and related restrictions. This decrease was attributable to a $0.4 million, or 0.3%, decrease in rental and other property revenues and a $0.6 million, or 1.4%, increase in property operating expenses.\n\nOther proportionate property net operating income increased by $3.9 million, or 78.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, due to the acquisition of 1001 Brickell Bay Drive in July 2019.\n\n## Non-Segment Real Estate Operations\n\nOperating  income  amounts  not  attributed  to  our  segments  include  property  management  costs,  casualty  losses,  and,  if  applicable,  the  results  of  apartment communities sold or held for sale, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  compared  to  2020,  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  increased  by  $6.7  million,  or  8.7%,  due  primarily  to additional assets being placed into service.\n\nFor the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  compared  to  2019,  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  increased  by  $13.9  million,  or  21.8%,  due  primarily  to depreciation and amortization of assets at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, acquired in July 2019, and The Hamilton, acquired in August 2020.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, general and administrative expenses increased by $22.7 million, or 216.7%, due primarily to lower allocation of expenses from Aimco Predecessor in 2020 as compared to the actual costs experienced running the separate business in 2021.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, general and administrative expenses increased $3.4 million, due primarily to audit and tax fees incurred as a separate legal entity and increased allocation of expenses from Aimco Predecessor.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, interest expense increased by $25.4 million, or 92.3% primarily due to interest associated with the Notes Payable to AIR entered into in conjunction with the Separation, which Notes Payable were funded on December 15, 2020.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs, increased $8.9 million due primarily to higher prepayment penalties and outstanding debt balances including the Notes Payable to AIR and debt related to the 2019 acquisition of Brickell.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment Income, Net\n\nOn November 26, 2019, Aimco Predecessor made a five-year, $275.0 million mezzanine loan to a partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments, located in southwest San Francisco. The loan is junior to a $1.5 billion first mortgage position and bears interest at a 10% annual rate, accruing if not paid from property operations. As discussed in Note 2, ownership of the subsidiary that originated and holds the note was retained by AIR, and AIR is obligated to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that hold this interest to us upon receipt of applicable third-party consent. As of December 31, 2021, the total receivable including accrued and unpaid  interest  was  $337.8  million.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  recognized  $30.4  million  of  income  in  connection  with  the  mezzanine  loan, compared to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\n## Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Options\n\nWe are required to adjust our interest rate options to fair value on a quarterly basis. As a result of the mark-to-market adjustment, we recorded an unrealized gain in the amount of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and we recorded an unrealized gain in the amount of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net, includes costs associated with our risk management activities, partnership administration expenses, valuation changes associated with equity investments, fee income, and certain other non-recurring items. For the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, other income (expense), net increased by $13.4 million due primarily to $8.0 million of fees earned related to specific acquisition and development services during the year ended December 31, 2021, with the remaining differences primarily being valuation changes in our investments in property technology funds consisting of privately held entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry.\n\nOther income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019 was relatively flat.\n\n## Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\n\nCertain  of  our  operations,  or  a  portion  thereof,  are  conducted  through  taxable  REIT  subsidiaries,  or  TRS  entities.  Additionally,  our  TRS  entities  hold investments in real estate.\n\nOur income tax benefit calculated in accordance with GAAP includes income taxes associated with the income or loss of our TRS entities. Income taxes, as well as changes in valuation allowance and incremental deferred tax items in conjunction with intercompany asset transfers and internal restructurings (if applicable), are included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nFor our TRS entities, deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for United States federal income tax purposes and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We reduce deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. We assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets through a review of the reversals of temporary differences, available tax planning  strategies,  future  taxable  income,  and  considering  all  available  positive  and  negative  evidence.  We  recognize  the  tax  consequences  associated  with intercompany transfers between Aimco Operating Partnership and TRS entities when such transactions occur. Please refer to Note 8 for further information about our income taxes.\n\nConsolidated GAAP income or loss subject to tax consists of pretax income or loss of our taxable entities and gains retained by the REIT. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net losses subject to tax of $31.4 million, compared to $25.5 million in 2020.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized income tax benefit of $13.6 million, compared to a benefit of $10.1 million during 2020. The change is due primarily to income tax benefit associated with internal restructuring, changes to our effective state rate expected to apply to the reversal of our existing deferred items, and higher losses at our TRS entities.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our loan agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our available liquidity was $394.6 million, which consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 $233.4 million in cash and cash equivalents;\n- \u00b7 $11.2 million of restricted cash, including amounts related to tenant security deposits and escrows held by lenders for capital additions, property taxes, and insurance; and\n- \u00b7 $150.0 million of available capacity to borrow under our revolving secured credit facility.\n\nWe have commitments for, and expect to spend, approximately $265.5 million on development and redevelopment projects, with $256.5 million undrawn on our construction loans. As of December 31, 2021, we had a commitment to fund an additional $14.2 million to IQHQ, which we funded subsequent to year end. We have unfunded commitments related to our real estate technology funds of $3.2 million, the timing of which is uncertain. Our principal uses for liquidity include normal  operating  activities,  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  outstanding  debt,  capital  expenditures,  and  future  investments.  Additionally,  our  third-party property managers may enter into commitments on our behalf to purchase goods or services in connection with the operation of our apartment communities and our office building. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to historical levels.\n\nWe  expect  to  fund  any  future  acquisitions,  redevelopment,  development,  and  other  capital  spending  principally  with  operating  cash  flows,  short-term borrowings, and debt and equity financing. Our near-term business plan does not contemplate the issuance of equity. We believe, based on the information available at this time, that we have sufficient cash on hand and access to additional sources of liquidity to meet our operational needs for 2022 and beyond.\n\nIn  the  event  that  our  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  revolving  secured  credit  facility,  and  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  are  not  sufficient  to  cover  our liquidity needs, we have the means to generate additional liquidity, such as from additional property financing activity and proceeds from apartment community sales. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including debt maturities, development and redevelopment spending, and future investment activity, primarily through property financing activity, cash generated from operations, and the recycling of Aimco equity. Our revolving secured credit facility matures in December 2023, prior to consideration of its two one-year extension options.\n\n## Leverage and Capital Resources\n\nThe availability and cost of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels, and financing is readily available. Any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We have taken steps to mitigate a portion of our repricing risk. However, if property or development financing options become unavailable, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in capital spending or apartment community dispositions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 41% of our leverage consisted of property-level, non-recourse, amortizing debt. Approximately 89% of our propertylevel  debt  is  fixed-rate,  which  provides  a  hedge  against  increases  in  interest  rates,  capitalization  rates,  and  inflation.  The  weighted-average  remaining  term  to maturity of our non-recourse property-level debt was 5.4 years at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.09%.\n\nWhile our primary source of leverage is property-level debt, we also have a credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions, Notes Payable to AIR, and construction loans. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving secured credit facility, swingline loan sub-facility and letter of credit sub-facility and had capacity to borrow up to $150.0 million. Under our revolving secured credit facility, we have agreed to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, minimum tangible net worth of $625.0 million, and maximum leverage of 60% as defined in the credit agreement. We are currently in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants.",

        "page_content": "On April  15,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  $150.0 million  variable-rate  non-recourse  construction  loan  collateralized  by  our  leasehold  interest  and  AIR's  fee ownership interest in Flamingo North Tower. The initial term of the loan is three years and bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 360 basis points subject to a minimum all-in per annum interest rate of 3.85%. As of December 31, 2021, we had $130.3 million of principal outstanding. Certain consolidated subsidiaries have indemnified AIR for any losses it incurs as a result of a default on the loan by Aimco. We recorded $3.8 million of deferred financing costs which will be amortized over the three-year term of the loan.\n\nOn June 21, 2021, we entered into a $100.7 million variable-rate non-recourse construction loan collateralized by our fee ownership interest in The Hamilton. The initial  term of the loan is three years and bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 320 basis points subject to a minimum all-in per annum interest rate of 3.45%. As of December 31, 2021, we had $38.1 million of principal outstanding. We recorded $2.3 million of deferred financing costs which will be amortized over the three-year term of the loan.\n\nChanges in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n\nThe following discussion relates to changes in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8 of this report.\n\n## Operating Activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $12.6 million. Our operating cash flow is primarily affected by rental rates, occupancy levels, operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment communities, and general and administrative costs. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased by $35.3 million compared to 2020 due to higher operating and general and administrative expenses.\n\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $10.1 million compared to 2019, due primarily to lower net cash contribution from our properties, which were negatively impacted by governmental measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and general and administrative and other increases related to the Separation, partially offset by the incremental contribution from properties acquired in 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased by $142.1 million compared to 2020, due primarily to capital expenditures and cash used in the purchase of The Benson Hotel, the Eldridge Townhomes, and construction costs on our development properties.\n\nCapital additions totaled $177.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. We generally fund capital additions with available cash and cash provided by operating activities, and construction loans.\n\nWe exclude the amounts of capital spending related to commercial spaces and to apartment communities sold or classified as held for sale at the end of the period from the foregoing measures. We have also excluded from these measures indirect capitalized costs, which are not yet allocated to communities with capital additions, and their related capital spending categories.\n\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $283.5 million compared to 2019, due primarily to the $277.6 million payment made by Aimco Predecessor on November 26, 2019, for the Mezzanine Investment. Adding to the decrease in cash used in investing was lower capital expenditures. The lower capital expenditures resulted from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic whereby temporary local restrictions halted construction activity at many apartment communities.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, decreased by $165.4 million compared to 2020, due primarily to the non-recurring $420.9 million investment received from Aimco Predecessor in connection with the Separation. The decrease was partially offset primarily by draws on construction loans, proceeds from non-recourse property loans, and lower principal repayments on non-recourse property debt.\n\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $9.9 million compared to 2019, due primarily to the $420.9 million investment from Aimco Predecessor. Partially offsetting this were higher principal payments on our non-recourse property debt, purchase of the interest rate options and deferred financing costs.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nWe use EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance. These key financial indicators are non-GAAP measures and are defined and described below. We provide",

        "page_content": "reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\nEarnings Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre)\n\nEBITDAre and Adjusted  EBITDAre  are  non-GAAP  measures,  which  we  believe  are  useful  to  investors,  creditors,  and  rating  agencies  as  a  supplemental measure of our ability to incur and service debt because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and allow for comparison of our credit strength to different companies. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of liquidity. There can be no assurance that our method of calculating EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Nareit defines EBITDAre as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, further adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 gains and losses on the dispositions of depreciated property;\n- \u00b7 impairment write-downs of depreciated property;\n- \u00b7 impairment  write-downs  of  investments  in  unconsolidated  partnerships  caused  by  a  decrease  in  the  value  of  the  depreciated  property  in  such partnerships; and\n- \u00b7 adjustments to reflect Aimco's share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities.\n\nEBITDAre is defined by Nareit and provides for an additional performance measure independent of capital structure for greater comparability between real estate  investment  trusts.  We  define  Adjusted  EBITDAre  as  EBITDAre  adjusted  to  exclude  the  effect  of  net  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  in consolidated  real  estate  partnerships  and  EBITDAre  adjustments  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests,  and  unrealized  gain  on  interest  rate  options,  which  we believe allow investors to compare a measure of our earnings before the effects of our capital structure and indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry. Additionally, we exclude interest income recognized on our Mezzanine Investment that was accrued but not paid.\n\nThe reconciliation  of  net  (loss)  income  to  EBITDAre  and  Adjusted  EBITDAre  for  the  years  ended  December 31, 2021,  2020,  and  2019,  is  as  follows  (in thousands):\n\n|                                                                                                    | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                                                    | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| Net (loss) income                                                                                  | $ (4,980)                 | $ (5,771)                 | $ 113                     |\n| Adjustments:                                                                                       |                           |                           |                           |\n| Interest expense                                                                                   | 52,902                    | 27,512                    | 18,598                    |\n| Income tax benefit                                                                                 | (13,570)                  | (10,149)                  | (3,301)                   |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                                                      | 84,712                    | 77,965                    | 64,030                    |\n| Impairments                                                                                        | -                         | 15,860                    | -                         |\n| Adjustment related to EBITDAre of unconsolidated partnerships                                      | 836                       | 848                       | 843                       |\n| EBITDAre                                                                                           | $ 119,900                 | $ 106,265                 | $ 80,283                  |\n| Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnership | (1,227)                   | 461                       | 206                       |\n| EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests                                      | (320)                     | (925)                     | (465)                     |\n| Mezzanine investment income, net (1)                                                               | (30,436)                  | (27,576)                  | (1,531)                   |\n| Unrealized (gains) losses on interest rate options                                                 | (6,509)                   | (1,058)                   | -                         |\n| Adjusted EBITDAre                                                                                  | $ 81,408                  | $ 77,167                  | $ 78,493                  |",

        "page_content": "## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nWe prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  which  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions.  We  believe  that  the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Capitalized Costs\n\nWe capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including developments, redevelopments, other tangible apartment community improvements, and replacements of existing community components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time  spent  by  employees  in  connection  with  the  planning,  execution,  and  control  of  all  capital  addition  activities  at  our  communities.  We  characterize  as 'indirect costs' an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital addition activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes, and insurance during periods in which redevelopments are in progress. We commence capitalization of costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital addition activities, at the point in time when activities necessary to get communities, apartment homes, or  leased  spaces  ready  for  their  intended  use  begin.  These  activities  include  when  communities,  apartment  homes,  or  leased  spaces  are  undergoing  physical construction, as well as when homes or leased spaces are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting, planning, and design are in progress. We cease the capitalization of costs when the communities or components thereof are substantially complete and ready for their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and homes or leased spaces are available for occupancy. We charge costs including ordinary repairs, maintenance, and resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nReal estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a sublease of office space within our corporate offices to AIR at then-current market rents. Based on an analysis  of  the  estimated  undiscounted  cash  flows  per  the  terms  of  the  sublease  arrangement,  we  evaluated  the  recoverability  of  the  assets  associated  with  the subleased space, including, the right-of-use asset, tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment and concluded the subleased assets were impaired. We recorded  an  impairment  charge  of  $11.0  million  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020.  There  were  no  such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2019.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a software license agreement with AIR to provide for the use of certain internally developed software at thencurrent market rates. Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relative to the carrying value of the internally developed software, we concluded the assets were impaired. Additionally, following an evaluation of the future service potential of certain other internal software that was under development, we ceased development and impaired the associated carrying value. We recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $4.9 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2019.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nUpon the acquisition of real estate, we determine whether the purchase qualifies as an asset acquisition or, less frequently, meets the definition of an acquisition of a business. We generally recognize the acquisition of apartment communities or interests in partnerships that own communities at our cost, including the related transaction costs, as asset acquisitions.\n\nWe allocate the cost of apartment communities acquired based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using valuation techniques that rely on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs within the fair value framework. We determine the fair value of tangible assets, such as land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment using valuation techniques that consider comparable market transactions, replacement costs and other available information. We determine the fair value of identified intangible assets or liabilities, which typically relate to in-place leases, using valuation techniques that consider the terms of the in-place leases, current market data for comparable leases and our experience in leasing similar communities.",

        "page_content": "The intangible assets or liabilities related to in-place leases are comprised of: (a) the value of the above- and below-market leases in-place, measured over the period, including probable lease renewals for below-market leases, that the leases are expected to remain in effect; (b) the estimated unamortized portion of avoided leasing commissions and other costs that ordinarily would be incurred to originate the in-place leases; and (c) the value associated with leased apartment homes during an estimated absorption period, which estimates rental revenue that would not have been earned had leased apartment homes been vacant at the time of acquisition, assuming lease-up periods based on market demand and stabilized occupancy levels. The above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to rental revenue over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases, which include reasonably assured renewal periods. Other intangible assets related to inplace leases are amortized to depreciation and amortization over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment\n\nPre-Separation, the Mezzanine Investment in the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments and related swaption were accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and a derivative, respectively. Post-Separation, the legal title to the loan investment and swaption remained with AIR, while we obtained the right to all  of  the  economics.  We  record  our  indirect  interest  in  the  mezzanine  loan  investment  in  the  Parkmerced  Apartments  in  'Mezzanine  investment'  on  our consolidated  balance  sheets,  and  our  income  earned  is  recognized  in  'Mezzanine  investment  income,  net'  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of operations. We recognize as income the net amounts earned on the mezzanine loan by AIR on its equity investment that are due to be paid to us when collected to the extent the income is supported by the change in AIR's claim to the to the net assets of the underlying borrower.  The income recognized primarily represents the interest accrued under the terms of the underlying mezzanine loan.\n\nOn a periodic basis, we evaluate our Mezzanine investment for impairment. We assess whether there are any indicators, including underlying property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of our investment may be impaired. An investment is considered impaired if we determine that its fair value is less than the net carrying value of the investment on an other-than-temporary basis. Cash flow projections for the investments consider property level factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. We consider various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity and relationships with our partners and banks. If we believe that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, no impairment charge is recorded. If our analysis indicates that there is an other-than temporary impairment related to the investment in a particular real estate venture, the carrying value of the venture will be adjusted to its estimated fair value.",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur chief market risks are refunding risk, that is the availability of property debt or other cash sources to refund maturing property debt, including the Notes Payable to AIR, and repricing risk, that is the possibility of increases in base interest rates and credit risk spreads. We use long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing, nonrecourse property debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short-term borrowings. We use working capital primarily to fund short-term uses. We make limited use of derivative financial instruments and we do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nAs of  December  31,  2021,  on  a  consolidated  basis,  we  had  $55.0  million  of  variable-rate  property-level  debt  outstanding  in  addition  to  two  variable  rate construction loans that totaled $168.4 million. We estimate that a change in 30-day LIBOR of 100 basis points with constant credit risk spreads would reduce or increase interest expense by approximately $2.2 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $244.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, a portion of which bears interest at variable rates.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of debt instruments as described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. The estimated fair value of total indebtedness, including our Notes Payable to AIR, was approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid an upfront premium of $12.1 million for the option to enter into a $1.5 billion notional amount interest rate swap at a future date. This interest rate option, or swaption, provides partial protection against exposure to rising interest rates between now and October 2024. We receive  a  cash  settlement  in  the  future  if  the  prevailing  interest  rate  is  higher  than  the  1.68%  strike  price  on  the  five-year  swap.  The  amount  of  a  future  cash settlement is capped if the prevailing interest rate exceeds 2.78%. Alternatively, if interest rates were to decrease below the specified strike price, we would not receive a cash settlement nor would we have any liability to make a payment.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid an upfront premium of $5.6 million (including transaction costs) for the option to enter into a $500.0 million notional amount interest rate swap at a future date. This interest rate option, or swaption, provides partial protection against our refinancing interest rate risk relative to our Notes Payable to AIR, and is intended to mitigate interest rate increases between now and January 2024. We receive a cash settlement in the future if the prevailing interest rate is higher than the 3% strike price on the five-year swap. Alternatively, if interest rates were to decrease below the specified strike price, we would not receive a cash settlement nor would we have any liability to make a payment.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we also paid an upfront premium of $0.3 million for interest rate caps for the entire amounts on our Flamingo and The Hamilton construction loans. These interest rate caps, provide protection if one month LIBOR exceeds 3% during the initial term of the loans.\n\n## ITEM 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Aimco\n\n## Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nAimco's management, with the participation of Aimco's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, Aimco's chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, Aimco's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nAimco's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.

During 2021, there were the following five committees: Audit; Compensation and Human Resources; Nominating, Environmental, Social, and  Governance; Investment; and Aimco-AIR Transactions. During 2021, no director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate total number of meetings of the Board and each committee on which such director served.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Guidelines, as described below, provide that the Company generally expects that the Chairman of the Board will attend all annual and special meetings of the stockholders. Other members of the Board are not required to attend such meetings. The Chairman of the Board attended the Company's 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and the Company anticipates that he will attend the Meeting this year.\n\nBelow is a table illustrating the current standing committee memberships and chairmen.

The Aimco-AIR Transactions Committee has a written charter that will be reviewed annually.\n\nThe Aimco-AIR Transactions Committee charter is posted on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com) and is also available in print to stockholders upon written request to Aimco's Corporate Secretary.\n\nThe Aimco-AIR Transactions Committee's responsibilities are set forth in the following chart.\n\n| Aimco-AIR Transactions Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Accomplished Since Formation in October 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Oversee all prospective contracts or transactions to be entered into by and between Aimco and AIR (each an 'Aimco-AIR Transaction') to ensure that all Aimco-AIR Transactions are on an arms-length basis and on commercially reasonable terms, and provide recommendations to the Board regarding the same. | \u2713                                              |\n| Review any proposed material modifications, extensions, and terminations (other than by the terms of an agreement) to any contract entered into between Aimco and AIR in connection with the separation of Aimco and AIR or since such time, and provide recommendations to the Board regarding the same.    | \u2713                                              |\n| Consider and make periodic recommendations to the Board with regard to the relationship between Aimco and AIR.                                                                                                                                                                                               | \u2713                                              |\n| Receive a regular report of all material activities between Aimco and AIR, including those pursuant to agreements approved and entered into at the time of the separation transaction.                                                                                                                       | \u2713                                              |\n| Exercise such additional powers and duties as may be reasonable, necessary, or desirable, in the Aimco-AIR Transactions Committee's discretion, to fulfill its duties under its charter.                                                                                                                     | \u2713                                              |\n| Perform such other functions as assigned by law, Aimco's charter or bylaws or the Board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | \u2713                                              |\n\nThe Aimco-AIR Transactions Committee was formed in October 2021, and meets as often as is necessary to carry out its duties and responsibilities.  The Committee has held two meetings since the Committee's formation in October 2021.\n\n## Board Composition, Board Refreshment, and Director Tenure\n\nAimco  is  focused  on  having  a  well-constructed  and  high  performing  board.  To  that  end,  the  Nominating,  Environmental,  Social,  and  Governance Committee selects nominees for director based on, among other things, breadth and depth of experience, knowledge, skills, expertise, integrity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, understanding of Aimco's business environment, diversity of perspective and background, and willingness to devote adequate time and effort  to  Board  responsibilities.  In  considering  nominees  for  director,  the  Nominating,  Environmental,  Social,  and  Governance  Committee  seeks  to  have  a diverse range of experience and expertise relevant to Aimco's business. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee places a premium on directors who work well in the collegial and collaborative nature of the Board (which is also consistent with the Aimco culture) and also requires directors who think and act independently and can clearly and effectively communicate their convictions. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee assesses the appropriate balance of criteria required of directors and makes recommendations to the Board.\n\nThe Nominating,  Environmental,  Social,  and  Governance  Committee  has  specifically  considered  the  feedback  of  some  stockholders  as  well  as  the discussions of some commentators that suggest lengthy board tenure should be balanced with new perspectives. Specific to Aimco, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee has structured the Board such that there are directors of varying tenures, with new directors and perspectives joining the Board every few years while retaining the institutional memory of longer-tenured directors. Longer-tenured directors, balanced with less-tenured directors, enhance the Board's  oversight  capabilities.  Aimco's  directors  work  effectively  together,  coordinate  closely  with  senior  management,  comprehend  Aimco's  challenges  and opportunities, and frame Aimco's business strategy.",

        "page_content": "When formulating its Board membership recommendations, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee also considers advice and recommendations from others, including stockholders, as it deems appropriate. Such recommendations are evaluated based on the same criteria noted above. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee will consider as nominees to the Board for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders persons who are recommended by stockholders in writing, marked to the attention of Aimco's corporate Secretary, no later than July 1, 2022.\n\nThe Board is responsible  for  nominating  members  for  election  to  the  Board  and  for  filling  vacancies  on  the  Board  that  may  occur  between  annual meetings of stockholders.\n\n## Board Leadership Structure\n\nIn  connection  with  the  Separation,  the  Board  concluded  that  separating  the  Chairman  and  CEO  role  would  be  most  effective  for  the  Company's leadership and governance. Mr. Miller serves as Chairman of the Board, which includes: presiding over executive sessions of the Independent Directors, which are held regularly and not less than four times per year; with the CEO, setting meeting agendas and schedules; calling meetings of the Independent Directors; and being available for direct communication with stockholders.\n\nThe Board has a majority of independent directors. Eight out of the ten directors are independent. The Audit, Compensation and Human Resources, Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance, and Aimco-AIR Transactions Committees are composed solely of independent directors.\n\n## Separate Sessions of Independent Directors\n\nAimco's  Corporate  Governance  Guidelines  (described  below)  provide  that  the  non-management  directors  shall  meet  in  executive  session  without management on a regularly scheduled basis, but no less than four times per year. The non-management directors, which group currently is made up of the eight Independent Directors, met in executive session without management five times during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe following table sets forth the number of meetings held by the Board and each committee during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                       |   Board |   Non- Management Directors |   Audit Committee |   Compensation and Human Resources Committee |   Nominating, Environmental, Social, and  Governance Committee |   Investment Committee | Aimco-AIR Transactions Committee   |\n|-----------------------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Number of Meetings... |       4 |                           5 |                 8 |                                            6 |                                                              4 |                      4 | 0*                                 |\n\n## Majority Voting for the Election of Directors\n\nIn an uncontested election at the meeting of stockholders, any nominee to serve as a director of the Company will be elected if the director receives a majority of votes cast, which means that the number of shares voted 'for' a director exceeds the number of shares voted 'against' that director. With respect to a contested election, a plurality of all the votes cast at the meeting of stockholders will be sufficient to elect a director. The following is not considered votes cast 'for' or 'against' a director nominee: (a) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention and (b) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to with a stockholder gives no direction. If a nominee who currently is serving as a director receives a greater number of 'against' votes for his or her election than votes 'for' such election (a 'Majority Against Vote') in an uncontested election, Maryland law provides that the director would continue to serve on the Board as a 'holdover director.' However, under Aimco's Bylaws, any nominee for election as a director in an uncontested election who receives a Majority Against Vote is obligated to tender his or her resignation to the Board for consideration following certification of the vote. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee will consider any resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept it. The Board is required to take action with respect to the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. Additional details are set out in Article II, Section 2.03 (Election and Tenure of Directors; Resignations) of Aimco's Bylaws.\n\n## Proxy Access\n\nAt our 2015 annual meeting, a proxy access stockholder proposal received the support of a majority of the votes cast. That proposal requested the Board to adopt a bylaw that would require the Company to include in its proxy materials nominees for director proposed by a stockholder or group that owns at least 3% of our outstanding shares for at least three years. Following that meeting, through the summer and fall of 2015 and into 2016, we engaged in extensive stockholder outreach and discussed proxy access with stockholders representing over 66% of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of September 30, 2015, including all ten of Aimco's largest stockholders as of that date.",

        "page_content": "Although our stockholders expressed varying views on proxy access generally, and on the specific terms of a proxy access bylaw, many stockholders indicated that they viewed proxy access as an important stockholder right. At the same time, many stockholders expressed concern that stockholders with a small economic interest could abuse proxy access and impose unnecessary costs on the Company. In particular, stockholders expressed support for a reasonable limit on the number of stockholders who could come together to form a nominating group, with a consensus around a 20 stockholder limit, so long as certain related funds were counted  as  one  stockholder  for  this  purpose.  In  addition,  many  stockholders  expressed  support  for  the  principle  that  a  proxy  access  bylaw  provide  for  a minimum of two candidates, with that principle being more meaningful to stockholders than the percentage of the board used to calculate the number of permitted proxy access candidates.\n\nStockholders expressed general flexibility concerning most other proxy access terms, including counting directors nominated as access candidates who are elected and re-nominated by the Board when determining the limit on access candidates for a limited number of years, and eliminating proxy access at the same annual meeting for which a nomination notice outside of proxy access has been submitted by another stockholder. Also, stockholders indicated that post-meeting holding requirements would be considered overly restrictive, but that a statement regarding post-meeting intentions that did not require continued ownership was acceptable.\n\nThe feedback received from stockholders was reported to the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee and to the Board. Following a review of that feedback, corporate governance best practices and trends and the Company's particular facts and circumstances, the Board amended the Company's bylaws to provide a proxy access right to stockholders. As a result, a stockholder or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of our shares for at least three years, may submit nominees for up to 20% of the Board, or two nominees, whichever is greater, for inclusion in our proxy materials, subject to complying with the requirements contained in our bylaws.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nThe Board has adopted a code of ethics  entitled  'Code  of  Business  Conduct  and  Ethics'  that  applies  to  the  members  of  the  Board,  all  of  Aimco's executive officers and all teammates of Aimco or its subsidiaries, including Aimco's principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer.  The  Code  of  Business  Conduct  and  Ethics  is  posted  on  Aimco's  website  (www.aimco.com)  and  is  also  available  in  print  to  stockholders,  upon  written request to Aimco's Corporate Secretary. If, in the future, Aimco amends, modifies, or waives a provision in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, rather than filing a Current Report on Form 8-K, Aimco intends to satisfy any applicable disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K by posting such information on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com), as necessary.\n\n## Corporate Governance Guidelines and Director Stock Ownership\n\nThe Board has adopted and approved Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines, which were last updated in April 2021, are available  on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com) and are also available in print to stockholders, upon written request to Aimco's Corporate Secretary. In general, the Corporate Governance Guidelines address director qualification standards, director responsibilities, the role of the Chairman of the Board or Lead Independent Director, as applicable, director access to management and independent advisors, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, the role of the Board in planning management succession, stock ownership guidelines and retention requirements, and an annual performance evaluation of the Board.\n\nWith respect to stock ownership guidelines for the Independent Directors, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that by the completion of five years of service from the date of the Separation or from joining the Board, whichever is later, an Independent Director is expected to own shares having a value of at least  $375,000. Due to the Separation and recent board refreshment, the Independent Directors are not yet required to have holdings in this amount. All of the Independent Directors except for Mr. Allen and Ms. Smith have holdings in excess of this amount as of February 28, 2022.\n\n## Corporate Responsibility\n\nAt Aimco, corporate responsibility is an important part of our business. As with all other aspects of our business, our corporate responsibility program focuses on continuous improvement, to the benefit of our stockholders, our residents, our teammates, our communities, and the environment. We actively discuss these matters with our stockholders and solicit their feedback on our program.\n\nFor more information on Aimco's corporate responsibility program, please refer to Aimco's 2020-21 Corporate Responsibility Report, which is available on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com).",

The Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the 'Committee') and Aimco management remain committed to extensive engagement with stockholders as part of ongoing efforts to formulate and implement an executive compensation program designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our  stockholders.  In  2021  and  early  2022,  we  engaged  with  stockholders  representing  approximately  65%  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  outstanding  as  of September  30,  2021,  as  part  of  our  annual  process  of  soliciting  feedback  on  Aimco's  executive  compensation  program.  The  following  chart  summarizes  the collective feedback we received, and actions we have taken in response.\n\n| Stockholder Feedback                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Action Taken                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall Program. The  Company  received  broad  support  from  stockholders  on  the  structure  of  its  post Separation  executive  compensation  program,  the  program's  alignment  of  pay  and performance, and the quantum of compensation delivered under the program. | Based on the broad support received from stockholders, the Company made no changes to the overall structure of the program.                           |\n| Disclosure. Stockholders  appreciated  the  thorough  disclosure  and  encouraged  Aimco  to  continue  the same level of disclosure.                                                                                                                                           | The Company has continued the same level of disclosure as prior years.                                                                                |\n| STI Plan. Stockholders are broadly pleased with the STI plan goals and disclosure of results.                                                                                                                                                                                   | The 2022 STI plan has similar  goals  and  the  Company  will  continue  to  provide  thorough disclosure of results.                                 |\n| LTI Plan. The Company's  post  Separation  three-year,  forward  looking  plan  measured  upon  relative TSR compared to the Russell 2000 Value Index, the FTSE Nareit Equity Apartments Index, and Aimco's development peers received broad support from stockholders.         | Given that the Company's LTI plan metrics received broad support from stockholders, the Company did not make changes to its LTI plan metrics in 2022. |",

        "page_content": "## Overview of Aimco's Pay-for-Performance Philosophy and 2021 Performance Results\n\nAimco is a pay-for-performance organization. Aimco starts by setting target total compensation near the median of target total compensation for Aimco's peers as identified below, both as a measure of fairness and also to provide an economic incentive to remain with Aimco. Actual compensation varies from target compensation based on Aimco's results. Each officer's annual cash incentive compensation, 'short term incentive' or STI, is based in part on Aimco's performance against corporate, rather than personal, goals. The more senior the officer, the greater the percentage of his or her STI that is based on Aimco's performance against its  corporate  goals.  Aimco's  longer  term  compensation,  'long  term  incentive'  or  LTI,  follows  a  similar  tiered  structure.  Each  officer's  LTI  is  based  in  part  on relative 'total stockholder return' or TSR, with NEOs having a greater share of their LTI based on relative TSR. In the case of Mr. Powell, his entire LTI award is 'at risk' based on Aimco's relative TSR. LTI is measured and vests over time, so that officers bear longer term exposure to the decisions they make.\n\nTo reinforce alignment of stockholder and management interests, Aimco also has stock ownership guidelines that require substantial equity holdings by executive officers, as described further below.\n\nAimco had 46.2% TSR in 2021. The following graph compares cumulative total returns for Aimco's Common Stock, the Russell 2000 Value Index, the FTSE Nareit Equity Apartments Index, and Aimco's development peers. The graph assumes the investment of $100 in Aimco's Common Stock and in each index on December 31, 2020, and that all dividends paid have been reinvested.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                         | For the fiscal years ended December 31,   | For the fiscal years ended December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Index                                   | 2020                                      | 2021                                      |\n| Aimco (1)                               | $ 100.00                                  | $ 146.21                                  |\n| Russell 2000 Value Total Return (2)     | 100.00                                    | 128.27                                    |\n| FTSE Nareit Equity Apartments Index (3) | 100.00                                    | 163.61                                    |\n| Peer Group (1)                          | 100.00                                    | 136.24                                    |",

A significant portion of executive pay is not guaranteed, but rather is at risk and tied to key financial and value creation metrics that are set in advance and disclosed to stockholders. All of the incentive compensation (both STI and LTI) for Mr. Powell is subject to the achievement of various performance objectives. For the other NEOs, all STI compensation, and two-thirds of target LTI compensation is subject to the achievement of various performance objectives. |\n| Balances  short-term  and  long-term  incentives.  The  incentive  programs  provide  a  balance  of  annual  and  longer-term  incentives,  with  LTI  compensation  vesting  over multiple years comprising a substantial percentage of target total compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| These mitigate the risk of the undue influence of a single metric by utilizing multiple performance measures.

In setting Mr. Powell's target total compensation for 2021, the Committee considered, among other things, the peer group compensation data as discussed below and Mr. Powell's relevant expertise and experience. Because Mr. Powell was new to his position, the Committee set his target total compensation at approximately 80% of the median for the peer group. The Committee devised a compensation plan for Mr. Powell that resulted in approximately 29% base salary, 29% based on Aimco's performance against its 2021 corporate goals, and 42% based on relative TSR. Mr. Powell's target compensation mix is illustrated as follows:\n\nHow the Committee determines the amount of target total compensation for executive officers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to reviewing the performance of, and determining the compensation for, the CEO, the Committee also reviews and approves the decisions made by the CEO as to the compensation of Aimco's other executive officers.

For example, if an executive's target STI was $400,000 and weighted 50% on KPIs, then 50% of that amount, or $200,000, varied based on KPI results and 50% of that amount, or $200,000, varied based on MAP results. As actual KPI results were 126.75% of target in 2021, then the executive would receive 126.75% of $200,000 ($253,500) for the KPI portion of her STI, and if MAP results were 100%, such hypothetical executive would receive 100% of the $200,000, for a total STI payment of $453,500.\n\nAimco's 2021 KPIs reflected Aimco's publicly communicated areas of strategic focus, as set forth below. Specifically, Aimco's KPIs consisted of the following six corporate goals that were reviewed with, and approved by, the Committee, each weighted as described.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese goals aligned executive officers with the long-term goals of the Company without encouraging them to take unnecessary and excessive risks.

        "page_content": "An explanation of the objective of each goal and performance levels and payouts for each goal is set forth below.\n\nNOI Achievement of Stabilized Portfolio (10% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objective of driving rent growth for its stabilized portfolio based on high levels of resident retention, through superior customer selection and satisfaction, coupled with disciplined innovation resulting in sustained cost control, to maximize NOI margins. For 2021, the range for the NOI achievement goal was as follows: 'Threshold' equated to achievement of five percent unfavorable to 2021 budgeted NOI; 'Target' equated to achievement of 2021 budgeted NOI; and 'Maximum' equated to five percent favorable to 2021 budgeted  NOI.  The  Company's  stabilized  portfolio  NOI  for  2021  was  more  than  5%  favorable  to  budgeted  NOI.  This  resulted  in  a  payout  on  the  NOI achievement goal of 20.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nDevelopment and Redevelopment Execution (35% of KPI) . The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Company's strategic objective of executing active  development,  redevelopment,  and lease-up  projects  pursuant  to  the  Company's  2021  budget  and  plan.  Large  and/or  complex  projects  provided  increased weighting toward the total goal weighting of 35%, with smaller scale projects provided lower weighting toward the total goal weighting. Achievement for each project  was  determined  with  reference  to  the  2021  budgeted  investment  and  plan  for  the  project,  and  was  based  on  the  extent  to  which  the  project  work  was completed on time and within budget, as well as, where applicable, the extent to which year-end occupancy and rental rates were consistent with the 2021 budget and plan. In 2021, the Company invested $215M of capital across eight development and redevelopment projects with each remaining on time, on budget, and on plan. The Company executed more than 630 leases on newly constructed and delivered apartment homes, nearly 200 more than planned at the start of 2021 and at rental rates averaging approximately 115% of target. Year-end occupancy for 2021 was also ahead of target. These outcomes resulted in a payout on this goal of 43.75% for each of the NEOs.\n\nNew Value-Add, Opportunistic, and Alternative Investments (10% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objective of securing new value-add and opportunistic investment opportunities, including development, redevelopment, acquisitions, programmatic joint ventures, debt placements, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements. In 2021, the Company commenced two new development and redevelopment projects. Specifically, the Company began the development of Oak Shore, consisting of 16 luxury single family rental homes plus eight accessory dwelling units in Corte Madera, CA. The project is on schedule and on budget, with deliveries expected beginning in 2023 and stabilization in 2025. The Company also began the major redevelopment of Hamilton on the Bay in the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami, FL. The project is on schedule and on budget, with apartment homes targeted to come back online in 2022 and stabilization targeted for 2024.  Additionally, the Company sourced and secured new investments that provide the opportunity for over 4.5M square feet and more than $1B of highly accretive development in dynamic, high-growth markets. Specifically, the Company acquired eight properties adjacent to Hamilton on the Bay for $19M. Combined with the land purchased as part of the initial acquisition of Hamilton on the Bay, the Company can, in total, now construct more than 1.1M square feet of new development in this rapidly growing submarket. The Company entered into a joint venture with Kushner Companies to purchase three undeveloped land parcels located in Fort Lauderdale, FL. The total contract price for the land was $49M ($25M at Aimco's 51% share), and current zoning allows for  the  development  of  approximately  3M  square  feet  of  multi-family  homes  and  commercial  space.  The  land  purchase  closed  in  January  2022.  The  Company purchased for $4M seven acres of developable land in Colorado Springs, CO that allows for the development of up to 119 apartment homes and townhomes. The Company acquired, for $40M, Eldridge Townhomes, a 58-unit townhome community located in Elmhurst, IL that the Company developed between 2018 and 2020. Eldridge Townhomes is located adjacent to an existing 400-unit Aimco community and the acquisition provides for continued operational efficiencies and improved NOI margins. The Company purchased, for $6.2M, 1.5 acres of fully entitled land on the Anschutz Medical and Life Sciences Campus in Aurora, CO plus options allowing  for  the  purchase  of  an  additional  5.2  acres  that  will  accommodate  more  than  750K  square  feet  of  new  development.  The  1.5  acre  site  is  now  being developed as The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club and represents a critical step in advancement of the campus masterplan. Finally, the Company made a $0.5M passive  equity  investment  in  Camber  Creek,  a  strategic  venture  capital  firm  focused  on  investing  in  real  estate  technology  companies.  These new investments resulted in a payout on this goal of 15.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nBalance Sheet and Financing Activity (30% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill the Company's strategic objectives of securing new financings and maintaining abundant liquidity. In 2021, the Company closed over $360M in new financings. Specifically, we closed a $150M loan secured by our leasehold interest in the North Tower at Flamingo Point. The initial term of the loan is three years with two one-year extension options at an interest rate floating at One Month LIBOR plus 360 bps. The floating interest rate has a 3.85% floor. Loan proceeds are being used to fund the completion of construction of the North Tower at Flamingo Point and other investment activity. The Company closed a $101M construction loan for the redevelopment of Hamilton on the Bay. The initial term of the loan is three years with two one-year extension options at an interest rate floating at One Month LIBOR plus 320 bps. The floating interest rate has a 3.45%  floor.  Additionally,  the  Company  closed  a  $52M  preferred  equity  commitment  from  an  institutional  equity  partner  to  partially  fund  the  Upton  Place development in Washington, D.C., freeing up Aimco capital for other accretive uses and improving the expected return on Aimco equity. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $395M of liquidity, including cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility. This resulted in a payout on the balance sheet goal of 35.00% for each of the NEOs.",

The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Aimco's strategic objective of fostering a healthy environment of respect and innovation, empowering our human capital to create value. For 2021, Aimco's stated goal was zero voluntary turnover at the officer level and overall team engagement of 4.20 out of 5. Every teammate is surveyed via a third-party, confidential survey on his or her annual anniversary of employment. The team engagement score consists of the average of the responses to the questions that comprise the engagement index, on a scale of 1 to 5, for all teammates who complete the survey during the year. For 2021, Aimco's team engagement score was a 4.21 out of 5. Aimco also met its stated goal of zero voluntary turnover at the officer level.  However, Aimco had higher than expected turnover below the officer level due to the transition resulting from the Separation and market conditions. The team was largely stabilized as of year-end. This resulted in a payout on the human capital goal of 8.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (5% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Aimco's strategic objective of continuing our commitment to the communities in which we work, live, and invest by building apartment communities with conservation and sustainability in mind and giving back to the community by way of Aimco's philanthropic program, Aimco Cares, both in monetary support and through volunteerism.  In 2021, Aimco updated is ESG policies following the Separation and published a Corporate Responsibility Report reflecting its ESG priorities and performance. In 2021, Aimco obtained LEED Gold certification of its previously completed development of Parc Mosaic in Boulder, Colorado. Additionally, Aimco's current development of Oak Shore in Corte Madera, CA is being built to LEED Gold standards, and its current development of Upton Place is being built to LEED Silver standards and Fitwel Wellness, and includes a 267kW Solar Power Farm. Aimco was recognized by the Denver Post as a top workplace in Colorado and by the Washington Post as a top workplace in the Washington, D.C., area, and was recognized by the Denver Business Journal as one of the Denver Area's healthiest employers. Aimco raised $412,000 through its Charity Golf Classic, benefitting military veterans and providing scholarships for students in affordable housing, and Aimco teammates volunteered their time to multiple charitable causes throughout the year. This resulted in a payout on the ESG goal of 5.00% for each of the NEOs.\n\nDue to Aimco's overall achievement on each of its 2021 goals, Aimco's overall KPI performance was 126.75%.  Accordingly, each NEO was awarded 126.75% of the portion of his or her target STI attributable to KPI.\n\nVarious of the key financial indicators we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are nonGAAP measures. Key non-GAAP measures we use are defined, described and, where appropriate, reconciled to the most comparable financial measures computed in accordance with GAAP under the Non-GAAP Measures heading within Part II, Item 7 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards for 2021\n\nUnder the 2021 LTI program for executive officers, three forms of LTI awards were granted to NEOs on April 28, 2021, as follows: (1) performancebased restricted stock, which was granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, representing 50% of the 2021 LTI awards for Mr. Powell and two-thirds of the 2021 LTI awards for Mses. Stanfield and Johnson; (2) performance-based stock options, which were granted to Mr. Powell, representing 50% of his 2021 LTI awards; and (3) time-based restricted stock, which was granted to Mses.

Aimco refers to the performance-based restricted stock and the performance-based stock options as 'performance-based LTI awards' because the amount of restricted stock and stock options that vest, if any, is determined based on Aimco's relative TSR performance during a forward looking, three-year performance period, as described in detail below.\n\nThe Committee typically sets grant dates for LTI awards at the time of its final compensation determination, generally in late January or early February. Due to the Separation and the additional time taken to create a new executive compensation plan for post-Separation Aimco, the Committee granted 2021 LTI on April 28, 2021. In order to keep the NEOs whole, the Committee awarded 2021 LTI using the closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock and the third-party valuation, as applicable, as of January 27, 2021, the date upon which the Committee would have normally made the awards.",

Stanfield and Johnson, the dollar amount allocated to restricted stock was divided by $4.17 per share, which price was calculated by a third party financial firm with particular expertise in the valuation of performance-based restricted stock. The share award agreements to which the performance-based restricted shares were granted do not provide for the  payment  of  dividends,  if  any,  until  the  shares  are  earned.  Dividends,  if  any,  accrue  during  the  performance  period.  The  number  of  shares  subject  to  the performance-based stock options to be granted to Mr. Powell were determined based on a valuation calculated by a third party financial firm with particular expertise in the valuation of options, taking into account the number of stock options that would have been awarded based on the valuation of a stock option on January 27, 2021, the date of the Committee meeting at which 2021 LTI awards would have been granted but for the Separation and the additional time taken to create a new executive compensation plan for post-Separation Aimco. The stock options as granted had an exercise price of $6.66, which was the closing price of Aimco's stock on the grant date of April 28, 2021, and equal to the fair market value of Aimco's Common Stock on the grant date.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating  the  number  of  shares  of  time-based  restricted  stock  to  be  granted  to  Mses.

The Committee determined Mr. Powell's STI for 2021 would be based entirely on Aimco's performance against corporate goals, described  above.  The  Committee  calculated  Mr.  Powell's  STI  by  multiplying  his  STI  target  of  $525,000  by  126.75%,  which  was  the  Committee's  payout determination having reviewed Aimco's overall performance against corporate goals, as described in detail above. The Committee granted Mr. Powell's LTI in the form of restricted stock and stock options on April 28, 2021, for the three-year performance period from January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023; the LTI grant is  entirely  at  risk,  based  on  relative  returns  over  the  performance  period.  Mr.  Powell's  2021  target  compensation  and  incentive  compensation  is  summarized  as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOther NEO Compensation. For Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, an allocation of the target STI was made as follows: 50% of the target STI was calculated based on Aimco's performance against KPI and 50% of the target STI was calculated based on each executive's achievement of her individual MAP goals. As described above, Aimco's KPI performance was 126.75%. Accordingly, each was awarded 126.75% of the portion of her STI attributable to KPI.",

The Committee reviewed and approved Mr. Powell's determinations with respect to Mses. Stanfield and Johnson. As described above, LTI for Mses.

As part of the 2019 LTI program, the Company granted performance-share awards that might be earned based on relative TSR as compared to the FTSE Nareit Equity Apartments Index (60% weighting) and the MSCI US REIT Index (40% weighting) over a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2021, with awards vesting 50% following the end of the three-year performance period (based on attainment of TSR targets) and 50% one year later, for a four-year plan from start to finish. On February 2, 2022, the Committee determined that Aimco's three-year TSR (combined with AIR's TSR for the period from December 15, 2020, through December 31, 2021, as described in the chart below) was 860 basis points lower than  the  FTSE  Nareit  Equity  Apartments  Index  and  140  basis  points  higher  than  the  MSCI  US  REIT  Index  for  the  three-year  performance  period  ending  on December 31, 2021, resulting in the number of shares being earned at 48% of target for Mr. Powell and Ms. Stanfield. Factoring in the portion of 2019 LTI that was for the purpose of retention, the realized LTI compensation for Mr. Powell and Ms. Stanfield was 65% of target.\n\nThe  chart  below  summarizes  the  results  for  the  2019  performance  share  awards,  and  provides  performance  as  of  December  31,  2021,  for  the  'in progress' 2021 and 2020 and performance share awards.\n\n(2)\n\n| TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   | TSR-Based Long Term Incentive Plan Award Status   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Three-Year Performance Period                     | 2017                                              | 2018                                              | 2019                                              | 2020                                              | 2021                                              | 2022                                              | 2023                                              | Status                                            | CEO % Payout (1)                                  | Other NEOs                                        |\n| 2021 - 2023                                       |                                                   |                                                   |                                                   |                                                   | 33% Completed                                     | 33% Completed                                     | 33% Completed                                     | Tracking Between Target and Maximum               | 129% (3)                                          | 119% (3)                                          |\n| 2020 - 2022                                       |                                                   |                                                   |                                                   | 67% Completed                                     | 67% Completed                                     | 67% Completed                                     |                                                   | Tracking Between Target and Maximum               | 116% (3) (4)                                      | 111% (3) (4)                                      |\n| 2019 - 2021                                       |                                                   |                                                   | 100% Completed                                    | 100% Completed                                    | 100% Completed                                    |                                                   |                                                   | Payout Achieved Between Threshold and Target      | 48% (4)                                           | 65% (4)                                           |\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

        "page_content": "## Other Compensation\n\nFrom time to time, Aimco determines to provide executive officers with additional compensation in the form of discretionary cash or equity awards.\n\nOn April 15, 2021, Aimco awarded each of Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson restricted stock awards as follows:  Mr. Powell - 371,901 shares, with an approximate fair market value at the grant date of $2.36 million; Ms. Stanfield - 247,934 shares, with an approximate fair market value at the grant date of $1.57 million; and Ms. Johnson - 175,984 shares, with an approximate fair market value at the grant date of $1.12 million.  These one-time grants, which vest 50% at the end of four years from the date of grant and 50% at the end of five years from the date of grant, were provided in connection with the executive officers' newly appointed positions following the Separation, for the express purpose of retention, and to align the long-term interests of the executive officers with those of the Company's stockholders.\n\n## Post-Employment Compensation and Employment and Severance Arrangements\n\n## 401(k) Plan\n\nAimco provides a 401(k) plan that is offered to all Aimco teammates. In 2021, Aimco matched 25% of participant contributions to the extent of the first 4% of the participant's eligible compensation. For 2021, the maximum match by Aimco was $2,900, which was the amount that Aimco matched for each of Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson's 2021 401(k) contributions. Aimco provided an additional discretionary match in the amount of $2,260 to all teammates in 2022 for Aimco's  achievement of greater than 125% on its 2021 corporate goals.\n\nOther than the 401(k) plan, Aimco does not provide post-employment benefits. Aimco does not maintain a defined benefit pension plan, a supplemental executive retirement plan, or any other similar arrangements.\n\n## Executive Employment Arrangements\n\n2021 Powell Employment Agreement . On October 27, 2021, Aimco Development Company, LLC, an affiliate of the Company and the employer entity for  Aimco's employees, entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Powell (the '2021 Employment Agreement'). The Committee evaluated the terms of the 2021 Employment Agreement in comparison to those of the CEOs of Aimco's peers. The 2021 Employment Agreement is for a term expiring on December 31, 2022. The 2021 Employment Agreement provides that on December 31, 2022, and on each subsequent one-year anniversary thereafter, the agreement shall be renewed for an additional one-year term unless either party gives written notice of intent not to renew to the other party at least 60 days before the end of the then calendar year.\n\nThe 2021 Employment Agreement provides for a base salary of $525,000, a target annual short-term incentive award opportunity of $525,000, and a target  long-term  incentive  award  opportunity  of  $750,000  for  2021.  The  2021  Employment  Agreement  provides  that  the  Committee  shall  review  and  set  Mr. Powell's  target  total  compensation  on  an  annual  basis  in  comparison  to  compensation  paid  to  the  Company's  peers,  taking  into  consideration  experience, performance, and other relevant factors.\n\nPursuant to the 2021 Employment Agreement, upon termination of Mr. Powell's employment by Aimco Development Company, LLC without cause, or by Mr. Powell for good reason, Mr. Powell is generally entitled to: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of (i) his annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) his target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination; (b) any short-term incentive bonus earned but unpaid for a prior fiscal year (the 'Prior Year STI'); (c) a pro-rata portion of the short-term incentive bonus he would have earned for the year in which the termination occurs, based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance targets (the 'Pro Rata STI'); and (d) an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium  for  health  and  welfare  plan  coverage  for  Mr.  Powell  and  his  coverage  dependents  in  effect  on  the  date  of  termination  (the  'monthly  COBRA reimbursement') multiplied  by 24 months. The vesting and exercise  of any equity  awards held  Mr. Powell on the date  of  termination  would  be  determined  in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nIn the event of termination of Mr. Powell's employment by Aimco without cause, or by Mr. Powell for good reason, in either case, within the period commencing six months prior to and ending 24 months following a 'Change in Control' (as defined in the 2021 Employment Agreement), then in lieu of the severance benefits described above, Mr. Powell will be entitled to: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to three times the sum of (i) his annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) his target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination; (b) the Prior Year STI; (c) the Pro Rata STI; (d) the monthly COBRA reimbursement multiplied by 36 months; and (e) 100% accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards then-held by Mr. Powell.",

The vesting and exercise of any equity awards held by Mr. Powell at the time of his death or disability would be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nIn the event that any payment or benefit payable to Mr. Powell under the 2021 Employment Agreement would result in the imposition of excise taxes under the 'golden parachute' provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will either be made and/or provided in full or  will  be  reduced  such  that  the  excise  tax  under  Section  280G  is  not  applicable,  whichever  is  least  economically  disadvantageous  to  Mr.  Powell.  The  2021 Employment Agreement does not provide for any excise tax or other tax 'gross-up' payment.\n\nAll severance payments and benefits under the 2021 Employment Agreement are subject to applicable withholding obligations, Mr. Powell's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, and compliance with certain non-competition, non-disclosure, and non-solicitation covenants.\n\nNeither Ms. Stanfield nor Ms. Johnson has an employment agreement.\n\n## Executive Severance Arrangements\n\nAimco has an executive severance policy that provides that Aimco shall seek stockholder approval or ratification of any future severance agreement for any senior executive officer that provides for benefits, such as lump-sum or future periodic cash payments or new equity awards, in an amount in excess of 2.99 times such executive officer's base salary and bonus. Compensation and benefits earned through the termination date, the value of vesting or payment of any equity awards outstanding prior to the termination date, pro rata vesting of any other long-term awards, or benefits provided under plans, programs or arrangements that are applicable to one or more groups of employees in addition to senior executives are not subject to the policy. It has been Aimco's longstanding practice not to provide excessive severance arrangements.\n\nExecutive Severance Policy . On February 22, 2018, the Committee adopted the Apartment Investment and Management Company Executive Severance Policy (the 'Executive Severance Policy'). The Executive Severance Policy superseded and replaced any employment agreement or other plan, policy or practice involving  the  payment  of  severance  benefits  to  participants  under  the  Executive  Severance  Policy.  On  April  28,  2021,  the  Committee  amended  the  Executive Severance Policy in accordance with recommendations provided by the Committee's compensation consultant to bring the policy in line with market. On October 27,  2021,  the  Committee  amended  the  Executive  Severance  Policy  to  remove  severance  provisions  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  in  connection  with  the Committee's approval of an employment agreement for Mr. Powell that includes  severance  provisions  that  are  consistent  with  the  severance  to  which  he  may otherwise become entitled under the Executive Severance Policy. The Company's Executive Vice Presidents, as determined on the records of the Company and any other entities through which the operations of the Company are conducted, are eligible to participate in the Executive Severance Policy. Each of Mses. Stanfield and Johnson are participants under the Executive Severance Policy.\n\nThe Executive Severance Policy provides that if the Company terminates a participant's employment without 'Cause,' or if the participant terminates his or her employment for 'Good Reason' (each as defined in the Executive Severance Policy), then the participant will be eligible to receive the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (i) the annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) the target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination; and\n- \u00b7 with respect to each participant, an amount equal to their monthly COBRA premium  reimbursement, multiplied by 18 months.\n\nThe vesting and exercise of any equity awards held by a participant on the date of termination will be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Executive Severance Policy, if the Company terminates a participant's employment without Cause, or if the participant terminates his or her employment for Good Reason, in either case, within the period commencing six months prior to and ending 24 months following a 'Change in Control'  (as  defined  in  the  Executive  Severance  Policy),  then  in  lieu  of  the  severance  benefits  described  above  the  participant  will  be  eligible  to  receive  the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of (i) the annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of termination, and (ii) the target annual bonus for the calendar year of the date of termination;\n- \u00b7 with respect to each participant, the monthly COBRA reimbursement multiplied by 24 months; and\n- \u00b7 100% accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards then-held by the participant.",

In  addition,  the  vesting  and  exercise  of  any  equity  awards  held  by  the participant at the time of his or her death or disability will be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement.\n\nIn the event that any payment or benefit payable to a participant under the Executive Severance Policy would result in the imposition of excise taxes under the 'golden parachute' provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will either be made and/or provided in full or will be reduced such that the excise tax under Section 280G is not applicable, whichever is least economically disadvantageous to the participant.

The Board may terminate or amend the Executive Severance Policy at any time, so long as at least 90 days' prior notice is provided to any participant if the termination or amendment of the Executive Severance Policy would materially or adversely affect the rights of the participant.\n\n## Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements\n\nEffective in connection with their promotions by Aimco for Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, Aimco entered into certain non-competition and  non-solicitation  agreements  with  each  executive.  Mr.  Powell's  non-competition  and  non-solicitation  agreement  was  replaced  by  his  2021  Employment Agreement. Pursuant to these agreements, each of these NEOs agreed that during the term of his or her employment with the Company and for a period of two years following the termination of his or her employment, except in circumstances where there was a change in control of the Company, he or she would not (i) be employed by a competitor of the Company described on a schedule to the agreement, (ii) solicit other employees to leave the Company's employment, or (iii) solicit customers of Aimco to terminate their relationship with the Company. The agreements further require that the NEOs protect Aimco's trade secrets and confidential information.  For  Mr.  Powell,  the  non-solicitation  requirement  survives  a  change  in  control  of  the  Company.  For  Mses.  Stanfield  and  Johnson,  the  agreements provide that in order to enforce the above-noted non-competition condition following the executive's termination of employment by the Company without cause, the executive will receive, for a period not to extend beyond the earlier of 24 months following such termination or the date of acceptance of employment with a noncompetitor, (i) non-compete payments in an amount, if any, to be determined by the Company in its sole discretion and (ii) a monthly payment equal to two-thirds of such executive's monthly base salary at the time of termination. For purposes of these agreements, 'cause' is defined to mean, among other things, the executive's (i) breach of the agreement, (ii) failure to perform required employment services, (iii) misappropriation of Company funds or property, (iv) conviction, plea of guilty, or plea of no contest to a crime involving fraud or moral turpitude, or (v) negligence, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, misconduct or violation of law.\n\n## Equity Award Agreements\n\nDouble Trigger Vesting Upon Change in Control . The award agreements pursuant to which restricted stock, stock option, and/or LTIP Unit awards have been granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, as applicable, provide that if (i) a change in control occurs and (ii) the executive's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason, in either case, within 12 months following the change in control, then (a) for time-based restricted stock and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock and LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested, and (b) for performance-based restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested based on the higher of actual or target performance through the truncated performance period ending on the date of the change in control, and all vested stock options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option.\n\nAccelerated  Vesting  Upon  Termination  of  Employment  Due  to  Death  or  Disability . The award agreements pursuant to which restricted stock, stock option, and/or LTIP Unit awards have been granted to Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson, as applicable, provide that upon a termination of employment due to death or disability, then (a) for time-based restricted stock and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock and LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested, and (b) for performance-based restricted stock,  stock option, and/or LTIP Unit awards, all outstanding shares of restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units shall become immediately and fully vested based on the higher of actual or target performance through the truncated performance period ending on the date of termination, and all vested stock options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option.",

        "page_content": "## Other Benefits; Perquisite Philosophy\n\nAimco's executive officer benefit programs are substantially the same as for all other eligible officers and employees. Aimco does not provide executives with more than minimal perquisites, such as reserved parking places.\n\n## Stock Ownership Guidelines and Required Holding Periods After Vesting\n\nAimco believes that it is in the best interest of Aimco's stockholders for Aimco's executive officers to own Aimco stock. Every year, the Committee and CEO review  Aimco's  stock  ownership  guidelines,  each  executive  officer's  holdings  in  light  of  the  stock  ownership  guidelines,  and  each  executive  officer's accumulated realized and unrealized restricted stock, stock option, and LTIP Unit gains.  The Committee updated the stock ownership guidelines in April 2021.\n\nEquity ownership guidelines for all executive officers are determined as a multiple of the executive's base salary. The Committee and management have established the following stock ownership guidelines for Aimco's executive officers:\n\n| Officer Position                | Ownership Target   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Chief Executive Officer         | 5x base salary     |\n| Other Executive Vice Presidents | 3x base salary     |\n\nAny executive officer who has not satisfied the stock ownership guidelines must, until the stock ownership guidelines are satisfied, hold 50% of any restricted stock that vests, after deduction of restricted stock sold for payment of income taxes related to the vesting for at least three years from the date of vesting, and hold shares equal to 50% of (i) the value realized upon option exercises less (ii) related income taxes for at least three years from the date of exercise.\n\nEach of Mr. Powell and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson exceeded the ownership targets established in Aimco's stock ownership guidelines as of the date of this filing.\n\n## Role of Outside Consultants\n\nThe Committee has the authority under its charter to engage the services of outside advisors, experts and others to assist the Committee. In 2021, the Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson to advise the Committee regarding Aimco's executive compensation plan. Willis Towers Watson did not provide other services  to  Aimco.  The  Committee  assessed  the  independence  of  Willis  Towers  Watson  pursuant  to  SEC  rules  and  concluded  that  Willis  Towers  Watson  is independent.\n\nThe  Committee  directed  Willis  Towers  Watson  to:  (i)  perform  studies  of  competitive  compensation  practices;  (ii)  develop  conclusions  and recommendations regarding Aimco's executive compensation plans for consideration by the Committee; (iii) identify an executive compensation peer group; (iv) perform a benchmarking analysis of the base salary, STI, and LTI of the NEOs relative to competitive practices; (v) advise the Committee regarding stock ownership guidelines for the NEOs; and (vi) perform an assessment of the risks contained in Aimco's incentive compensation plans.\n\n## Base Salary, Incentive Compensation, and Equity Grant Practices\n\nBase salary adjustments typically take effect on January 1. The Committee (for the CEO) and the CEO, in consultation with the Committee (for the other executive  officers),  determine  incentive  compensation  in  late  January  or  early  February.  STI  is  typically  paid  in  February  or  March.  LTI  is  granted  on  a  date determined by the Committee, typically in late January or early February.\n\nAimco grants equity in three scenarios: in connection with its annual incentive compensation program as discussed above; in connection with certain new-hire or promotion packages; and for purposes of retention.\n\nWith respect to LTI, the Committee sets the grant date for the restricted stock, stock option, and LTIP Unit grants. The Committee typically sets grant dates at the time of its final compensation determination, generally in late January or early February. Due to the Separation and the additional time taken to create a new executive compensation plan for post-Separation Aimco, the Committee granted 2021 LTI in late April 2021.  The date of determination and date of award are not selected based on share price. In the case of new-hire packages that include equity awards, grants are made on the employee's start date or on a date designated in advance based on the passage of a specific number of days after the employee's start date. For non-executive officers, as provided for in the 2015 Plan, the Committee  has  delegated  the  authority  to  make  equity  awards,  up  to  certain  limits,  to  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  (Ms.  Stanfield)  and/or  Corporate  Secretary (Ms. Johnson). The Committee and Mses. Stanfield and Johnson time grants without regard to the share price or the timing of the release of material non-public information and do not time grants for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.",

        "page_content": "## 2022 Compensation Targets\n\nBased on comparison to compensation paid to CEOs at Aimco's peers, the Committee set Mr. Powell's target total compensation (base compensation, STI and LTI) for 2022 at $2.3 million. Mr. Powell, in consultation with and approval from the Committee, set target total compensation (base compensation, STI and LTI) for 2022 for the other NEOs as follows: Ms. Stanfield - $1.4 million; and Ms. Johnson - $1.1 million. Aimco performance will determine the amounts paid for 2022 STI and the portion of LTI awards that vest, and such amounts may be less than, or in excess of, these target amounts. STI will be paid in cash. The LTI was granted on February 2, 2022, and was in the form of restricted stock, stock options, and/or LTIP Units.\n\n## Accounting Treatment and Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation\n\nThe Committee generally considers the accounting treatment and tax implications of the compensation awarded or paid to our executives. Grants of equity compensation awards under our long-term incentive program are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 718. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code was amended on December 22, 2017, by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 'Tax Act'). Under the Tax Act, Section 162(m) applies to each employee who serves as the Company's principal executive officer or principal financial officer during the taxable year, each other employee of the Company who is among the three most highly  compensated  officers  during  such  taxable  year,  and  any  other  employee  who  was  a  covered  employee  of  the  Company  for  any  preceding  taxable  year beginning  after  December  31,  2016.  The  Tax  Act  also  eliminated  the  performance-based  compensation  exception  with  respect  to  tax  years  beginning  after December 31, 2017, but includes a transition rule with respect to compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017, and not materially modified after that date. The Company has awarded, and will continue to award, compensation as it considers appropriate that does not qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m).\n\n## COMPENSATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS\n\nThe Compensation and Human Resources Committee held six meetings during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion & Analysis with management. Based upon such review, the related discussions, and such other matters deemed relevant and appropriate by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion & Analysis be included in this filing.\n\n## Date: February 22, 2022\n\nQUINCY L.

        "page_content": "## CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION\n\nWe believe that executive pay should be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our teammates to create stockholder value. In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the principal executive officer. The disclosure is required for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The annual total compensation for 2021 for Mr. Powell, our CEO, was $5,445,198, as reported under the heading 'Summary Compensation Table.' Our median employee's total compensation  for  2021  was  $144,781.  As  a  result,  we  estimate  that  Mr.  Powell's  2021  total  compensation  was  approximately  37.6  times  that  of  our  median employee.\n\nOur CEO to median employee pay ratio was calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining 2021 total  compensation,  consisting  of  base  salary,  annual  bonus  amounts,  stock-based  compensation  (based  on  the  grant  date  fair  value  of  awards granted during 2021) and other incentive payments for all individuals who were employed by Aimco on December 31, 2021, other than our CEO. Our measuring date of December 31 remained the same as last year. We included all active employees and annualized the compensation for any employees who were not employed by Aimco for the full 2021 calendar year. After identifying the median employee based on 2021 total compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the 'Total' column in the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n## DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nIn  formulating  its  recommendation  for  director  compensation,  the  Nominating,  Environmental,  Social,  and  Governance  Committee  reviews  director compensation  for  independent  directors  of  companies  in  the  real  estate  industry  and  companies  of  comparable  market  capitalization,  revenue,  and  assets  and considers compensation trends for other NYSE-listed companies. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee also considers the size of the Board as compared to other boards, the participation  of  each  independent  director  on  committees,  and  the  resulting  workload  on  the  directors.  In  addition,  the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee considers the overall cost of the Board to the Company and the cost per director.\n\n## 2021 Compensation\n\nIn connection with the Separation, the Independent Directors each received an initial fee of 34,000 shares of Common Stock, which shares were awarded on December 21, 2020, for Messrs. Allen, Leupp, Stone, and Sykes and Ms. Gibson, and on January 27, 2021, for Messrs. Miller and Stein and Ms. Smith.\n\nFor 2021, compensation for the Independent Directors included a fixed annual cash retainer of $75,000 and an award of 16,234 shares of fully vested Common Stock. No meeting fees were paid to independent directors for attending meetings of the Board and the committees on which they serve.\n\nAs contemplated by the Separation and by Aimco and AIR, Mr. Considine has specific responsibilities to Aimco as a non-executive employee during 2021 and 2022 to support the establishment and growth of the Aimco business, reporting directly to the Board. These responsibilities include short and long-term strategic  direction  and  advice,  transition  and  executive  support  to  Aimco  officers,  and  advice  and  consultation  with  respect  to  Aimco's  strategic  growth  and acquisition  activities.  The  Independent  Directors  set  Mr.  Considine's  2021  target  total  compensation  (including  base  compensation,  STI,  and  LTI)  for  these responsibilities at $1.8 million.",

The stock, stock options, and LTIP Units were awarded on February 4, 2022.  The closing price of Aimco's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 4, 2022, was $6.79. Directors will not receive meeting fees in 2022.\n\nAs  described  above,  Mr.  Considine  has  specific  responsibilities  to  Aimco  as  a  non-executive  employee  during  2021  and  2022  to  support  the establishment and growth of the Aimco business, reporting directly to the Board. The Independent Directors set Mr. Considine's 2022 target total compensation (including base compensation, STI, and LTI) for these responsibilities at $1.8 million, consisting of $300,000 in base salary, target STI of $600,000, and target LTI of  $900,000,  identical  to  his  2021  target  total  compensation.  Mr.  Considine's  2022  base  salary  of  $300,000  is  in  the  form  of  175,439  LTIP  Units  awarded  on February 2, 2022, and which will vest on the first anniversary of the award date.  With respect to the LTIP Units granted to Mr. Considine, Mr. Considine was granted the ability to participate in the appreciation of value of Aimco that took place after these LTIP Units were granted, subject to their vesting. For the purpose of calculating the number of shares subject to these LTIP Units, the target dollar amount was divided by $1.71, which price was calculated by a third-party financial firm with particular expertise  in the valuation of such LTIP Units. The LTIP Units as granted had a conversion price of $6.96, which was the closing price of Aimco's stock on the grant date and equal to the fair market value of Aimco's Common Stock on the grant date. Mr. Considine's 2022 STI will be based entirely on Aimco's performance against its 2022 corporate goals. Mr. Considine's 2022 LTI was awarded on February 2, 2022, in the form of LTIP Units and is based entirely on Aimco's relative TSR over the forward looking, three-year performance period from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2024.",

As of February 28, 2022, Aimco held approximately 95.0% of the common partnership interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than Aimco are referred to as 'OP Units.' Generally, after a holding period of 12 months, common OP Units may be tendered for redemption and, upon tender, may be acquired by Aimco for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock for each common OP Unit (subject to adjustment). If Aimco acquired all common OP Units for Common Stock (without regard to the ownership limit set forth in Aimco's Charter), these shares of Common Stock would constitute approximately 5.0% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock. OP Units are subject to certain restrictions on transfer.",

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\n\n## Certain Relationships and Related Transactions\n\n## Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions\n\nAimco recognizes that related person transactions can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that Aimco's decisions are based on considerations other than the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. Nevertheless, Aimco recognizes that there are situations where related person transactions may be in, or may not be inconsistent with, the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee,  pursuant  to  a  written  policy  approved  by  the  Board,  has  oversight  for  related  person  transactions.  The  Nominating,  Environmental,  Social,  and Governance Committee will review transactions,  arrangements  or relationships  in  which  (1)  the  aggregate  amount  involved  will  or  may  be  expected  to  exceed $100,000 in any calendar year, (2) Aimco (or any Aimco entity) is a participant, and (3) any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than an interest arising solely as a result of being a director of another corporation or organization that is a party to the transaction or a less than ten percent beneficial owner of another entity that is a party to the transaction). The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee has also given its standing approval for certain types of related person transactions such as certain employment arrangements, director compensation, transactions with another entity in which a related person's interest is only by virtue of a non-executive employment relationship or limited equity position, and transactions in which all stockholders receive pro rata benefits.\n\n## Sublease of a Portion of Aimco Office Space\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Aimco entered into a sublease agreement (the 'Sublease') with an entity in which Mr. Considine has sole voting and investment power. Under this agreement, Aimco has subleased to said entity approximately 2,957 square feet of office space within the same building as Aimco's corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado, and consisting of excess space not needed by Aimco, on exactly the same terms as Aimco leases the space. The Sublease does not provide any benefit to the entity, as other space in the building requires comparable rent. The Sublease provides some benefit to Aimco as it gives Aimco the ability to put the excess space to productive use. The entity has a lease term less favorable than Aimco's lease with the landlord, in that Aimco has the option to terminate the Sublease at any time, for any or no reason, upon six months' notice. The Sublease has a term that began on April 1, 2019, and ends on April 30, 2029, the same term as the Aimco lease. The annual amount of rent in the first year was $78,361, subject to annual increases. The aggregate amount of rent expected to be paid under the Sublease, assuming the entire lease term is fulfilled, is approximately $850,000. The Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed the Sublease and determined that it is in the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders.\n\n## Related Person Transactions\n\nIn November 2019, Aimco confirmed an arrangement with Richard M. Powell, of R.M. Powell & Co., a contractor for Aimco since 1997 and father of Mr. Wes Powell, Director, President and CEO. Depending on the success of potential transactions identified by Mr. Richard Powell, he may earn fees in amounts in excess of $120,000. Pursuant to the Company's related party transactions policy, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed and approved the arrangement with Mr. Richard Powell, subject to the Committee's subsequent review and approval of any specific transaction in which R.M. Powell & Co. provides services.",

        "page_content": "In March 2020, Elizabeth Likovich, the daughter of Mr. Considine, Director, became a full-time employee of the Company. Her compensation for 2021 was in line with the median for her peers, and consisted of $254,606 in base salary, $68,400 in STI, $4,222 in discretionary matching contributions under Aimco's 401(k) plan, and $1,106,022 in equity awards vesting over four to five years. Prior to joining Aimco, Ms. Likovich held a similar position at a peer apartment company. Pursuant to the policy noted above, the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee reviewed and approved the employment of Ms. Likovich.\n\n## Independence of Directors\n\nThe Board  has  determined  that  to  be  considered  independent,  a  director  may  not  have  a  direct  or  indirect  material  relationship  with  Aimco  or  its subsidiaries (directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). A material relationship is one that impairs or  inhibits,  or  has  the  potential  to  impair  or  inhibit,  a  director's  exercise  of  critical  and  disinterested  judgment  on  behalf  of  Aimco  and  its  stockholders.  In determining whether a material relationship exists, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including whether the director or a family member is a current or former employee of the Company, family member relationships, compensation, business relationships and payments, and charitable contributions between Aimco and an entity with which a director is affiliated (as an executive officer, partner or substantial stockholder). The Board consults with the Company's counsel to  ensure  that  such  determinations  are  consistent  with  all  relevant  securities  and  other  laws  and  regulations  regarding  the  definition  of  'independent  director,' including but not limited to those categorical standards set forth in Section 303A.02 of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nConsistent  with  these  considerations,  the  Board  has  affirmatively  determined  that  Messrs.

A summary of the Pre-Approval Policy is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Pre-Approval Policy describes the Audit, Audit-related,  Tax and Other Permitted services that have the general pre-approval  of the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 Pre-approvals are typically subject to a dollar limit of $50,000.\n- \u00b7 The term of any general pre-approval is generally 12 months from the date of pre-approval.\n- \u00b7 At  least  annually,  the  Audit  Committee  reviews  and  pre-approves  the  services  that  may  be  provided  by  the  independent  registered  public accounting firm without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 Unless a type of service has received general pre-approval and is anticipated to be within the dollar limit associated with the general pre-approval, it requires specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it is to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.\n- \u00b7 The  Audit  Committee  will  consider  whether  all  services  are  consistent  with  the  rules  on  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm independence.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee also considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, for reasons such as its familiarity with Aimco's business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance Aimco's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. Such factors are considered as a whole, and no one factor is necessarily determinative.\n\nAll of the services described in the Principal Accountant Fee section above were approved pursuant to the annual engagement letter or in accordance with the Pre-Approval Policy.",

        "page_content": "To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apartment Investment and Management Company\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apartment Investment and Management Company (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial  statement  schedule  listed  in  the  index  at  Item  15(a)  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  'consolidated  financial  statements').  In  our  opinion,  the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2021,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Accounting for Acquisitions of Real Estate\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\nDuring 2021 the Company acquired the Eldridge Townhomes for total consideration of $40 million. As more fully described in Note 2 and summarized in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the total consideration for this asset acquisition was allocated to land, buildings and improvements, intangible assets, and intangible liabilities, based upon their relative fair values.\n\nAuditing the Company's allocation of cost for this asset acquisition involved a higher degree of judgment due to the subjective nature of the assumptions used in determining the relative fair values of the assets acquired. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these acquired tangible assets includes market comparable prices for similar land parcels and estimated replacement costs for buildings.\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm",

        "page_content": "To the Partners and the Board of Directors of Aimco OP L.P.\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aimco OP L.P. (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Partnership's internal control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2021,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Partnership's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Partnership's  financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Accounting for Acquisitions of Real Estate\n\n## Description of the Matter\n\nDuring 2021 the Partnership acquired the Eldridge Townhomes for total consideration of $40 million. As more fully described in Note 2 and summarized in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the total consideration for this asset acquisition was allocated to land, buildings and improvements, intangible assets, and intangible liabilities, based upon their relative fair values.\n\nAuditing the Partnership's  allocation  of  cost  for  this  asset  acquisition  involved  a  higher  degree  of  judgment  due  to  the  subjective nature of the assumptions used in determining the relative fair values of the assets acquired.  The significant assumptions used to estimate  the  fair  value  of  these  acquired  tangible  assets  includes  market  comparable  prices  for  similar  land  parcels  and  estimated replacement costs for buildings and improvements.\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm",

Aimco, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the general partner and directly is the special limited partner of Aimco OP L.P. ('Aimco Operating Partnership').\n\nExcept as the context otherwise requires, 'we,' 'our,' and 'us' refer to Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated subsidiaries, collectively.\n\n## The Separation\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Aimco completed the separation of its businesses (the 'Separation'), creating two, separate and distinct, publicly traded companies, Aimco and Apartment Income REIT Corp. ('AIR') (Aimco and AIR together, as they existed prior to the Separation, 'Aimco Predecessor').\n\nPrior  to  the  Separation,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  were  prepared  on  a  carve-out  basis  and  reflect  significant  assumptions  and  allocations.  The consolidated financial statements reflect our historical consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ('GAAP'). The historical financial statements of Aimco do not represent the financial position and results of operations of one  legal  entity,  but  rather  a  combination  of  entities  under  common  control  that  have  been  'carved  out'  from  Aimco  Predecessor's  financial  statements.  All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nAll  separation  related  transactions  between  Aimco  and  Aimco  Predecessor  are  considered  effectively  settled  through  partners'  capital  in  our  consolidated financial statements, other than the Notes Payable to AIR as discussed in Note 7. The settlement of these transactions is reflected as contributions from Aimco Predecessor,  net  in  our  consolidated  statements  of  equity  and  partners'  capital  and  net  change  in  Aimco  Predecessor  invesment  in  financing  activity  in  our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Business\n\nAimco, through a wholly owned subsidiary, is the general and special limited partner of Aimco Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2021, Aimco owned 93.1% of  the  legal  interest  in  the  common  partnership  units  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  and  95.0%  of  the  economic  interest  in  Aimco  Operating Partnership. The remaining 6.9% legal interest is owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of Aimco Operating Partnership, Aimco has exclusive control of Aimco Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe own or lease a portfolio of real estate investments focused primarily on the U.S. multifamily sector. These real estate investments include a portfolio of 29 operating apartment communities (25 consolidated properties with 6,125 apartment homes and four unconsolidated properties), diversified by both geography and price point, in ten major U.S. markets; one commercial office building owned as part of a land assemblage; three residential apartment communities, with 1,331 planned apartment homes, a single family rental community, with 16 planned homes plus eight accessory dwelling units, and one hotel, with 106 planned rooms, that we are actively developing or redeveloping; land parcels held for development; and three residential apartment communities with 499 apartment homes, for which we have completed the redevelopment and are in lease-up, but have not achieved stabilization. In addition, we hold other opportunistic and alternative investments, including our Mezzanine investment; our IQHQ investment; and our investment in real estate technology funds.\n\nAny reference  to  the  number  of  apartment  communities  and  homes,  square  footage,  or  occupancy  percentage  in  these  notes  to  our  consolidated  financial statements are unaudited.\n\n## Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aimco, Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated subsidiaries. Aimco Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements  include  the accounts  of Aimco Operating Partnership  and its consolidated  subsidiaries.  All  significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nAs used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, 'partnership' refers to a limited partnership or a limited liability company and 'partner' refers to a partner in a limited partnership or a member of a limited liability company.\n\nCertain  reclassifications  have  been  made  to  prior  period  amounts  to  conform  to  the  current  period  financial  statement  presentation  with  no  effect  on  the Company's previously reported results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## Principles of Consolidation\n\nWe consolidate variable interest entities ('VIE'), in which we are considered the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Refer to Note 6 for further information.\n\n## Allocations\n\nThe 2020 consolidated statements of operations include allocations of general and administrative expenses from Aimco Predecessor, as discussed in Note 5 Transactions with AIR. We consider the basis on which expenses have been allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by us during the periods presented. However, the allocations may not include all of the actual expenses that we would have incurred and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had it been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that might have been incurred had we been a stand-alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, what functions we  might  have  performed  ourselves  or  outsourced,  and  strategic  decisions  we  might  have  made  in  areas  such  as  information  technology  and  infrastructure. Following the Separation, AIR, through its subsidiaries, provides Aimco with certain property management and other services, and we perform certain functions using our own resources or purchase services from third parties.\n\n## Common Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership\n\nCommon noncontrolling  interests  in  Aimco  Operating  Partnership  consist  of  common  OP  Units  ('OP  Units')  and  are  reflected  in  Aimco's  accompanying consolidated balance sheets as common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership. Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss is allocated to the holders of common OP Units, other than Aimco, based on the weighted-average number of common OP Units (including Aimco) outstanding during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the holders of common OP Units had a weighted-average economic ownership interest in Aimco Operating Partnership  of  approximately  5.0%.  Please  refer  to  Note  10  for  further  information  regarding  the  items  comprising  common  noncontrolling  interests  in  Aimco Operating Partnership. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Aimco are held by Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests consists of equity interests held by a limited partner in a consolidated real estate partnership that has a finite life. We generally  attribute  to  noncontrolling  interests  their  share  of  income  or  loss  of  consolidated  partnerships  based  on  their  proportionate  interest  in  the  results  of operations of the partnerships, including their share of losses even if such attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance within our equity accounts.\n\nIf a consolidated real estate partnership includes redemption rights that are not within our control, the noncontrolling interest is included as temporary equity. If the redemption right is not currently redeemable but probable of being redeemable in the future, changes in redemption value are recognized each quarter with the change in value being reflected in additional paid-in-capital.\n\nThe assets of our consolidated real estate partnerships must first be used to settle the liabilities of the consolidated real estate partnerships. The consolidated real estate partnership's creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nThe  following  table  represents  a  reconciliation  of  our  redeemable  noncontrolling  interests  in  consolidated  real  estate  partnership  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\n\n| Balance at December 31, 2020   | 4,263   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|\n| Capital contributions          | 29,440  |\n| Net income                     | 91      |\n| Balance at December 31, 2021   | 33,794  |\n\n## Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nWe  own  general  and  limited  partner  interests  in  partnerships  that  either  directly,  or  through  interests  in  other  real  estate  partnerships,  own  apartment communities. We generally account for investments in real estate partnerships that we do not consolidate under the equity method. Accordingly, we recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods presented, inclusive of our share of any impairments and disposition gains or losses recognized by and related to such entities, and we present such amounts within income from unconsolidated real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe excess of our cost of the acquired partnership interests over our share of the partners' equity or deficit is generally ascribed to the fair values of land and buildings owned by the partnerships. We amortize the excess cost ascribed to the buildings over the related estimated useful lives. Such amortization is recorded as an adjustment of the amounts of earnings or losses we recognize from such unconsolidated real estate partnerships.",

        "page_content": "We may also originate loans for real estate acquisitions or developments where we either expect, or have the opportunity, to participate in the residual profits from such projects. When the risks and rewards of these arrangements are similar to an equity investor or joint venture partner, we account for these arrangements as real estate investments using the equity method of accounting. We recognize as income changes in our share of net assets, adjusted for any basis differential, in mezzanine investment income, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe assess the recoverability of our equity method investments if there are indicators of potential impairment. We did not recognize any such impairments of our equity method investments during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment\n\nOn November 26, 2019, Aimco Predecessor made a five-year, $275.0 million mezzanine loan to the partnership owning the 'Parkmerced Apartments,' located in southwest San Francisco (the 'Mezzanine Investment'). The loan bears interest at a 10% annual rate, accruing if not paid from property operations. Ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the mezzanine loan was retained by AIR following the Separation.\n\nThe Separation Agreement provides for AIR to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that originated and hold the mezzanine loan, a related equity option to acquire a 30% interest in the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments and the interest rate option, or swaption, that provides partial protection against future refinancing risk through 2024 to Aimco once required consents to transfer are received. At the time of the Separation and as of the date of this filing, legal title of these subsidiaries has not yet transferred to Aimco. Until legal title of the subsidiaries is transferred, AIR is obligated to pass payments on such loan to us, and we are obligated to indemnify AIR against any costs and expenses related thereto. We have the risks and rewards of ownership of the Mezzanine Investment and have recognized an asset related to our right to receive the Mezzanine Investment from AIR.\n\nWe recognize as income the net amounts earned on the mezzanine loan by AIR on its equity investment that are due to be paid to us when collected to the extent the income is supported by the change in AIR's claim to the net assets of the underlying borrower. The income recognized primarily represents the interest accrued under the terms of the underlying mezzanine loan.\n\nThe loan is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, those resulting from the ongoing disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated response, and any similar events that might occur in the future, which may result in all or a portion of the loan not being repaid. In the event we determine that a portion of the Mezzanine Investment is not recoverable, we will recognize an impairment.\n\n## Real Estate\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nUpon the acquisition of real estate, we determine whether the purchase qualifies as an asset acquisition or, less frequently, meets the definition of an acquisition of a business. We generally recognize the acquisition of real estate or interests in partnerships that own real estate at our cost, including the related transaction costs, as asset acquisitions.\n\nWe allocate the cost of real estate acquired based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined using valuation techniques that rely on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs within the fair value framework. We determine the fair value of tangible assets, such as land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, and equipment using valuation techniques that consider comparable market transactions, replacement costs, and other  available  information.  We  determine  the  fair  value  of  identified  intangible  assets  or  liabilities,  which  typically  relate  to  in-place  leases,  using  valuation techniques that consider the terms of the in-place leases, current market data for comparable leases, and our experience in leasing similar real estate.\n\nThe intangible assets or liabilities related to in-place leases are comprised of: (a) the value of the above- and below-market leases in-place, measured over the period, including probable lease renewals for below-market leases, for which the leases are expected to remain in effect; (b) the estimated unamortized portion of avoided leasing commissions and other costs that ordinarily would be incurred to originate the in-place leases; and (c) the value associated with in-place leases during an estimated absorption period, which estimates rental revenue that would not have been earned had the leased space been vacant at the time of acquisition, assuming lease-up periods based on market demand and stabilized occupancy levels. The above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to rental revenue over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases, which include reasonably assured renewal periods. Other intangible assets related to in-place leases are amortized to depreciation and amortization over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases.\n\n## Capital Additions\n\nWe capitalize  costs,  including  certain  indirect  costs,  incurred  in  connection  with  our  capital  additions  activities,  including  redevelopments,  other  tangible apartment community improvements, and replacements of existing community components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by employees in connection with the planning, execution, and control of all capital addition activities at our communities. We characterize as 'indirect costs' an allocation  of  certain  department  costs,  including  payroll,  at  the  area  operations  and  corporate  levels  that  clearly  relate  to  capital  addition  activities.  We  also capitalize  interest,  property  taxes,  and  insurance  during  periods  in  which  construction  projects  are  in  progress.  We  commence  capitalization  of  costs,  including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our",

        "page_content": "capital addition activities, at the point in time when activities necessary to get communities, apartment homes, or leased spaces ready for their intended use begin. These activities include when communities, apartment homes or leased spaces are undergoing physical construction, as well as when homes or leased spaces are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting, planning, and design are in progress. We cease the capitalization of costs when the communities or components thereof are substantially complete and ready for their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and homes or leased spaces are available for occupancy. We charge costs including ordinary repairs, maintenance, and resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred.\n\nFor the each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we capitalized to buildings and improvements $21.3 million, $1.0 million, and $0.2 million of interest costs, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we capitalized to buildings and improvements $20.9 million, $2.7 million, and $4.1 million of indirect costs, respectively.\n\n## Gain or Loss on Dispositions\n\nGain or loss on dispositions are recognized when we no longer hold a controlling financial interest in the real estate and sufficient consideration  has been received. Upon disposition, the related assets and liabilities are derecognized, and the gain or loss on disposition is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities and the value of consideration received. There were no dispositions in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n## Impairment\n\nReal estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the  carrying  amount  to  our  estimate  of  the  undiscounted  future  cash  flows,  excluding  interest  charges,  of  the  community.  If  the  carrying  amount  exceeds  the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the community.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a sublease of office space within our corporate offices to AIR at then-current market rents. Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relative to the sublease arrangement, we evaluated the recoverability of the assets associated with the subleased space, including, the right-of-use asset, tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment and concluded the subleased assets were impaired. We recorded an impairment charge of $11.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2019.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a software license agreement with AIR to provide for the use of certain internally developed software at thencurrent market rates. Based on an analysis of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relative to the carrying value of the internally developed software, we concluded the assets were impaired. Additionally, following an evaluation of the future service potential of certain other internal software that was under development, we ceased development and impaired the associated carrying value. We recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $4.9 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no such impairments for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2019.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nWe classify  highly  liquid  investments  with  an  original  maturity  of  three  months  or  less  as  cash  equivalents.  We  maintain  cash  equivalents  in  financial institutions in excess of insured limits. We have not experienced any losses in these accounts in the past and believe that we are not exposed to significant credit risk because our accounts are deposited with major financial institutions.",

The allowance is determined based on an assessment on whether substantially all of the amounts due from the resident or tenant is probable of collection. This includes a specific tenant analysis and aging analysis.\n\n## Deferred Leasing Costs\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  adoption  of  Accounting  Standard  Codification  ('ASC')  842,  we  defer  leasing  costs  incremental  to  a  lease  that  we  would  not  have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. Amortization of these costs over the lease term on the same basis as lease income, is included in depreciation and amortization.\n\n## Revenue from Leases\n\nWe are a lessor for residential and commercial leases. Our operating leases with residents may provide that the resident reimburse us for certain costs, primarily the resident's share of utilities expenses, incurred by the apartment community. Our operating leases with commercial tenants may provide that the tenant reimburse us for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other recoverable costs incurred by the commercial property.\n\nIn 2019, with the adoption of ASC 842, we concluded that residential and commercial reimbursements represent revenue attributable to non-lease components for which the timing and pattern of recognition is the same as the revenue for the lease components. Reimbursements and the related expenses are presented on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations, with the reimbursements included in rental and other property revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in the period the recoverable costs are incurred. We recognize rental revenue attributed to lease components, net of any concessions, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## Debt Issuance Costs\n\nWe defer, as debt issuance costs, lender fees and other direct costs incurred in obtaining new financing and amortize the amounts over the terms of the related loan agreements. In connection with the modification of existing financing arrangements, we defer lender fees and amortize these costs and any unamortized debt issuance costs over the term of the modified loan agreement. Debt issuance costs associated with non-recourse property debt are presented as a direct deduction from the related liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. For debt issuance costs associated with our revolving credit facilities and construction loans that have not been drawn we record the costs in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets and amortize the costs to interest expense, on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. Debt issuance costs associated with construction loans are reclassified as a direct deduction to the construction loan liability in proportion to any draws  on  the  loans  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  subsequently  amortized  to  interest  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  remaining  term  of  the arrangement in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWhen financing arrangements are repaid or otherwise extinguished prior to maturity, unamortized debt issuance costs are written off. Any lender fees or other costs incurred in connection with an extinguishment are recognized as expense. Amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs and other extinguishment costs are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation for all  tangible  assets  is  calculated  using  the  straight-line  method  over  their  estimated  useful  lives.  Acquired  buildings  and  improvements  are depreciated over a useful life based on the age, condition, and other physical characteristics of the asset. Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are generally depreciated over five years.\n\nWe depreciate capitalized costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related improvement, which is generally 5, 15, or 30 years. We also capitalize payroll and other indirect costs incurred in connection with preparing an asset for its intended use. These costs include corporate-level costs that clearly relate to the capital addition activities, which we allocate to the applicable assets. All capitalized",

Leasehold improvements are also recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's estimated useful life or the term of the related lease.\n\nCertain homogeneous items that are purchased in bulk on a recurring basis, such as appliances, are depreciated using group methods that reflect the average estimated useful life of the items in each group. Except in the case of casualties, where the net book value of the lost asset is written off in the determination of casualty  gains  or  losses,  we  generally  do  not  recognize  any  loss  in  connection  with  the  replacement  of  an  existing  community  component  because  normal replacements are considered in determining the estimated useful lives used in connection with our composite and group depreciation methods.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nAimco has  elected  to  be  taxed  as  a  REIT  under  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  'Code'),  commencing  with  its  taxable  year  ended December 31, 1994, and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner. Aimco's current and continuing qualification as a REIT depends on its ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which are related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity  of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. If Aimco qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it will generally not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the 'double taxation' (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.\n\nEven if Aimco qualifies as a REIT, it may be subject to United States federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on undistributed income. Aimco also will be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arm's length transactions between it and a TRS (described below) and on any net income from sales of apartment communities that were held for sale in the ordinary course. The state and local tax laws may not conform to the United States federal income tax treatment, and Aimco may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business. Any taxes imposed on us reduce our operating cash flow and net income.\n\nCertain of Aimco's operations or a portion thereof, including property management and risk management, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are our subsidiaries of Aimco Operating Partnership, and each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a corporate subsidiary that has elected to be a TRS instead of a REIT and, as such, is subject to United States federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents and investment partners that cannot be offered directly by a REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain apartment communities.\n\nFor our TRS entities, deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for United States federal income tax purposes and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We reduce deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. We assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets through a review of the reversals of temporary differences, available tax planning  strategies,  future  taxable  income,  and  considering  all  available  positive  and  negative  evidence.  We  recognize  the  tax  consequences  associated  with intercompany transfers between Aimco Operating Partnership and TRS entities when such transactions occur. Please refer to Note 8 for further information about our income taxes.\n\n## Earnings per Share and per Unit\n\nWe and Aimco Operating Partnership calculate earnings per share and unit based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock or common OP Units,  participating  securities,  common  stock  or  common  unit  equivalents  and  dilutive  convertible  securities  outstanding  during  the  period.  Aimco  Operating Partnership  considers  both  common  OP  Units  and  equivalents,  which  have  identical  rights  to  distributions  and  undistributed  earnings,  to  be  common  units  for purposes of the earnings per unit computations. Please refer to Note 11 for further information regarding earnings per share and unit computations.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.",

Adoption of the standards update required changes to be made prospectively and early adoption was permitted. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2021, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements\n\nOn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which simplified the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity and affects the diluted earnings per share calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares, which was effective for us on January 1, 2021. Adoption of the standards update required changes to be made retrospectively and early adoption was permitted. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2021, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting' ('ASU 2020-04'), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the LIBOR or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The guidance was effective beginning March 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-01 , 'Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope' ('ASU 2021-01'), which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance. We plan to adopt ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 when LIBOR is discontinued. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements due to the fact that we hold one month LIBOR debt instruments which are not expected to be discontinued in 2022.\n\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05 establishing Topic 842, Lessors - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments. ASU 2021-05 improves ASC 842 classification guidance as it relates to a lessor's accounting for certain leases with variable lease payments. This guidance requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable payments that do not depend on an index or rate as an operating lease if either a sales-type lease or direct financing lease classification would trigger a dayone loss. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2021-05 on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 3 - Significant Transactions\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, we acquired from AIR the Eldridge Townhomes for $40.0 million based on an independent opinion of its value. The Eldridge Townhomes are a 58-unit townhome community located on 3.6 acres of land contiguous to our Elm Creek community in Elmhurst, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago. To fund the acquisition of Eldridge Townhomes, we used proceeds from debt placement on the unencumbered Evanston Place asset in Evanston, Illinois. The allocation of consideration paid for this asset acquisition is included in the table below.\n\n| Number of townhomes                                                                  | 58            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Purchase price                                                                       | 40,000        |\n| Consideration allocated to land Consideration allocated to building and improvements | 3,483  35,630 |\n| Consideration allocated to intangible assets (1)                                     | 913           |\n|                                                                                      | (26)          |\n| Consideration allocated to below-market lease liabilities (2)                        |               |\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  also  acquired  eight  land  parcels  adjacent  to  The  Hamilton  apartment  community,  located  in  Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, for $19.3 million and we began major redevelopment of the existing apartment building at The Hamilton. The scope of our investment will completely renew the waterfront high-rise, which benefits from spacious apartment homes (averaging 1,411 square feet) and an abundance of outdoor and amenity space that was previously underutilized.",

        "page_content": "In February 2021, we acquired from AIR The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club development property for $6.2 million, net of outstanding construction liabilities of $0.9 million. The development property consists of land and initial construction costs. The project is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we also purchased seven acres of developable land in Colorado Springs, Colorado for $4.1 million that allows for the construction of up to 119 apartments and townhomes.\n\n## Upton Place JV\n\nOn December  4,  2020,  we  entered  into  a  joint  venture  to  acquire  a  90%  interest  in  a  partnership  (the  'Upton  Place  JV')  with  a  third-party  developer ('Developer').  The  Upton  Place  JV  was  formed  to  construct  Upton  Place,  a  mixed-use  development  project  which  will  create  689  apartment  homes  and approximately 100,000 square feet of commercial space in upper-northwest Washington, D.C. In conjunction with Upton Place JV, we entered into two 99-year ground leases with a third party for the land underlying the property.\n\nOur commitment to fund equity at the inception of the joint venture totaled $105.0 million, of which $20.0 million was contributed by an AIR affiliate before the Separation.  AIR earns annual payments of $1.15 million on their equity.  AIR's equity interest in the joint venture is presented as noncontrolling interests in consolidated  real  estate  partnerships  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Also,  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  preferred  equity agreement with an institutional partner to fund $52.2 million in return for an accruing 9.7% rate of return.  The institutional partner's equity interest in the joint venture  is  presented  as  redeemable  noncontrolling  interest  in  consolidated  real  estate  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.      Of  the  $85.0  million  commitment remaining at the Separation, $39.2 million and $5.2 million had been funded as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nContemporaneous with the formation of the joint venture, the Developer provided a guaranty of cost overruns which requires the Developer to fund all costs and expenses in excess  of  certain  guaranteed  cost  amounts.  The  Developer  has  also  guaranteed  the  project's  construction,  delivery  and  will  be  responsible  for managing the lease up and management of the retail units. We will be responsible for the lease-up and management of the residential units.\n\nThe Developer has a 10% interest in the Upton Place JV as well as rights to receive a promote distribution contingent on certain internal rates of return. Upon final completion of the project and following 360 days after stabilization ('Stabilization', defined as at least 95% of apartment units and 90% of retail space being leased with tenants having taken possession), the Developer has the option to require the Upton Place JV to redeem its promote based on the then fair value of the project.\n\nWe evaluated the joint venture, concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidate the Upton Place JV. The Developer's equity interest in the joint venture is presented as noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships in the consolidated balance sheets. The Developer's contingent option relative to its promote distribution is a liability. As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Developer's noncontrolling interest and promote distribution liability was $11.7 million.\n\n## Acquisition of The Hamilton\n\nOn August 25, 2020, we acquired The Hamilton, an apartment community and an adjacent land parcel located in Miami, Florida.\n\nSummarized information regarding these acquisitions is set forth in the table below (in thousands):\n\n| Purchase price                                                | $ 115,394   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Capitalized transaction costs                                 | 5,136       |\n| Total consideration                                           | 120,530     |\n| Consideration allocated to land                               | $ 56,649    |\n| Consideration allocated to building and improvements          | 56,171      |\n| Right-of-use lease assets                                     | 92,787      |\n| Due from affiliate                                            | 705         |\n| Lease liabilities                                             | (86,348)    |\n| Consideration allocated to intangible assets (1)              | 1,517       |\n| Consideration allocated to below-market lease liabilities (2) | (951)       |\n| Total consideration                                           | $ 120,530   |",

        "page_content": "## Life Science Developer Investment\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a $35.8 million and a $12.5 million investment in, respectively, and as of December 31, 2021, a $14.2 million commitment to IQHQ, a privately-held life-sciences real estate development company. In addition, Aimco has the right to collaborate with IQHQ on any multifamily component at its future development sites. Subsequent to year end, we funded our remaining commitment.\n\n## Other Significant Transactions\n\n## Non-recourse Property Debt\n\nWe also closed on two non-recourse loans for $60.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The loans have 10-year terms, and a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.09%. Proceeds from the loans were used to fund the acquisition of Eldridge Townhomes for $40.0 million and other investment activities.\n\n## Fort Lauderdale Consolidated Joint Venture\n\nIn July 2021, Aimco entered into a joint venture with Kushner Companies to purchase three undeveloped land parcels located in downtown Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at a total contract price for the land of $49.0 million ($25.0 million at Aimco's 51% share). Current zoning allows for the development of approximately three million square feet of multifamily homes and commercial space. The land purchase, which closed in January 2022, was funded primarily by a $40.0 million loan ($20.4 million at Aimco's 51% share) that also closed in January 2022.\n\n## Note 4 - Leases\n\n## Revenue from Leases\n\nThe majority of lease payments we receive from our residents and tenants are fixed. We receive variable payments from our residents and commercial tenants primarily for utility reimbursements and other services.\n\nOur total lease income was comprised of the following amounts for all operating leases (in thousands):\n\n|                       | 2021           | 2020         | 2019    |\n|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|---------|\n| Fixed lease income    | $ 157,842    $ | 140,140    $ | 133,180 |\n| Variable lease income | 11,487         | 11,192       | 9,929   |\n| Total lease income    | $ 169,329      | $ 151,332  $ | 143,109 |\n\nIn general, our commercial leases have options to extend for a certain period of time at the tenant's option. Future minimum annual rental payments we will receive under commercial leases, excluding such extension options, are as follows as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\n\n| 2022       | $ 11,469   |\n|------------|------------|\n| 2023       | 8,183      |\n| 2024       | 5,577      |\n| 2025       | 3,308      |\n| 2026       | 1,867      |\n| Thereafter | 1,908      |\n| Total      | $ 32,312   |\n\nGenerally,  our  residential  leases  do  not  provide  extension  options  so  the  average  remaining  term  is  less  than  one  year.  Our  commercial  leases,  as  of December 31, 2021, have an average remaining term of 4.2 years.",

Four  leases  commenced January 1, 2021, two of which have rent escalations that start at the point the property reaches stabilization. Three of the leases have a term of 25 years, and one has a term of 10 years. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we, as lessee, and AIR, as lessor, entered into a finance lease for a 15-acre plot of land in the San Francisco Bay Area on which we began construction of 16 single family rental homes and 8 accessory dwelling units in June 2021. The lease commenced on June 1, 2021, and has a term of 25 years.\n\nWe have provided AIR with residual value guarantees aggregating to $250.8 million, which provide that if the residual value of the leased assets is less than the specified residual value guarantees at the earlier of lease expiration or termination, we are required to pay the difference. See Note 5 for further details.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, operating and financing right-of-use assets of $5.1 million and $429.8 million, respectively, are included in other assets and right-ofuse lease assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2021, amortization related to our finance leases was $8.3 million, net of amounts capitalized. For the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense related to our finance leases was $9.2 million, net of amount capitalized.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, operating and financing right-of-use assets of $5.6 million and $92.7 million, respectively, are included in other assets and right-ofuse lease assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, finance leases related to development projects resulted in no amortization or interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Aimco's operating leases and finance leases have weighted-average remaining terms of 7.4 years, and 38.5 years, respectively, and weighted-average discount rates of 3.1% and 5.4%, respectively.\n\nWhen the rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, we estimate the value of our lease liabilities using discount rates equivalent to the rates we would pay on a secured borrowing with terms similar to the leases. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected to not separate these components for all classes of underlying assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated  balance  sheet.  Leases  with  initial  terms  greater  than  12  months  are  recorded  as  operating  or  financing  leases  on  the  consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into two 99-year ground leases for the land underlying the development site at Upton Place, a mixed-use development project which will create 689 apartment homes and approximately 100,000 square feet of commercial space in upper-northwest Washington, D.C, initially  recording  right-of-use  lease  assets  and  lease  liabilities  of  $92.8  million  and  $86.3  million,  respectively.  We  also  have  a  lease  for  our  corporate  office. Substantially, all of the payments under our ground and office leases are fixed. We exclude options to extend the leases in our minimum lease terms unless the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. We sublease office space within our corporate office to AIR which is reflected in sublease income below. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $1.4 million of sublease income from AIR.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Aimco's ground and office leases have weighted-average remaining terms of 98 years and 7.4 years, respectively, and weightedaverage discount rates of 6.0% and 3.1%, respectively. Combined minimum annual lease payments under operating and financing leases, reconciled to the lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, are as follows (in thousands):\n\n|                         | Sublease Income   | Operating Lease Future Minimum Rent   | Financing Leases Future Minimum Payments   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 2022                    | 1,393   $         | 1,891    $                            | 27,197                                     |\n| 2023                    | 1,403             | 1,922                                 | 27,597                                     |\n| 2024                    | 1,413             | 1,935                                 | 28,597                                     |\n| 2025                    | 1,423             | 1,930                                 | 29,208                                     |\n| 2026                    | 1,433             | 1,960                                 | 30,300                                     |\n| Thereafter              | 3,526             | 4,624                                 | 1,613,950                                  |\n| Total                   | 10,591   $        | 14,262                                | $ 1,756,849                                |\n| Less: Discount          |                   | (1,599)                               | (1,321,756)                                |\n| Total lease liabilities | $                 | 12,663  $                             | 435,093                                    |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we capitalized $22.7 million of lease costs associated with active development and redevelopment projects on certain of the underlying property and ground lease assets.

        "page_content": "## Note 5 - Transactions with AIR\n\nIn  conjunction  with  the  Separation,  we  entered  into  various  separation  and  transition  services  agreements  with  AIR  that  provide  for  a  framework  of  our relationship with AIR after the Separation, including: (i) a separation agreement setting forth the mechanics of the Separation, the key provisions relating to the separation of our assets and liabilities from those of AIR, and certain organizational matters and conditions; (ii) an employee matters agreement to allocate liabilities and  responsibilities  relating  to  employment  matters,  employee  compensation,  benefits  plans  and  programs,  and  other  related  matters  (the  'Employee  Matters Agreement');  (iii)  agreements  pursuant  to  which  AIR  will  provide  property  management  and  related  services  to  us  (collectively,  the  'Property  Management Agreements'); (iv)  an  agreement  pursuant  to  which  AIR  will  provide  us  with  customary  administrative  and  support  services  on  an  ongoing  basis  (the  'Master Services Agreement'); and (v) a master leasing agreement where we may enter into leases with AIR with the option to develop, redevelop, or lease-up the subject leased properties, and under which we will have certain lease termination rights (the 'Master Leasing Agreement').\n\n## Master Services Agreement\n\nWe and AIR entered into a Master Services Agreement, in which AIR will provide us with customary administrative and support services. We are obligated to pay AIR the  fully  burdened  costs  in  performing  the  services.  We  may  terminate  any  or  all  services  on  60  days'  prior  written  notice,  and  AIR  may  terminate individual services, at any time after December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred administrative and support fees of $2.4 million, which are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We did not incur any fees during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Property Management Agreements\n\nWe entered into several Property Management Agreements with AIR, pursuant to which AIR will provide us with certain property management, property accounting  and  related  services  for  the  majority  of  our  operating  properties,  and  we  will  pay  AIR  a  property  management  fee  equal  to  3%  of  each  respective property's revenue collected and such other fees as may be mutually agreed for various other services. The initial term of each Property Management Agreement is one-year, with automatic one-year renewal periods, unless either party elects to terminate at any time upon delivery of 60 days' prior written notice to the other party before the end of the term. Neither party is obligated to pay to the other party a termination fee or other penalty upon such termination.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded property management and property accounting fees of $5.2 million, which we included in property operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. From Separation to December 31, 2020, we recorded property management and property accounting fees of $0.2 million.\n\n## Master Leasing Agreement\n\nThe Master Leasing Agreement governs the current and any future leasing arrangements between us, as lessee and AIR, as lessor. The initial term of the Master Leasing Agreement is 18 months (expiring on or about June 14, 2022), with automatic annual extensions (subject to each party's right to terminate upon notice prior to the end of any such extension term). The Master Leasing Agreement provides that each time the parties thereto wish to execute a lease for a particular property, such parties will cause their applicable affiliates to execute a stand-alone lease. The initial annual rent for any leased property is based on the then-current fair market value of the subject property and market NOI cap rates, subject to certain adjustments, and is further subject to periodic escalation as set forth in the applicable lease, and the other terms thereof, including the initial term and extensions. We have the right to terminate any such lease prior to the end of its term once the leased property is stabilized. In connection with such an early termination, AIR will generally have an option (and not an obligation) to pay us an amount equal to the difference between the property's fair value at stabilization and the initial value of the leasehold interest, at a five percent discount thereto; if AIR does not exercise such option, we will have the right to cause such property to be sold to a third party, with AIR guaranteed to receive an amount equal to the difference between the property's fair market value at stabilization and the initial value of the leasehold interest and we will retain any excess proceeds. In the event of such sale of the property, we may also elect to purchase the property at a purchase price equal to the fair market value as agreed upon at the time of lease inception (and may subsequently sell the property to a third party, subject to AIR's right of first refusal during the first year following our acquisition). If AIR elects not to pay the fee for the development or redevelopment-related improvements, and we decline to purchase the property or cause its sale to a third party, we may elect to rescind our termination of the applicable lease and instead continue such lease in effect in accordance with its terms.\n\n## Notes Payable to AIR\n\nOn December 14, 2020, we entered into $534.1 million of Notes Payable to AIR that are secured by a pledge of the equity interest in the entity that holds a portfolio of assets, however, certain of the assets secure existing senior loans of $242.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The notes mature on January 31, 2024 and bear interest  at  5.2%,  with  accrued  interest  payable  quarterly  on  January  1,  April  1,  July  1  and  October  1,  commencing  on  April  1,  2021.  For  the  years  ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized interest expense of $27.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, associated with the Notes Payable to AIR. We made interest payments of $22.1 million which are included in interest payments on Notes Payable to AIR in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021. Please refer to Note 7 for further details.",

Expenses  allocated  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  and  2019  were  $9.8  million  and  $9.5  million,  respectively.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the expense, the allocation was based on Aimco's relative share of total gross potential revenue, and the relative gross asset value of our communities as compared to the total gross potential revenue and gross asset value of all communities held by Aimco Predecessor, which we believe to be reasonable methodologies. These allocated expenses are centralized corporate costs for management and other services, including, but not limited to, executive oversight, treasury, finance, human resources, tax, accounting, financial reporting, information technology, and investor relations.\n\n## Due to and from AIR\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have amounts due to and from AIR of $15.7 million and $4.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had amounts due to and from AIR of $5.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. The amounts due to AIR primarily consist of invoices paid on our behalf and accrued interest on the Notes Payable to AIR. The amounts due from AIR primarily consist of net cash flows generated by our operating properties.\n\n## Terry Considine Service Agreement/AIR Reimbursement\n\nIn conjunction with the Separation, we entered into an arrangement with AIR with respect to the services of Terry Considine, an Aimco Board member and our former Chief Executive Officer, for services to be rendered by Mr. Considine separate from his services as a Board member, including, but not limited to: (i) short and long-term strategic direction and advice; (ii) transition and executive support to officers; and (iii) advice and consultation with respect to strategic growth and acquisition activities. We are obligated for all base salary, short-term incentive amounts and long-term incentive amounts payable to Mr. Considine for the calendar year 2021 under the terms of his employment agreement with AIR that are in excess of $1 million, collectively.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, our Independent Directors set Mr. Considine's target total compensation for 2021 for the services described above (including base  compensation,  short-term  incentive,  and  long-term  incentive)  at  $1.8  million,  to  be  paid  out  in  cash  and  equity.  In  addition,  we  estimate  the  total  2021 reimbursement to AIR, pursuant to the arrangement described above, to be $4.6 million for a combined total of $6.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $6.2 million of expense in the aggregate pursuant to these arrangements, which is included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2021, $4.6 million is included in the amount due to AIR.\n\n## Sublease with AIR\n\nIn  December  2020,  we  entered  into  a  sublease  arrangement  with  AIR  to  provide  space  within  our  corporate  office,  including  tenant  improvements  and furniture, fixtures and equipment, at then-current market rents. The sublease provides for fixed rents, which commenced on January 1, 2021 and expire on May 31, 2029. Please refer to Note 4 for further information about our sublease income.\n\n## Guarantee Liability\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement, legal liabilities that relate to occurrences prior to the Separation, including environmental liabilities related to properties that were no longer owned by Aimco or AIR at the time of the Separation are borne by Aimco Operating Partnership up to the first $17.5 million of such liabilities, in the aggregate, and borne by AIR Operating Partnership for any such liabilities in excess of $17.5 million.\n\nOn the date of Separation, we recognized a liability of $16.4 million, which represented the present value of the expected future cash flows required to settle the legal liabilities using an estimated market discount rate of 4.25%. The guarantee liability was systematically reduced as costs related to the legal liabilities were incurred.\n\nOn December 30, 2021, we executed an agreement with AIR to fulfill the obligation whereby we transferred funds to AIR in an amount equal the $17.5 million guarantee liability less amounts paid through December 30, 2021, for occurrences prior to the Separation. As a result of the final funding of the guarantee liability in connection with this agreement, we recorded $1.1 million of expense related to the unamortized discount, which is included in other income (expenses), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Acquisitions from AIR\n\nIn February 2021, we acquired from AIR the Benson Hotel and Faculty Club. In August 2021, we acquired from AIR the Eldridge Townhomes. Refer to Note 3 for further details regarding these acquisitions.",

        "page_content": "## Note 6 - Variable Interest Entities\n\nWe evaluate our investments in limited partnerships and similar entities in accordance with the consolidation guidance to determine whether each such entity is a VIE. The accounting standards related to the consolidation of VIEs require qualitative assessments to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary analysis is based on power and economics. We conclude that we are the primary beneficiary and consolidate the VIE if we have both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly influence the VIE's economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Significant judgments and assumptions related to the determinations include, but not limited to, estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\n\nAimco consolidates Aimco Operating Partnership, a VIE of which Aimco is the primary beneficiary. Aimco, through Aimco Operating Partnership, consolidates all VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Aimco are that of Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nThe VIEs that Aimco Operating Partnership consolidates own interests in real estate or commitments to acquire real estate. We are the primary beneficiary for the VIEs because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and have a substantial economic interest. We have six unconsolidated VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary because we are not the decision maker. The six unconsolidated VIEs include four unconsolidated real estate partnerships that hold four apartment communities in San Diego, California, and the Mezzanine Investment.\n\nThe  details  of  our  consolidated  and  unconsolidated  VIEs,  excluding  those  of  Aimco  Operating  Partnership,  are  summarized  in  the  table  below  as  of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except for VIE count).\n\n|                                         | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                         | Consolidated        | Unconsolidated      | Consolidated        | Unconsolidated      |\n| Count of VIEs                           | 9                   | 6                   | 2                   | 6                   |\n| Assets:                                 |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Real estate, net                        | $ 564,909   $       | -   $               | 310,552   $         | -                   |\n| Mezzanine investment                    | -                   | 337,797             | -                   | 307,362             |\n| Right-of-use lease assets               | 429,768             | -                   | 92,709              | -                   |\n| Unconsolidated real estate partnerships | -                   | 13,005              | -                   | 12,829              |\n| Other assets                            | 43,715              | 35,773              | 16,949              | 12,500              |\n| Liabilities:                            |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                | 124,747             | -                   | 7,106               | -                   |\n| Accrued liabilities and other           | 30,519              | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n| Construction loans, net                 | 163,570             | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n| Lease liabilities                       | 435,093             | -                   | 86,781              | -                   |\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, two of our consolidated VIEs closed construction loans. In conjunction with these loans, we made customary guarantees. In certain situations, the lenders may have recourse to our general credit. As of December 31, 2021, we estimate the maximum exposure equals the $168.4 million outstanding loan balances. Other consolidated VIEs' creditors do not have recourse to our general credit.\n\n## Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships\n\nWe own an interest in four apartment communities in San Diego, California, of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our investment balance of $13.0 million and $12.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, represents our maximum exposure to loss in these VIEs.\n\n## Mezzanine Investment\n\nAs discussed in Note 2, AIR owns an interest in a partnership that owns Parkmerced Apartments, of which it is not the primary beneficiary, and under the terms of the Separation Agreement, AIR is obligated to transfer ownership of the subsidiaries that hold this interest to us upon receipt of applicable third-party consent. Our investment balance of $337.8 million and $307.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, represents our indirect interest in notes receivable through our agreement with AIR and our maximum exposure to loss in this VIE.",

        "page_content": "## Note 7 -Debt\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nOn December 16, 2020, we entered into a credit agreement with PNC Bank. The credit agreement provides for a new $150.0 million secured credit facility, a $20.0 million swingline loan sub-facility and a $30.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. We can request incremental commitments under the credit agreement up to an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The credit facility expires on December 2023, but can be extended, at our option, by up to two twelve-month periods, subject to the satisfaction of certain events and covenant metrics. The revolving loans (other than the swingline) will bear interest, at our option, at a per annum rate equal to (a) LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% or (b) a base rate plus a margin of 1.00%. Swingline loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the base rate plus a margin of 1.00%. The base rate is defined as a fluctuating per annum rate of interest equal to the highest of  (x)  the  overnight  bank  funding  rate  as  reported  by  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  New  York,  plus  0.5%,  (y)  PNC  Bank,  National  Association's  prime  rate and (z) the daily LIBOR Rate plus 1.00%. If the LIBOR Rate determined under any referenced method would be less than 0.25%, such rate shall be deemed 0.25%. Aimco may terminate or, from time to time, reduce the aggregate amount of commitments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balance related to the credit facility, the swingline sub-facility or the letter of credit Sub-facility. Total debt issuance costs of approximately $1.9 million were deferred and are presented net of amortization recognized over the term of the facility within other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Under our revolving secured credit facility, we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, minimum adjusted tangible net worth of $625.0 million, and maximum leverage of 60% as defined in the credit agreement, among other customary covenants. We are currently in compliance with these covenants.\n\n## Notes Payable to AIR\n\nOn December  14,  2020,  our  subsidiary,  Aimco  JO  Intermediate  Holdings  LLC  ('Aimco  JO')  entered  into  two  notes  aggregating  to  $534.1  million  in exchange for  an  equity  interest  in  James-Oxford  Limited  Partnership  ('James  Oxford')  a  consolidated  subsidiary  of  Aimco  that  indirectly  owns  a  portfolio  of consolidated real estate assets. The notes are secured by a pledge of the equity interests in James Oxford, however, certain of James Oxford's assets secure existing senior loans of $242.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The notes mature on January 31, 2024 and bear interest at 5.2%, with accrued interest payable quarterly on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized interest expense of $27.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, associated with the Notes Payable to AIR, which is included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations and $6.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in due to affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nUpon a disposition, consolidation, or similar event or transaction, Aimco JO is obligated to prepay the Notes in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds received  in  connection  with  such  transaction  or  casualty  event.  Any  such  prepayment  shall  be  accompanied  by  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  and  a  make-whole amount representing all remaining unpaid interest over the term of the Notes. However, if after giving effect to such transaction or casualty event, the fair market value of all real estate assets owned by James Oxford and its subsidiaries, less senior secured indebtedness (e.g., nonrecourse property debt), exceeds the thenoutstanding principal balance of the Notes, we have the option to reinvest the net cash proceeds within 180 days of such transaction or casualty event by acquiring, leasing, constructing, or improving real property useful in the business of Aimco JO or its subsidiaries that we believe in good faith will enhance or create value. We are not otherwise permitted to prepay the Notes prior to the maturity date.\n\nThe Notes Payable to AIR are senior secured obligations of Aimco JO and rank senior to all other senior obligations of Aimco JO to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral and rank pari passu with all other senior unsubordinated obligations of Aimco JO to the extent the amount of such obligations exceed the value of the underlying collateral. The Notes are not guaranteed and as a result, recourse is limited to Aimco JO, its assets and the underlying collateral pledged to secure Aimco JO's obligations under the Notes. The Notes also contain customary representations, warranties, non-financial covenants and events of default.\n\n## Construction Loans\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  entered  into  a  $150.0  million  variable-rate  non-recourse  construction  loan  collateralized  by  our leasehold interest and AIR's fee ownership interest in Flamingo North Tower. The initial term of the loan is three years and bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 360 basis points subject to a minimum all-in per annum interest rate of 3.85%. As of December 31, 2021, we had $130.3 million of principal outstanding. Certain consolidated subsidiaries have indemnified AIR for any losses it incurs as a result of a default on the loan by Aimco.\n\nAlso,  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  $100.7  million  variable-rate  non-recourse  construction  loan  collateralized  by  our  fee ownership interest in The Hamilton. The initial term of the loan is three years and bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 320 basis points subject to a minimum allin per annum interest rate of 3.45%. As of December 31, 2021, we had $38.1 million of principal outstanding.\n\nIf  LIBOR ceases to exist during the term of these agreements, the documents associated with these agreements contain language to address a transition to another benchmark rate. It is anticipated LIBOR will be replaced with SOFR, however, if SOFR were to not be available the agreements contain alternate provisions.",

The construction loan is secured by the 99-year leasehold  interest  in  the  development  site  and  by  improvements  to  be  constructed  on  the development site. Interest will accrue on the construction loan only when the funds are drawn upon. Funds drawn upon will bear interest at a rate equal to one month LIBOR plus 450 basis points subject to a minimum all-in per annum interest rate of 4.75%. The initial term of the construction loan is fifty-four months, beginning December 23, 2020. The Upton Place joint venture has the option to extend the term for two additional periods of one year each, subject to the satisfaction of certain events and covenant metrics.\n\nTotal debt issuance costs of approximately $7.5 million have been deferred and are presented within other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Non-Recourse Property Debt\n\nWe finance apartment communities in our portfolio primarily using property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing debt.

Therefore, we are  the  accounting  spinee  and  AIR  is  considered  the  divesting  entity  and  treated  as  the  accounting  spinnor,  or  accounting  predecessor.  Since  the  assets, liabilities and operations of Aimco prior to the Separation were spread across multiple legal entities, a separate capital structure did not exist.",

        "page_content": "## Note 10 - Partners' Capital\n\n## Separation from AIR\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Aimco Operating Partnership completed the Separation, which was effected,  in part,  through a pro  rata  distribution  of  all  of  the outstanding common limited partnership units of Aimco Operating Partnership to holders of AIR Operating Partnership common limited partnership units and AIR Operating Partnership Class I High Performance partnership units as of the close of business on December 5, 2020. In addition, stockholders of Aimco received one share of Class A common stock of AIR for every one share of Class A common stock of Aimco held as of the close of business on the record date and received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Class A common stock of AIR.\n\n## Aimco Operating Partnership Partners' Capital\n\n## Common Partnership Units\n\nIn Aimco Operating Partnership's consolidated balance sheets, the common partnership units held by Aimco are classified within Partners' Capital as General Partner and Special Limited Partner capital and the common OP Units are classified within Limited Partners' capital. In Aimco's consolidated balance sheets, the common OP Units are classified within permanent equity as common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership.\n\nCommon partnership units held by Aimco are not redeemable whereas common OP Units are redeemable at the holders' option, subject to certain restrictions, on the basis of one common OP Unit for either one share of Common Stock or cash equal to the fair value of a share of Common Stock at the time of redemption. Aimco has the option to deliver shares of Common Stock in exchange for all or any portion of the common OP Units tendered for redemption. When a limited partner  redeems  a  common  OP Unit for  Common Stock, Limited Partners'  capital  is  reduced,  and  the  General  Partner  and  Special  Limited  Partners'  capital  is increased.\n\nThe holders of the common OP Units receive distributions in an amount equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of Common Stock.\n\n## Note 11 - Earnings and Dividends per Share and per Unit\n\nAimco and Aimco Operating Partnership calculate basic earnings per share of common stock and basic earnings per common unit based on the weightedaverage  number  of  shares  of  common  stock  and  common  partnership  units  outstanding.  We  calculate  diluted  earnings  per  share  of  common  stock  and  diluted earnings per unit taking into consideration dilutive shares of common stock and common partnership unit equivalents and dilutive convertible securities outstanding during the period.\n\nThe shares of common stock and common partnership units outstanding at the Separation date are reflected as outstanding for all periods prior to the Separation for purposes of determining earnings per share and per unit. Each of our executives and AIR's executives received one share of AIV stock and one share of AIR stock at the Separation date for unvested shares. We include AIR's executives' rights to receive AIV shares upon vesting in our dilutive calculations.\n\nOur common stock and common partnership unit equivalents include options to purchase shares of common stock, which, if exercised, would result in Aimco's issuance of additional shares of common stock and Aimco Operating Partnership's issuance to Aimco of additional common partnership units equal to the number of shares of common stock purchased under the options. These equivalents also include unvested Performance-Based Restricted Stock awards that do not meet the definition of participating securities, which would result in an increase in the number of shares of common stock and common partnership units outstanding equal to the number of the shares that vest. Common partnership unit equivalents also include unvested long-term incentive partnership units. We include in the denominator securities with dilutive effect in calculating diluted earnings per share and per unit during these periods.\n\nOur time-based restricted stock awards receive non-forfeitable dividends similar to shares of common stock and common partnership units prior to vesting, and our Performance-Based LTIP I units and Performance-Based LTIP II units receive non-forfeitable distributions based on specified percentages of the distributions paid to common partnership units prior to vesting and conversion. The unvested restricted shares and units related to these awards are participating securities. We include the effect of participating securities in basic and diluted earnings per share and unit computations using the two-class method of allocating distributed and undistributed earnings when the two-class method is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. Participating securities are excluded from our computation of diluted loss per share and unit for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, because the effect of the inclusion would be anti-dilutive.",

Share-Based Compensation\n\nWe have a stock award and incentive program to attract and retain employees and independent directors. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 23.4 million shares were available for issuance under the Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the '2015 Plan'). The total number of shares available for issuance under this plan may increase due to any forfeiture, cancellation, exchange, surrender, termination or expiration of an award outstanding under the 2015 Plan. Awards under the 2015 Plan may be in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, or other types of awards as authorized under the Plan. Our plans are administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board.",

        "page_content": "In connection with the Separation, we entered into an agreement to modify all outstanding awards granted to the holders of such awards. Each outstanding time or performance based Aimco award was converted into one share of Aimco common stock and one share of AIR common stock. Generally, all such Aimco equity awards retain the same terms and vesting conditions as the original Aimco equity awards immediately before the Separation.\n\nFollowing  the  Separation,  compensation  expense  related  to  these  modified  awards  for  the  employees  retained  by  Aimco  is  incurred  by  Aimco.  The compensation expense related to these modified awards for employees of AIR is incurred by AIR.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, total compensation cost recognized for share-based awards was (in thousands):\n\n|                                          | 2021    | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Share-based compensation expense (1)     | $ 3,377 | 1,070  |\n| Capitalized share-based compensation (2) | 340     | 138    |\n| Total share-based compensation (3)       | $ 3,717 | 1,208  |\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our share of total unvested compensation cost not yet recognized was $15.5 million. We expect to recognize this compensation cost over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.2 years.\n\nWe grant stock options and restricted stock awards that are subject to time-based vesting and require continuous employment, typically over a period of four to five years from the grant date, and we refer to these awards as Time-Based Stock Options and Time-Based Restricted Stock, respectively. We also grant stock options, restricted stock awards, and two forms of long-term incentive partnership units ('LTIP units'), that vest conditioned on Aimco's total shareholder return ('TSR'), relative to identified indices  over a forward-looking performance period of three years. We refer to these awards as TSR Stock Options, TSR Restricted Stock, TSR LTIP I units, and TSR LTIP II units. Vested LTIP II units may be converted at the holders' option to LTIP Units for a conversion price over a term of 10 years. Earned TSR-based awards, if any, will generally vest 50% on each of the third anniversary and fourth anniversary of the grant date, based on continued employment. Our Time-Based Stock Options and TSR Stock Options expire generally 10 years from the date of grant.\n\nWe recognize  compensation  cost  associated  with  time-based  awards  ratably  over  the  requisite  service  periods,  which  are  typically  four  to  five  years.  We recognize compensation cost related to the TSR-based awards, which have graded vesting periods, over the requisite service period for each separate vesting tranche of the award, commencing on the grant date. The value of the TSR-based awards takes into consideration the probability that the market condition will be achieved; therefore, previously recorded compensation cost is not adjusted in the event that the market condition is not achieved, and awards do not vest.\n\nWe had Time-Based  Stock  Options,  Time-Based  Restricted  Stock,  TSR  Stock  Options,  TSR  Restricted  Stock,  TSR  LTIP  I  units  and  TSR  LTIP  II  units outstanding as of December 31, 2021.

Under this method, the prices of the indices and shares of our Common Stock were simulated through the end of the performance period. The correlation matrix between shares of our Common Stock and the indices as well as the corresponding return volatilities were developed based upon an analysis of historical data.\n\nThe following table includes the assumptions used for the valuation of TSR-based awards that were granted in 2021.\n\n| TSR-based Award Assumptions                                           | 2021         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Grant date market value of a common share                             | $6.66-$7.10  |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                               | 0.02%-1.22%  |\n| Dividend yield                                                        | 0%           |\n| Expected volatility                                                   | 30.4%-32.29% |\n| Derived vesting period of TSR Restricted Stock                        | 3.0          |\n| Weighted average expected term of TSR Stock Options and LTIP II units | 5.4          |\n\n## Note 13 - Fair Value Measurements\n\n## Recurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nIn 2020, we paid an upfront premium of $12.1 million for the option to enter into a $1.5 billion notional amount interest rate swap at a future date. This interest rate option, or swaption, provides partial protection against exposure to rising interest rates between now and October 2024. We receive a cash settlement in the future if the prevailing interest rate is higher than the 1.68% five-year swap strike price. The amount of future cash settlement is capped if the prevailing interest rate exceeds 2.78%. Alternatively, if interest rates were to decrease below the specified strike price, we would not receive a cash settlement, nor would we have any requirement to make a payment.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid upfront a premium of $5.6 million (including transaction costs) for the option to enter into a $500.0 million notional amount interest rate swap at a future date. This interest rate option, or swaption, provides partial protection against our refinancing interest rate risk relative to our Notes Payable to AIR and is intended to mitigate interest rate increases between now and January 2024. We receive a cash settlement in the future if the prevailing interest rate is higher than the 3% strike price on the five-year swap rate. Alternatively, if interest rates were to decrease below the specified strike price, we would not receive a cash settlement, nor would we have any requirement to make a payment.\n\nFrom time to time, we purchase interest rate caps to provide protection against increases in interest rates on our floating rate debt. The fair value of these interest rate caps is included in the fair value table below.\n\nWe measure at fair value on a recurring basis our interest rate options, which are presented in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our interest rate options  are  classified  within  Level  2  of  the  GAAP  fair  value  hierarchy,  and  we  estimate  their  fair  value  using  pricing  models  that  rely  on  observable  market information,  including  contractual  terms,  market  prices,  and  interest  rate  yield  curves.  The  fair  value  adjustment  is  included  in  earnings  in  unrealized  gains  on interest rate options in our consolidated statements of operations. Changes in fair value are reflected as a non-cash transaction in adjustments to arrive at cash flows from operations, and the upfront premium is reflected in purchase of interest rate option in our consolidated statements of cash flows.",

These  investments  are  measured  at  net  asset  value  ('NAV')  as  a  practical  expedient.  See  Note  1 4 for  further  details  of unfunded commitments.\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of our interest rate options and our investment in real estate technology funds as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\n|                                                | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                | Total                     | Level 1                   | Level 2                   | Level 3                   | Total                     | Level 1                   | Level 2                   | Level 3                   |\n| Interest rate option                           | $ 25,449                  | $                         | -   $ 25,449              | $ -   $                   | 13,315                    | $ -   $                   | 13,315                    | $ -                       |\n| Investment in real estate technology funds (1) | $ 9,613                   | $ -   $                   |                           | -   $ -   $               | 2,293                     | $ -   $                   | -   $                     | -                         |\n\n## Fair Value Disclosures\n\nWe believe that the carrying value of the consolidated amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivables and payables approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, due to their relatively short-term nature and high probability of realization. We estimate the fair value of our nonrecourse  property  debt,  construction  loans,  and  Notes  Payable  to  AIR  using  an  income  and  market  approach,  including  comparison  of  the  contractual  terms  to observable and unobservable inputs such as market interest rate risk spreads, contractual interest rates, remaining periods to maturity, debt service coverage ratios, and loan to value ratios. We classify the fair value of our non-recourse property debt and construction loans within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy based on the significance of certain of the unobservable inputs used to estimate its fair value.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Notes Payable to AIR approximated their fair value at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe following table summarizes carrying value and fair value of our non-recourse property debt and construction loans debt as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\n|                            | 2021 As of December 31, 2021   | 2021 As of December 31, 2021   | 2020 As of December 31, 2020   | 2020 As of December 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                            | Carrying Value                 | Fair Value                     | Carrying Value                 | Fair Value                     |\n| Non-recourse property debt | $ 484,883                      | 498,960                        | $ 449,510    $                 | 467,010                        |\n| Construction loans debt    | $ 168,376                      | 168,376                        | -                              | -                              |\n\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nImmediately following the Separation, we tested our right of use assets, tenant improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and our internally developed software  for  impairment.  We  concluded  that  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  related  assets  no  longer  exceeded  their  carrying  values  and  recorded  an  aggregate impairment  of  $15.9  million.  The  fair  value  determination  included  assumptions  based  on  Level  3  inputs.  See  Note  2  for  further  details.  There  were  no  such impairments in 2021 or 2019.\n\n## Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Commitments\n\nIn connection with our development, redevelopment and other capital additions activities, we have entered into various construction-related contracts, and we have made commitments to complete development and redevelopment of certain real estate, pursuant to financing or other arrangements. As of December 31, 2021, our commitments related to these capital activities totaled approximately $265.5 million, most of which we expect to incur during the next 24 months.\n\nWe enter  into  certain  commitments  for  future  purchases  of  goods  and  services  in  connection  with  the  operations  of  our  apartment  communities.  Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.\n\nWe have a commitment to fund an additional $14.2 million to IQHQ, which was funded subsequent to year end. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, we contributed a total of $23.3 million and $12.5 million, respectively. We also have unfunded commitments related to four investments in privately held entities that develop technology related to the real estate industry. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, we contributed a total of $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, to these technology funds, leaving an additional funding commitment in the amount of $3.2 million as of December 31, 2021, the timing of which is uncertain.",

While the outcome of the legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes there are no legal proceedings pending that would have a material effect upon on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Note 15 - Business Segments\n\nWe have three segments: (i) Development and Redevelopment, (ii) Operating, and (iii) Other.\n\nOur Development and Redevelopment segment consists of properties that are under construction or have not achieved stabilization, as well as land assemblages that  are  being  held  for  development  adjacent  to  The  Hamilton  community  and  other  land  purchases.  Our  Operating  segment  includes  24  residential  apartment communities that have achieved stabilized  level  of  operations  as  of  January  1,  2020  and  maintained  it  throughout  the  current  year  and  comparable  period.  We aggregate all our apartment communities that have reached stabilization into our Operating segment. Our Other segment consists of properties that are not included in our Developments and Redevelopment or Operating segments. We realigned our segments during the fourth quarter of 2020 and have restated the historical periods prior to the realignment to conform with current segment presentation.\n\nOur chief operating decision maker ('CODM') uses cash flow, construction timeline to completion and actual versus budgeted results to evaluate our properties in  our  Development  and  Redevelopment  segments.  Our  CODM  uses  proportionate  property  net  operating  income  to  assess  the  operating  performance  of  our Operating segment. Proportionate property net operating income is defined as our share of rental and other property revenues, excluding reimbursements, less direct property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements, for consolidated communities. In our consolidated statements of operations, utility reimbursements are included in rental and other property revenues, in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our Development and Redevelopment segment includes five real estate investments: Upton Place, The Hamilton, the Benson Hotel, land parcels adjacent to The Hamilton community and land purchased in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Development and Redevelopment segment also includes our five leased properties of which, two are under construction and three are in lease-up but have not achieved stabilization. Our Operating segment includes 24 consolidated apartment communities with 6,067 apartment homes. Our Other segment includes our recent Eldridge Townhomes acquisition, stabilized but not owned for the comparable reporting period, and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, our only office building.\n\nThe following tables present the revenues, proportionate property net operating income, and income before income tax benefit (expense) of our segments on a proportionate basis for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands). Prior carve out amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reconcile the difference between non-recurring carve out accounting and current results as it relates to insurance expense, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  This  adjustment  ensures  comparability  of  post-Separation  results  to  pre-Separation  segment  results.  Absent  the  adjustment,  2021  NOI  would  have increased 6.9%.\n\n|                                                               | Development and Redevelopment   | Operating   | Other    | Proportionate and Other Adjustments (1)   | Corporate and Amounts Not Allocated to Segments   | Consolidated   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Year ended December 31, 2021:                                 |                                 |             |          |                                           |                                                   |                |\n| Rental and other property revenues                            | $ 12,418                        | $ 136,250   | $ 14,317 | $ 6,851                                   | $ -                                               | $ 169,836      |\n| Property operating expenses                                   | 7,931                           | 43,463      | 4,207    | 6,727                                     | 5,285                                             | 67,613         |\n| Other operating expenses not allocated    to segments (2)     | -                               | -           | -        | -                                         | 117,863                                           | 117,863        |\n| Total operating expenses                                      | 7,931                           | 43,463      | 4,207    | 6,727                                     | 123,148                                           | 185,476        |\n| Proportionate property net operating       income (loss)      | 4,487                           | 92,787      | 10,110   | 124                                       | (123,148)                                         | (15,640)       |\n| Other items included in loss before    income tax benefit (3) | -                               | -           | -        | -                                         | (2,910)                                           | (2,910)        |\n| Income (loss) before income tax benefit                       | $ 4,487                         | $ 92,787    | $ 10,110 | $ 124                                     | $ (126,058)      $                                | (18,550)       |",

        "page_content": "Exhibit 4.1\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF AIMCO CLASS A COMMON STOCK\n\n## General\n\nAimco's charter authorizes the issuance of up to 510,587,500 shares of capital stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, all of which are currently classified as Class A common stock. The Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol 'AIV.' Computershare Trust Company, N.A. serves as transfer agent and registrar of the Class A common stock.\n\nHolders of shares of the Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if, when and as declared by Aimco's Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefor. The holders of shares of Class A common stock, upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of or any distribution of the assets of Aimco, are entitled to receive ratably any assets remaining after payment in full of all liabilities of Aimco and any liquidation preferences of preferred stock. The shares of Class A common stock possess voting rights for the election of directors of Aimco and in respect of other corporate matters, each share entitling the holder thereof to one vote. Holders of shares of Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, which means that holders of more than 50% of the shares of Class A common stock voting for the election of directors can elect all of the directors if they choose to do so and the holders of the remaining shares cannot elect any directors. Holders of shares of Class A common stock do not have preemptive rights, which means that they have no right to acquire any additional shares of Class A common stock that may be issued by Aimco at a subsequent date.\n\n## Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer\n\nFor Aimco to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, not more than 50% in value of its outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year, and the shares of capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Because Aimco's Board of Directors believes that it is essential for Aimco to continue to qualify as a REIT and to provide additional protection for Aimco's stockholders in the event of certain transactions, Aimco's Board of Directors has adopted provisions of the charter restricting the acquisition of shares of Class A common stock.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions specified in the charter, no holder may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of various attribution and constructive ownership provisions of the Code and Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, more than 8.7% (or 15% in the case of certain pension trusts described in the Code, investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or Mr. Considine) of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock. For purposes of calculating the amount of stock owned by a given individual, the individual's Class A common stock and interests in the Aimco OP L.P. are aggregated. Under certain conditions, Aimco's Board of Directors may waive the ownership limit. However, in no event may such holder's direct or indirect ownership of Class A common stock exceed (i) 12% of the total outstanding shares of Class A common stock, in the case of a person subject to the general 8.7% ownership limit, or (ii) 20% of the total outstanding shares of Class A common stock, in the case of an entity subject to the 15% ownership limit (although the 15% ownership limitation applicable to Mr. Considine may not be waived). As a condition of such waiver, the Aimco Board of Directors may require opinions of counsel satisfactory to it or an undertaking from the applicant with respect to preserving the REIT status of Aimco. If shares of Class A common stock in excess of the ownership limit, or shares of Class A common stock that would cause the REIT to be beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons, or that would result in Aimco being 'closely held,' within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code, or that would otherwise result in Aimco failing to qualify as a REIT, are issued or transferred to any person, such issuance or transfer shall be null and void to the intended transferee, and the intended transferee would acquire no rights to the stock. Shares of Class A common stock transferred in excess of the ownership limit or other applicable limitations will automatically be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more qualifying charitable organizations to be designated by Aimco. Shares transferred to such trust will remain outstanding, and the trustee of the trust will have all voting and dividend rights pertaining to such shares. The trustee of such trust may transfer",

        "page_content": "such shares to a person whose ownership of such shares does not violate the ownership limit or other applicable limitation. Upon a sale of such shares by the trustee, the interest of the charitable beneficiary will terminate, and the sales proceeds would be paid, first, to the original intended transferee, to the extent of the lesser of (1) such transferee's original purchase price (or the market value of such shares on the date of the violative transfer if purportedly acquired by gift or devise) and (2) the price received by the trustee, and, second, any remainder to the charitable beneficiary. In addition, shares of stock held in such trust are purchasable by Aimco for a 90-day period at a price equal to the lesser of the price paid for the stock by the original intended transferee (or the original market value of such shares if purportedly acquired by gift or devise) and the market price for the stock on the date that Aimco determines to purchase the stock. The 90-day period commences on the date of the violative transfer or the date that Aimco's Board of Directors determines in good faith that a violative transfer has occurred, whichever is later. All certificates representing shares of Class A common stock bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above.\n\nAll persons who own, directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code and Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, more than a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock must file a written statement or an affidavit with Aimco containing the information specified in the Aimco charter within 30 days after January 1 of each year. In addition, each stockholder shall upon demand be required to disclose to Aimco in writing such information with respect to the direct, indirect and constructive ownership of shares as Aimco's Board of Directors deems appropriate or necessary to comply with the provisions of the Code applicable to a REIT or to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental agency.\n\nThese restrictions on ownership and transfer of Class A common stock will not apply if Aimco's Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in the best interests of Aimco to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT or that compliance is no longer required for Aimco to qualify as a REIT. The restrictions on ownership and transfer of Class A common stock described above could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for Aimco's Class A common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of Aimco's stockholders.\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF AIMCO PREFERRED STOCK\n\n## General\n\nUnder its charter, Aimco may issue, from time to time, shares of one or more classes or series of preferred stock. The particular terms of any class or series of preferred stock issued will be determined by Aimco's Board of Directors.\n\nAimco's charter authorizes the issuance of up to 510,587,500 shares of capital stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, all of which are classified as Class A common stock. There are currently no shares of Aimco's preferred stock authorized, issued, and outstanding.  The Board of Directors of Aimco is authorized to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock into shares of preferred stock by setting or changing in any one or more respects the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of such shares of capital stock, including, but not limited to, ownership restrictions consistent with the ownership limit with respect to each class or series of capital stock, and the number of shares constituting each class or series, and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any such class or series, to the extent permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, and Aimco's charter.\n\nAimco's Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, may issue preferred stock with voting, conversion, or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of Class A common stock. Preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change of control or make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of Class A common stock, may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Class A common stock, and could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control of Aimco or other corporate action.",
