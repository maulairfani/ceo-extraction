These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent only the Bank's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside the Bank's control. The words 'anticipate', 'believe', 'estimate', 'expect', 'intend', 'plan', 'predict', 'target', 'forecast', 'guideline', 'should', 'project' and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. It is possible that the Bank's actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nInformation regarding important factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those in the Bank's  forward-looking  statements  appear  in  a  number  of  places  in  this  Annual  Report,  principally  in  Item  3.  'Key Information - D. Risk Factors' and Item 5. 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects'. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) changes in general economic, business, political, social, fiscal or other conditions in Colombia, or in any of the other countries where the Bank operates; taking into account (A) that despite the economic recovery from the crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic driven by rapid progress on vaccination, strong consumer spending, and leaps forward on digitalization,  economic  challenges  persist,  therefore  it  is  important  for  organizations  to  anticipate  and  to manage risks, which were amplified by the pandemic with impacts such as rising commodity prices, inflation, debt, social divisions, and geopolitical tensions; and (B) the recent outbreak of armed conflict in Eastern Europe, which is expected to impact the prices of energy raw materials and agricultural inputs, and would imply new pressures on the cost of living; (ii) changes in capital markets or in markets in general that may affect policies or attitudes towards lending; (iii) unanticipated increases in financing and other costs or the inability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on attractive terms; (iv) continued  increases  in  inflation  or  prolonged  inflation,  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  and/or  interest  rates;  (v) sovereign risks; (vi) liquidity risks; (vii) increases in delinquencies by the Bank's borrowers; (viii) lack of acceptance of new products or services by the Bank's targeted customers; (ix) competition in the banking, financial services, credit card services, insurance, asset management, remittances, business and other industries in which the Bank operates; (x) adverse determination of legal or regulatory disputes or proceedings and the consequences thereof (including without limitation, actions taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic); (xi) changes in official policies, regulations and the Colombian government's banking policy as well as changes in laws, regulations or policies in other jurisdictions in which the Bank does  business;  (xii)  the  negative  impact  on  operations  and  financial  results  of  the  Bank  due  to  widespread  health emergencies, infectious diseases or pandemics, such as COVID-19; (xiii) factors specific to the Bank, including changes to the estimates and assumptions underlying our financial statements; our success in identifying risks (such as the incidence of loan delinquencies) and managing risks; our inability to achieve our financial and capital targets which may result in failure to achieve any of the expected benefits of our strategies; model limitations or failures including, without limitation, the impact that COVID -19 may have on the performance and utilization of our models which may require us to establish additional loan loss reserves or raise additional capital; a reduction in our credit ratings, which would decrease our funding availability; failure to achieve regulatory stress testing; and changes to the reliability and security of our data management, data privacy, information and technology infrastructure, including cyber attack threats which may impact our ability to serve clients.\n\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are subject to change, and the Bank does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events arising after the date of this Annual Report.",

Accordingly, decreases in the growth rate, periods of negative growth, increases in inflation, changes in policy,  or  future  judicial  interpretations  of  policies  involving  exchange  controls  and  other  matters  such  as  currency depreciation, inflation, interest rates, taxation, banking laws and regulations and other political or economic developments in such jurisdictions may affect the overall business environment and may, in turn, negatively affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.",

        "page_content": "In particular, the governments of Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala have historically exercised substantial influence on their economies, and they are likely to continue to implement policies that will have significant impacts on the business and results of operations of companies in such countries (including the Bank), market conditions, and prices and rates of return on securities of local issuers (including the Bank's securities). Potential changes in laws, public policies and regulations may cause instability and volatility in Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala, and their respective markets. This is especially important for Colombia, that will have presidential elections in May 2022. There is a risk of a change in the way in which the country's economic policies are conducted, which may possibly have adverse effects on public  finance,  such  as  high  budget  deficits  and  increasing  debt  levels,  economic  growth  and  inflation.  Future developments in government policies could negatively affect the Bank's business and financial condition and the market value of its securities.\n\nThe downgrade of El Salvador's sovereign rating to CCC from B on February 9, 2022 by Fitch implies a higher borrowing cost in the local and external debt market, because of the higher perception of risk in the country. This credit downgrade may lead to increasing fiscal pressure over domestic debt levels for 2022 and beyond. According to the FocusEconomics consensus, public debt in El Salvador (as a % of GDP) is predicted to drop slightly this year from 87.6% in 2021 to 87.3%. In other words, short-term levels of public debt will remain high and may lead to negative perceptions by international investors regarding the country and its prospects, especially given the multiple sources of uncertainty.\n\nIn the mid-term, our expectation is that the debt-to-GDP will begin to increase again starting in 2023 due to the high fiscal deficits and higher borrowing cost. This in turn will lead to increased needs for financial resources, in the face of more challenging access to multilateral funding, mainly from the IMF. In light of all of the foregoing, we expect more downside risk related to the public finances and economic performance of El Salvador in the medium-term.\n\nMoreover, the adoption of Bitcoin as El Salvador legal tender may negatively affect the financial system due to the high volatility  of  that  asset.  Furthermore,  the  decision  to  adopt  Bitcoin  as  legal  tender  has  led  to  a  deterioration  in  the relationships between El Salvador's Government and some multilateral organizations (such as IMF). This has also led to increased concerns that the extension of a potential financing program from the IMF to El Salvador between 2022-2023 will  not  go  ahead.  In  addition,  the  possible  issuance  of  public  debt  in  this  cryptocurrency  would  begin  to  expose  the government's liabilities and payment commitments to its volatility. Thus, the adoption of Bitcoin not only represents risks for the financial stability of the country, but also potentially will lead to additional pressures on public finances. To date, the adoption of Bitcoin among companies and households in the country continues to be low, reducing the magnitude of the potential risks to which the country is exposed in the short term. Going forward, as the use of Bitcoin becomes more widespread, the potential impact of the risks will also grow.\n\nChanges in the political and regulatory environment in El Salvador may adversely affect the financial performance of the subsidiaries located in this country, and it is likely that in 2022 an impairment in the goodwill recognized in the financial statements of Grupo Bancolombia will have to be recorded.\n\nThe economies of the countries in which the Bank operates are vulnerable to external effects that could be caused by  significant  economic  difficulties  experienced  by  their  major  regional  trading  partners  or  by  more  general contagion effects stemming from either economic or geopolitical shocks, which could have a material adverse effect on economic growth in these countries and their ability to service their public debt.\n\nA significant decline in economic growth or a sustained economic downturn of any of Colombia, Panama, El Salvador or Guatemala's major trading partners (i.e., the European Union, the United States, China and other Latin American countries for Colombia; and the United States and European Union for Panama, Guatemala and El Salvador) could have a material adverse impact on Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala's balance of trade and remittances inflows, resulting in lower economic growth.\n\nDeterioration in the economic and political situation in neighboring countries could adversely affect the economy and cause  instability  in  Colombia,  Panama,  El  Salvador  and  Guatemala  by  disrupting  their  diplomatic  or  commercial relationships with neighboring countries. Any future tensions may cause political and economic uncertainty, instability, market volatility, low confidence levels and higher risk aversion by investors and market participants that may negatively affect economic activity in any of those jurisdictions.",

One of the greatest impacts would be the potential for increased prices for energy raw materials and agricultural items, segments in which Ukraine and Russia together have a significant share in world production and trade. While it is possible that high prices for energy raw materials may positively impact the trade balance, exchange rate and the fiscal balance of Colombia, such high prices would predominantly have an adverse impact on the economies of Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala, which are net importers of fuels. In addition, the decreased availability of certain agricultural items could lead to new pressures on the cost of living in all countries.\n\nIn addition to the shocks mentioned above, additional global supply chain constraints are expected. First, the contractionary monetary policies that most countries in the world have implemented will lead to a decrease in aggregate demand, reducing the pressures on supply chains experienced last year. On the other hand, the reduction of supply of certain products as previously mentioned, due to the conflict in Ukraine and Russia, and the lock-downs in various Chinese cities as a result of the zero covid policy implemented by that country, are generating supply pressures supply due to the in availability of ships to load and unload merchandise. As a result, the supply chain crisis is expected to persist during 2022, affecting the Bank's clients through the general cost of production and cost of living and therefore the Bank's financial results.\n\nFinally, if the Russian/Ukrainian conflict continues or grows in severity, it could lead to global instability and negatively affect European economies, including those of certain important trading partners for Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala, reducing demand for exports other than commodities.\n\n## Any additional taxes resulting from changes to tax regulations or the interpretation thereof in countries where the Bank operates, could adversely affect the Bank's consolidated results.\n\nUncertainty related to tax legislation represents a constant  risk for the Group. Changes in legislation, regulation, and developments resulting from judicial judgments, could affect the tax burdens by increasing tax rates and fees, creating new taxes, limiting deductions and exemptions, and eliminating incentives and non-taxed income.\n\nAmong other things, even though the Bank does not normally adopt aggressive positions on tax law interpretation, the national or local tax authorities may not apply the tax law in the same way that we expected. Different interpretations of tax regulations could result in future tax audits, litigation and associated costs, which could negatively affect our results.\n\nIn addition, on September 14, 2021 the Colombian Congress issued a tax reform that includes new measures that have had significant impacts on our operations, our clients and our shareholders. The aforementioned measures include, among others, the increase in the tax rate for Corporate Income Tax ('CIT') purposes and a surcharge which negatively affects our results of operations and cash flow.\n\n## Colombia and El Salvador have experienced several periods of violence and instability that could affect the economy and the Bank.\n\nColombia has experienced periods of criminal violence over the past four decades, primarily due to the activities of guerilla groups and drug cartels, such us the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ('Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia' or 'FARC') and the National Liberation Army ('Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional' or 'ELN'). Despite the peace treaty between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ('Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias  de  Colombia'  or  'FARC'),  a  lasting  decrease  in  violence  or  drug-related  crime  in  Colombia  or  the successful integration of former guerilla members into Colombian society, may not be achieved. An escalation of violence or drug-related crime may have a negative impact on the Colombian economy and on the Bank.\n\nAlso, in El Salvador, the increase in violence led the legislative assembly on March 27, 2022 to adopt certain exceptional measures, conferring certain powers on the executive and suspending certain constitutional guarantees.",

Furthermore,  proven  or  alleged wrongdoings could have adverse effects on the political and economic stability of such countries. These adverse political and economic effects may negatively impact our business, including by depressing business volumes, reducing our ability to recover amounts we have loaned to persons or projects involved in illicit or allegedly illicit conduct and/or harming our reputation.\n\n## Risk Factors relating to the Bank's Business and the Banking Industry\n\n## Our financial results may be negatively affected by changes to accounting standards.\n\nWe report our results and financial position in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (hereinafter, IASB), as well as the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (hereinafter, IFRS-IC). Changes to IFRS or interpretations thereof may cause our future reported results and financial position to differ from current expectations. Such changes may also affect our regulatory capital and financial ratios. We monitor potential accounting changes and, when possible, we determine their potential impact and disclose significant future changes in our financial statements that we expect as a result of those changes. Currently, there are a number of issued but not yet effective IFRS changes, that could be expected to impact our reported results, financial position  and  regulatory  capital  in  the  next  several  years.  For  further  information  about  developments  in  financial accounting and reporting standards, see Note 2. Significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Our financial results may be negatively affected by changes to assumptions supporting the value of our goodwill\n\nWe test for impairment, at least annually, the goodwill that we have recognized with respect to the financial positions of our operating segments. Our impairment test in respect of the assets recognized as of December 31, 2021 indicated that our goodwill balances are not impaired. The impairment test requires that we make assumptions regarding estimated earnings, discount rates and long-term growth rates impacting the recoverable amount of the goodwill associated with each operating segment and on estimates of the carrying amounts of the operating segments to which the goodwill relates; also, the impairment test requires that we analyze the macroeconomic and political environment of the geographies in which each cash-generating unit ('CGUs') is located. If the actual results in future periods deviate from the earnings and other assumptions on which our impairment testing is based, the value of the goodwill in any one or more of our businesses may become impaired in the future, resulting in expense charges.\n\nFrom 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 triggered exceptional volatility in the financial markets. Accordingly, in connection with the evaluation of economic budgets, forecasts and other assumptions commonly used to determine the recoverable value of goodwill, the Bank considered various macroeconomic circumstances and ran multiple weighted scenarios for assessing the expected future cash flows for each CGU, taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19. However, depending on the time it takes for economic activity to return to pre COVID-19 levels and the uncertainty thereof, there could be adverse impacts on goodwill in future years.\n\nFor further information, see Note 2. Significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Our financial results may be negatively affected by macroeconomic and other challenges and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected all of the regions and countries where the Bank operates. There is still a moderate degree of uncertainty about the future direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. The spread of COVID-19 and resulting government controls and restrictions implemented globally have caused an increase in the production costs of goods and services, which are still being experienced, and disruptions in  supply  chains,  which  have  contributed  to  rising  inflationary  pressures  and  market  volatility.

        "page_content": "macroeconomic and epidemiological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the countries where the Bank operates were less pronounced than was experienced during 2020, despite the appearance and global expansion of the omicron variant, which caused a period of uncertainty in global financial markets. Although governments have provided more focused responses to control outbreaks and vaccination programs are positively progressing to gradually cover a larger part of the population, an upward trend in infections level began to be observed as of December 31, 2021, due to the new omicron variant.\n\nThe Bank took prudential  measures  to  assess  (a)  whether  uncertainties  arose  as  to  the  ability  to  continue  generating revenues  from  contracts  with  customers  and  commissions,  (b)  going  concern  considerations  in  relation  to  liquidity, regulatory capital requirements and concentrations of market risk, (c) whether fair value adjustments were necessary for financial  instruments,  (d)  any  potential  impact  on  the  carrying  value  of  goodwill  and  non-financial  assets,  (e)  the measurement of the impact of changes in loan terms agreed with customers, and (f) whether a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) has occurred for its financial assets. The methodology to estimate expected credit losses has been adjusted to incorporate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic factors and market conditions and has required ongoing monitoring. However, despite the adjustments made to the model, there can be no assurance that the Bank will not recognize unexpected future losses arising from increases in credit risk resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank continues to provide customer support through credit relief and concessions.\n\nThe Bank could face additional challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including legal and reputational risk due to the increase in the level of customer complaints due to service deficiencies caused by the increase in the use of digital channels and scrutiny regarding the implementation of its initiatives to provide relief to clients affected by the pandemic.\n\nFor further information about the current impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's performance and financial position as of December 31, 2021, see Note 2. Significant accounting policies and Note 31. Risk management to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Changes in banking regulations in Colombia and in other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates could adversely affect the Bank's consolidated results.\n\nBanking regulations in Colombia and other jurisdictions where the Bank operates, have a material effect on the Bank's business and operations. Banking regulations may change frequently, and changes may be adopted or regulations may be interpreted in a way that may have an adverse effect on the Bank's business. Also, the political climate in the region could result  in  populism  and  instability  that  may  support  further  regulation  regarding  financial  institutions.  In  addition,  the increasing tendency towards the enhancement of financial consumer protection standards among legislators, regulators and courts, could result in additional costs for our operations.\n\nLaw 2157 of 2021, enacted in October of 2021, reformed the Habeas financial data law, and seeks to extend, among other things, relief to people who have negative credit bureau reports by establishing new limits on how long information may be retained and amnesty for those who catch up on their defaulted credit obligations. These changes could cause increases in credit risk and cost of credit, as well as problem related to the lack of historical credit information. We are currently evaluating what impact this reform might have on our internal credit risk models.\n\nIn addition, the Colombian Government is preparing a regulatory proposal that would implement the international standard of the Basel Committee on Large Exposures (Large Exposures, or LEX). This rule would modify the current rules of legal lending limits and would establish a 25% exposure limit of the Tier 1 Capital with respect to the same counterparty or groups of connected counterparties. We have evaluated how these new limits might impact corporate clients. However, the precise impact will depend on the final terms of the regulatory proposal to be issued by the Ministry of Finance in 2022.",

These banking authorities have broad powers to adopt regulations and impose other requirements affecting or restricting virtually all aspects of the Bank's capitalization, organization and operations, including the imposition of anti-money laundering measures and the authority to regulate the terms and conditions on which the Bank can extend credit. In the event of non-compliance with applicable regulations, the Bank could be subject to fines, sanctions or the revocation of licenses or permits to operate its business. In Colombia, for instance, if the Bank encounters significant financial problems or becomes insolvent or in danger of becoming insolvent, banking authorities would have the power to take over the Bank's management and operations. Any sanctions, fines or other penalties resulting from non-compliance with regulations in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama and other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates could materially and adversely affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\n\n## Future restrictions on interest rates or banking fees could negatively affect the Bank's profitability.\n\nIn prior years, the regulators of the jurisdictions in which the Bank operates have considered various legislative and/or regulatory initiatives regarding banking fees. Although most such initiatives have not been adopted in the past, there might be  renewed  attempts  to  impose  restrictions  on  banking  fees  in  the  future.  If  we  are  prohibited  or  otherwise  limited (including by limits with respect to pricing) from continuing to charge our clients for certain products or services, including specified types of transactions, or from imposing charges for products or services that might be introduced in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## The tax haven regulation in the countries where the Bank operates could adversely affect its business and financial results.\n\n## Colombian tax rules:\n\nDecree 1966 of 2014, as modified by Decree 2095 of 2014 and Decree 1625 of 2016 designated 37 territories as noncooperative jurisdictions or places of null or minimum taxation (tax havens) for Colombian tax purposes, although neither Panama nor other countries in which the Bank operates, were included on this list. Twenty out of the 37 territories have signed  the  convention  on  mutual  administrative  assistance  in  tax  matters.  Additionally,  10  territories  carried  out  an effective exchange of information with Colombia as of December 31, 2018 (Ruling 91 of 2019 Colombian tax authority).\n\nAs a result of the tax haven regulation, the Bank's clients who are residents in the 37 territories would be subject to a 35% withholding  tax  rate  on  interest  and  dividends  derived  from  investments  in  the  Colombian  securities  market  (nondeductibility of payments made to such residents or entities located in tax havens could not proceed unless the required tax amount has been withheld).\n\nSimilarly, the tax haven regulation states that these kinds of transactions are subject to the transfer pricing regime. As a result, the Bank must file a transfer pricing report and an informative return for such transactions, regardless of the amount. Additional information disclosure requirements for transactions with related companies could be requested by the tax authorities,  any  of  which  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  Bancolombia's  business  and  financial  results  due  to  the disallowance of certain costs and expenses.\n\nAdditionally, these transactions could increase the probability of a tax audit by the Colombian authorities.\n\nIn order to avoid Panama's designation as a tax haven, Colombia and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding which  states  that  both  countries  will  negotiate  a  Double  Taxation  Treaty  (DTT).  This  treaty  is  expected  to  include provisions regarding the exchange of information between Colombian and Panamanian tax authorities.",

Deductions for these expenses cannot be included in the corporate income tax return in case the tax amount has not been withheld.\n\nMoreover, transactions with tax havens territories are subject to the transfer pricing regime and El Salvador does not have a double taxation treaty with any country classified as a tax haven. The Salvadoran tax administration lists the territories and countries considered as tax havens.\n\n## Guatemala considerations:\n\nGuatemala does not have regulation on tax havens.\n\n## The Bank and most of its Subsidiaries are subject to the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 and the OECD's Automatic Exchange of Information - Common Reporting Standard (CRS).\n\nBancolombia and most of its subsidiaries are considered foreign financial institutions ('FFIs') under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 ('FATCA') (see 'Item 4. Information on the Company  - B. Business Overview - B.8. Supervision and Regulation - International regulations applicable to Bancolombia and its subsidiaries'). Additionally, Bancolombia  and  some  of  its  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  the  reporting  obligations  derived  from  the  conventions  that implement the Common Reporting Standard ('CRS') approved by the OECD.\n\nGiven the size and the scope of the Bank's international operations, we have taken measures and implemented procedures aimed at complying with FATCA and CRS, including transmitting to the relevant authorities the reports required under FATCA and CRS.\n\nHowever, if the Bank cannot satisfy the requirements thereunder, certain payments to Bancolombia, or its Subsidiaries, may be subject to withholding under FATCA or other penalties imposed by each government. The possibility of such withholding or penalties and the need for accountholders and investors to provide certain information may discourage some customers or potential customers from banking with us, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations and financial  condition.  In  addition,  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  intergovernmental  agreements  ('IGA'),  particular agreements entered into with the IRS, the international conventions signed for the exchange of information under CRS, and the laws or any other regulations enforced in the relevant jurisdictions may increase our compliance costs. Legislation and  regulations  implementing  FATCA  and  CRS  in  some  of  the  countries  in  which  the  Bank  operates  remain  under development, and the reporting dates vary depending on the jurisdiction.\n\n## The Bank may be exposed to increased costs and liabilities in the event of the failure of its services providers to perform their obligations under key services contracts.\n\nThe Bank enters into contracts with third parties who provide certain key services that are essential to its business. These services  include  online  banking  platforms,  data  processing  and  payment  services,  clearing  and  settlement  services, software for processing credit and debit card services, and technological infrastructure, among others. The Bank faces the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on such third-party vendors for certain components of its systems.\n\nWhile  the  Bank  conducts  due  diligence  prior  to  engaging  with  third  party  service  providers  and  performs  ongoing monitoring of vendor controls, it does not control their operations. If any of the Bank's key service providers fail to fulfill any  of  their  contractual  obligations  or  causes  disruptions  in  services,  (including,  failure  to  handle  current  or  higher volumes, or poor performance of services and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations), the Bank's ability",

In  addition,  the  Bank  may  be  required  to  incur  significant  additional  costs  to  find  replacement  providers. Furthermore,  the  unavailability  of  the  services  provided  by  some  technology  and  other  vendors  could  result  in  the unavailability of certain channels through which our clients execute transactions with us until a replacement provider is engaged,  which  could  result  in  lost  revenue,  additional  costs  and,  potentially,  adverse  regulatory  consequences  and reputational harm.\n\n## The Bank is subject to credit risk and estimating exposure to credit risk involves subjective and complex judgments.\n\nA number of our products expose the Bank to credit risk. These products include loans, financial leases, guarantees and lending commitments.\n\nThe Bank estimates and establishes reserves for credit risk and potential credit losses. This process involves subjective and complex judgments, including projections of economic conditions and assumptions about the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. This process is also subject to human error as the Bank's employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit risk rating to a client, which may result in the Bank's exposure to a higher credit risk than one indicated by the Bank's risk rating system. The Bank may not be able to timely detect these risks before they materialize, or due to limited resources or available infrastructure, the Bank's employees may not be able to effectively implement its credit risk management system, which may increase the Bank's exposure to credit risk. Moreover, the Bank's failure to continuously refine its credit risk management system may result in a higher risk exposure for the Bank, which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.\n\nOverall, if the Bank is unable to effectively control the level of non-performing or poor credit quality loans in the future, or  if  its  loan  loss  reserves  are  insufficient  to  cover  future  loan  losses,  the  Bank's  financial  condition  and  results  of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe amount of the Bank's non-performing loans may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond the Bank's control, such as changes in the income levels of the Bank's borrowers, increases in the inflation rate or an increase in interest rates, the impact of macroeconomic trends and political events affecting Colombia and other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates or has exposure (especially Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala) or events affecting specific industries. Any of these developments could have a negative effect on the quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, requiring the Bank to increase provisions for loan losses and resulting in reduced profits or in losses.\n\nAlso, modeling for expected credit losses (ECL) has been made more complex by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market volatility, macroeconomic factors and credit relief, and has required ongoing monitoring and more frequent testing across the Bank, particularly of credit models. As a consequence, the Bank recorded a general provision adjustment (Overlay) on the loans for which relief had been granted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Panama and Colombia and adjusted the macroeconomic variables to avoid excessively procyclical assumptions. There can be no assurance that, even after these adjustments to the model, the Bank will not have futures losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic or other events that cannot be predicted.\n\n## Risks  relating  to  the  use  of  quantitative  models  and  information  may  adversely  impact  the  Bank's  business strategies and results.\n\nIn recent years, the use of mathematical and statistical models has spread rapidly in different areas of the Bank. The use of these models brings benefits such as objectivity, automation and efficiency, but also entails costs related to the resources required for their development as well as heightened risks.\n\nThe heightened risks arise from three fundamental sources:\n\n- (1) Data deficiencies in both availability and quality.\n- (2) Methodological errors in the design of the model such as volatility in the estimates, inadequate simplifications or approximations, erroneous hypotheses, bias identification/fixing and incorrect design.",

Decisions based on inadequate models will have a negative impact on the implementation of business strategies, risk identification and measurement, position valuation, stress testing, capital adequacy  assessment,  customer  asset  management,  compliance  with  internal  limits  or  compliance  with  financial  or regulatory information requirements and issuance of public information.\n\n## The Bank is subject to credit risk with respect to its non-traditional banking businesses including investing in securities and entering into derivatives transactions.\n\nNon- traditional sources of credit risk can arise from, among other things: investing in securities, entering into derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to the Bank, and executing securities, futures, or currency trades from the Bank's proprietary trading desk that fail to settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty or systems failure  by  clearing  agents,  exchanges,  clearing  houses  or  other  financial  intermediaries.  Any significant increases in exposure to any of these non-traditional risks, or a significant decline in the credit quality or the insolvency of any of the counterparties, could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank is subject to risks from concentration in its loan portfolio. Problems with one or more of its largest borrowers may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Bank's 20 largest economic groups, on a consolidated basis, represented 11.2% of the Bank's loan portfolio. No single group exposure represented more than 2% of the loan book. Problems with one or more of the Bank's largest economic groups could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.\n\nThe value of the collateral securing the outstanding principal and interest balance of the Bank's loans may not be sufficient to cover such outstanding principal and interest. In addition, the Bank may be unable to realize the full value of the collateral or guarantees securing the outstanding principal and interest balance of its loans.\n\nThe Bank's loan collateral primarily includes real estate, owned assets used for financial leasing transactions and other assets that are located primarily in Colombia, El Salvador, Panama and Guatemala, the value of which may significantly fluctuate or decline due to factors beyond the Bank's control. Such factors include market factors, environmental risks, macroeconomic factors and political events affecting the local economy. In addition, the Bank may face difficulties in enforcing its rights as a secured creditor. Timing delays, procedural problems enforcing collateral and local protectionism may make foreclosures on collateral and enforcement of judgments difficult. Any decline in the value of the collateral securing the Bank's loans may result in a reduction in the recovery from collateral realization and may have an adverse impact on the Bank's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## The Bank is subject to market risk\n\nThe Bank is directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk, or the risk of losses in positions arising from movements in market prices, is inherent in the products and instruments associated with our operations, including  loans,  deposits,  securities,  bonds,  long-term  debt,  short-term  borrowings,  proprietary  trading  in  assets  and liabilities and derivatives. Changes in market conditions that may affect our financial condition and results of operations include fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, securities prices and changes in the implied volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, among others.\n\n## The Bank's results of operations are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.\n\nThe Bank holds a substantial portfolio of loans and debt instruments that have both fixed and floating interest rates. Therefore,  changes  in  interest  rates  could  adversely  affect  our  net  interest  margins  as  well  as  the  value  of  the  debt",

        "page_content": "instruments. Increases in interest rates may reduce the market value of the Bank's debt instruments, leading to smaller gains or larger losses on these investments. Sustained high interest rates have historically discouraged customers from borrowing and have resulted in increased delinquencies in outstanding loans and deterioration in the quality of assets. On the other hand, decreases in interest rates may cause margin compression and lower net interest income as the Bank usually maintains more assets than liabilities at variable rates. Decreasing interest rates also may trigger loan prepayments which could negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. Generally, in a declining interest rate environment, prepayment activity increases, reducing the weighted average maturity of the Bank's interest earning assets and adversely affecting its operating results. Prepayment risk also has a significant adverse impact on the Bank's earnings from its credit card and collateralized mortgage obligations, since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these portfolios, which may result in a mismatch in funding or in reinvestment of the prepayment proceeds at lower yields. In addition, these risks could significantly impact the Bank's portfolio as well as portfolios managed by the Bank and owned by third parties. To the extent we experience withdrawals of third-party assets, our asset management revenues and related income will be adversely affected.\n\n## The Bank's income from its proprietary trading activities is highly volatile.\n\nThe Bank derives a portion of its profits from its proprietary trading activities. Income from this activity is highly volatile and depends on numerous factors beyond the Bank's control, such as the general market environment, overall market trading activity, interest rate levels, fluctuations in exchange rates, oil prices and general market volatility. A significant decline in the Bank's trading income, or the incurrence of a trading loss, could adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank has significant exposure to sovereign risk, and especially Colombian and Salvadoran sovereign risk, and the Bank's results could be adversely affected by decreases in the value of its sovereign debt instruments.\n\nThe Bank's debt instruments portfolio is primarily composed of sovereign debt instruments. Therefore, the Bank's results are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risk associated with sovereign debt, in particular risk associated with securities issued  or  guaranteed  by  the  Colombian  Government.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Bank's  total  debt  instruments represented  9.94%  of  its  total  assets,  and  40.41%  of  these  securities  were  issued  or  guaranteed  by  the  Colombian Government. A significant decline in the value of the securities issued or guaranteed by the Colombian Government could adversely affect the Bank's debt instruments portfolio and consequently the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\nIn addition, during the last year, the sovereign risk associated with the securities issued or guaranteed by the El Salvador Government has increased. El Salvador 5 year credit default swap, credit derivative contracts that enable investors to swap credit risk on a company, a country or another entity, has increased from 670 bps as of December 31, 2020 to 1,819 bps as of December 31, 2021. The securities issued or guaranteed by the El Salvador Government represented 5.81% of the Bank's total debt instruments, as of December 31, 2021, and a significant decline on the value of these securities could affect the Bank's debt instruments portfolio.\n\n## The Bank is subject to market, liquidity, operational and structural risks associated with its derivative transactions.\n\nThe Bank enters into derivative transactions for hedging purposes on its own account and for its customers. The Bank is subject to market, liquidity (due to the difficulty in closing out a trade prior to maturity if bid-ask spreads are too large, representing a significant cost) and operational risk associated with these transactions, including basis risk (the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost) and credit or default risk  (the  risk  of  insolvency  or  other  inability  of  the  counterparty  to  a  particular  transaction  to  perform  its  obligations thereunder).  In  addition,  the  market  practice  and  documentation  for  derivative  transactions  is  less  developed  in  the jurisdictions where the Bank operates as compared to other more economically developed countries, and the court systems in such jurisdictions have limited experience in dealing with issues related to derivative transactions. As a result, there are increased operating and structural risks associated with derivatives transactions in these jurisdictions.\n\nIn addition, the execution and performance of derivatives transactions depend on the Bank's ability to develop adequate control and administrative systems, and to hire and retain qualified personnel. Moreover, the Bank's ability to adequately",

These factors may further increase the risks associated with these transactions and could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank is subject to operational risks and losses.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to operational risk, including the risks from fraud by employees or third parties, human errors, inadequate definition of processes or technological failures that affect the availability of financial services or appropriate processing, authorization and registration of transactions and operations. The financial sector is particularly vulnerable to different forms of fraud, due to the ease of monetization and conversion into cash of the proceeds of such fraud. Products and services that involve money outflows or transfers are constantly affected by new fraudulent schemes.\n\nDue to the nature of financial activities and their reliance on systems for the processing, authorization and registration of operations, the Bank may be exposed to interruption and technological failures in the processing of operations that affect the availability and quality of products and channels to customers, in both live and digital scenarios.\n\nThe Bank's businesses rely heavily on data collection, processing and storage systems, the failure of which could materially and adversely affect the effectiveness of its risk management, reputation and internal control system as well as its financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAll of the Bank's principal businesses are highly dependent on the ability to timely collect and process a large amount of financial  and other  information  at  its  various  digital  and  physical  channels  across  numerous  markets,  at  a  time  when transaction processes have become increasingly complex with increasing volume. The proper functioning of financial control, accounting or other data collection and processing systems is critical to the Bank's businesses and to its ability to compete effectively.\n\nA partial or complete failure of any of these primary systems could materially and adversely affect the Bank's decisionmaking process, its risk management and internal control systems, the quality of its service, and the Bank's ability to respond on a timely basis to changing market conditions. If the Bank cannot maintain effective data collection, processing, storage and management systems, its business operations, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nThe Bank is also dependent on information systems to operate its website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. The Bank may experience operational problems with its information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer hackers or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of its systems could cause information, including data related to customer requests and other client information, to be lost, compromised, or to be delivered to the Bank's clients with delays or errors, which could reduce demand for the Bank's services and products, resulting in additional costs for the Bank and potentially fines and penalties by regulators which could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position. To guarantee service continuity,  the  Bank  plans  and  implements  exercises  related  to  business  continuity  and  disaster  recovery  as  well  as cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities' management, according to internal and external control areas requirements. There can be no assurance that these measures will successfully eliminate or substantially mitigate the risk associated with failure of our data collection, processing, and storage systems.\n\n## The Bank is subject to cyber-security risk.\n\nCyber risk remains one of the main concerns of the financial sector and is a critical risk for the Bank. The cybersecurity threat landscape is constantly evolving and cyberattacks can be accomplished by insiders or outsiders through sophisticated or common techniques, such as the inappropriate use of privileged account on core systems, infiltration of ransomware or malware, phishing, interception of confidential data in cyberspace, distributed denial of services attacks, and other attacks that  may  result  in  monetary  losses,  reputational  damage  or  the  interruption  of  business  services.  These  cyberattack scenarios  can  also  impact  cloud  services  providers  or  third  party  vendors,  which  could  adversely  affect  both  their operations and those of the Bank's and its clients.",

These actions have increased the attack perimeter, have led to less visibility over the physical security of systems, and have made it more difficult to quickly patch and update some of our cybersecurity corporate policies, creating opportunities for cybercriminals. The Bank's Security Operation Center - SOC has seen an exponential growth in the number of cyberattacks and this increase, added to events that  cybercriminals  have  carried  out  in  the  financial  and  non-financial  sectors,  has  made  it  more  difficult  to  acquire insurance policies with adequate coverage against cyber risks and, when acquired, with much higher prices.\n\nDue to the increase of cybersecurity risks associated to the need for accessibility, flexibility, and scalability required by the  hybrid  work  environment  and  our  on-premise  and  cloud  solutions,  the  Bank's  management  constantly  invests significant  resources  in  improving  its  physical  and  virtual  security  control  environment  to  improve  the  cyber  risk methodologies and processes; however, the Bank recognizes that it is not possible to contain all the future cyber attacks.\n\nFor  further  information  see  'ITEM  4.

Cybersecurity framework'.\n\n## Failures related to the Bank's information technology infrastructure and management information systems could adversely affect the Bank's competitiveness, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn 2021, the Bank experienced certain technological failures, which temporarily affected products and services partially or  totally  in  some  cases.  The  occurrence  of  these  events  resulted  in  certain  hours  of  unavailability  of  service  to  our customers. Although these events interrupted the Bank's ability to provide services, they did not have any financial impacts on the organization. However, a prolonged or more severe service interruption could generate repercussions such as loss of clients, fines and sanctions by the regulators, refunds to customers and reputational damage.\n\n## The Bank is exposed to ESG risks that could affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWhile the Paris Climate Protection Agreement and the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are not industry-specific,  other  initiatives  are  contemplated  or  are  in  early  stages  that  specifically  involve  financial  services, challenging the Bank's strategies to incorporate ESG factors.\n\nIn addition, sustainability is gaining importance in society and is increasing focus on topics such as climate change, social inequality, and corporate misconduct, generating rapid changes in market sentiment which could have adverse impacts on the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nInvestors around the world are increased demanding sustainable products. This focus on ESG factors is influencing the reputational and business success of financial institutions in the countries where the Bank operates.\n\nIn terms of social inequality, the pandemic intensified social inequities due to the lack of access to opportunities and the meeting  of  basic  needs,  generating  gaps  in  equity,  diversity,  and  inclusion  and  exacerbating  the  risk  of  increasing polarization  and  resentment  within  societies  resulting  in  both  peaceful  and  non-peaceful  demonstrations  against institutions.\n\nIn terms of corporate misconduct, COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of good governance practices, associated with the evaluation and supervision of non-financial and emerging risks, to comprehensively manage risks, identifying, monitoring, and controlling their impacts.\n\nFinally, among the ESG issues, climate change is a critical concern, it exposes the Bank to physical and transition risks, which impact or exacerbate other typical risks, such as credit, market, liquidity, operational, and reputational risk.\n\nThe Bank is vulnerable to financial risks related to the consequences of climate change through physical impacts arising from the rise in the frequency and severity of climate events such as droughts, storms, floods and heatwaves as well as events that cause gradual deterioration such as changes in precipitation levels and rising sea levels. Such events and longterm shifts may damage, destroy or otherwise impact the value or productivity of the Bank's properties and other assets,",

Such events and long-term shifts may also have a significant impact on our customers, which could amplify credit risk by diminishing borrowers' repayment capacity or collateral values,  and  other  businesses  and  counterparties  with  whom  we  transact,  which  could  have  a  broader  impact  on  the economy, supply chains and distribution networks\n\nIn addition, the Bank is exposed to the risks that arise from the drive to transition towards a carbon neutral economy Transition risks may result from changes in policies; laws and regulations; technologies; and/or market preferences to address climate change. Such changes could materially, negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition  and/or  our  reputation,  in  addition  to  having  a  similar  impact  on  our  customers.  Banking  regulators  and supervisory authorities, investors and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their customers, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbon-intensive environment, the Bank faces regulatory risk of increasing focus on our resilience to climate-related risks, including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.\n\nIn terms of liquidity risk, severe weather events that cause macro-economic shocks may increase liquidity demand and refinancing risk.\n\nFinally, if the Banks fails to appropriately measure and manage the various risks resulting from climate change or fails to adapt its strategy and business model to the changing regulatory requirements and market expectations, its reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## The Bank's ability to attract and retain specialized talent could impact some business objectives.\n\nThe current economic landscape requires workforces to exhibit new skills and attributes such as creativity, innovation and flexibility, which are necessary to adapt the Bank's operations to constant technological advances, and to update the Bank's business  models  and  strategies  to  develop  new  products  and  services.  To  respond  to  these  trends,  many  companies, including financial institutions such as the Bank, are struggling to engage employees with specialized knowledge in a variety of technological information areas, including data science, quantitative resources, information security and other technical areas, in which it is becoming more difficult to acquire and retain staff on a cost-effective basis.\n\nThe Bank's strategic objectives are linked to their human talent. Specifically, the development of new products, services and digital tools demands that the Bank's human talent have specialized capabilities to carry out the relevant process, enabling the Bank to achieve competitive advantages.\n\nWhile the  Bank  has  implemented  strategies  to  attract  and  retain  experienced  and  skilled  professionals,  the  lack  of  a specialized workforce to fill positions that require this kind of knowledge in various areas could negatively affect the Bank's ability to deal with future challenges, slow the digital business strategy execution, including development of new products and affect the Bank's results of operations.\n\n## Digital misinformation could adversely affect the Bank's reputation as well as its operational and financial results.\n\nThe increase in digital interconnection has increased the spread and distribution of digital content across social media networks where mentions of the Bank increased over 280% in 2021 through texts, photos, audio, and videos, some of which are used with the intent to, among other purposes, commit fraud. Such digital misinformation is related to inaccurate, exaggerated, or untrue information which increases negative sentiment towards the brands that can impact organizations, such as the Bank, if used to blackmail or defame the Bank's reputation to negatively affect the trust of customers and other",

Such developments could lead to reduced business for the Bank which would negatively affect the operational, economic, and reputational performance of the Bank.\n\n## Acquisitions and strategic alliances may not perform in accordance with expectations or may disrupt the Bank's operations and adversely affect its profitability.\n\nAn element of the Bank's business strategy is to identify and pursue growth-enhancing strategic opportunities. The Bank may base assessments of potential acquisitions and alliances on assumptions with respect to operations, profitability and other matters that may subsequently prove to be incorrect, and any future acquisitions, investments and alliances may not produce the anticipated synergies or perform in accordance with the Bank's expectations which could adversely affect its operations and profitability. In particular, the Bank holds a minority financial investment, through a private equity fund, in an infrastructure project located in Colombia. In previous years, the main shareholder of the project and the concession company faced negative press related to irregular practices. If any of these situations result in sanctions or convictions then the company in which the Bank indirectly holds a minority stake, which is the holder of a toll road concession, may suffer a reputational harm, which in turn may have an adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition and the return on the Bank's investment.\n\n## Downgrades in the credit ratings of the Bank and its subsidiaries would increase their cost of borrowing funds and make their ability to raise new funds, attract deposits or renew maturing debt more difficult.\n\nThe Bank's, and its subsidiaries', credit ratings are an important component of the liquidity profile of each entity, and their ability to successfully compete depends on various factors, including their financial stability as reflected by their credit ratings. A downgrade in the credit ratings of the Bank or its subsidiaries would increase their cost of raising funds from other banks or in the capital markets. Purchases of the Bank's or its subsidiaries' securities by institutional investors could be reduced if they suffer a decline in their credit ratings. The ability of the Bank or its subsidiaries to renew maturing debt could become restricted and the terms for such renewal more expensive if their credit ratings were to decline. The Bank's, and  its  subsidiaries',  lenders  and  counterparties  in  derivative  transactions  are  sensitive  to  the  risk  of  a  credit  rating downgrade. A downgrade in the credit rating of the Bank or its subsidiaries may adversely affect perception of their financial stability and their ability to raise deposits, which could make each entity less successful when competing for deposits and loans in the marketplace.\n\n## The Bank faces risks relating to regulatory compliance in general, and in particular with respect to laws relating to anti-competitive practices, consumer protection and protection of personal data.\n\nThe Bank must comply with laws and regulations related to, among other things, anti-competitive practices, merger control unfair competition provisions, personal data protection and consumer protection. The Bank has a special unit responsible for overseeing and ensuring regulatory compliance in general. To ensure compliance for personal data law, the Bank has developed a comprehensive data protection program.\n\nThe risk  of  non-compliance  or  non-fulfillment  of  these  laws  and  regulations  may  result  in  significant  administrative sanctions imposed by the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce ('SIC') and the Colombian Superintendence of Finance.\n\nThe Bank may not be able to prevent all risks  associated  with  regulatory  compliance  or  detect  all  instances  of  noncompliance  with  the  regulations  described  above.  Any  failure  by  the  Bank  to  detect  and  prevent  the  aforementioned practices in a timely manner could damage the Bank's reputation and cause it to incur substantial fines and penalties which could adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and financial position.\n\n## The Bank's policies and procedures may not be able to detect money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption or other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis.\n\nThe  Bank  is  required  to  comply  with  applicable  anti-money  laundering,  anti-terrorism  and  anti-corruption  laws  and regulations. These laws and regulations require the Bank, among other things, to adopt and enforce 'know your customer' policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to the applicable authorities.

The Bank has anti-corruption procedures, which incorporate, among others, an anti-corruption policy, training, reporting channels, monitoring, internal investigations, and sanctions. While this system is designed to prevent and detect corrupt behavior, it does not completely eliminate the risk that the Bank's employees, providers, clients or agents may engage in corrupt practices.\n\nIf  the  Bank  fails  to  fully  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  it  may  face fines,  penalties  or  other  liabilities including restrictions on its ability to conduct business. In addition, the Bank's business and reputation could suffer if it is not able to prevent and detect money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption or other illegal practices.\n\n## The Bank is subject to increasing competition which may adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nThe  Bank  operates  in  a  highly  competitive  environment  and  management  expects  increasing  competition  in  the jurisdictions where the Bank operates.\n\nIntensified  merger  activity  in  the  financial  services  industry  has  produced  larger,  better  capitalized  and  more geographically  diverse  firms  that  are  capable  of  offering  a  wider  array  of  financial  products  and  services  at  more competitive prices. Also, the emergence of new financial technologies, unregulated financial intermediaries (known as 'shadow  banking')  and  the  recent  enactment  of  regulations  aimed  at  enabling  non-Colombian  residents  (other  than individuals) to offer loans in COP, may increase competition for the Bank.\n\nThe Bank's ability to maintain its competitive position depends mainly on (i) its ability to fulfill new customers' needs through the development of new products and services, (ii) the ability to offer adequate services and strengthen its customer base through cross-selling and (iii) the ability to attract and retain human talent. For that reason, the Bank's business will be adversely affected if the Bank is not able to maintain efficient service strategies.\n\nLast  but  not  least,  the  Bank's  efforts  to  offer  new  services  and  products  might  not  succeed  if  product  or  market opportunities develop more slowly than expected or if the profitability of opportunities is undermined by competitive pressures.\n\n## The Bank is subject to operational and strategic risks associated with new services on digital platforms such as Banking as a Service and Open Banking.\n\nThe financial services industry is undergoing massive digital disruption due to market expectations, which include new digital services and changes in business models allowing third-party alliances. The development of new services on digital platforms creates challenges in risk management which may generate economic and reputational impacts.\n\nAmong the strategic risks are the non-traditional new competitors and their ability to gain traction in the new services and digital platforms during initial development. Other risks arising from this evolution are the occurrence of fraud, failures in processes, legal compliance and data protection due to the increasing initiatives related to services on digital platforms such as Banking as a Service (BaaS) and Open Banking in which data, processes, and business functionalities are made available in an ecosystem of banks, customers, and third parties.\n\n## Discontinuation of the London InterBank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), and the regulation and implementation of a replacement benchmark rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\n\nIn 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation  of  the  LIBOR  benchmark  after  2021.

For  more  information,  see  Item  5 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - B.

In addition, the transition process to an alternative reference rate could impact the Bank's business, financial condition or result of operations, as a result of:\n\n- \u00b7 An adverse impact in pricing, liquidity, value, return and trading for a broad array of financial products, loans and derivatives that are included in the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Extensive changes to internal processes and documentation that contain references to LIBOR or use formulas that depend on LIBOR.\n- \u00b7 Disputes,  litigation  or  other  actions  with  counterparties  regarding  the  interpretation  and  enforceability  of provisions in LIBOR-based products such as fallback language or other related provisions.\n- \u00b7 The transition and development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition the Bank's risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on one or more alternative reference rates in a timely manner; and\n- \u00b7 An increase in prepayments of LIBOR-linked loans by the Bank's clients.\n\nFrom January 2022, the Bank began to offer products indexed to the SOFR rate, and determined not to offer new products indexed to the LIBOR rate.\n\n## Risks Relating to the Preferred Shares and the ADSs.\n\n## Preemptive rights may not be available to holders of American Depositary Receipts ('ADRs') evidencing ADSs.\n\nThe Bank's by-laws and Colombian law require that, whenever the Bank issues new shares of any outstanding class, it must offer the holders of each class of shares (including holders of ADRs) the right to purchase a number of shares of such class sufficient to maintain their existing percentage ownership of the aggregate capital stock of the Bank. These rights are called preemptive rights. United States holders of ADRs may not be able to exercise their preemptive rights through The Bank of New York Mellon, which acts as depositary (the 'Depositary') for the Bank's ADR facility, unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is effective with respect to such rights and class of shares or an exemption from the registration  requirement  thereunder  is  available.  The  Bank  is  obligated  to  file  a  registration  statement  or  find  a corresponding exemption only if it determines to extend the rights to holders of the ADRs. Although it is not obligated to, do so, the Bank intends to consider at the time of any rights offering the costs and potential liabilities associated with any such registration statement, the benefits to the Bank from enabling the holders of the ADRs to exercise those rights and any other factors deemed appropriate at the time before it makes a decision as to whether to file a registration statement. Accordingly, the Bank may in some cases decide not to file a registration statement.\n\nUnder the deposit agreement between the Bank and the Depositary, only the Depositary is entitled to exercise preemptive rights, and the Depositary has no obligation to make available preemptive rights to holders of ADRs. If the Bank offers or causes  to  be  offered  to  the  holders  of  any  deposited  securities,  including  preferred  shares  of  the  Bank,  any  rights  to subscribe for additional preferred shares of the Bank or any rights of any other nature, the Depositary has discretion as to the procedure to be followed in making such rights available to any holders of ADRs or in disposing of such rights on behalf of any holders of ADRs and making the net proceeds available to such holders of ADRs. If by the terms of such rights offering or for any other reason, the Depositary does not either make such rights available to any holders of ADRs",

        "page_content": "or dispose of such rights and make the net proceeds available to such holders of ADRs, then the Depositary will allow the rights to lapse. Whenever the rights are sold or lapse, the equity interests of the holders of ADRs will be proportionately diluted.\n\n## Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the Colombian economy, the market price of the Bank's ADSs, and the dividends payable to holders of the Bank's ADSs.\n\nColombia has adopted a floating exchange rate system. The Central Bank maintains the power to intervene in the exchange market in order to consolidate or dispose of international reserves, and to control any volatility in the exchange rate. From time to time, including during 2021, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Colombian peso and the U.S. dollar. Unforeseen events in the international markets, fluctuations in interest rates, volatility of the oil price in the international markets, or changes in capital flows, may cause exchange rate instability that could generate sharp movements in the value of the peso. Because a portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in, or indexed to, foreign currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, sharp movements in exchange rates may negatively impact our results. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact the value of dividends paid to holders of our ADSs as well as the market price and liquidity of ADSs.\n\n## The Bank's preferred shares have limited voting rights.\n\nThe Bank's corporate affairs are governed by its by-laws and Colombian law. Under the Bank's by-laws and Colombian law, the Bank's preferred stockholders may have fewer rights than stockholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction.  Under the Bank's by-laws and Colombian corporate law, holders of preferred shares (and, consequently, holders of ADRs) have no voting rights in respect of preferred shares, other than in limited circumstances as described in 'Item 10. Additional Information - B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Voting Rights - Preferred Shares'. Holders of the Bank's preferred shares, including holders of ADRs, are not entitled to vote for the election of directors or to influence the Bank's management policies.\n\n## Holders of the Bank's ADRs may encounter difficulties in the exercise of dividend and voting rights.\n\nHolders of the Bank's ADRs may encounter difficulties in the exercise of some of their rights with respect to the shares underlying ADRs. If the Bank makes a distribution to holders of underlying shares in the form of securities, the Depositary is allowed, in its discretion, to sell those securities on behalf of ADR holders and instead distribute the net proceeds to the ADR holders. Also, even in those limited instances in which the preferred shares represented by the ADRs have the power to vote, under some circumstances, ADR holders may not be able to vote by giving instructions to the depositary. This may occur if ADR holders do not receive from the Depositary a notice of meeting sufficiently prior to the instruction date to  ensure  that  the  Depositary  will  vote  the  preferred  shares  represented  by  the  ADRs  in  accordance  with  instructions received from such holders. There are no circumstances in which holders of ADRs may vote in a way other than by providing instructions to the Depositary.\n\n## Relative illiquidity of the Colombian securities markets may impair the ability of an ADR holder to sell preferred shares.\n\nThe Bank's common and preferred shares are listed on the Colombian Securities Exchange, which is relatively small and illiquid compared to securities exchanges in major financial centers. In addition, a small number of issuers represent a disproportionately large percentage of market capitalization and trading volume on the Colombian Securities Exchange. A liquid trading market for the Bank's securities might not develop on the Colombian Securities Exchange. A limited trading market could impair the ability of an ADR holder to sell preferred shares (obtained upon withdrawal of such shares from the ADR facility) on the Colombian Securities Exchange in the amount and at the price and time such holder desires and could increase the volatility of the price of the ADRs.\n\n## Changes in Colombia's tax regime may affect ADRs tax treatment.\n\nADRs  do  not  have  the  same  tax  benefits  as  other  equity  investments  in  Colombia.  ADRs  represent  Bancolombia's preferred shares and are held through a fund of foreign capital in Colombia which is subject to a specific tax regulatory",

Accordingly, the applicable law in Colombia to equity investments, in particular, those relating to dividends and profits from sale, are not applicable to ADRs, including the Bank's ADRs.\n\nHowever, the tax regime applicable to ADRs may change from time to time, considering that in recent years the Colombian tax regime has undergone several changes.\n\nFor more information see 'Item 10.

This new insurance policy applies in the event of a violent robbery when withdrawing money at an ATM or multifunctional machine.

Additionally, this policy provides economic assistance to cover loss of personal documents in connection with the robbery, and in case the insured dies as a result of the event, the insurance will provide to the deceased's relatives up to twice the value withdrawn at Bancolombia ATMs.\n\nAlliance with Gemini for Cryptocurrency operations: In December 2021, Bancolombia established an alliance with the  crypto  exchange Gemini. This alliance will allow around 5,000 clients to make cash in and cash out transactions between Bancolombia and Gemini.

Operating Results - Results by Segment'.\n\n## B.2            OPERATIONS\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of the principal markets in which the Bank competes, including a breakdown of total interest and valuation income by category of activity and geographic market for each of the last three fiscal years.\n\n## B.3            SEASONALITY OF DEPOSITS\n\nHistorically, the Bank has experienced some seasonality in its demand deposits, with higher average balances at the end of the year and lower average balances during the first months of the year. This behavior is explained primarily by the increased liquidity provided by the Central Bank and the Colombian National Treasury at year end, as economic activity tends to be higher during this period resulting in a greater number of transactions.\n\nDuring 2021, economic activity started to recover as government restrictions were gradually 'relaxed' and vaccination programs against Covid-19 were commenced, resulting in better loan portfolio and deposits performance. Nonetheless, the Bank maintained high liquidity levels during the first half of the year.\n\nHowever, we do not consider the seasonality of demand deposits to have a significant impact on our business, since the excess/shortage of liquidity has been managed through the treasury portfolio.\n\n## B.4            RAW MATERIALS\n\nThe Bank is not dependent on sources or availability of raw materials.\n\n## B.5            DISTRIBUTION NETWORK\n\nBancolombia provides its products and services through a traditional branch network, sales and customer representatives as well as through mobile branches (or 'Puntos de Atenci\u00f3n M\u00f3viles' ), an ATM network, online and computer banking, telephone banking, mobile phone banking services, and points of sale (or 'Puntos de Atenci\u00f3n Cercano' ), among others. Transactions performed through electronic channels represented more than 94.52% of all transactions in 2021, vs 94.63% of all transactions in 2020. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, Bancolombia had a sales force of approximately 12,498 employees.\n\nThe following are the distribution channels offered by Bancolombia as of December 31, 2021:\n\n## Branch Network\n\nBancolombia's consolidated branch network consisted of 1,015 offices, including 620 from Bancolombia S.A., 93 from Banco Agricola, 39 from Banistmo, 156 from BAM and 107 from other subsidiaries.",

In  addition,  trust  companies,  cooperatives,  insurance  companies,  insurance brokerage and securities intermediaries, special state-owned institutions, and severance payments and pension funds also participate in the Colombian financial system.\n\n## Market and Credit Institutions' Evolution in 2021\n\nIn 2015, Colombian financial institutions began reporting their consolidated financial results under the IFRS framework. However, in the case of credit institutions (including banks, financial corporations, financing companies and 38 financial cooperatives), the SFC has allowed the presentation of stand-alone financial statements under Colombian Banking GAAP, following  Decree  1851  of  August  2013,  which  regulates  the  Law  1314  of  2009  concerning  the  technical  regulatory framework for institutions that report their financial results. Accordingly, the following information includes figures under Colombian Banking GAAP regulation, as reported by Colombian credit institutions to the SFC.\n\nLoan growth at Colombian credit institutions was 10.3% in 2021, compared to 3.91% in 2020. Commercial loans grew by 7.83% in 2021, compared to 4.36% in the previous year. Consumer loans increased 12.76% in 2021, more than the 2.04% in 2020. Mortgage loans increased 14.25% in 2021, more than 2020 (7.06%), and small business loans grew 8.92% in 2021 from 0.92% in 2020.\n\nThe level of past-due loans held by credit institutions as a percentage of their total loan portfolio, decreased from 4.99% in December 2020 to 3.93% in December 2021. In addition, the coverage, measured by the ratio of allowances for loans losses (principal) to PDLs (overdue 30 days), ended 2021 at 166.08%, compared to 153.89% at the end of 2020.\n\nAt the end of 2021, loan portfolios represented 61.41% of total assets, less than the previous year proportion which was 61.59%. Investments and derivatives, as a percentage of total assets, decreased from 23.22% at the end of 2020 to 22.49% at the end of 2021. Deposits decreased as a proportion of the total balance of liabilities from 73.71% in 2020 to 72.13% in 2021.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, credit institutions recorded COP 861 trillion in total assets, representing a 12.01% increase compared to the previous year. Based on total assets held by Colombian credit institutions, banks had a market share of 94.95% followed by financing companies with 1.60%, financial corporations with 2.93%, and financial cooperatives with 0.52%.\n\nThe capital  adequacy  ratio  (Tier  1  +  Tier  2)  for  credit  institutions  was  21.97%  in  December  2021  (including  banks, financial  corporations,  financing  companies  and  financial  cooperatives),  which  is  well  above  the  minimum  legal requirement of 9.8%.",

        "page_content": "## B.8            SUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\n## Colombian Banking Regulators\n\nThe Colombian Constitution grants power to the congress of Colombia to prescribe the general legal framework of the financial system and within such framework the Government issues regulations. Multiple agencies are vested with the authority to regulate the financial system, including the board of directors of the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (the 'Ministry of Finance'), the SFC, the SIC and the Self-Regulatory Organization (' Autoregulador del Mercado de Valores ' or 'AMV'). The following is a description of their functions:\n\nThe Central Bank exercises the customary functions of a central bank, including price stabilization, monetary policy, regulation  of  currency  circulation,  regulation  of  credit,  exchange  rate  monitoring  and  management  of  international reserves. Its board of directors is the regulatory authority for monetary, currency exchange and credit policies, and is responsible for the direction of the Central Bank's duties. The Central Bank also acts as lender of last resort to financial institutions.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has the function, among others, of regulating, through the Unit of Financial Regulation, all aspects of financial and insurance activities. It is responsible for regulations relating to capital adequacy, legal lending limits, authorized operations, disclosure of information and accounting of financial institutions on a high level, which matters are then regulated in detail by the SFC.\n\nThe SFC is the authority responsible for licensing, supervising and regulating financial institutions, the Bank. The SFC has broad discretionary powers to supervise financial institutions, including the authority to impose fines on financial institutions  and  their  directors  and  officers  for  violations  of  applicable  regulations.  The  SFC  is  also  responsible  for monitoring, supervising and regulating the market for publicly traded securities in Colombia.\n\nThe AMV is the self-regulatory organization of Colombia. The AMV may issue mandatory instructions to its members and supervise its members' compliance and impose sanctions for violations. All capital market intermediaries, including the Bank, must become members of the AMV and are subject to its instructions.\n\nThe SIC is the authority responsible anti-trust and data protection matters, and has jurisdiction over the Bank.\n\n## Regulatory Framework for Colombian Banking Institutions\n\nThe basic regulatory framework of the Colombian financial sector is described below.\n\nDecree 663 of 1993, as amended, defines the structure of the Colombian financial system and establishes the permitted forms  of  business  entities  and  their  authorized  activities.  Furthermore,  Decree  663  of  1993  sets  forth  (i)  licensing requirements, (ii) the procedure applicable for mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs, and other corporate reorganizations of the aforementioned entities, (iii) specific regulations that apply to the issuance and sale of shares and other securities by such entities, and (iv) certain rules regarding the activities of officers and directors of such institutions, among others.\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010 compiles regulations that were previously issued in separate decrees, including regulations regarding banking, insurance and securities market activities, capital adequacy requirements, principles relating to the determination, dissemination and publication of rates and prices of products and financial services, and lending activities.\n\nExternal Circulars 029 of 2014 and 100 of 1995 compile the rules and regulations issued by the SFC that apply to financial institutions and other entities under its supervision.\n\nFinancial institutions are subject to further rules if they engage in additional activities. Law 964 of 2005 (securities market law) regulates securities activities, which may be performed by banks, and securities offerings. External Resolution 1 of 2018 (foreign exchange regulations), and External Resolution 4 of 2006 issued by the board of directors of the Central",

        "page_content": "Bank,  defines  the  different  activities  that  banks,  including  the  Bank,  may  perform  as  foreign  exchange  market intermediaries, including lending in foreign currencies and investing in foreign securities.\n\nViolations of any of the above statutes and their relevant regulations are subject to administrative sanctions and, in some cases, criminal sanctions.\n\n## Financial Conglomerates\n\nLaw  1870  of  2017  ('Law  1870')  implemented  the  legal  framework  for  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  financial conglomerates in areas such as regulatory capital, related party transactions, corporate governance principles, conflicts of interest and risk management, among others. According to Law 1870, a financial holding company may acquire that status by either (i) having significant influence over a financial institution or (ii) controlling a financial institution. A financial holding company (1) has significant influence over a financial institution when it directly or indirectly, holds more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting capital of the financial institution, excluding from the calculation voting capital held by entities that under their regulations are not allowed to control a financial institution (such as pension funds), and (2) controls a financial institution, when it has (i) more than 50% of the voting capital of the financial institution, (ii) the majority of the votes in the Board of Directors of the financial institution or the right to elect a majority of its members or (iii) a dominant influence over the decisions made by the financial institution as a result of an agreement with the financial institution or its shareholders as established in articles 260 and 261 of the Colombian Code of Commerce.\n\nThe Government has issued several decrees pursuant to its authority under Law 1870, including Decree 774 of 2018, which regulates capital adequacy requirements for financial conglomerates, and Decree 1486 of 2018, which regulates the criteria to  determine  related  parties,  risk  concentration  limits  and  conflicts  of  interest.  These  regulations  provide  that  when financial institutions fulfill capital adequacy requirements and solvency ratios on a stand alone basis, authorities may not impose solvency ratios on the financial conglomerate as a whole.\n\nThe  law  also  reinforced  the  mechanism  for  the  resolution  of  credit  institutions  -  deposit-taking  institutions  under Colombian Law - by establishing the concept of the bridge bank, an entity used to facilitate the purchase of assets and transfer of liabilities from failing institutions.\n\nPursuant to the financial conglomerates regime, Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana S.A. has significant influence and, therefore,  is  the  financial  holding  company  of  Bancolombia  only  for  the  purposes  of  the  financial  conglomerates framework. These new regulations require Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana S.A. to: (i) continue strengthening the Bank's Corporate Governance System as a Financial Conglomerate; (ii) review the risk management and capital adequacy models; and (iii) strengthen the internal control and information reporting systems of the companies that make up the conglomerate under this framework. The SFC has authority to implement applicable regulations and, accordingly, from time to time issues administrative resolutions and circulars.\n\n## Key interest rates\n\nArticle 884 of the Colombian Commercial Code provides for a limit on the amount of interest that  may be charged in commercial transactions. The limit is 1.5 times the current banking interest rate (' inter\u00e9s bancario corriente '), certified and calculated by the SFC as the average rate of interest ordinarily charged by banks for loans made during a specified period. The current banking interest rate for small business loans and for all other loans is certified by the SFC. As of December 31, 2021, the banking interest rate for small business loans was 37.36% and for all other loans was 17.46%.\n\n## Capital adequacy requirements - Basel III\n\nCapital adequacy requirements for Colombian financial institutions (as set forth in Decree 2555 of 2010, as amended) are based on most of the Basel III standards. This regulation provides for a gradual implementation plan beginning in 2021 and ending in 2024 for requirements regarding solvency ratios and capital buffers. The SFC issued External Circular 020",

        "page_content": "of  2019  which  sets  requirements  in  relation  to  capital  adequacy  requirements  for  credit  institutions  and  information reporting to the SFC. Some of the highlights of this regulation are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The technical capital ('Technical Capital') is calculated as the sum of Common Equity Tier One Capital (the 'patrimonio b\u00e1sico ordinario'), the Additional Tier One Capital (' patrimonio b\u00e1sico adicional ') and the Tier Two Capital (' patrimonio adicional ').\n- \u00b7 Revised criteria for debt and equity instruments to be considered Common Equity Tier One Capital, Additional Tier One Capital, and Tier Two Capital were established. Additionally, the SFC must review whether a given instrument adequately complies with the applicable criteria in order for an instrument to be considered Tier One Capital or Tier Two Capital, upon request of the issuer. Debt and equity instruments that have not been classified by the SFC as Tier One Capital or Tier Two Capital shall not be considered Tier One Capital or Tier two Capital for purposes of capital adequacy requirements.\n- \u00b7 The Capital Adequacy Ratio is set at a minimum of 9% of the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets; however, each entity must comply with: (i) a minimum basic solvency ratio of 4.5% (which is defined as the ordinary basic capital after deductions divided by the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets and offbalance sheet items); (ii) a minimum additional basic solvency ratio (which is defined as the sum of Common Equity Tier One Capital after deductions and Additional Tier One Capital, divided by the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items) of 4.875% which began on January 1, 2021, increasing gradually up to 6% as of January 1, 2024; (iii) a capital conservation buffer (which is defined as the Common Equity Tier One Capital after deductions divided by the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets and offbalance sheet items) of 0.375% which began on January 1, 2021, increasing gradually up to 1.5% as of January 1, 2024; (iv) a systemically important institution buffer (which is defined as the Common Equity Tier One after deductions divided by the financial institution's total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items) of 0.25% which  began  on  January  1,  2021,  increasing  gradually  up  to  1%  as  of  January  1,  2024  (Bancolombia  was recognized by the SFC as a domestic systemically important institution in Colombia); and (v) a combined buffer equivalent to the sum of the aforementioned buffers as of January 1, 2024. These ratios apply to credit institutions individually and on a consolidated basis.\n- \u00b7 Credit establishments must comply with a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, which is defined as the sum of the Common Equity Tier One Capital after deductions and the Additional Tier One Capital, divided by the leverage value. The leverage value is the sum of all net assets, the net exposures in all repo, simultaneous transactions and temporary transfer of securities, the credit exposures in all derivative instruments, and the exposure value of all contingencies.\n- \u00b7 Credit establishments must comply with minimum capital requirements for operational risk. This new capital requirement will be determined by the product of the Business Indicator ('indicador de negocio'), the Operational Risk Coefficient (' coeficiente de riesgo operacional ') and the Internal Loss Multiplier (' indicador de p\u00e9rdida interna '). The Operational Risk Coefficient will be 12% of the Business Indicator, but if the Business Indicator exceeds COP 3 billion, the coefficient will be 15% for the excess amount. Each entity was required to comply with the requirement as of January 1, 2021.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - B1 Liquidity and Funding. Capital Adequacy.'\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for banks on an unconsolidated basis is established in Article 80 of Decree 633 of 1993. The minimum capital requirement for banks, including Bancolombia, for 2022 is COP 107,849 million. Failure to meet such  requirement  can  result  in  the  taking  of  possession  (' toma  de  posesi\u00f3n ')  of  the  Bank  by  the  SFC  (see  Item  4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8 -Supervision and Regulation - Bankruptcy Considerations').",

        "page_content": "## Mandatory Investments\n\nCentral Bank regulations require financial institutions, including the Bank, to hold minimum mandatory investments in debt  instruments  issued  by  Fondo  para  el  Financiamiento  del  Sector  Agropecuario  ('Finagro'),  a  Colombian  public financial institution that finances production and rural activities to support the agricultural sector. The amount of these mandatory investments is calculated by applying a fixed percentage (ranging from 4.3% to 5.8%, depending on the type of liability) to the quarterly average of the end of day balances of certain liabilities, primarily, deposits and short-term debt. The investment balance is computed at the end of each quarter. Any required adjustment (due to a change in the quarterly average between periods) results in the purchase of additional securities or may result in redemption by Finagro at of securities in excess of the requirement. The purchase of additional securities takes place during the month following the date as of which the computation was performed.\n\n## Foreign Currency Position Requirements\n\nAccording  to  External  Resolution  1  of  2018  issued  by  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Central  Bank  as  amended  or supplemented ('Resolution 1 of 2018'), a financial institution's foreign currency position is the difference between such institution's foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities (including any off-balance sheet items). In the case of foreign exchange market intermediaries that consolidate financial statements and have controlled foreign investments, such  as  the  Bank,  the  value  of  controlled  foreign  investments,  and  (ii)  the  value  of  derivatives  and  other  liabilities designated by the intermediary as hedging instruments for the controlled foreign investments are excluded from its foreign currency position.\n\nAlso,  Resolution  1  of  2018  provides  foreign  currency  position  limits,  so  that  their  positions  may  not  exceed  certain percentages of  their  technical  capital  in  specific  periods;  and  requires  banks  to  calculate  a  gross  position  of  leverage (' posici\u00f3n bruta de apalancamiento ') as it relates to its foreign currency position.\n\n## Reserve Requirements\n\nCredit institutions are required to satisfy reserve requirements with respect to deposits and other cash demands which are held by the Central Bank in the form of cash deposits. According to Resolution 11 of 2008 issued by the board of directors of the Central Bank, as amended, the reserve requirements for Colombian banks are measured bi-weekly and the amount depends on the class of deposits.\n\nCredit institutions must maintain reserves of 8.00% over private demand deposits, government demand deposits, other deposits and liabilities and savings deposits; of 3.50% over term deposits with maturities fewer than 540 days and 0% over term deposits with maturities equal to or more than 540 days.\n\n## Non-Performing Loan Allowance\n\nThe SFC maintains rules on non-performing loan allowances for financial institutions; the allowance level of these loans is determined by the profile and risk conditions of the clients and according to the specific conditions of the loan. These rules  apply  to  Bancolombia's  financial  statements  on  a  stand-alone  basis  for  Colombian  regulatory  purposes.  Nonperforming loan allowances in the Consolidated Financial Statements are calculated according to IFRS.\n\n## Lending Activities\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010, as amended, sets forth the legal lending limits, which provide for the maximum amounts that a financial institution may lend to a single borrower (including for this purpose all related fees, expenses and charges). These maximum amounts may not exceed 10% of a bank's technical capital. However, the limit is raised to 25% when amounts",

In addition, no loan to a single financial institution may exceed 30% of the Bank's technical capital, with the exception of loans funded by Colombian development banks which are not subject to such limit.\n\nDecree 2555 of 2010 also sets a maximum limit of 30% of the Bank's technical capital for single-party risk, the calculation of which includes loans, leasing operations and equity and debt investments.\n\n## Ownership and Management Restrictions\n\nThe Bank is organized as a stock company (' sociedad an\u00f3nima '). Its corporate existence is subject to the rules applicable to  commercial companies, principally the Colombian Commercial Code which requires stock companies (such as the Bank) to have a minimum of five shareholders at all times and provides that no single shareholder may own 95% or more of the Bank's subscribed capital stock. Article 262 of the Colombian Commerce Code prohibits the Bank's subsidiaries from acquiring stock of the Bank.\n\nPursuant to Decree 663 of 1993, as amended, any transaction resulting in an individual or entity holding 10% or more of the outstanding shares of any Colombian financial institution, including, in the case of the Bank, transactions resulting in holding ADRs representing 10% or more of the subscribed capital stock of the Bank, is subject to the prior authorization of the SFC. For that purpose, the SFC must evaluate the proposed transaction based on the criteria and guidelines specified in Decree 663 of 1993. Transactions entered into without the prior approval of the SFC are null and void and cannot be recorded in the Bank's stock ledger. These restrictions apply equally to Colombian and foreign investors.\n\n## Bankruptcy Considerations\n\nColombian  banks  and  other  financial  institutions  are  subject  to  special  rules  regarding  insolvency,  restructuring  and liquidation. Pursuant to Colombian banking law, the SFC has the power to intervene in the operations of a bank in order to prevent it from, or to control and reduce the effects of, a bank failure. The SFC also conducts periodic visits to financial institutions and may impose capital or solvency obligations on financial institutions without taking control of such financial institutions.\n\nThe SFC may intervene in a bank's business: (i) prior to the liquidation of the bank, in order to prevent the bank from entering into a state where the SFC would need to take possession by taking one of the following recovery measures (' institutos de salvamento '): (a) submitting the bank to a special supervision regime; (b) issuing a mandatory order to recapitalize the bank; (c) placing the bank under the management of another authorized financial institution, acting as trustee;  (d)  ordering  the  transfer  of  all  or  part  of  the  assets,  liabilities  and  contracts  of  the  bank  to  another  financial institution; (e) ordering the bank to merge with one or more financial institutions that consent to the merger; (f) ordering the adoption of a recovery plan by the bank pursuant to guidelines approved by the government; (g) ordering the exclusion of certain assets and liabilities by requiring the transfer of such assets and liabilities to another institution designated by the SFC; or (h) ordering the progressive unwinding (' desmonte progresivo ') of the operations of the bank; or (ii) at any",

The SFC has the power to determine that such suspension will affect all of the obligations of the bank, or only certain types of obligations or even obligations up to or in excess of a specified amount.\n\nAs a result of a taking of possession, the SFC must appoint as special agent the person or entity designated by Fogafin to administer the affairs of the bank while such process lasts and until it is decided whether to liquidate the bank.\n\nIf the underlying problems that gave rise to the taking of possession of the bank are not resolved within a term not to exceed two years, the SFC must order the liquidation of the bank.\n\nDuring a taking of possession (which period ends when the liquidation process begins), Colombian banking laws prevent any creditor of the bank from: (i) initiating any procedure for the collection of any amount owed by the bank; (ii) enforcing any judicial decision rendered against the bank to secure payment of any of its obligations; (iii) constituting a lien or attachment over any of the assets of the bank to secure payment of any of its obligations; or (iv) making any payment, advance or compensation or assuming any obligation on behalf of the bank, with the funds or assets that may belong to it and are held by third parties,  except  for  payments  that  are  made  by  way  of  set-off  between  regulated  entities  of  the Colombian financial and insurance systems.\n\nIn the event that the bank is liquidated, the SFC must, among other measures, provide that all term obligations owed by the bank are due and payable as of the date when the order to liquidate becomes effective.\n\nIn the event of liquidation, bank deposits and certain other types of saving instruments are excluded from the process and paid prior to any other liabilities. The remaining claims are recognized in accordance with applicable law and the following rank: (i) claims related to court expenses incurred in the interest of all creditors, wages and other obligations related with employment contracts and tax authorities' credits regarding national and local taxes; (ii) claims secured by liens; (iii) claims secured by real estate collateral, such as mortgages; (iv) other claims of the tax authorities that are not included in the first class of claims and claims of suppliers of raw materials and inputs to the debtor; and (v) finally, all other claims without any priority or privilege, provided, however, that among credits of the fifth class, subordinated debt will be ranked junior to the external liabilities (' pasivos externos ') and senior only to capital stock.

Banks must pay an annual premium of 0.30% of total funds received on saving accounts, checking accounts, certificates of deposit and other deposits, which is paid in four quarterly installments. If a bank is liquidated, the deposit insurance will cover the funds deposited by an individual or corporation with such bank up to a maximum of COP 50 regardless of the number of accounts held.\n\n## Risk Management Systems\n\nCommercial banks must have risk administration systems to meet the SFC minimum standards for compliance and to avoid and mitigate the following risks: (i) credit; (ii) liquidity; (iii) market; (iv) operational; (v) money laundering and terrorism; and (vi) counterparty.\n\nThrough Circular 018 of 2021, the SFC issued the regulatory framework for the Comprehensive Risk Management System (' Sistema  Integral  de  Administraci\u00f3n  de  Riesgos ',  or  'SIAR'),  which  will  be  effective  as  of  June  1,  2023,  with  the exception of certain provisions related to risk data aggregation and reporting, which will be effective as of December 31, 2023, at the latest. These provisions require financial entities to have a global vision of the risks to which they are exposed, since it integrates the management of credit, market, operational, liquidity, counterparty, guarantee, insurance and country risks. Thus, in compliance with this regulation, on December 22, 2022, the Bank's internal SIAR implementation plan was sent to the SFC.\n\nCommercial banks generally have several risk measurement methods, including the risk weighted assets measurement which is calculated according to weight percentages assigned to different types of assets. There are some exceptions in which the weight percentage is higher and is calculated based on the associated risk perception of the evaluated asset. Provisions, which are calculated on a monthly basis, are another risk measurement method. The above only applies to stand-alone financial statements.\n\nWith respect to market risks, commercial banks must follow the provisions of the Circular Externa 100 of 1995 issued by the SFC ('Basic Accounting Circular'), which defines criteria and procedures for measuring a bank's exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks. Under such regulations, banks must submit to the SFC information on the net present value, duration, and interest rate of its assets, liabilities, and derivative positions. Colombian banks are required to calculate, for each position on the statement of financial position, a volatility rate and a parametric value at risk ('VaR'), which is calculated based on net present value, modified duration and a risk factor computed in terms of a basis points change. Each risk factor is calculated and provided by the SFC.\n\nWith respect to liquidity risk, financial entities must meet a liquidity coverage test that ensures their ability to hold liquid assets  sufficient  to  cover  potential  net  cash  outflows  for  a  period  of  30  days.  Net  cash  outflows  for  this  purpose  are contractual maturities of assets (interbank borrowings, financial assets investments, loans and advances to customers, derivative financial instruments) minus contractual maturities of liabilities (demand deposits, time deposits, interbank deposits borrowings from other financial institutions, debt instruments, derivative financial instruments) occurring within a  period of 30 days. For purposes of this calculation, liabilities do not include projections of future transactions. The maturity  of  the  loan  portfolio  is  affected  by  the  historical  default  indicator  and  the  maturity  of  deposits  is  modeled according to the regulation.\n\nFinancial  entities  are  also  required  to  meet  the  Net  Stable  Funding  Ratio  (' Coeficiente  de  Fondeo  Estable  Neto '  or 'NSFR') requirements. The NSFR will require credit institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain a stable funding profile",

        "page_content": "in relation to the composition of their assets. The NSFR is a ratio that seeks to limit excessive dependency on unreliable financing sources for strategic assets which are often illiquid. The NSFR is defined as the amount of Available Stable Funding, which includes equity and liabilities that will remain with the credit institution for more than one year. This ratio should be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis (Fondeo Estable Disponible or 'FED') of the amount of Required Stable  Funding (' Fondeo Estable Requerido ').  The  ratio  started  to  be  reported  on  March  31,  2020.  Nonetheless,  the External Circular 015 of 2021 maintained until March 31, 2023 the 25% weighting for the FED in demand and term deposits (less than six months) of financial entities and open collective investment funds, noting that this does not affect the schedule of convergence and compliance with the regulatory minimum of the NSFR in the terms established in External Circular 019 of 2019.\n\nWith respect to operational risk, commercial banks must assess, according to principles provided by the Basic Accounting Circular, each of their business lines (such as corporate finance, purchases and sales of securities, commercial banking, asset management, etc.) in order to record the risk events that may occur and result in fraud, technology problems, legal and reputational problems and problems associated with labor relations at the applicable bank.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering Provisions\n\nThe regulatory framework to prevent and control money laundering is contained in, among others, Decree 663 of 1993; the External Circular 029 of 2014 issued by the SFC; and the Colombian Criminal Code, as amended.\n\nColombian laws adopt the latest guidelines related to anti-money laundering and other terrorist activities established by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ('FATF'). Colombia, as a member of the GAFI-SUD (a FATFstyle regional body), follows the FATF's recommendations. In 2022, the SFC introduced new requirements for financial entities  and  their  risk  management  systems  for  Anti-Money  Laundering/Combating  the  Financing  of  Terrorism (AML/CFT) - in Colombia referred to as the 'Sistema  de  Administraci\u00f3n  del  Riesgo  de  Lavado de  Activos  y  de  la Financiaci\u00f3n  del  Terrorismo'  ('SARLAFT').  The  new  SARLAFT  requirements  include:  due  diligence  on  ultimate beneficial owners and politically exposed persons; countermeasures to circumstances that involve high-risk countries; information requirements in international and domestic transactions; supervision in correspondent activities; enhancement of technology tools and digital use of potential customer's identity, among others.\n\nFinancial  institutions  must  cooperate  with  the  appropriate  authorities  to  prevent  and  control  money  laundering  and terrorism financing. Finally, the Colombian Criminal Code introduced criminal rules and regulations to prevent, control, detect, eliminate and adjudicate all matters related to financing terrorism and money laundering, including the omission of reports on cash transactions, mobilization or storage of cash, and the lack of controls.\n\n## Consumer Protection\n\nLaw 1328 of 2009  establishes  a  set  of  rights  and  responsibilities  for  customers  of  the  financial  system  and  a  set  of obligations for financial institutions in order to minimize disputes. This law also gives foreign banks more flexibility to operate  in  Colombia  through  'branches'.  Following  its  adoption,  credit  institutions  were  allowed  to  operate  leasing businesses  and  banks  were  allowed  to  extend  loans  to  third  parties  so  that  borrowers  could  acquire  control  of  other companies.\n\n## Regulatory Framework for Subsidiaries that are Non-Participants in the Financial Sector\n\nAll  of  Bancolombia's  Colombian  subsidiaries  that  do  not  provide  financial  services  are  governed  by  the  laws  and regulations embodied in the Colombian Civil Code and the Colombian Commercial Code as well as any regulations issued",

In  addition,  certain  subsidiaries  of  Bancolombia  located  in other  countries have  transmitted directly to the  IRS the information required pursuant to FATCA, since those other countries have not entered into an IGA.\n\n## CRS\n\nThe CRS, approved by the OECD Council in 2014, is applicable to signatory countries of the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement ('MCAA') and requires signatory countries to obtain information from their financial institutions and  automatically  exchange  that  information  with  other  jurisdictions  on  an  annual  basis.  The  CRS  defines  (i)  which financial institutions are required to report; (ii) the types of accounts covered; and (iii) the due diligence procedures that financial institutions must follow to identify the reporting information.\n\nAmong the countries where Bancolombia operates, Colombia and Panam\u00e1, have entered into the MCAA.\n\nCompliance with the terms of the international conventions signed for the exchange of information under CRS, the laws or any other regulations enforced in the relevant jurisdictions may increase Bancolombia's compliance costs.\n\n## Financial Regulation in Panama\n\nThe banking business in Panama is regulated by the Law Decree 9 of 1998, subsequently amended by Law Decree 2 of 2008. In accordance with the Law Decree, as amended, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama, as the banking supervisor, has the power to issue agreements and resolutions to regulate the banking system. These regulations are mainly focused on matters such as licensing of banks, corporate governance, banking supervision (consolidated and individual or sub-consolidated), capital requirements, capital adequacy, liquidity requirements, risk management (credit, market, liquidity, country, asset and liability, operational, information technology, electronic banking), external audit, onsite inspections, reporting, compliance, change of control, mergers and acquisitions, confidentiality, money laundering, voluntary wind up, administrative and operational control, reorganization, bankruptcy, penalties, customers protection and dispute resolution.\n\nIn order to implement Basel III capital standards, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama issued in January 2015 an agreement on Capital Adequacy. This agreement sets forth the new composition of a banking institution's capital base, as well as the new capital adequacy ratio, including tier 1 core capital ratio and tier 1 capital ratio, all consistent with Basel III standards. This agreement became effective in June 2016 and as of January 1, 2019, the new standards became fully applicable. Regarding liquidity, banks operating under a general banking license, or General License Banks, are currently required to maintain 30% of their global deposits in liquid assets (which include short-term loans to other banks and other liquid assets) of the type prescribed by the Superintendency of Banks. Additionally, General License Banks are required to maintain assets in Panama of no less than 60% of their local deposits or any other percentage fixed by the Superintendency of Banks. Under the Banking Law, deposits from central banks and other similar depositories of the international reserves of sovereign states are immune from attachment or seizure proceedings. However, in 2018, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama, moving forward with the implementation of Basel III liquidity standards, issued an agreement on Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), also requiring General License Banks to maintain",

Daily compliance with the LCR (High Quality Liquid Assets as a percentage of net cash outflows) is being implemented progressively, beginning in December 2018 with a compliance percentage of 25%, until achieving a 100% compliance percentage in December 2022.\n\nThe Superintendency has also issued regulations, consistent with Basel III standards, regarding capital requirements for market risk on the trading book; and regulations to improve country risk management and operational risk management, as well as governance and controls regarding investment in securities.\n\nPanamanian  regulations  also  require  all  financial  institutions  to  maintain  a  legal  reserve  for  certain  obligations.  The Superintendency of Banks may require additional marginal reserves. The exact level and method of calculation of these reserve requirements is set by the Superintendency of Banks.\n\nAs for credit risk, in March 2016, the Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama issued Accord No.3-2016, which sets forth new risk weights applicable to on and off-balance sheet credit exposures, which are more risk sensitive in line with Basel II and Basel III standards. The Accord introduced the treatment of counterparty exposures in derivatives transactions, as well as credit risk mitigation techniques, such as the treatment of financial collaterals.\n\nIn Panama, banks are prohibited from granting, directly or indirectly, to any individual or legal person, including any entity that is part of the economic group of a bank, any loan or credit facility, guarantee or any other obligation (other than credit facilities  fully  secured  by  deposits  in  the  bank)  ('Credit  Facilities')  in  favor  of  said  person  exceeding  at  any  time, individually or jointly, 25% of the total regulatory capital of the bank. Obligations to related parties (as such term is defined in the applicable regulations) that exceed (i) 5% of its total capital, in the case of unsecured transactions, and (ii) 10% of its total capital, in the case of secured transactions (other than loans secured by deposits in the bank), are prohibited.\n\nBanks and banking groups (defined as the holding company and all direct and indirect subsidiaries of the holding company) are subject to inspection by the Superintendency of Banks, which must take place at least once every two years. The Superintendency of Banks is empowered to request from any bank or any company that belongs to the economic group of which  a  bank  in  Panama  is  a  member,  the  documents  and  reports  pertaining  to  its  operations  and  activities.  The Superintendency of Banks can assume the administrative and operating control of a bank, including possession of its assets and seizure of its management in order to defend the best interest of the bank's depositors and creditors, under any of the following grounds: (i) at the request of the bank; (ii) if the bank may not continue operations without endangering the interests of the depositors; (iii) as a consequence of the evaluation of an advisor's report; (iv) noncompliance with the measures ordered by the Superintendency of Banks; (v) if the bank carries out its operations in an illegal, negligent or fraudulent manner; (vi) if the bank has suspended payment of its obligations; and (vii) if the Superintendency of Banks confirms  that  capital  adequacy,  solvency  or  liquidity  of  the  bank  has  deteriorated  in  such  a  way  as  to  require  the Superintendency of Banks intervention. Upon expiration of the period of administrative control, the Superintendent will decide whether to proceed with the reorganization of the bank, the compulsory liquidation of the bank or the return of administrative and operating control to the directors or legal representatives of the bank, as applicable.\n\nThe Superintendency of Banks of the Republic of Panama is also in charge of the supervision and oversight of the trust business,  regulated  by  Law  1  of  1984,  which  set  forth  aspects  such  as  minimum  requirements  of  trust  agreements, characteristics of trusts, rights and responsibilities of grantors, trustees and beneficiaries.\n\nLaw No.21 of 2017 strengthens the oversight and regulation capabilities of the Superintendency of Banks, regarding the trust business. The Law imposes higher standards and provides for more detailed supervision, with respect to matters such as licensing, prudential regulation, corporate governance, reporting and customer protection, amongst others.\n\n## Other Regulations in Panama\n\nSecurities market activities in Panama are subject to the supervision, control and oversight of the Superintendency of the Securities Market. These activities are primarily regulated by Law Decree 1 of 1999, as amended by several laws. which established important changes in order to strengthen the regulatory framework of the Panamanian securities market and increase investors' confidence. Among the most important changes introduced by these amendments are the following: (i) the  establishment  of  a  coordination  and  cooperation  system  between  the  financial  supervisors,  enabling  a  more",

In Panama, anti-money laundering requirements are primarily regulated by (i) Executive Decree No. 136 of June 9, 1995, which created a Financial Analysis Unit ('UAF') for the Prevention of Money Laundering, and (ii) Law No. 23 of April 27, 2015 (as  amended,  'Law  23'),  regulated  by  Executive  Decree  No.  363  of  August  13,  2015,  whereby  banks  and  trust corporations, among other financial institutions, are required to perform their operations with due diligence and due care conducive to preventing said operations, to be performed with funds, or over funds, generated from activities related to money laundering.\n\nLaw 23 and Accord No. 7 of 2015 provide that the following entities are deemed to be 'supervised entities' for purposes of money laundering, financing of terrorism or any other illicit activity: (i) banks; (ii) bank groups; (iii) trust corporations; (iv) leasing companies; (v) factoring companies; (vi) credit, debit or pre-paid card processing entities; (vii) companies engaged in remittances or wire transfers; and (viii) companies that provide any other service related to trust companies. These entities must take necessary measures to prevent their operations and/or transactions from being used for money laundering, financing of terrorism or any other illicit activity, including tax evasion. Following recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Law No.70 of 2019 was enacted to include tax evasion as an offense precedent to money laundering, complemented by Law 254 of November 11, 2021, that includes dispositions on fiscal transparency and anti-money laundering prevention, focusing on availability of accounting records, due diligence, and final beneficiary dispositions.\n\nPanama has also moved forward with the adoption of international standards on transparency and cooperation on tax matters,  through  the  approval  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Agreement  for  the  implementation  of  FATCA  in  2016,  the commitment regarding the automatic exchange of information on a bilateral basis and under the Common Reporting Standard, beginning in September 2018, and the ratification of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance on Tax Matters in 2017. All of the above have enabled the exchange of information for tax matters between the Panamanian tax authorities, and a broader set of countries to implement these commitments. Regulations were adopted in 2016 and 2017, and later amended, setting forth the obligations and responsibilities of banking institutions, regarding due diligence procedures in order to identify reportable accounts under FATCA and CRS, as well as responsibilities regarding  control  measures  and  reporting  requirements  necessary  to  comply  with  such  international  standards  and agreements.",

Decree 592 states that the Superintendency of the Financial System and the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador are mandated to supervise all members of the financial system and to  approve the necessary regulation for the adequate application of Decree 592.The Superintendency of the Financial System is responsible for the supervision of the individual and consolidated activities of all the members in the Salvadorian financial system, as well as the people, operations and entities described in the law.\n\nDecree 592 establishes all the powers and duties of the Superintendency, some of which are: (i) to fulfill and enforce the regulations applicable to the entities subject to its supervision and issue all the necessary instructions for compliance of the  laws  applicable  to  the  system;  (ii)  to  authorize  the  establishment,  function,  operation,  intervention,  suspension, modification, revocation of authorizations and closure of all members of the system, in accordance with regulations. In the event of closure, the Superintendency will coordinate with the entities involved the actions established by the law; (iii) risk  prevention  through  the  monitoring  and  management  of  the  members  within  the  system  with  a  view  toward  the prudential  management  of  liquidity  and  capital  adequacy;  (iv)  facilitation  of  an  efficient,  transparent  and  organized financial  system;  (v)  to  require  that  all  supervised  entities  and  institutions  be  managed  in  accordance  with  the  best international practices of risk management and corporate governance; and (vi) all other legal requirements.\n\nIn  2015,  the  Salvadorian  congress  amended  Decree  592  to  include  within  the  scope  of  the  supervision  of  the Superintendency of the Financial System all legal entities  dedicated  to  the  money  transfer  business.  In  2016  another amendment to Decree 592 was enacted to define the requirements that must be met by valuation experts when elaborating valuation reports in connection with guarantees of loans granted by financial entities.\n\n## Banking Law of El Salvador\n\nDecree 697 of 1999 enacted by Salvadorian congress, regulates the financial intermediation activities and other operations performed by banks.  Banks  are  required  to  establish  a  liquidity  provision  as  required  by  the  Superintendency  of  the Financial System in accordance with the deposits and liabilities of each bank.\n\nAccording to the Salvadorian regulation, the liquidity provision for Salvadorian banks as of December 31, 2021 are:\n\n|                               | Ordinary Reserve Requirements  %   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Checking accounts             | 15%                                |\n| Saving accounts               | 15%                                |\n| Time deposits                 | 12%                                |\n| Borrowings from foreign banks | 3%                                 |\n| Long-term debt(1)             | 5%- 15%                            |\n| Checking accounts             | 15%                                |\n\n## Monetary Integration Law of El Salvador\n\nThe Monetary Integration Law adopted the U.S. dollar as the legal tender, establishing a fixed exchange rate of 8.75 Colones per USD 1.00. The col\u00f3n continues to have  unrestricted legal circulation, but the Central Reserve Bank has replaced it with the U.S. dollar each time col\u00f3n bills and coins were used in commercial transactions.",

The operations or transactions of the financial system made or agreed in Colones before the effective date of the Monetary Integration Law are expressed in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate established in such law.\n\n## Investment Funds Law\n\nThe  investment  funds  law  seeks  to  encourage  economic  activity  by  providing  small  investors  with  access  to  capital markets, diversification of their investments and channeling of their savings into productive sectors, in order to generate higher economic growth.\n\nThis Law sets forth the regulatory framework for the supervision of investment funds, their share of participation and companies that administer such funds and their operations; as well as other participants to which it refers. Additionally, it regulates the marketing of participation shares in foreign investment funds.\n\nThis Law also provides for the creation of investment fund managers who are responsible for performing all activities, contracts, and operations necessary for the administration and operation of investment funds.\n\nIn 2016, the Central Bank enacted Technical Standards ('Normas T\u00e9cnicas') to apply this Law. Such technical standards include standards regarding permitted transactions by the investment funds, and standards related to the disclosure of information, among other things.\n\n## Financial Inclusion Law\n\nThis  law  was  enacted  by  the  Salvadorian  congress  in  September  2015  and  aims  to  promote  financial  inclusion  and competition in the Salvadorian financial system, as well as to reduce costs for users and customers of such system, through: a)  the authorization of Electronic Money Issuers and the rules for their transactions, limits and backup deposits at the Central Reserve Bank; and b) authorizing existing banks to use the 'Simplified Account', an account that doesn't require customers to have a tax ID and allows limited balances and transactions.\n\nThis law encourages and promotes citizens to have access to formal financial services and to use retail payment instruments to achieve their insertion into productive activities, contributing to the improvement of their quality of life and well-being, and therefore the law facilitates the development of financial products that are designed having in mind the income levels and volume of transactions of the low-income population.\n\n## Consumer Protection Law\n\nThis law has been in force in El Salvador since September 2005. Its purpose is to protect the rights of consumers in order to ensure balance, certainty and legal security in their relationships with commercial establishments, including financial institutions, retailers and suppliers. The law also, created the institutional framework to enable enforcement of the law and safeguard consumer's rights.\n\nThe law applies to commercial activities generally, e-commerce included, but also has specific regulations that apply to financial services providers, especially regarding obligations and prohibitions, as well as setting limits for the amounts of bank fees and surcharges, and contract requirements.\n\n## Bitcoin Law\n\nOn June 8, 2021, the Congress of the Republic of El Salvador enacted Legislative Decree 57 with the purpose of regulating Bitcoin as legal tender, unrestricted in any type of transaction carried out in El Salvador ('Bitcoin Law'). The Bitcoin Law has been in force since September 7, 2021.",

In order to obtain that registration, the supplier must comply with all mandatory requirements, including the filing of a form, along with all corporate documents, and the establishment of Anti-Money Laundering programs, policies and procedures to safeguard client's assets with a high degree of care, cybersecurity program, among others.\n\nOther regulations related to the implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender that have been issued are the NRP-29 Technical Standards  to  facilitate  the  participation  of  financial  entities  in  the  Bitcoin  ecosystem,  and  the  guidelines  for  the authorization of the operation of the technological platforms for Bitcoin and Dollar services, both approved on September 7 by the Central Reserve Bank.\n\nThe institutions subject to such technical standards are banks, cooperative banks, savings and credit entities, and electronic money suppliers. The purpose of NRP-29 is to regulate the services provided by these institutions to their clients, whether such services are offered directly or through a supplier of bitcoin services. The purpose of the guidelines is to establish the applicable provisions for the authorization of the operation of the technological platforms for Bitcoin and Dollar services, that the regulated subjects wish to provide to their clients.\n\n## Financial Regulation in Guatemala\n\nDecree No. 16-2002, Guatemalan Central Bank Law (' Ley Organica del Banco de Guatemala '), sets forth the scope of the activities of Banco de Guatemala in its capacity as Central Bank of the country, establishing as its fundamental purpose contributing to the creation and maintenance of the most favorable conditions for an orderly development of the national economy, for which it shall facilitate the monetary, foreign exchange and credit conditions that promote stability in general prices.\n\nPursuant to Decree No. 16 -2002, Banco de Guatemala's main objectives are to (i) be the sole issuer of the national currency, (ii) assure the effective functioning of the national payments system, (iii) assure an adequate liquidity level in the banking system, (iv) receive in deposit bank reserve requirements and statutory deposits, (v) manage international reserves.\n\nDecree No. 16- 2002 also regulates the activities of the Monetary Board as governing body of the Banco de Guatemala financial system. Pursuant to Decree No. 16-2002, the Monetary Board has roles with respect to the Guatemalan financial system, such as: (i) determine and assess the monetary, currency exchange and credit policies of the country; (ii) ensure liquidity and solvency of the national banking system; (iv) regulate the Banking Clearing House Chamber; (v) authorize the investment policy of international monetary reserves; and (vi) establish the minimum reserves required in order to strengthen the Banco de Guatemala's net worth, among others.\n\nThe Superintendency of Banks is created and regulated by Decree No. 18-2002 Bank Supervision Law (Ley de Supervisi\u00f3n Financiera). The Decree establishes the scope of the Superintendency's regulatory and supervisory activities within the financial system. Thus, the Superintendency of Banks is in charge of the supervision of entities such as the Banco de Guatemala,  banks,  financial  corporations,  credit  institutions,  bond  entities,  insurance  entities,  warehouse  deposit companies, currency exchange offices, financial groups and holding companies of financial groups, and other entities as mentioned by law.",

To  verify  compliance  with  the  regulation,  banking  institutions  must  provide  the Superintendence of Banks with a daily report detailing the minimum reserve requirement.\n- b) Loan Loss Reserves: In accordance with limitations specified by Decree 19 of 2002, (Banks and Financial Groups Law) and regulations issued by the Monetary Board, banking institutions, financial service entities, international banking entities and other financial institutions must carry out quarterly delinquency assessments of their credit and record reserves based on estimates of non-recoverability. Banking institutions and financial corporations must  provide  to  the  Superintendence  of  Banks  monthly  reports  concerning  outstanding  credits  in  effect  and movements and appraisals  of  credit  portfolios  in  accordance  with  criteria  specified  by  the  Monetary  Board. Additionally, the Superintendence of Banks carries out on-site reviews in which it evaluates payment ability and payment fulfillment of debtors and requests the institutions to record that necessary reserves be based on the nonpayment risk.\n- c) Capital  Requirements:  As  specified  in  regulations  issued  by  the  Monetary  Board,  banking  institutions  in Guatemala  must  have  a  minimum  capital  adequacy  ratio  (risk-weighted  assets  to  equity)  of  10%,  which  is consistent with the Basel I guidelines. Banks must submit a weekly report to the Superintendence of Banks for monitoring compliance with this requirement.\n- d) Related Party Transactions: In its on-site reviews the Superintendence of Banks verifies that financial institutions are in compliance with Monetary Board regulations limiting transactions between related parties. Related parties may conduct business with one another provided they do so in accordance with their normal standards of business. The Banks and Financial Groups Law establishes the limitations to carry out operations that imply direct and indirect  financing  of  any  nature,  regardless  of  the  legal  form  they  take,  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  bonds, promissory notes, obligations and/or credits, or grant guarantees or endorsements, which together exceed the following thresholds:\n- 1. 15% of the assets attributable to a single individual or legal person, of a private nature; or one State or autonomous company or entity.\n- 2. 30% of the assets attributable to two or more related persons who are part of a risk unit.\n\nIn addition, when a bank has a deficit in its regulatory capital (deficiencia patrimonial), it must immediately report it to the Superintendence of Banks. The Monetary Board will immediately order the suspension of operations of a bank that has suspended payment of its obligations and has a deficit in regulatory capital that exceeds 50% of equity, or if it has not submitted to the Superintendence of Banks a recovery plan, or if such plan has been rejected or has not been complied with. In such a case, the Monetary Board will name an Assets and Liabilities Exclusion Board which will be responsible for suspending the obligations of the entity and closing its operations. If, after suspension of operations, the Board of Assets and Liabilities Exclusion reports to the Monetary Board that dissolution is inevitable, the Monetary Board must",

Once bankruptcy proceedings commence, the Savings Protection Fund participates as the entity in charge of the recovery of depositor funds.\n\nThe Law for Banks and Financial Groups provides a regularization plan, and if deemed convenient, at the discretion of the Monetary Board, limits on distributions to shareholders of a bank as well as the possibility of placing a member on the Board of Directors.\n\nDecree  No.  19-2002  regulates  the  creation,  organization,  merging,  activities,  operations,  functioning,  suspension  of operations  and  winding  up  of  banks  and  financial  entities,  as  well  as  the  establishment  and  closure  of  branches  and representation offices of foreign banks in Guatemala.\n\nDecree 19 of 2002 allows financial entities to form financial groups or conglomerates under the common control of a holding entity or to designate one of the financial entities of  the group as its holding company. In order to form such financial group conglomerates, it is necessary that the financial group has a bank. The identification as a financial group does not entail that the financial group becomes a separate legal entity. Rather, the purpose of such identification is to allow the Superintendency of Banks to perform its supervision tasks on a consolidated basis.\n\n## Other Regulations in Guatemala\n\nDecree No. 94- 2000 (' Ley de Libre negociaci\u00f3n de Divisas ') permits and regulates the use, transfer and payment in foreign currencies, as well as the use of foreign currency accounts and deposits within the Guatemalan financial system. Corporations  and  other  entities  that  wish  to  offer  securities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  must  obtain  prior authorization from the Monetary Board.\n\nDecree No.67-2001 establishes the Anti-Money Laundering Law (' Ley Contra el Lavado de Dinero u Otros Activos '). The law was enacted to prevent and control money laundering in connection with criminal activities. Regulations issued by the Superintendency of Banks in accordance with this law went into effect on April 26, 2002. Among other things, the law and regulations created the Financial Intelligence Unit within the Superintendence of Banks under the name of Special Verification  Intendancy  (' Intendencia  de  Verificaci\u00f3n  Especial '  or  'IVE').  The  Special  Verification  Intendancy  has developed a national network for the prevention, control and surveillance of money-laundering activities. Penalties for non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations are set forth in the Superintendence of Banks Resolution 43-2002 and include fines for bank directors or employees and the suspension or cancellation of a financial institution's license.\n\nOn  December  1,  2021,  a  new  Technological  Risk  Management  Regulation  (' Reglamento  de  Manejo  de  Riesgo Tecnol\u00f3gico ') was published, which aims to establish the minimum guidelines that banks and other financial entities must comply with to manage technological risk. Among other provisions, the new regulation: i) establishes obligations that financial institutions have when contracting services that process and/or store information with third parties; ii) sets rules related to the backup computing center for the institution, providing that it must be in a geographical location other than the main computer center of the entity; iii) establishes the requirement to obtain authorization to process and/or store information  outside  the  national  territory,  including  a  requirement  to  obtain  a  legal  opinion  from  a  lawyer  from  the jurisdiction where the information will be processed and/or stored; and iv) indicates the minimum requirements for the backup copies of the IT infrastructure information, information system and database.\n\nAdditionally, within the rules that the Monetary Board has issued regulating financial institutions, Resolution JM-93-2005 (Regulations for Credit Risk Management) seeks to regulate certain matters that must be reviewed by banks, offshore entities and the companies of a financial group that grant financing, such as the minimum information of the financing applicants and debtors, and the valuation of credit assets.\n\nIn addition, authorized operations between companies of the same financial group are regulated by Resolution JM-1802002 (' Reglamento de operaciones que pueden efectuar entre s\u00ed las empresas del Grupo Financiero '). The purpose of this regulation is to regulate the financial and/or service provision operations that may be carried out by the companies of the financial group among themselves, in accordance with the provisions of article 46, paragraph b), of Law of Banks and Financial Groups.",

This include a strategy to manage liquidity risk that incorporates the institution's credit profile, policies and processes and prudential measures to identify, quantify, monitor and control said risk and to be able to manage liquidity on a daily basis, as well as contingency plans to deal with liquidity constraints.\n\n## B.9        CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK\n\nAs  cybersecurity  incidents  in  the  financial  industry  increase  exponentially  in  frequency  and  impact,  affecting  the organizations' reputation, banks must adequately deploy defenses to discourage would-be attackers' plans. Materialization of cyber-security risks may result in the unauthorized access to confidential information, technological breaches of the infrastructure  of  the  Bank  with  the  aim  of  stealing  information,  fraud  due  to  exploitation  of  vulnerabilities  and  the interruption of the Bank's services.\n\nThe Bank's internal policies define cybersecurity risk as the possibility of an economic or non-economic loss arising from a violation of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information that the Bank processes. However, the Bank does not have control over or manage our customer desktops, laptops or other devices, therefore, any occurrence of a cyber risk in these systems cannot be attributed to it, unless at least one of the following events occurs: (i) intentional interruption of the Bank's informational and technological infrastructure, excluding technological or operative failures; (ii) successful unauthorized access to information or to a system; or (iii) unauthorized change in the Bank's hardware, firmware, or software.\n\nBancolombia implemented a strategy designed to allow it to protect and maintain the operations of the company's business processes, mitigating the security risks to which the organization was exposed by these new conditions, including those related to the interruption, exposure, leak, or damage to the integrity of critical business information, as well as the lack of availability of resources and customer service. This strategy includes the implementation of a documented management process designed to oversee cybersecurity and information security to provide a framework that handles the information's risks according to the objectives, strategies, regulations, and industry best practices.\n\nThe framework used to manage cyber-security risks is designed under practices of international frameworks and standards issued  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  in  NIST  SP  800-30  and  NIST  Cybersecurity Framework,  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  in  ISO/IEC-27032,  as  well  as  the  definitions established by the Bank.\n\nThe cyber-security and information security division of the Bank is responsible for cyber-security risk management, a function performed together with the business, technology, risk, and internal audit teams. The team considers the nature of the Bank, its risk appetite, customer needs, business strategy and the environment of the financial industry.\n\nThe  framework  seeks  to  ensure  that  the  risks  are  identified,  measured,  controlled  and  monitored,  and  considers  the international and regional best practices and regulations. The cyber-security risk management system is designed as a three line  of  defense  model, distinguishing between three groups involved in effective risk management: (i)  a first line of defense,  which  is  responsible  for  defining  information  security  strategy  and  the  preventive  detection  and  isolation  of advanced  threats,  (ii)  a  second  line  of  defense  that  establishes  the  risk  management  framework  to  provide  timely information that supports upper management in their decision making process, and (iii) a third line of defense that supports regulatory compliance, the strengthening of good practices in information security and the independent supervision of the of the implementation of the first two lines of defense.\n\nThe Bank's senior management is committed to cybersecurity risk management, through a clear strategy which includes the allocation of human, technical and financial resources and a clear definition and disclosure of responsibilities regarding to cybersecurity, as discussed below.\n\nSenior management has established a cybersecurity and information security committee, responsible for approving and promoting the most important policies, strategies, and projects, being informed, and making decisions about associated controls, periodically evaluating the strategic and tactical plans of compliance, the review, approval and prioritization of",

This Committee is formed by seven vice presidents of the following functions: Bancolombia's Corporate Services, Banistmo's Corporate Services, BAM's Corporate  Services,  Banco  Agr\u00edcola's  Corporate  Services,  Bancolombia's  Administrative  and  Security  Services, Bancolombia's Corporate Human Resources, and Bancolombia's Corporate Risk.\n\nIn addition to senior management, Bancolombia's Board of Directors is also involved in cyber-security risk management, the Board has a member who has been trained and continues to be trained in cyber-security and information security issues.\n\nSince cyber risk is supervised by the Risk Committee, the Risk Corporate Vice Presidency is responsible for proposing the methodology, procedures and tools for cybersecurity related risks management and the management policies which is approved by the Board of Directors; ensuring that an appropriate cybersecurity risk management process is maintained and keeping the Board of Directors informed of its effectiveness according to the approved guidelines and methodologies; and  analyzing  periodically  the  reports  that  are  submitted  by  the  senior  management  on  cybersecurity  risk  exposure, exposures substantial changes, tolerance level compliance and mitigation and management measures adopted by the Bank. Through the Audit and Risk Committees, in which members of the Board of Directors participate, members receive regular reports on cybersecurity and information security relevant issues, the level of compliance with the approved policies and procedures for cybersecurity risk management, as well as relating to the causes of any breaches and the measures adopted to address the gaps identified by the Cybersecurity and Information Security Committee, to consider any corrective actions required.\n\nFurthermore, due to the challenges raised by the COVID-19 pandemic such as hybrid working arrangements -that is, a combination of remote and on-site work -plus the accelerated digital transformation and the increasing adoption of cloud solutions has brought additional challenges with new threats and increased the probability that the existing ones could occur. In this new environment, the security perimeter extends to employees, outsourced staff and third parties outside the organization, working from any device from anywhere in the world and accessing the organization's information and services.\n\nSome practices to keep the organization safe in the new environment were, among others: enabling secure schemes for remote work with multiple authentication factors, selected third party security assessments, identification and protection of critical assets, risk management of our assets and those of third parties, the strengthening of access control and identity management,  secure  application  development,  and  securing  the  technological  infrastructure,  business  operations  and human resources.\n\nLikewise, the practices adopted by the Bank include the deployment of controls and strategies for data loss prevention, information lifecycle  management, actions to mitigate phishing, smishing and identity theft,  protection  of  emails  and collaborative tools, and the adjustment of rules regarding safe browsing. Threat hunting, and threat intelligence, the use of penetration tests and management of vulnerabilities, event monitoring, business resilience including the response and recovery of capabilities or services affected in a cyberattack, and cloud security are also part of the practices implemented in the organization.\n\nIn 2021 the Bank appointed a specific project team to accelerate the identification and classification of the information assets that Bancolombia exchanges with its most critical third parties. Through this initiative, an updated inventory is being developed  and  maintained,  compliance  with  the  controls  required  for  its  protection  is  being  evaluated,  and  the cybersecurity and information security risks that are being identified, assessed and treated.\n\nIn  addition,  our  cybersecurity  teams  strive  to  educate,  support,  and  equip  our  employees  and  third  parties  with  the knowledge and the tools to prevent, mitigate, and report cyber-attacks and incidents, and keep the Bank and customer's data protected. During 2021, a series of awareness and sensitization activities were carried out for all our employees and a large number of third parties, in some cases with the support of experts in the field.\n\nIn 2021, Bancolombia invested USD 31.1 million in activities related to preventive, detective, and corrective efforts for cybersecurity  management,  including:  insurance  policies,  human  resources  costs,  security  solutions  licensing  and  the administration and maintenance of cybersecurity controls for the Bank. In 2021, Bancolombia had no cybersecurity or information security incidents that materially affected the Bank in an economic or non-economic manner, in accordance",

Additionally, cybersecurity and information security reports are generated periodically for the  review  by  the  members  of  Bancolombia's  Board  of  Directors,  where  the  status  of  cybersecurity  and  information security  is  reported.  Bancolombia  did  not  experience  direct  cybersecurity  impacts  due  to  the  COVID  19  pandemic, however in 2021 there was a decrease (compared with 2020) in phishing attacks on our clients in which the Bank identified and dismantled 2,791 fraudulent sites.\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the Bank has not faced a cyber-attack with a material impact on its business or customers. However, we can give no assurance that the previously described measures, initiatives, and procedures will be 100% effective in preventing or mitigating potential future attacks or threats to our technology infrastructure. Any failure by the Bank to detect or prevent cyber-security risk in a timely manner could result in a negative impact on the Bank's results of operations and financial position, or in problems with information, including data related to customers being lost, compromised, or delivered to the Bank's customers with delays or errors. The public perception that a cyber-attack on  its  systems  may  be  successful,  whether  or  not  this  perception  is  correct,  may  damage  the  Bank's  reputation  with customers, regulators and third parties with whom it does business.\n\nFinally, the SEC proposed amendments to its rules to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident reporting by public companies. These amendments include, among other things: (i) reporting about material cybersecurity incidents and periodic reporting to provide updates about previously reported cybersecurity incident; and (ii) periodic reporting about a registrant's policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks; the registrant's board of directors' oversight of cybersecurity risk; as well as management's role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk and implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures; and annual reporting or certain proxy disclosure about the board of directors' cybersecurity expertise, if any.  Subject to the issuance of final rules, the Bank is analyzing the potential impacts that these amendments could have, as well as the actions to be taken in this regard.\n\n## B.10        COVID-19 CONSIDERATIONS\n\nSince the beginning of March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 impacted the Bank's operations, customers, suppliers, and employees. This circumstance affected the Bank's Colombian and Central American operations. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, a more positive trend began to be seen and this continued during 2021.\n\nFollowing the initial impacts of the pandemic, the economic recovery was better than expected in the countries where the Bank operates.\n\nThe measures undertaken by the Bank to mitigate COVID-19 impacts related mainly to Colombia and Panama given that the most severe effects of the pandemic took place in these countries when compared to Guatemala and El Salvador. In Colombia particularly, for those customers that needed support with their obligations, the Bank applied the Debtor Support Program (DPS). This program was in force until August 31, 2021 and allowed customers to pay lower installments and continue to meet their obligations and covered more than 1.1 million loans.\n\nSince not all customers recovered at the same pace, the Bank continued to offer alternatives for debtors, even after the DPS ended. As a result, between September and December 2021, approximately 236,000 customers that continued to be affected by the pandemic (including retail, SMEs, and corporate customers) received some options regarding their loans, such as extension of the loans maturities, deferrals, and grace periods.  Similar measures were taken by the Bank's Central American Operations.\n\nThe Bank also supported suppliers by reducing payment terms to 30 days or less, giving priority to those that, due to their size and diminished possibility of financial leverage, needed more liquidity. At the end of 2021, 10,833 suppliers were benefited by this initiative.",

        "page_content": "Bancolombia also supported the Colombian Government platform to deliver subsidies. Through its channels, the Bank continued  to  work  with  the  National  Government  in  the  delivery  of  subsidies  to  vulnerable  households,  as  well  as companies whose operations were affected by the pandemic. In 2021, the Bank distributed subsidies of the solidarity income (' plan ingreso solidario' ) to 880,539 people and formal employment support program ('programa de ingreso solidario' or ' PAEF) to 44,625 beneficiary companies.\n\nBancolombia also supported the Vaccination Plan in Colombia, donating 22,000 doses of the vaccine Sinovac.\n\nIn Panama, Banistmo devoted essential resources to help clients, both individuals and companies, with the impacts from the pandemic. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the superintendency of finance in Panama deployed several measures to help make financial obligations more manageable. Banistmo together with the regulator joined efforts to offer massive credit relief programs available to clients in the form of payment deferrals. A new category for loans subject to relief was implemented, past due balances were frozen, interest on arrears were excluded from charges and customers were exempted from being reported to credit bureaus.\n\nAs of December of 2021, a small portion of the loan portfolio in Banistmo is still subject to credit relief as the Bank made debt restructuring available to many customers on their existing balances to accept repayment on a longer term than initially considered under the massive program launched in 2020 by financial institutions in Panama.\n\nFor more information on the Bank's risks associated to COVID-19, refer to Item 3.D. Risk Factors - 'Our financial results may be negatively affected by macroeconomic and other challenges and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic'.\n\n## B.11       ESG\n\n## General approach to ESG\n\nIn Bancolombia, we believe in responsible and sustainable investment, and we are aware that ESG criteria are essential to the conduct of our business. We are committed to incorporating these criteria as a fundamental and integral element in all our investment processes. Since 2014, we have sought to deepen the integration of sustainability criteria in our product offering,  our  recommendations  to  the  market  and  our  investment  strategy.  This  commitment  is  aligned  with  a global agenda, which is to comply with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), designed to achieve more prosperous societies and protect the planet.\n\nLeading indexes around the world constantly monitor the performance of companies in environmental, social, economic, and corporate governance terms. Bancolombia is included in many of these indexes, encouraging the implementation of ESG practices. Thus, in November 2021, Bancolombia was recognized as the fifth most sustainable bank, according to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\n\nIn terms of ESG governance, under the guidelines issued by the Board of Directors and its committees, the sustainability committee is the responsible body for ESG issues in the Bank.\n\nRegarding  regulation  of  ESG  matters,  in  Colombia,  the  Government  issued  Decree  151  of  2021  which  reformed  the information  disclosure  regime  by  securities  issuers,  such  as  the  Bank,  providing  a  two-year  transition  period  for  its implementation.  Furthermore, the SFC issued at the end of 2021, the External Circular 031 which requires, no later than the year 2024, the disclosure of information related to ESG matters from a financial materiality perspective. Likewise, on March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed rules that would require registrants, including foreign private issuers, such as the Bank, to include climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. This proposal, which is modeled in part on the recommendations of the TCFD and upon the GHG Protocol, would require disclosure of climate-related risks, greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial metrics. The Bank is currently analyzing the potencial impact and reviewing the potencial disclosure roadmap to be followed in response to these rules and proposed rules.",

        "page_content": "## Governance and Economic Dimension\n\nOur corporate framework of principles and policies enables us to integrate ESG criteria into our business model and act in a  sustainable  way. This framework is established by the Board of Directors, as the body responsible for defining the strategy and long-term objectives of the company. Directly or through its Committees, the Board oversees compliance with our sustainability strategy, supervision of the measures undertaken to mitigate climate change risk,  adoption of principles  for  responsible  investment  and  education  of  employees  to  make  them  aware  of  these  principles  and implementation of policies designed to ensure compliance with applicable law in the countries where we operate.\n\nAdditionally, members of senior management act as the sustainability committee.  The Sustainability Committee analyzes the opportunities, risks and challenges related to sustainability and discusses the progress of our ESG agenda, in alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure.\n\nThe Bank has a sustainability division that coordinates and drives the ESG agenda in accordance with our corporate strategy and policies. This division is led by a senior manager, who is part of the Sustainability Committee.\n\nIn  terms  of  diversity  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  company  seek  to  promote  a  mix  of  experience,  knowledge,  and innovative and challenging visions, in accordance with the economic, social, and business environment. Bancolombia aims for diversity in the composition of its Board of Directors, particularly in gender and nationality. Currently, 29% of our Board of Directors is represented by women (2 out of 7 board members) and 29% are non-Colombian directors (2 out of 7 members). The directors' profiles can be consulted at Item 6.A. - 'Directors and Senior Management'.\n\nBancolombia believes that the criteria considered by the shareholders in nominating candidates to the Board of Directors must  include  an  awareness  of  the  need  for  an  integrated  business  management  which  combines  a  commitment  to sustainable business activity with the proper management of government resources. One factor to consider in this regard are a director's professional skills. Given this, it was essential to the Board that one of the directors have a background in ESG matters.  Accordingly, since 2016 Arturo Condo Tamayo has served as the expert director in sustainability and cybersecurity.\n\nIn terms of our tax strategy, through planning, advice, and control of tax processes the Bank complies with applicable tax regulations,  optimizes  tax  management  and  influences  the  business  decision-making  process,  to  manage  tax  risk  and contribute to the financial performance.\n\nWe adopted tax policies approved by the Board of Directors, such as the following: the companies must (i) comply with their obligations in accordance with the tax regulations in force in each country and ensure compliance with the laws and regulations in the countries where we operate; (ii) strive for greater collaboration with the tax authorities for the proper development of their functions; (iii) disclose to our stakeholders, in the annual report, the amount of taxes paid; (iv) not participate in artificial tax structures, without real economic justification and business purpose, or that lack commercial substance;  and  (v)  identify,  measure,  monitor  and  mitigate  the  risks  associated  to  our  tax  affairs,  under  existing  tax principles in each country where we operate, among others.\n\nIn Bancolombia, we established ethical principles in the code of conduct and ethics, according to our organizational culture and corporate governance principles.\n\nTo promote our ethical behavior, we have stablished the following polices: anti-fraud and anti-corruption policy, integrity and compliance manual, and financing of political parties policy. We have a phone line called the 'ethics line' (' l\u00ednea \u00e9tica '), which is an anonymous and confidential service for employees and other stakeholders to report potential fraud, ethics violations and other related matters.\n\nIn addition, we have an ethics committee whose purpose is to build a series of guidelines to encourage and internalize the principles and values that we proclaim in our organization related to the decisions we make.",

We incorporated into our client experience quality measurement an understanding of their willingness to recommend us to third parties, using the net promoter score (NPS) methodology as the chief indicator in the group of metrics that allow us to assess the organization's overall performance in this regard. Using this indicator allows us to understand not only our clients' satisfaction but also their brand loyalty. This metric is measured on the standard parameters from 0 to 100%. In 2021, our NPS indicator was 65.32%.\n\nIn terms of the economic dimension, we are integrating ESG aspects into our business strategy, including Retail Banking, Wealth Management, Corporate Banking, Asset Management and Project Finance. We know that ESG has an important role  in  addressing  sustainability  challenges  by  facilitating  the  transition  to  a  low  carbon  economy  and  stimulating sustainable  development.  To that  end,  we  set  a  goal  to  invest  COP  500  trillion  before  2030  through  credit  and  other financial services. This goal to incorporate ESG variables extends to all our business segments and includes processes of due diligence, engagement, knowledge of clients and finance through innovative products for sustainable solutions.\n\nSome of the ESG aspects we have included in our business strategy include:\n\n- (i) We expect that by 2025, all assets under management of the Bank will be invested, to some extent, in strategies driven by ESG criteria.\n- (ii) We developed the Sustainability credit line, which is a special financing line designed to support our customers in the  development  of  projects  that  promote  the  use  of  clean  technologies,  gender  equality,  renewable  energies, efficient use of energy, clean fuels, and reduction of waste, emissions, and discharges, among others.\n- (iii) We finance SMEs and entrepreneurs and support them in their growth so that their productivity and employment opportunities increase and have a positive impact on the country's economy.\n- (iv) We also have been implementing a sustainable funding strategy. To date, we have issued four green or sustainable bonds for gross proceeds of USD 477 million that we have used to finance initiatives related to, among others, clean energy, sustainable construction, and cleaner production.\n\nFinally, we have adopted the Equator Principles and the Performance Standards of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation - IFC, as standards for the identification, evaluation and management of environmental and social risks and impacts implicit in the operations and projects we finance. During 2021, 112 operations were evaluated through the Socio-Environmental Risk Analysis process.\n\nIn addition to complying with the requirements of the Equator Principles (Project Finance and Corporative Loans), our environmental and social risks policy covers credit and leasing operations in excess of USD 1 million, and if there is any operation with a risk that generates a warning below this amount, an evaluation over such operation must be made. Also, our environmental and social risk assessment covers liens, assets received as guarantees and those that are under lease agreements and received as payment in defaulted operations.\n\nAdditionally, Bancolombia has a controversial issues policy that defines the activities that we are not willing to finance because of their high social and environmental impact, and the conditions for financing and investing in economic sectors with high environmental and social impact.\n\n## Environmental Dimension\n\nWe seek to identify the direct and indirect impacts of our activities and encourage the prevention, mitigation, correction, and compensation for those impacts.",

We  have  set  up environmental policies, which include environmental and social risk analysis, Environmental Management, Controversial issues in financing and investment, Responsible investment, Climate change and sustainable procurement.\n\nClimate Change: Climate forms part of our broader environmental agenda, and we recognize that managing climaterelated risks and opportunities is vital to the long-term sustainability of the Bank. For this reason, Bancolombia became one of the founding banks of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. This is an industry-led Alliance, hosted by the United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and co-launched by the Financial Services Taskforce (FSTF). Under this alliance (NZBA), Bancolombia committed to: 1. Transition all operational and attributable GHG emissions from our lending and investment portfolios to align with pathways to net-zero by mid-century, or sooner, including CO2 emissions reaching net-zero at the latest by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. 2. Use decarbonization scenarios which are from credible and well-recognized sources; 3. Prioritize our efforts where we have, or can have, the most significant impact, i.e. the most GHG-intensive and GHG-emitting sectors within our portfolios, which are key to the transition to a net-zero carbon economy.\n\nIn terms of climate-related risk, Bancolombia has identified physical and transition risks in some critical sectors in its loan portfolio and investments that can generate potential losses for the Bank. For more information on these risks, please refer to Item 3.D. Risk Factors - 'The Bank is exposed to ESG risks that could affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations'. On February 2021, Bancolombia launched its Climate Change Policy to guide our clients in the transition to a low carbon economy. This policy includes the following sectors: coal extraction, coal power generation, oil extraction, livestock,  cement  manufacturing,  iron  and  steel  manufacturing,  air  transport,  maritime  transport,  and  vehicle manufacturing.\n\nBancolombia also defined a goal of financing the transition to a low carbon economy for an amount of COP 40 trillion by 2030.\n\nWe are working to engage clients and ensure an adequate transformation of their practices towards a low-carbon economy. In terms of physical risk, Bancolombia has developed assessments of the quantification of physical risks related to both our clients and our own operation. It considers the effect of physical risks on real estate guarantees, effects on loans guaranteed by trust vehicles and impacts on clients or industries affected by extreme climate events.\n\nFrom credit risk management, Bancolombia is developing physical risk assessment models and methodologies to assess climate impacts in our credit portfolios. Grupo Bancolombia has analyzed the volatility of the main risk factors of its investment portfolio, such as exchange and interest rates due to extreme weather events.\n\nDisclosure of climate change risks is extremely important in our effort to be transparent with our stakeholders. For this reason, Bancolombia adopted the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) commitments in 2019 to meet  the  call  for  financial  institutions  to  build  a  more  resilient  financial  system  through  the  implementation  and dissemination of climate change management issues. We also disclose our climate performance through CDP (Climate Disclosure Program) platform.\n\nReputational risk may result from changes in customers' perception or increasing attention and scrutiny from investors and regulators on the Bank's contribution to the transition to a low carbon economy.  The Bank has established a corporate policy  for  its  loan  portfolio  related  to  sectors  with  high  impact  on  climate,  such  as  coal  extraction  and  coal  power generation.  The  policy  includes  qualitative  risk  identification  and  risk  mitigation  measures.  Some  of  the  mitigation measures include:\n\n- \u00b7 Permanent social networks and mass media monitoring to identify alerts that may damage the trust of any of the Bank's stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 A narrative which focuses on the Bank's purpose and its ESG strategy, used to guide commercial teams in its relationship with different stakeholders and the advice they provide to affected clients through the transition process for the next 10 years.",

We have defined targets related to climate change for scope 1 and 2, i.e for our direct operations. We are committed to reducing our emissions by 73 %  by 2024 compared to our 2019 emissions. This target was established in accordance with SBTi - Science Base Target Initiative- methodologies.\n\n## Social Dimension\n\nWe seek to promote financial inclusion, gender equality and, in general, projects that contribute to reducing social gaps in the countries in which we operate and improve the quality of life of the communities.\n\nWe  seek  to  establish  conditions  that  maximize  the  potential  and  well-being  of  all  employees.  We  have  established environmental policies, which include human rights, diversity, equity and inclusion and training for all employees on discrimination and harassment in the workplace.\n\nKey material factors in the social dimension related to our employees include:\n\n- \u00b7 Bancolombia  set  a  strategic  objective  of  developing  our  culture  and  talent  to  be  competitive.  We  work continuously to contribute to the quality of life of our employees, by establishing safe workspaces, promoting healthy behaviors and wellness programs, and promoting individual, family and community development.\n- \u00b7 We  leverage  our  zero  tolerance  policies  with  respect  to  any  form  of  discrimination  and  work  and  sexual harassment with related support material. We incorporate guidelines and protocols of action, training, and support services provided by highly qualified personnel to prevent this type of behavior within the organization.\n- \u00b7 We have analyzed the demographics of our employees at the corporate level with respect to matters such as gender, age, position level, nationality, minority status, nature of the position, gender pay and others. The data used for these analyses were provided voluntarily by employees.\n- \u00b7 We also have an equity, diversity and inclusion strategy to empower women within the organization, so that they identify and express what they want to be on a personal and professional level. As part of this strategy, we have set targets for 2030 for the number of women represented in each position.\n- \u00b7 Talent attraction and employee turnover rate: We have processes designed to provide us with talent with the skills, abilities and attitudes that we require at our organization. One of our goals is to ensure professional development of  our  employees  through  an  equitable  vacancy  procedure.  73%  of  vacancies  are  filled  by  internal  selection processes. Our recruitment indicator average at corporate level shows that there is a natural process of talent renewal and allows us to attract new employees with innovative knowledge and new proposals. Company's total and voluntary turnover rates for the  last  year  as  a percentage  of  total  number of  employees  is  10%  and  5% respectively.\n- \u00b7 Since 2013, by declaring our Human Rights Policy, we made public our commitment to \"respect, promote and remediate human rights\" in compliance with the universal declaration, included in the International Humanitarian Law, the ILO and the law of the countries where we have a presence.

Volume and rate variances have been calculated based on movements in average balances over the period and changes in nominal interest rates on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities. Net changes attributable to changes in both volume and interest rate have been allocated to the change due to changes in volume.\n\n|                                                               |

OPERATING RESULTS\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included in this Annual Report.\n\nThe following  discussion  includes  information  regarding  future  financial  performance  and  plans,  targets,  aspirations, expectations, and objectives of management, which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is possible that the Bank's actual results may  differ  materially  from  the  results  discussed  in  the  forward-looking  statements  because  of  several  risks  and uncertainties. In addition, please refer to the discussion in Item 3. 'Key Information - D. Risk Factors' for a description of risks and uncertainties affecting the Bank's business and financial results and to Item 4 B. 'Business Overview, B.9 Cybersecurity Framework', for a description of the Bank's cybersecurity framework.\n\n## IMPACT OF ECONOMIC AND MONETARY POLICIES ON BANCOLOMBIA'S RESULTS\n\nBancolombia's operating results are affected by macroeconomic factors, mainly in Colombia but also in the other countries where the Bank operates. The most important variables include GDP growth, interest rates, inflation, and exchange rates, mostly the USD/COP exchange rate. The following discussion summarizes the trends of these measures in Colombia in 2021.\n\n## Economic activity\n\nColombia's real GDP growth was 10.6% in 2021, achieving a very important recovery after the 7% contraction in 2020. This recovery was the result of a reduction in the number of cases of COVID-19 and greater normality in the operation of productive activities and mobility of households, and despite the impact of the social unrest and protests in the second quarter 2021.\n\nKey GDP components in 2021 compared with 2020 were as follows: investment grew 9.9%, consumption 14.1%, imports 27.5%, and exports 14.2%. In 2020, gross capital formation represented 19% of GDP, total consumption represented 88%, exports 13%, and imports 20%.\n\nThe sectors that showed more dynamic growth in 2021 were the artistic, entertainment and recreation activities and other service  activities  (33%),  retail  and  wholesale,  transportation,  accommodation,  and  food  services  (21.2%),  and  the manufacturing industry (16.4%).\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Colombian Central Bank's benchmark interest rate stood at 3%, after a 125-bp increase over the year. The year closed amidst a process of increases in the monetary policy interest rate.\n\nSince the main goal of the Central Bank is to take inflation back to levels close to its long-term target (3%), it is reasonable to think that interest rate hikes will continue at a fast pace in the short term.\n\n## Inflation\n\n2021 year-end inflation stood at 5.62%, noticeably higher than the 1.61% recorded in 2020. The components leading inflation in 2021 were food and nonalcoholic beverages (17.23% increase), non-durable goods (12.01% increase), and",

On the contrary, semi-durable goods (1.08% decrease) and services (2.48% increase) were the components where prices grew the least.\n\nInflation closing 2021 above the upper limit of the Central Bank's tolerance range (4%) and with an upward trend, is one of the key factors leading to the expectation of continued hikes that in the monetary policy interest rate.\n\nIn the short term, inflation behavior which would be predictably biased upwards given the stress situation that international supply chains are experiencing, among other factors, will be challenging for private consumption and the purchasing power of households.\n\n## Exchange rate\n\nThe Colombian peso depreciated 15.98% against the USD during 2021, with the USD/COP closing at COP 3,981.16, compared to a depreciation of 4.74% in 2020, when the USD/COP closed at COP 3,432.5. As a result, the COP finished 2021 in a weakened position that could indicate that financial markets are anticipating significant electoral uncertainty ahead of the legislative and presidential elections that Colombia will face in 2022.\n\n## Outlook\n\nProspects for the Colombian financial sector in general, and for Bancolombia in particular, are expected to depend on the factors listed below:\n\n| Favorable factors for the Colombian economy - medium-term                                                                                     | Unfavorable factors for the Colombian economy - medium term                                                                                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| High  resilience  to  the  pandemic,  with  strong  policy  framework  and  comprehensive policy response to Covid-19.                        | Political uncertainty due to upcoming presidential elections.                                                                                           |\n| Robust household consumption.                                                                                                                 | Still high uncertainty about the future dynamics of the pandemic.                                                                                       |\n| Resilient financial system will enter a new upswing.                                                                                          | Ongoing global supply chains disruptions.                                                                                                               |\n| High commodity prices will support growth of investment and exports.                                                                          | Inflationary pressures                                                                                                                                  |\n| Public debt already achieved downward path in 2021.                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Fiscal rule was strengthened with a new debt anchor and independent  oversight.                                                               | Slow implementation of infrastructure agenda and peace agreement.                                                                                       |\n| Implementation of Basel III have further strengthened capital adequacy  of credit institutions.                                               | Further  raising  in  fiscal  revenues  are  needed  to  safeguard  key  social  protection programs and public investment while debt level is reduced. |\n| Robust  supervisory  and  regulatory  frameworks  to  safeguard  financial  stability.                                                        | Structural reforms are needed to aid job creation and bring employment  closer to pre-pandemic levels.                                                  |\n| The temporary protection status program for Venezuelan migrants should  strengthen their integration and raise Colombia's economic potential. |                                                                                                                                                         |\n\n## GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGES IN RESULTS FOR 2021 VERSUS 2020\n\nThe following discussion does not address the changes in results for 2020 versus 2019; the discussion of these changes may be found in the Bank's Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2020\n\n## Summary\n\nAfter facing one of the most challenging years in its recent history due to COVID-19, during 2021 Bancolombia recovered at  a  better  pace  than  expected,  due  in  large  part  to  the  economic  recovery  that occurred  in  all  the  geographies  where Bancolombia has a presence,  encouraging  the  appetite  for  credit  consumption  in  the  main  segments  where  the  Bank operates.  Even though the pandemic impacted the Bank's operations, customers, suppliers, and employees, Bancolombia maintained its strong competitive position and full-service financial model.

        "page_content": "equity  holders  of  the  parent  company  totaled  COP  4,087  billion  (COP  4,309  per  share,  including  both  common  and preferred shares, and USD 4.33 per ADR), which represents an increase of 1,380.76% as compared to COP 276 billion of net income attributable to equity holders of the parent company for the fiscal year 2020.\n\nBancolombia's average return on stockholders' equity for 2021 was 14.03%, up from 1.02% in 2020.\n\nThe net interest and valuation income margin increased in 2021 and stood at 5.09% for the year, up from 4.91% in 2020.\n\nCredit impairment charges, totaled COP 2,421 billion for 2021, down 67.84% from COP 7,527 billion in 2020. The lower provision charges during 2021 was driven by a downward trend in credit deterioration indicators and lower levels of provisions charges compared to what was budgeted, as a result of the economic recovery, improved projections in the macroeconomic scenarios and improvements in the expected loss model.\n\nLoans and advances to customers and financial institutions experienced net growth of 15.11% during the year. This growth was driven primarily by good and stable performance of retail and mortgage loans during the year, a better performance of commercial loans in the second half of 2021, and COP depreciation against USD. The total loan book denominated in COP grew 10.56% and USD-denominated loans grew 7.46% for the year.\n\nAllowance for loans and lease losses represented 6.73% of total loans and 166.29% of 30-day past-due loans (excluding accrued interest) at the end of 2021 compared with 8.13% of total loans and 164.95% of 30-day past-due loans (excluding accrued interest) on December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Bank expects that these allowances will provide adequate coverage for expected credit losses. Capital adequacy was 15.49% (Tier 1 ratio of 11.92%), higher than the 14.74% (Tier 1 ratio of 11.24%) reported at the end of 2020, principally due to the good results of the net income during the year.\n\nDeposits by customers increased 16.35% during 2021, while the ratio of net loans to deposits was 97.2% at the end of the year, up from 96.7% on December 31, 2020.\n\n## Net interest margin and valuation income on financial instruments before impairment on loans and financial leases and off-balance sheet credit instruments\n\nFor 2021, net interest income and valuation was COP 11,784 billion, up 8.85% from COP 10,826 billion in 2020.   The 3.31% decrease in interest income was offset by the 25.78% decrease in interest expenses due to the effort to reduce funding costs by increases in saving and checking accounts balances.\n\nThe weighted average nominal interest rate on loans and financial leases ended at 7.5% in 2021 down from 8.3% in 2020. At the same time, interest income, which is the sum of interest on loans, financial leases, overnight funds and interest and valuation income from investment securities, totaled COP 16,136 billion in 2021, down 3.31% as compared to COP 16,689 billion in 2020 because of lower interest income on loans and financial leases.\n\nInterest on investment securities, which includes, among other items, the interest paid or accrued on debt instruments and mark-to-market valuation adjustments, totaled COP 471 billion in 2021, 119.01% higher than 2020.  Amid a challenging year because of the beginning of the rate hike cycle by the Central Bank and inflationary pressures, this increase was due to  the  positive  performance  of  the  derivative  portfolio,  due  to  the  increased  demand  for  hedging  instruments  by  the costumers of the different segments.\n\nNet interest and valuation income margin from continuing operations increased 18 basis points from 4.91% to 5.09% during the year.  This increase is due to the decrease in funding costs due to increases in saving and checking accounts.  In September 2021, the Central Bank of Colombia started a rate hike cycle, with a first hike of 25 basis points followed by two 50 basis points hikes in November and December. Interest rate hikes benefit margins because of the asset-sensitive nature of the Bank's balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "The strategy implemented by Bancolombia in recent years has consisted of increasing the proportion of consumer loans in the portfolio, but during 2021 the Bank maintained relatively stable market share in the segments where it operates. During the year, the Bank focused on supporting the recovery of its customers, reducing funding costs, enhancing its digital offers, and maintaining a strong capital and liquidity position.\n\nBancolombia was active in the deposits markets to secure necessary funding. Interest expenses totaled COP 4,352 billion in 2021, down 25.78% as compared to COP 5,863 billion in 2020. The decrease in interest expense is primary due to the increase in deposits in saving and checking accounts and the decrease of the balance in time deposits and borrowings from other financial institutions.  At the end of 2021, the Bank gradually increased its balance in time deposits to support this growth, as economic activity and the loan book showed better trends.  Overall, the average interest rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was 1.9 % in 2021, lower than the 2.7% of 2020.",

        "page_content": "Other administrative and general expenses totaled COP 3,522 billion in 2021, up 12.13% as compared to 2020, reflecting the investments the Bank made in digital transformation mainly related to technology costs, given the fast development in 2021.\n\nImpairments, depreciation, and amortization totaled COP 921 billion in 2021, up 9.88% as compared to 2020.  This increase is primarily due to accelerated growth in the operating leases and renting business and consequently higher asset depreciation.\n\nAs a result of the changes in expenses and revenues, the cost to income ratio of Bancolombia for 2021 was 52.16%, an increase when compared to 50.51% in 2020.\n\n## Provision Charges and Credit Quality\n\nFor the  year  2021,  total  credit  impairment  charges,  net  totaled  COP  2,421  billion  (or  1.2%  of  average  loans),  which represents a decrease of 67.84% as compared to COP 7,527 billion (or 3.9% of average loans) in 2020. The significant decrease in provision charges was driven by a better macroeconomic forecast due to the faster pace of the economic recovery, less provisions related to significant impaired clients' and improvements in the expected loss models.\n\nNet loan charge-offs totaled COP 5,036 billion in 2021 up 93.68% from the 2,600 billion in 2020. The increase of chargeoffs was driven by the retail segment.   Net Charge-offs have two important features first, they reduce the balance of the loan portfolio, and second they help reduce the amount of past due loans.\n\nPast-due loans amounted to COP 10,020 billion as of December 31, 2021, down 4.27% as compared to COP 10,467 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe past-due loan ratio (loans overdue more than 30 days divided by total loans) was 4.55% as of December 31, 2021, down from 5.47% as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in this ratio is mainly due to the better-than-expected rate of economic recovery and positive customer performance after the relief and support program ended.\n\n## Income Tax Expenses\n\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year 2021 totaled COP 1,776 billion, compared with an income tax recovery of COP 6.5 billion in 2020. The effective tax rate for 2021 was 29.68%.\n\nIncome tax expense in 2021 was impacted mainly by the operation in Colombia.   Available tax benefits led to a lower tax burden compared with the statutory tax rate. For Colombia, those benefits related to investments in real productive fixed assets, exempt income from low-income mortgage portfolio and untaxed dividends. For the remaining operations, tax benefits were associated with the exempt income from returns on securities issued by the Governments of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Panama.\n\nFor further details please see Note 12 of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## RESULTS BY SEGMENT\n\nThe Bank manages its business through 9 main operating segments: Bankng Colombia, Banking El Salvador, Banking Panama, Banking Guatemala, Trust, Investment Banking, Brokerage, International Banking and All Other.\n\nThe segmental information in this Annual Report reflects the reporting structure in place at the reporting date in accordance with the segmental information in Note 3.

Analysis of 2021 versus 2020\n\nIn 2021, profit before taxes for Banking Colombia increased by 1042.66% to COP 3,712 billion from a loss of COP 394 billion in 2020 due to the reasons described below.\n\nTotal interest and valuation decreased by 3.74% to COP 11,498 billion despite the growth in the loan portfolio of 11.74%, mainly due to the lower yields obtained in commercial and consumer loans given our assets sensitive condition framed by central bank's reference rate cuts that took place in 2020 and impacted 2021 margins. This decrease was mainly reflected in the interest income decline from commercial loans by 13.20%, and leasing by 21.90%. Additionally, interest expenses decreased by 31.88% due to changes in the funding mix in which saving accounts and checking accounts gained share reducing the funding cost.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net decreased by 63.69% to COP 2,122 billion. This variation is mainly due to a better performance of the loan portfolio, the end of the credit relief program (PAD) and the better macroeconomic variables estimated in the risk models.\n\nTotal fees and commission net, increased by 17.12% to COP 2,316 billion, mainly due to the better performance of credit and debit cards which increased by 17.16%, banking services by 25.99%, and payments-collections by 21.52% (digitals channels) as a result of higher transaction flows associated with the economic recovery. Such increases were partially offset by decreases in branch network services of 64.15%, 95.32% for ATM fees, and 7.17% for bancassurance.",

caused by the uncertainty related to COVID-19, the supply chain crisis and political risk.\n\nDividends and net profits from capital investments increased by 114.39% to COP 94 billion from COP 43.7 billion in 2020, due to an improvement in the financial results of subsidiaries in accordance with the gradual economic recovery worldwide.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 13.15% to COP 6,080 billion, largely due to an increase in bonuses which increased from COP 25 billion in 2020 to COP 440 billion in 2021 as an effect of the reactivation of the variable compensation that was suspended in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFinally, the assets attributable to Banking Colombia grew by 19.49% during the year, mainly driven by loan book growth.\n\n## Banking El Salvador through Banco

interest and valuation expressed in COP decreased by 2.64% to COP 1,194 billion, mainly due to lower late loan originations during the year that were not reflected in accrued interest income. However, this decrease was partially offset by a significant reduction in interest expenses of 18.13% during the year.",

Commercial,  consumer  and  mortgage portfolios experienced double digit performance mainly due to the  devaluation of the Colombian peso. In USD, net interest income declined by 4.0% despite the good performance of the loan portfolio denominated in USD growing 6.58% in commercial, 4.04% in consumer, and 2.10% in mortgages.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net decreased by 101.16% to COP (4) billion from COP 367 billion in 2020, primarily due to provisions reversal as a result of better asset quality and changes in the risk models related to macro-variables.\n\nTotal fees and commissions, net increased by 13.13% to COP 243 billion despite fees and commission expenses growing by 55.70% due to higher expenses related to network access and brand usage fees charged by card associations given the higher transactional flows experienced in the last months of the year.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 27.77% to COP 631 billion, primarily caused by the reactivation in the employee bonus plan that was suspended in 2020.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking El Salvador grew by 16.64% during the year, mainly driven by growth in loans and by the depreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD dollars.\n\n## Banking Panama:\n\n|

        "page_content": "Total interest and valuation slightly decreased in COP terms by 1.16%, however when measured in USD  interest and valuation decreased by 3.1% mainly due to a reduction of 0.4% in the commercial loan portfolio during 2021 due to corporate clients' prepayments and the increase in charge-offs during the last quarter. Nevertheless, the overall loan book grew by 1.8% in USD, reflecting better performance in consumer that increased by 2.8% and mortgages by 4.4%.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net decreased by 64.40% to COP 323 billion compared to COP 908 billion in 2020. This improvement is mostly due to lower provision charges and provisions reversal as a result of better asset quality and changes in the risk models related to macro-variables.\n\nTotal fees and commission, net increased by 3.60% to COP 200 billion, mainly driven by higher income generated by merchant acquiring services and ATM fees which increased by 18.16% in the last year.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased in USD terms by 12.82% due to the reactivation of the employee bonus plan which was suspended during 2020 because of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Panama increased by 15.68% during the year, mainly driven by the depreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD dollars.\n\n## Banking Guatemala :\n\n|

        "page_content": "Total interest and valuation increased in COP terms by 6.99%, to COP 1,179 billion, and increased by 5.4% when measured in USD, due to a better performance of the loan book mainly driven by consumer portfolio. The credit portfolio expressed in USD grew by 8.20%, with loans increasing by 4.86% in commercial, 22.88% in consumer and 12.98% in mortgages.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net decreased by 112.05% to COP (36) billion from COP 297 billion in 2020, due to lower provision charges in line with the performance of the loan portfolio and a provision reversal as a result of better asset quality and macroeconomic improvement in the risk models.\n\nTotal fees and commission, net decreased by 19.53% to COP 110 billion mainly due to lower income from credit and debit card fees decreasing to COP 15 billion from COP 86 billion in 2020. This decrease was partially offset by a significant increase in electronic services and ATM fees to COP 47 billion in 2021.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 2.11% to COP 567 billion, mainly due to an increase in bonuses to COP 65 billion in 2021 from COP 38 billion in 2020 caused by the full reactivation of the bonus plan.\n\nAssets attributable to Banking Guatemala increased by 19.67% during the year, mainly due to the growth in the loan book and by the depreciation of the FX that impacted loans expressed in USD dollars.\n\n## Trust :\n\n|

This increase was primarily explained by an increase in bonuses to COP 22 billion in 2021 after it was suspended in 2020.\n\nAssets attributable to the Trust segment decreased by 7.08% during the year to COP 683 billion, due to a decrease in equity securities investments\n\n## Investment Banking :\n\n|

Analysis of 2021 versus 2020\n\nIn 2021, profit before taxes for the Investment Banking segment increased by 46.72% to COP 48 billion from COP 33 billion in 2020.\n\nTotal fees and commissions, net increased by 112.60% to COP 79 billion driven by higher fees in Structured Financing and M&A. This offset the impact of the decline in revenues from operations with other operating segments of the Bank by 82.56% to COP 4 billion, due to a lower yield on liquidity management.\n\nDividends received, and share of profits of equity method investees, reported a better result moving from COP (2) billion in 2020 to COP (0.2) in 2021, largely due to higher income generation from equity investments.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 47.06% to COP 35 billion, mainly due to an increase in bonuses to COP 12 billion in 2021 considering the reactivation of the bonus plan that was suspended in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

of 2021 versus 2020\n\nIn 2021, profit before taxes for the Brokerage segment decreased by 34.25% to COP 60 billion from COP 91 billion in 2020.\n\nTotal interest and valuation decreased by 73.90% to COP 12 billion, mainly due to losses on derivatives related to securities futures  and  indexes  futures.  This  was  partially  offset  by  higher  profits  in  dividends  and  net  income  from  equity investments.\n\nTotal fees and commission, net increased by 3.78% to COP 113 billion, mainly due to an increase of COP 9 billion in trust income because of higher managed volumes in investment funds. Total operating income net remained relatively stable slightly decreasing by 0.50% compared to 2020.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 33.55% to COP 121 billion, mainly due to an increase in bonuses of COP 27 billion in 2021 as a result of the bonus plan reactivation suspended in 2020.\n\nAssets  attributable  to  the  Brokerage  segment  increased  by  17.47%  during  the  year,  mainly  due  to  an  increase  in  the investment portfolio in the subsidiary Bancolombia Capital Holding.",

2021, profit before taxes for the International banking segment increased to COP 125 billion from COP 87 billion in 2020. The increase was mostly due to interest expenses reduction of COP 102 billion in 2021 which offset the lower income from loans and operations with derivatives.\n\nTotal credit impairment charges, net decreased by 126.72% to COP (15) billion from COP 56 billion in 2020, mainly due to lower provision charges and provisions reversal as a result of better asset quality and macroeconomic improvement.\n\nTotal fees and commissions, net increased by 10.11%, to COP 27 billion, mainly due to higher fees from banking services, acceptances, guarantees and standby letters of credits.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 4.09% to COP 63 billion, due to the reactivation of the employee bonus plan which was suspended during 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAssets attributable to the International banking segment increased by 17.42%, to COP 24,075 billion.",

This improvement is explained by the growth in operating leases and the higher valuations of real state which were affected in 2020 by the pandemic.\n\nDividends and net income on equity investments increased from COP 54 billion to COP 197 billion in 2021 because of higher valuations and cash flows from the Viva Malls real estate portfolio.\n\nAssets attributable to All Other decreased by 31.62% to COP 7,117 billion.\n\n## B.

During 2021, the Bank maintained a solid liquidity position, with high liquidity levels during the first half of the year.\n\nThe following table shows the composition of the liquid assets in the last two years:\n\n| Liquid Assets  (1)             |            | December 31, 2021    December 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|\n| High quality Liquid Assets *   |            |                                          |\n| Cash                           | 22,641,516 | 18,356,375                               |\n| High quality liquid securities | 18,258,002 | 16,729,107                               |\n| Other Liquid Assets            |            |                                          |\n| Other securities **            | 3,299,371  | 2,672,337                                |\n| Total Liquid Assets            | 44,198,889 | 37,757,819                               |\n\n* High-quality liquid assets: cash and shares that are eligible to be reportable or repo operations, in addition to those liquid assets that the Central Bank receives for its monetary expansion and contraction operations described in paragraph 3.1.1 of the Foreign Regulatory Circular DODM-142 of the central bank.\n\n** Other Securities: Securities issued by financial and corporate entities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, liquid assets showed a significant growth of COP 6,441 billion, mainly due to the increase in cash and high-quality liquid securities. This change is a consequence of higher demand deposits, resulting in higher reserve requirements (cash) and excess liquidity, which has been managed through the treasury portfolio with purchases of highquality liquid securities.\n\nThe Bank measures liquid assets on a daily basis and compares this result to an objective target set by the Risk Committee. Under this rule, daily liquid assets must be equal to or higher than such target. In the event the limit is not reached, there is a five-day period to increase liquidity levels.\n\nCash is important to guarantee branch and ATM operations. The Bank's expansion across the Colombian territory requires considerable levels of cash; however, cash levels are daily monitored in order to minimize opportunity costs. Additionally, cash is considered in the mandatory bank reserve established by the Central Bank.\n\nSecurities that comprise liquid assets are reviewed by the ALCO considering the Bank's liquidity objective. Even though available for sale and held to maturity debt securities cannot be sold, they can be pledged as collateral in repurchase agreements. Some of them are mandatory investments that can be posted to the Central Bank as collateral.\n\nSFC requires financial entities to have liquid assets greater than the contractual liquidity cumulative one-month gap. This contractual gap reflects the maturity of the current positions of assets and liabilities and does not reflect projections of future operations. The maturity of the loan portfolio for this purpose is affected by the historical default indicator and the maturity of deposits is modeled according to the regulation.\n\nThe Bank's management believes that the current level of liquidity is adequate and will seek to maintain its solid deposit base and the access to alternative sources of funding such as borrowings from domestic and international development and commercial banks, repurchase agreements, bond issuances, overnight funds and Central Bank funds, considering market conditions, interest rates and the desired maturity profile of liabilities.",

Liabilities denominated in Colombian Pesos increased by 11.49%, and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars increased by 14.11%. This change is principally the result of the increase in both COP and USD denominated checking and  saving  accounts,  offset  by  a  decline  in  borrowings  from  other  institutions  and  COP  denominated  time  deposits. However, although USD denominated liabilities increased by 14.11%, this increase was due to the  depreciation of the USD/COP exchange rate (15.98% in 2021), as USD denominated liabilities decreased by USD 421 million.\n\n|                     | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,        |\n|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n|                     | 2021                 | 2020                      |\n|                     | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP        |\n| Total funding       |                      |                           |\n| Peso-denominated    |                      | 153,871,797   138,014,643 |\n| Dollar-denominated. |                      | 102,057,793    89,438,649 |\n| Total Liabilities   |                      | 255,929,590   227,453,292 |\n\nIn 2021, the Bank experienced a growth in deposits which reached COP 210,390 billion at year-end, an increase of COP 29,570 billion, or 16.35% compared to the level at December 31, 2020. COP denominated deposits increased by 15.33%, explained  mainly  by  the  rise  in  COP  denominated  saving  and  checking  accounts,  while  USD  denominated  deposits increased by 18.16% as a result of the rise in USD denominated saving accounts. The ratio of deposits to total assets was 72.58%, increasing by 183 basis points compared to 2020.\n\n|                | As of December 31,        | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                | 2021                      | 2020                 |                      |\n|                | In millions of COP        | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Total Deposits | 210,390,848   180,820,793 |                      |                      |\n\nThe following table sets forth checking accounts, savings accounts and time deposits as a percentage of the Bank's total liabilities for the years 2021 and 2020:\n\n|                                 | 2021    2020   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| Checking accounts               | 15.9 %  14.0 % |\n| Time deposits                   | 23.2 %  26.8 % |\n| Saving accounts                 | 41.5 %  37.9 % |\n| Other deposits                  | 1.6 %   0.7 %  |\n| Percentage of Total Liabilities | 82.2 %  79.4 % |\n\nThe Bank's principal sources of funding are deposits, which are mainly composed of checking accounts, time deposits and savings accounts.\n\nDeposits as a percentage of the Bank's total liabilities in 2021 were 82.2%, increasing from 79.4% of total liabilities at year-end 2020.\n\nThe ratio of net loans to deposits (including borrowings from commercial banks) was 93.38% at the end of 2021, increasing from 91.03% as compared to 2020. This change is primarily explained by the increase in net loans and advances to customers, that rose from COP 174,793 billion in 2020 to COP 204,459 billion in 2021, which was higher compared with the growth in deposits (the increase was COP 26,919 billion reaching an amount of COP 218,942 billion in 2021). It is important to highlight that during 2021 economic activity started to recover as government restrictions were gradually 'relaxed' and vaccination program against COVID - 19 were executed, resulting in a better performance of the loan portfolio.",

Nevertheless, in order to maintain a lower cost of funds, the growth of loans was financed mainly by deposits, as a result of which borrowings decreased by COP 2,650 billion in 2021. Additionally, Bancolombia's borrowings from financial institutions are linked to different market rates/indexes like the IBR, (a short-term benchmark interest rate of Colombian money market liquidity that reflects the price at which banks are willing to lend or borrow funds from financial market), DTF, IPC, LIBOR and SOFR.\n\nIn 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement has resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR which is used as interest rate benchmark. On December 31, 2021, Bancolombia had USD 1,278 million of liabilities linked to LIBOR, which represents 1.99% of total liabilities as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Debt instruments in issue\n\nIn  2021,  Bancolombia  issued  COP  600  billion  aggregate  principal  of  senior  notes,  while  Bancolombia  Panam\u00e1  and Banistmo issued notes in amounts of USD 91 million and USD 47 million, respectively. The carrying amount of debt securities in issue increased by COP 1,967 billion.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the total outstanding aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Bank was COP 21,093 billion.\n\nThe following table shows the Bank's debt securities in issue maturity profile:\n\n|                           | 2022            | 2023            | 2024            | 2025            | 2026            | 2027 and    thereafter   | Total                                                                      |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                           | InmillionsofCOP | InmillionsofCOP | InmillionsofCOP | InmillionsofCOP | InmillionsofCOP | InmillionsofCOP          | InmillionsofCOP                                                            |\n| Debt instruments in issue |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |                          | 5,697,371  1,255,858  2,135,099  3,940,558  663,600  7,401,378  21,093,864 |",

        "page_content": "Stockholders' equity attributable to the owners of the parent company amounted to COP 32,234 billion on December 31, 2021, up 21.43% from COP 26,545 billion on December 31, 2020. This increase is mainly explained by the generation of profits during 2021 and the depreciation of the COP versus the USD.\n\nThe Bank's capital adequacy ratio on a consolidated basis was 15.49% as of December 31, 2021, up from 14.74% in 2020. This increase reveals the sustained positive results of the Bank after the adoption of Basel III.\n\nThe Bank's capital adequacy ratio exceeded the requirements of the Colombian government and the SFC by 649 basis points above the minimum 9% required by the Colombian regulator. The basic capital ratio (Tier 1) was 11.92% and the tangible capital ratio, which is equal to the ratio of the difference between equity and goodwill and intangible assets to tangible assets, was 8.2% at the end of 2021.

        "page_content": "## B.2       FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TREASURY ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Bank's treasury division is responsible for the sales and trading activities in Bancolombia, Banistmo, Banco Agr\u00edcola, Bancolombia Panam\u00e1, Bancolombia Puerto Rico, and BAM. It is accountable for the execution of all transactions in domestic and foreign currencies legally authorized in Colombia and in all the countries where the Bank has presence. These include derivatives transactions, fixed income and indexed securities trading, repurchase or resale transactions, short sales, temporary securities transfers, as well as FX trading.\n\nThe Bank monitors treasury division activities through policies regarding the management of liquidity, market, legal, credit and operational risks. Such policies are monitored by the Vice-President of Risk Management. With the aim to control market and liquidity risks,  the  Bank  sets  limits  intended  to  keep  its  exposure  levels  and  losses  within  certain  ranges determined by the Bank's Board of Directors. The Bank's investment policies do not include restrictions regarding the maturity of the securities held in the portfolio, except for those related to the liquidity portfolio and over the counter ('OTC') derivatives transactions held by Bancolombia and Banistmo.\n\nBefore taking any additional position, the Bank's treasury division also verifies, with respect to investments in domestic and  in  foreign  currencies,  the  availability  of  funds  for  investment  and  each  investment's  suitability  with  the  Bank's liquidity structure.\n\nAs mentioned in Item 11. 'Quantitative and  Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk', the market risk stated in the treasury  book  is  measured  with  value  at  risk  (VaR)  metrics,  and  the  position  limits  are  based  on  the  results  of  these methodologies. The Bank has defined VaR limits that follow a hierarchical structure, which avoids the concentration of market risk in certain groups of assets and also takes advantage of portfolio diversification. In addition to VaR limits, the Bank uses stop loss signals, except for GFA, to inform senior management when accumulated losses are close to certain pre-defined thresholds in the trading book. Moreover, for the options portfolio in Bancolombia, the Bank has set limits based on the sensitivity of the portfolio to the underlying volatility, underlying currency and interest rates.\n\nAs  part  of  its  operations,  the  Bank  holds  cash  and  cash  equivalents  primarily  in  Colombian  pesos,  U.S.  dollars  and Guatemalan quetzals. These positions, as well as any other currency position, are determined by the treasury division in connection with the Bank's currency risk assessment and  management. Specifically, the Bank's exposure to FX risk primarily arises from changes in the USD/COP exchange rate. The exposure to currency risk is managed by the Bank's Treasury Division. The Bank estimates VaR metrics to limit the exposure to foreign currency risk of its balance sheet in Bancolombia, Valores Bancolombia, and Banistmo and BAM. These limits are supervised daily by the Bank's Market Risk Management Office. The Bank's Treasury Division manages a derivative portfolio in Bancolombia and Banistmo, which includes forward in FX with the purpose, among others, of hedging its overall currency exposure.\n\nThe Colombian Chief Treasury Officer ('CTO'), centralizes all the reports from the Treasury Directors in the subsidiaries in all geographies, in which they are responsible for FX, investment and risk taking.\n\nThere  are  several  communications  channels  between  the  Treasury  divisions  and  the  CTO,  which  are:  Investment Committee; the participants in this meeting, which is held monthly, are: CTO, Proprietary Trading Director, Market Risk Director, Treasury Directors from each Bank, and the Head of each desk in Colombia (Fixed Income, FX and Derivatives). This committee reviews the investment strategy portfolios, profit and loss figures, VaR levels, Benchmark portfolios, based on the framework and risk appetite, defined by the Board of Directors.\n\nPerformance is measured against the 'Benchmark' approved for each treasury, which includes a target position for each asset and limits for every product and market, in which the treasury operation can invest. There is a continuous follow up of the portfolios in the investment committee, which runs monthly.",

History and Development of the Company - Capital Acquisitions and Divestitures'.\n\n## C.       RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES, ETC.\n\nNot Applicable\n\n## D.       TREND INFORMATION\n\nDriven by an improved macroeconomic environment across all geographies where the Bank operates, net interest and valuation income in 2021 grew 183.82%. This result was primarily influenced by better credit quality metrics and a lower deterioration. Higher volumes on loans, growing margins, and very positive activity in fee generation, among others, also contributed to good performance during the year. The following is a brief discussion of recent trends in the company and the economy.\n\n## Loan Volume Performance\n\nGross loans and financial leases (i.e., before allowance for loans and financial lease losses) increased 15.11% in 2021. The different economies in which Bancolombia operates experienced a significant recovery from the COVID-19 crisis during 2021. Each loan category experienced good activity, with consumer and home lending showing the best performance and gaining share within the total portfolio as of December of 2021. Commercial loans grew 13.70%, consumer loans 17.78%, mortgages 18.06% and small business loans 4.05%.\n\nLoans in Bancolombia S.A. were up 11.7% year over year, clearly driven by activity during the second half of the year, due to the continued economic recovery in Colombia. Retail loans were an important driver for growth during the year with disbursements reaching pre-pandemic levels, while mortgage loans also had a higher increase on average across the portfolio with a stable performance in originations during the year. The Colombian economy has improved significantly from the COVID-19 crisis, supported by a solid monetary policy paving the way for the recovery of domestic demand.\n\nBanco Agr\u00edcola's loan book increased 4.82% in dollar terms during 2021. Commercial loans represented the highest growth while maintaining the largest share in the portfolio. In the  last  year,  growth has  indicated  important  signs  of recovery, as seen in consumption and exports fueled primarily by remittances.\n\nBanistmo showed mixed dynamics in loan book growth, with mortgages and retail expanding the most as a result of the economy recovery, whereas commercial contracted in line with the market. The loan book grew 1.81% in Banistmo over the year. Panama's challenges are still present to reignite growth and to reach a balanced recovery across the different sectors of the economy, after suffering one of the most severe COVID-19 outbreaks in the region.\n\nLoans in Guatemala expanded 8.20% in 2021. Lending activity accelerated especially in the consumer segment during the year increasing by 22.88% largely attributed to the development of pre-approved credit lines originations. Good results in the home lending portfolio were also a surprising development in 2021. Guatemala experienced a lower impact due to COVID-19 pandemic when compared to other countries in Latin America, supported by a high inflow of remittances.\n\nForeign-denominated  loans  increased  7.46%  during  2021.  The  portfolio  in  El  Salvador,  the  offshore  operation  of Bancolombia Panama and Puerto Rico and the USD denominated loans in Colombia explain the higher volume in the consolidated dollar denominated portfolio.\n\n## Net Interest Margin and Valuation\n\nMost of the Bank's loan book has a variable rate and the re-pricing pace of our assets tends to be faster than that of the Bank's liabilities.",

        "page_content": "The annualized net interest and valuation income margin was 5.09% for 2021, increasing when compared to the ratio of 4.91% reported in 2020. This higher level is starting to demonstrate an upward trend supported by the beginning of the rates hike cycle by the central bank in Colombia, as well as more dynamic lending activity. The higher proportional growth of  interest  income  compared  to  interest  expenses  contributed  to  a  better  net  margin,  with  good  results  in  the  cost  of liabilities.\n\nCost of funding continued on a positive trend in the last year as deposits increased their share in the total mix. Checking and saving accounts increased during 2021, whereas the balance on time deposits decreased. This performance contributed to sustaining a low funding cost and a sound liquidity position. Customer deposits account for more than 85% of the bank's funding needs, offering a cost-competitive and stable source of funding.\n\nFor 2022 the Group's net interest margin is expected to expand, in view of a current contractionary macroeconomic policy taking place in the Colombian financial system.\n\n## Cost of credit\n\nFor the year 2021, the cost of credit was 1.18% of average loans, which represents a significant decline when compared to the 3.85% and 1.91% shown in 2020 and 2019, respectively. For 2021 and based on the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the main events that support the results in provisions are related to macroeconomic improvement, the provision models  fine  tuning,  the  evolution  to  better  ratings  for  the  high-risk  portfolio,  and  the  lower  reported  deterioration. Bancolombia maintains a strong balance sheet supported by an adequate level of loan loss reserves, reporting a coverage ratio to PDLs (overdue 30 days) of 166.3% as of December 2021.\n\n## E.

Such dividend distribution must be made to all stockholders, in cash or in issued stock of Bancolombia, as may be determined by the stockholders, and within a year from the date of the ordinary annual stockholders' meeting in which the dividend was declared. According to Colombian law, the minimum dividend per share may be waived by an affirmative vote of the holders of 78% of the voting shares present at the stockholders' meeting.\n\nThe annual net profits of Bancolombia must be applied as follows: (i) first, an amount equal to 10% of Bancolombia's net profits to a legal reserve until such reserve is equal to at least 50% of the Bank's paid-in capital; (ii) second, to the payment of  the  minimum  dividend  on  the  preferred  shares  (for  more  information,  see  Item  10.  \"Additional  Information  -  B.",

MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\n\nSet forth below is certain information concerning the Bank's capital stock and a brief summary of certain significant provisions of the Bank's bylaws and Colombian corporate law. This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the Bank's bylaws (an English translation of which is attached as Exhibit 1 to this Annual Report) and to Colombian corporate law.\n\n## Bancolombia's Corporate Purpose\n\nPursuant to Article 4 of its bylaws, Bancolombia's corporate purpose consists of all kinds of banking operations, business, acts and services. Subject to applicable law, Bancolombia may carry out all the activities and investments authorized to banks. Bancolombia is also authorized to participate in the capital stock of other companies, subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nAs of the date of filing of this Annual Report, Bancolombia's board of directors is composed of seven directors, elected for a two-year term, with no alternate directors. For additional information regarding Bancolombia's current directors please see Item 6.A, 'Directors and Senior Management'.\n\nAfter being designated, all of the members of the Board of Directors need an authorization from the Superintendency of Finance. The Superintendency of Finance assesses whether the director has an adequate profile for the position according to the requirements under Colombian Law.\n\nAccording to Decree 3923 of 2006, the election of independent directors must be in a separate ballot from the ballot to elect the rest of directors, unless the reaching of the minimum number of independent directors required by law or by the by-laws is assured, or when there is only one list that includes the minimum number of required independent directors.\n\nAccording to Law 964 of 2005, 25% of the members of the board of directors shall be independent. An 'independent director' is a director who is NOT: (i) an employee or director of the issuer or any of its parent or subsidiary companies, including  all  those  persons  acting  in  said  capacity  during  the  year  immediately  preceding  that  in  which  they  were appointed, except in the case of an independent member of the board of directors being re-elected; (ii) shareholders, who either  directly  or  by  virtue  of  an  agreement  direct,  guide  or  control  the  majority  of  the  entity's  voting  rights  or  who determine the majority composition of the administration, the board of directors or other corporate bodies of this same entity; (iii) a partner or employee of any association or firm that provides advisory or consultancy services to the issuer or to companies who belong to the same economic group to which the issuer in question belongs, in the event that income obtained from such services represent for said association or firm twenty percent (20%) or more of its total operating income; (iv) an employee or director of a foundation, association or institution that receives significant donations from the issuer.  The  term  'significant  donations'  is  quantified  as  being  twenty  percent  (20%)  or  more  of  the  total  amount  of donations received by the respective institution; (v) an administrator of any entity on whose board of directors a legal representative  of  the  issuer  participates;  and  (vi)  any  person  who  receives  from  the  issuer  any  kind  of  remuneration different from fees as a member of the board of directors, of the audit committee or any other committee set up by the board of directors.\n\nIn  January 2022, the Corporate Governance Code was modified by the Board of Directors in order to strengthen the independence of the board. As part of this, the following criteria were added to those required to qualify a director as nonindependent:",

Under that system: (i) each holder of common shares is entitled at the annual general shareholders' meeting to nominate for election one or more directors; (ii) each nomination of one or more directors constitutes a group for the purposes of the election; (iii) each group of nominees must be listed in the order of preference for nominees in that group to be elected; (iv) once all groups have been nominated, holders of common shares may cast one vote for each common share held in favor of a particular group of nominees. Votes may not be cast for particular nominees in a group; they may be cast only for the entire group; (v) the total number of votes casted in the election is divided by the number of directors to be elected. The resulting quotient is the quota of votes necessary to elect particular directors. For each time that the number of votes cast for a group of nominees is divisible by the quota of votes, one nominee from that group is elected, in the order of the list of that group; and (vi) when no group has enough remaining votes to satisfy the quota of votes necessary to elect a director, any remaining board seat or seats are filled by electing the highest remaining nominee from the group with the highest number of remaining votes cast until all available seats have been filled.\n\nThe directors of Bancolombia must abstain from participating, directly or through an intermediary, on their own behalf or on behalf of a third party, in activities that may compete against the Bank or in conflict-of-interest transactions that may generate a conflict of interest situation, unless the general shareholders meeting expressly authorizes such transactions.",

If the director is a shareholder, his or her vote shall be excluded from the respective decision  process.  In  any  case,  the  general  shareholders  meeting  could  only  grant  its  authorization  if  the  act  does  not adversely affect Bancolombia's interests. In the general annual shareholders meeting the shareholders are responsible for determining, the compensation of the members of the board of directors.\n\nPursuant to the by-laws of Bancolombia, the board of directors has the power to authorize the execution of any agreement, within the corporate purpose of Bancolombia, and to adopt the necessary measures in order for the Bank to accomplish its purpose, except for agreements that, by law, can only be authorized at the Shareholders 'Meeting. Furthermore, the board of directors must authorize certain transactions such as the issuance of Bank's bonds or common shares up to the total amount of authorized capital stock.\n\n## Description of Share Rights, Preferences and Restrictions\n\nBancolombia's bylaws provide for an authorized capital stock of COP 700 billion divided into 1,400,000,000 shares of a par value of COP 500 each, which must belong to one of the following classes: (i) common shares, (ii) privileged shares; and (iii) shares with preferred dividend and no voting rights ('preferred shares').

These general meetings may be ordinary meetings or extraordinary meetings.\n\nOrdinary general shareholder's meetings occur at least once a year but no later than three months after the end of the prior fiscal year, for the following purposes: (i) to consider the approval of Bancolombia's annual report, including the financial statements for the preceding fiscal year; (ii) to review the annual report prepared by the external auditor; (iii) to determine the compensation for the members of the board of directors, and the external auditor (the external auditor compensation is determined  every  two  years)  (iv)  to  elect  directors,  the  external  auditor  and  the  client  representative  ('defensor  del consumidor financiero'). The client representative's primary duty is to solve the individual complaints submitted by clients and users and serve as their spokesman, the directors and the external auditor (each for a two-year term); and (v) to determine the dividend policy and the allocation of profits, if any, of the preceding fiscal year, as  well as any retained earnings from previous fiscal years.\n\nExtraordinary general shareholders' meetings may take place when duly called for a specified purpose or purposes, or, without prior notice, when holders representing all outstanding shares entitled to vote on the issues presented are present at the meeting.\n\nQuorum for both ordinary  and  extraordinary  general  shareholders'  meetings  to  be  convened  at  first  call  requires  the presence of two or more shareholders representing at least half plus one of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the relevant meeting. If a quorum is not present, a subsequent meeting is called at which the presence of one or more holders of shares entitled to vote at the relevant meeting constitutes a quorum, regardless of the  number of shares represented. General shareholders' meetings may be called by the board of directors, the CEO or the external auditor of Bancolombia.\n\nIn addition, two or more shareholders representing at least 20% of the outstanding shares have the right to request that a general meeting be convened. Notice of ordinary meetings and extraordinary meetings convened to approve fiscal yearend financial statements, the reduction of the outstanding capital, the merger, spin-off or sale of more than 25% of the assets, liabilities and contracts, must be published in one newspaper of wide circulation at Bancolombia's principal place of business at least 30 calendar days prior to such meeting.

Pursuant to Colombian law and/or Bancolombia's bylaws, special majorities are required to adopt the following corporate actions: (i) a favorable vote of at least 70% of the shares represented at a general shareholders' meeting is required to approve the issuance of shares without preemptive rights available for shareholders; (ii) a favorable vote of at least 78% of the holders of represented common shares to decide not to distribute as dividend at least 50% of the annual net profits of any given fiscal year; (iii) a favorable vote of at least 80% of the holders of represented common shares and 80% of the holders of outstanding preferred shares to approve the payment of the dividend in shares; and (iv) a favorable vote of at least 70% of the holders of common shares and of outstanding preferred shares to effect a decision to impair the conditions or rights established for such preferred shares, or a decision to convert those preferred shares into common shares.\n\nIf the Superintendency of Finance determines that any amendment to the bylaws fails to comply with Colombian law, it may demand that  the  relevant  provisions  be  modified  accordingly.

(ii) when the preferred dividend has not been fully paid during two consecutive annual terms. In this event, holders of such shares shall retain their voting rights until the corresponding dividends have been fully paid to them. (iii) if at the end of a fiscal period, the Bank's profits are not enough to pay the minimum dividend and the Superintendency of Finance, by its own decision or upon petition of holders of at least ten percent (10%) of preferred shares, determines that benefits were concealed or shareholders were misled with regard to benefits received from the Bank by the Bank's directors or officers decreasing the profits to be distributed, the Superintendency of Finance may resolve that holders of preferred shares should participate with  speaking  and  voting  rights  at  the  general  shareholders'  meeting,  in  the  terms  established  by  law.  (iv)  when  the registration of shares at the Colombian Securities Exchange or at the Superintendency of Finance, is suspended or canceled. In this event, voting rights shall be maintained until the irregularities that resulted in such cancellation or suspension are resolved. (v) when voting amendments that could impair the preferred shares' rights, or the conversion of the preferred shares to common shares, a favorable vote of a minimum of seventy percent (70%) of the subscribe capital stock, including the favorable vote of a minimum of seventy percent (70%) of the preferred shares, is required.\n\nBancolombia must cause a notice of any meeting at which holders of preferred shares are entitled to vote to be mailed to each record holder of preferred shares. Each notice must include a statement stating: (i) the date of the meeting; (ii) a description of any resolution to be proposed for adoption at the meeting on which the holders of preferred shares are entitled to vote; and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies.\n\n## Dividends\n\n## Common Shares\n\nOnce the unconsolidated Financial Statements are approved by the general shareholders meeting, the appropriation for the payment of taxes of the corresponding taxable year has been made, and the transfers to the reserves have been performed, then they can determine the allocation of distributable profits, if any, of the preceding year.\n\nUnder  the  Colombian  Commercial  Code,  a  company  must  distribute  at  least  50%  of  its  annual  net  profits  to  all shareholders, payable in cash, or as determined by the shareholders, within a period of one year following the date on",

If the total amount segregated in all reserves of a company exceeds its outstanding capital, this percentage is increased to 70%. The minimum common stock dividend requirement of 50% or 70%, as the case may be, may be waived by a favorable vote of the holders of 78% of a company's common stock present at the meeting.\n\nUnder Colombian law and Bancolombia's bylaws annual net profits are to be applied as follows: (i) first, an amount equivalent  to  10%  of  net  profits  is  segregated  to  build  a  legal  reserve  until  that  reserve  is  equal  to  at  least  50%  of Bancolombia's paid-in capital; (ii) second, payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares; and (iii) third, allocation  of  the  net  profits  is  determined  by  the  holders  of  a  majority  of  the  common  shares  entitled  to  vote  on  the recommendation of the board of directors and the President and may, subject to further reserves required by the by-laws, be distributed as dividends. Under the Bank's bylaws, the dividends payable to the holders of common shares cannot exceed the dividends payable to holders of the preferred shares. Bancolombia's bylaws requires the Bank to maintain a reserve fund equal to 50% of paid-in capital. All common shares that are fully paid in and outstanding at the time a dividend or other distribution is declared are entitled to share equally in that dividend or other distribution. Common shares that are only partially-paid participate in a dividend or distribution in the same proportion as the shares that have been fully paid in at the time of the dividend or distribution.\n\nThe general shareholders' meeting may allocate a portion of the profits to welfare, education or civic services, or to support economic organizations of the Bank's employees.\n\n## Preferred Shares\n\nHolders of preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends based on the net profits of the preceding fiscal year, after deducting losses affecting the capital and once the amount that shall be legally set apart for the legal reserve has been deducted, but before creating or accruing for any other reserve, of a non-cumulative minimum preferred dividend equal to one percent (1%) yearly of the subscription price of the preferred share, provided this dividend is higher than the dividend assigned to common shares. If this is not the case, the dividend shall be increased to an amount that is equal to the per share dividend on the common shares. The dividend received by holders of common shares may not be higher than the dividend assigned to preferred shares.\n\nPayment of the preferred dividend shall be made at the time and in the manner established in the general shareholders' meeting and with the priority indicated by Colombian law.\n\nIn the event that the holders of preferred shares have not received the minimum dividend for a period in excess of two consecutive fiscal years, they will acquire certain voting rights. See Item 10. 'Aditional Information - B. Memorandum and  Articles  of  Association  -  Description  of  Share  Rights,  Preferences  and  Restrictions  -  Voting  Rights  -  Preferred Shares'.\n\n## General Considerations Relating to Dividends\n\nIn the general shareholders' meeting, shareholders will determine the effective date, the system and the place for payment of dividends, including payment in installments.\n\nDividends declared on the common shares and the preferred shares will be payable to the record holders of those shares, as  they  are  recorded  on  Bancolombia's  stock  registry,  on  the  appropriate  record  dates  as  determined  in  the  general shareholders' meeting.\n\nAny dividend in shares payable by Bancolombia will be paid in common shares to the holders of common shares and in preferred shares to the holders of preferred shares. Nonetheless, Shareholders at the general shareholders' meeting may authorize the payment in common shares to all shareholders.\n\nAny dividend in shares requires the approval of 80% or more of the shares present at a shareholders' meeting, which will include  80%  or  more  of  the  outstanding  preferred  shares.  In  the  event  that  such  voting  majority  is  not  obtained, shareholders may individually elect to receive a stock dividend or a cash dividend.",

In addition, the Superintendency of Finance has the power to take over the operations and assets of a bank and proceed to its liquidation under certain circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the 'Estatuto Org\u00e1nico del Sistema Financiero', Decree 663 of 1993. For more information see Item 4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8.

These rights are called preemptive rights. See  Item  3.  'Key  Information  -  D.  Risk  Factors  -  Preemptive  rights  may  not  be  available  to  holders  of  American Depositary Receipts ('ADRs') evidencing ADSs'.\n\nShareholders at a general meeting of shareholders may suspend preemptive rights with respect to a particular capital increase by a favorable vote of at least 70% of the shares represented at the meeting. Preemptive rights must be exercised within the period stated in the share placement terms of the increase, which cannot be shorter than 15 business days following the publication of the notice of the public offer of that capital increase. From the date of the notice of the share placement terms, preemptive rights may be transferred separately from the corresponding shares.\n\nThe  Superintendency  of  Finance  will  authorize  decreases  in  the  outstanding  capital  stock  decided  by  the  holders  of common shares only if: (i) Bancolombia has no liabilities; (ii) Bancolombia's creditors consent in writing; or (iii) the outstanding capital stock remaining after the reduction represents at least twice the amount of Bancolombia's liabilities.\n\n## Limits on Purchases and Sales of Capital Stock by Related Parties\n\nPursuant to the Colombian Commerce Code, the members of the Bank's board of directors and certain of the Bank's principal executive officers may not, directly or indirectly, buy or sell shares of the Bank's capital stock while they hold their  positions,  except  when  dealing  with  nonspeculative  operations  and  in  that  case  they  need  to  obtain  the  prior authorization  of  the  board  of  directors  passed  with  the  vote  of  two-thirds  of  its  members  (excluding,  in  the  case  of transactions by a director, such director's vote) or when deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the Bank with the authorization of the Shareholders Meeting the affirmative vote of the ordinary majority foreseen in the bylaws, excluding the vote of the petitioner.\n\n## No Redemption\n\nColombian law prohibits Bancolombia from repurchasing shares of its capital stock, including the preferred shares.",

Any transfer of shares equal to or greater than 5% of the Bank's capital stock or any person acquiring a percentage of shares that would make him the beneficial owner of 5% or more of the Bank's capital stock, is a material event, and therefore, must be disclosed to the Superintendency of Finance.\n\n## Changes in the Capital of the Company\n\nThere are no conditions in the Bank's by-laws governing changes in the Bank's capital stock that are more stringent than those required under Colombian law.\n\n## C.                 MATERIAL CONTRACTS\n\nBancolombia has not entered into any contract, other than those entered in the ordinary course of business or that are not considered to be material, to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party, for the two years immediately preceding the date of this Annual Report.\n\n## D.                 EXCHANGE CONTROLS\n\nThe Central Bank has consistently made foreign currency available to Colombian private sector entities to meet their foreign currency obligations. Nevertheless, in the event of shortages, foreign currency may not be available to private sector companies and the amounts needed by the Bank to service foreign currency obligations may not be purchased in the open market without substantial additional costs.\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Statute, Law 9 of 1991, outlines the Colombian foreign exchange regime which relates to matters such  as  imports  and  exports  of  goods,  foreign  indebtedness,  and  guarantees  in  foreign  currencies,  among  others. Additionally, Decree 1068 of 2015 and Decree 119 of 2017, as amended, sets forth an International Investments Regime which provides for rules applicable to foreign residents who invest in the Colombian securities markets and undertake other types of investments, prescribes registration with the Central Bank of certain foreign exchange transactions, and specifies procedures pursuant to which certain types of foreign investments are to be authorized and administered. Both, the Foreign Exchange Statute and the International Investments Regime are regulated by External Resolution No. 1 of 2018 and External Regulating Circular DCIP-83 of 2021, both as amended, of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank.\n\nUnder Colombian law and the Bank's by-laws, foreign investors receive the same treatment as Colombian citizens with respect to ownership and the voting rights of ADSs and preferred shares. For a detailed discussion of ownership restrictions see Item 4. 'Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8. Supervision and Regulation - Ownership and Management Restrictions'.",

TAXATION\n\n## Colombian Taxation\n\n## ADRs do not have the same tax benefits as other equity investments in Colombia\n\nAlthough ADRs represent Bancolombia's preferred shares, they are held through a fund of foreign capital in Colombia which is subject to a specific tax regulatory regime. Accordingly, the applicable law in Colombia to equity investments those relating to dividends and profits from sale, are not applicable to ADRs, including the Bank's ADRs.\n\nUnder Section 18-1 of the Colombian Tax Code, modified by Law 2010 de 2019, dividends are subject to a dividend tax, as follows:\n\n## Foreign Portfolio investment\n\nTo determine the income tax with respect to the profits earned from the foreign portfolio investments, regardless of the method or vehicle used to make the investment by the investor, the following rules shall apply:\n\n- i.     The dividends that were subject to CIT at the corporate level are taxed at 10%. Dividend tax rate. Dividends that did  not  pay  CIT  at  the  corporate  level  are  subject  to  the  recapture/equalisation  tax  at  the  rate  of  25%  upon distribution, plus the 10% dividend tax.\n- ii.    The tax is to be collected via withholding tax on the accrual or cash basis.\n\nFor  Colombian  tax  purposes,  an  individual  is  considered  as  a  tax  resident  if  he  or  she  meets  any  of  the  following requirements:\n\n- -To remain in Colombia (Continuously or not) for an aggregate period of time of 183 calendar days or more including entry and departure days from the country, within a period of 365 consecutive calendar days. In case where that requirement is met by considering the days spent in Colombia over two successive fiscal years the individual would be considered as tax resident as of the second fiscal year.\n- -Those individuals  who  are  working  for  the  Colombian  Foreign  Service  or  those  serving  the  Colombian Foreign Service and which, by virtue of the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations, are exempt from taxation on all or part of their income and occasional earnings in the country in which they are serving during the respective tax year or period.",

For Corporate Income Tax purposes, companies incorporated in Colombia under Colombian Laws qualify as a National Company and are taxed on their worldwide income.  For Colombian tax purposes, a non-resident entity that is effectively managed in Colombia would be considered as a Colombian entity (effective place of management).\n\n## Preferred shares\n\nPreferred shares will have the same treatment as financial liabilities for the issuer's tax purposes. The treatment will be the same as financial assets for the holder. This treatment will not be applicable to listed shares that do not comply with the rest of the requirements established by Article 33-3 of the Colombian Tax Code.\n\n## Other Tax Considerations\n\nAs of the date of this report, there is not a Double Taxation Treaty between Colombia and the United States.\n\n## United States Federal Income Taxation Considerations\n\nThis section describes the material United States federal income tax consequences generally applicable to a U.S. holder (as defined below) of owning preferred shares or ADSs. It applies to you only if you hold your preferred shares or ADSs as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes. This discussion addresses only United States federal income taxation  and  does  not  discuss  all  of  the  tax  consequences  that  may  be  relevant  to  you  in  light  of  your  individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax.

These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. There is currently no comprehensive income tax treaty between the United States and Colombia. In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nIf an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds the preferred shares or ADSs, the United States federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding the preferred shares or ADSs should consult its tax advisor with regard to the United States federal income tax treatment of an investment in the preferred shares or ADSs.\n\nYou are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of preferred shares or ADSs and you are:\n\n- \u00b7 A citizen or resident of the United States,\n- \u00b7 A domestic corporation (or an entity treated as a domestic corporation),\n- \u00b7 An estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source, or a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more United States persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\nIn general, and taking into account the earlier assumptions, for United States federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing ADSs, you will be treated as the owner of the preferred shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of preferred shares for ADRs, and ADRs for preferred shares generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax.\n\nThe tax treatment of your preferred shares or ADSs will depend in part on whether or not we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes. Except as discussed below under 'PFIC Rules', this discussion assumes that we are not classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes.\n\nYou should consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state and local and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of preferred shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\n\n## Taxation of Distributions\n\nUnder the United States federal income tax laws, if you are a U.S. holder, the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes),",

        "page_content": "other than certain pro-rata distribution of the Bank's preferred shares, including the amount of any Colombian tax withheld, will be treated as a dividend that is subject to United States federal income taxation. If you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, dividends paid to you that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided that you hold the preferred shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date (or, if the dividend is attributable to a period or periods aggregating over 366 days, provided that you hold the preferred shares or ADSs for more than 90 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date) and meet other holding period requirements. Dividends we pay with respect to the ADSs generally will be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, the ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. The Bank believes that its ADSs, which are listed on the NYSE, are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States; however, there can be no assurance that the Bank's ADSs will continue to be readily tradable on an established securities market. Because the preferred shares are not listed on any United States securities market, it is unclear whether dividends we pay with respect to the preferred shares will also be qualified dividend income. If dividends we pay with respect to the Bank's preferred shares  are  not  qualified  dividend  income,  then  the  U.S.  dollar  amount  of  such  dividends  received  by  a  U.S.  holder (including dividends received by a non-corporate U.S. holder) will be subject to taxation at ordinary income tax rates.\n\nYou must include any Colombian tax withheld from the dividend payment in this gross amount even though you do not in fact receive it. The dividend is taxable to you when you, in the case of preferred shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs,  receive  the  dividend,  actually  or  constructively.  The  dividend  will  not  be  eligible  for  the  dividends-received deduction  generally  allowed  to  United  States  corporations  in  respect  of  dividends  received  from  other  United  States corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income as a U.S. holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the Colombian Peso payments made, determined at the spot Colombian Peso / U.S. dollar rate on the date the dividend distribution is includible in your income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date you include the dividend payment in income to the date you convert the payment into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally  will  be  income  or  loss  from  sources  within  the  United  States  for  foreign  tax  credit  limitation  purposes. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in the preferred shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not expect to calculate earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to generally treat distributions with respect to preferred shares or ADSs as dividends.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the Colombian tax withheld and paid over to Colombia will be creditable or deductible against your United States federal income tax liability. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to preferential rates. To the extent a refund of the tax withheld is available to you under Colombian law, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against your United States federal income tax liability. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances.\n\nFor  foreign  tax  credit  purposes,  dividends  will  generally  be  income  from  sources  outside  the  United  States  and  will generally be 'passive' income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you.\n\nThe rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.\n\n## Taxation of Capital Gains\n\nIf you are a U.S. holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your preferred shares or ADSs, you will recognize capital gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount that you realize and your tax basis, determined in U.S. dollars, in your preferred shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the property is held for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.",

        "page_content": "## PFIC Rules\n\nWe believe that preferred shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes, and we do not expect to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. It is therefore possible that we could become a PFIC in a future taxable year. If we were to be treated as a PFIC, unless you elect to be taxed annually on a mark-tomarket basis with respect to your preferred shares or ADSs, the following rules would apply. With certain exceptions, your preferred shares or ADSs would be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during your holding period in your preferred shares or ADSs.\n\nAny 'excess distributions,' which would include any distributions during a taxable year that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by you in respect of the preferred shares or ADSs during the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, your holding period for the preferred shares or ADSs that preceded the taxable year in which you receive the distribution, and any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of your preferred shares or ADSs would be allocated ratably over your holding period for the preferred shares or ADSs and would generally be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. Any gain recognized would not be treated as capital gain.\n\nIf you own preferred shares or ADSs in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, you may make a mark-to-market election. If you make this election, you will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above. Instead, in general, you will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of your preferred shares or ADSs at the end of the taxable year over your adjusted basis in your preferred shares or ADSs. These amounts of ordinary income will not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital gains. You will also be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of your preferred shares or ADSs over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). Your basis in the preferred shares or ADSs will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts.\n\nIn addition, notwithstanding any election you make with regard to the preferred shares or ADSs, dividends that you receive from us would not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income if we are treated as a PFIC with respect to you either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead would be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.\n\n## Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets\n\nOwners  of  'specified  foreign  financial  assets'  with  an  aggregate  value  in  excess  of  USD  50,000  (and  in  some circumstances, a higher threshold) may be required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. 'Specified foreign financial assets' include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are held for investment and not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-United States persons (including the preferred shares and ADSs), (ii) financial instruments and contracts that have non-United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign entities. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of this reporting requirement to their ownership of the preferred shares or ADSs.\n\n## FATCA Withholding\n\nUnder FATCA, a 30% withholding tax will be imposed on certain payments to certain non-U.S. financial institutions that fail to comply with information reporting requirements or certification requirements in respect of their direct and indirect United States shareholders and/or United States accountholders. To avoid becoming subject to the 30% withholding tax on payments to  them,  we  and  other  non-U.S.  financial  institutions  may  be  required  to  report  information  to  the  IRS regarding the holders of preferred shares or ADSs and to withhold on a portion of payments under the preferred shares or ADSs to certain holders that fail to comply with the relevant information reporting requirements (or hold preferred shares or  ADSs  directly  or  indirectly  through  certain  non-compliant  intermediaries).

SUBSIDIARY INFORMATION\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM 11        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe following section describes the market risks to which Bancolombia is exposed and the tools and methodology used to measure these risks as of December 31, 2021. Bancolombia faces market risk as a consequence of its lending, trading and investments businesses. Market risk represents the potential loss due to adverse changes in market prices of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and other risk factors, such as sovereign risk.\n\nBancolombia's risk management strategy, called the Integrated Risk Management Strategy, is based on principles set by international bodies and by Colombian regulations, and is guided by Bancolombia's corporate strategy. The main objective of the Integrated Risk Management Strategy is to identify measure, coordinate, monitor, report and propose policies for market and liquidity risks of the Bank, which in turn serve to facilitate the efficient administration of Bancolombia's assets and  liabilities.  Bancolombia's  board  of  directors  and  senior  management  have  formalized  the  policies,  procedures, strategies and rules of action for market risk administration in its 'Market Risk Manual'. This manual defines the roles and responsibilities within each subdivision of the Bank and their interaction to ensure adequate market risk administration.\n\nThe Bank's Market Risks Management Office is responsible for: (a) identifying, measuring, monitoring, analyzing and controlling the market risk inherent in the Bank's businesses, (b) analyzing the Bank's exposure under stress scenarios and confirming compliance with Bancolombia's risk management policies, (c) analyzing the methodologies design by the official  price  vendor  for  valuation  of  the  market  value  securities  and  financial  instruments,  (d)  reporting  to  senior management and the board of directors any violation of Bancolombia's risk management policies, (e) reporting to the senior management on a daily basis the levels of market risk associated with the trading instruments recorded in its treasury book (the 'Treasury Book'), and (f) proposing policies to the board of directors and to senior management that ensure the maintenance of predetermined risk levels. The Bank has also implemented an approval process for new products across each of its subdivisions. This process is designed to ensure that every subdivision is prepared to incorporate the new",

Trading instruments are recorded in the Treasury Book and include fixed income securities, foreign exchange (FX) and bond futures, and over-the-counter plain vanilla and exotic derivatives. Trading in derivatives includes forward contracts on foreign currency operations, forward contracts on fixed income securities, plain vanilla options on foreign currency, Asian options on U.S. dollar/COP, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Non-trading instruments are recorded in the Bank's banking book (the 'Banking Book'), which includes primarily loans, time deposits, checking accounts and savings accounts.\n\nThe Bank uses a value at risk ('VaR') calculation to limit its exposure to the market risk of its Treasury Book. The board of directors is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR based on its assessment of the appropriate level of risk for Bancolombia. The Proprietary Trading Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR by type of investment. These limits are supervised daily by the Market Risk Management Office.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet items denominated in different currencies, either as a result of trading or in the normal course of business. Our principal foreign currency exposure is the U.S. dollar, which is managed by  Treasury Division and monitored by measuring positions, VaR and daily results.\n\nFor managing the interest rate risk from banking activities, the Bank analyzes the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, the foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the Banking Book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## Trading Instruments Market Risk Measurement\n\nThe Bank currently measures the Treasury Book exposure to market risk (including over-the-counter derivatives positions) as well as the currency risk exposure of the Banking Book, which is provided to the Treasury Division, using a VaR methodology established in accordance with 'Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular', issued by the SFC.\n\nThe  VaR  methodology  established  by  'Chapter  XXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular'  is  based  on  the  model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee of 2005, which focuses on the Treasury Book and excludes investments measured under amortized cost which are not being given as collateral and any other investment that comprises the Banking Book, such as non-trading positions excluding the currency risk position stemming from investment in affiliated but not consolidated entities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the methodology aggregates all risks by the use of correlations, through an allocation system based on defined zones and bands, affected by given sensitivity factors.\n\nThe total market risk for the Bank is calculated by the arithmetical aggregation of the VaR calculated for each subsidiary. The aggregated VaR is reflected in the Bank's Capital Adequacy (Solvency) ratio, in accordance with Decree 2555 of 2010.\n\nFor purposes of VaR calculations, a risk exposure category is any market variable that is able to cause potential changes in the portfolio value. Taking into account a given risk exposure, the VaR model assesses the maximum loss not exceeded at a specified confidence level over a given period of time. The fluctuations in the portfolio's VaR depend on volatility, modified duration and positions changes relating to the different instruments that are subject to market risk.\n\nThe  relevant  risk  exposure  categories  for  which  VaR  is  computed  by  Bancolombia  according  to  the  'Chapter  XXI, appendix 1 of the Basic Accounting Circular' are: (i) interest rate risks relating to local currency, foreign currency and UVR; (ii) currency risk; (iii) stock price risk; (iv) fund risk and (v) credit default swaps.",

Bancolombia calculates the interest rate risk for positions in local currency, foreign currency and UVR separately, in accordance with Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular issued by the Financial Superintendence. The calculation of the interest rate risk begins with determining the net position in each instrument and estimating its sensitivity, which is calculated by multiplying its net present value ('NPV') by its 'modified duration' and by the interest rate's estimated fluctuation (as defined by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia.). The interest rate's fluctuations are established by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia according to historical market performance, as shown in the following table:\n\nFigure 1.

within its corresponding band. A net sensitivity is then calculated for each band, by determining the difference between the sum of all long-positions and the sum of all short-positions. Then a net position is calculated for each zone (which consists of a series of bands) determined by the Financial Superintendence. The final step is to make adjustments within each band, across bands and within each zone, which results in a final number that is the interest rate risk VaR by currency. Each adjustment is performed following the guidelines established by the Financial Superintendence.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to interest risk primarily arises from investments in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES) and other securities issued by the Colombian government.\n\nThe interest rate risk VaR increased from COP 403 billion on December 31, 2020 to COP 404 billion on December 31, 2021, due to the increase in the position in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES) and United States government's treasury bonds. During the year 2021, the average interest rate risk VaR was COP 408 billion, the maximum value COP 451 billion, and the minimum value COP 347 billion.\n\n## Currency (Treasury and Banking Book), Equity (Treasury Book) and Fund Risk (Treasury Book)\n\nThe VaR model uses a sensitivity factor to calculate the probability of loss due to fluctuations in the price of stocks, funds and currencies in which the Bank maintains a position. As previously indicated, the methodology used in this Annual Report to measure such risk consists of computing VaR, which is derived by multiplying the position by the maximum probable variation in the price of such positions (' \uf044 p'). The \uf044 p is determined by the Financial Superintendence, as shown in the following table:",

Between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, the average currency risk VaR was COP 82 billion, the maximum value COP 99 billion, and the minimum value COP 63 billion. Current currency risk primary arises from the USD exposure of Bancolombia in foreign exchange derivatives.\n\nThe equity risk VaR increased from COP 98 billion as of December 31, 2020 to COP 100 billion as of December 31, 2021 mainly due to the increase in the brokerage firm's trading position. This exposure comes mainly from investment in Proteccion, a pension and severance fund, which represents 50% of the equity risk VaR.\n\nBetween December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, the average equity VaR was COP 97 billion, the maximum value COP 103 billion, and the minimum value COP 92 billion.\n\nThe fund risk, which arises from investment in mutual funds, increased from COP 214 billion as of December 31, 2020 to COP 225 billion as of December 31, 2021. Between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, the average fund risk VaR was COP 222 billion, the maximum value COP 226 billion, and the minimum value COP 216 billion.\n\n## Total Market Risk VaR\n\nThe total market risk VaR is calculated as the algebraic sum of the interest rate risk, the currency risk, the stock price risk, fund risk and the credit default swaps risk which are calculated as the algebraic sum of the Parent Company and each of its subsidiaries' exposure to these risks. Currently Bancolombia Group does not present exposure to credit default swaps risk.\n\nThe total market risk VaR, increased 0.7%, going from COP 811 billion in December 31, 2020 to COP 817 billion as of December 31, 2021, and due mainly to increase in the fund risk mentioned above.\n\nAssumptions and Limitations of VaR Models: Although VaR models represent a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as predictive of future results. The Bank may incur in losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by the Bank's VaR models. A VaR model does not calculate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the reasonable judgment of the Bank's risk management personnel.\n\nThe  chart  below  provides  information  about  Bancolombia's  consolidated  VaR  for  trading  instruments  at  the  end  of December 2020 and December 2021.\n\n|                        | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                        | 2021                 | 2020                 |\n|                        | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Interest Rate Risk VaR | 403,556              | 402,882              |\n| Currency Risk VaR      | 88,477               | 95,926               |\n| Equity Risk VaR        | 99,895               | 98,131               |\n| Fund Risk VaR          | 225,373              | 214,308              |\n| Total VaR              | 817,302              | 811,247              |",

Changes in interest rates affect Bancolombia's earnings as a result of timing differences on the repricing of the assets and liabilities. The Bank manages the interest rate risk arising from banking activities in non-trading instruments by analyzing the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities. The foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the Banking Book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## Interest Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nThe Bank has performed a sensitivity analysis of market risk sensitive instruments estimating the impact on the net interest income of each position in the Banking Book, using a repricing model and assuming positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points (bps).\n\nThe table 1 provides information about Bancolombia's interest rate sensitivity for the statement of financial position items comprising the Banking Book:\n\nThe  chart  below  provides  information  about  Bancolombia's  interest  rate  risk  sensitivity  in  local  currency  (COP)  at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:\n\nTable 1.

The change in the net interest income sensitivity between 2021 and 2020 is due to the increase in the sensitivity of float loans.\n\nOn the other hand, the net interest income sensitivity in foreign currency, assuming the same parallel shift of 100 basis points, was USD 22 at December 31, 2021, compared with USD 10 at December 31, 2020. The increase in net interest income sensitivity due to interest rate risk between 2021 and 2020 occurred due to the in increase in float loans.\n\n## Assumptions and Limitations\n\nNet interest income sensitivity analysis is based on the repricing model and is based on the following key assumptions: (a) does  not  consider  prepayments,  new  operations,  defaults,  etc.,  (b)  the  fixed  rate  instruments  sensitivity,  includes  the amounts with maturity lower than one year and assumes these will be disbursed at market interest rates and (c) changes in interest rate occur immediately and parallel in the yield curves from assets and liabilities for different maturities.\n\n## Structural Equity Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nBancolombia's investment banking affiliate, in its role of financial corporation, has, directly and through its affiliated companies, structural equity investments. These positions are maintained mostly in Industrial and financial sectors. The market value of those investments increased by 23% during the year, from COP 40 billion as of December 31, 2020 to COP 50 billion as of December 31, 2021, as a result mainly driven by the increase in the market value of the investments in Enka Shares.\n\nThe structural equity positions are exposed to market risk. Sensitivity calculations are made for those positions:\n\n|              | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|              | 2021                 | 2020                 |\n|              | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP   |\n| Market Value | 49,925               | 40,502               |\n| Delta        | 14.7 %               | 14.7 %               |\n| Sensitivity  | 7,339                | 5,954                |\n\nA negative impact of 14.7%, applied to the market value, produces a decrease of COP 7 billion in the structural equity investments market value, from COP 50 billion to COP 43 billion.",

External Circular 028 of 2014, issued by the SFC, contains the corporate governance standards to be followed by companies issuing securities that may be  purchased  by  Colombian pension funds, and determines that entities under supervision of the SFC, when making investment decisions, must take into account the recommendations established by the 'Country Code' ('C\u00f3digo Pa\u00eds') and the corporate governance standards followed by the entities who are beneficiaries of the investment.\n\nAdditionally, Law 964 of 2005 established mandatory corporate governance requirements for all issuers whose securities are publicly traded in the Colombian market, and Decree 2555 of 2010 regulates the information disclosure requirements for the Colombian securities market SIMEV ('Sistema Integral de Informaci\u00f3n del Mercado de Valores'). Bancolombia's corporate  governance  standards  comply  with  these  legal  requirements  and  Bancolombia  has  implemented  additional corporate governance measures pursuant to regional recommendations including the OECD White Paper on Corporate Governance for Latin America and the Andean Development Corporation's (CAF) Corporate Governance Code.\n\nThe  following  is  a  summary  of  the  significant  differences  between  the  corporate  governance  practices  followed  by Bancolombia and those applicable to domestic issuers under the NYSE listing standards\n\n- \u00b7 Independence of Directors. Under NYSE corporate governance rules, a majority of a U.S. company's board of directors must be composed of independent directors. Regarding Colombian legislation, Law 964 of 2005 requires that at least 25% of the members of the Bank's board of directors are independent directors, and Decree 3923 of 2006  regulates  their  election.  Additionally,  Colombian  law  requires  that  all  directors  exercise  independent judgment under all circumstances. Bancolombia's Corporate Governance Code includes a provision stating that directors shall exercise independent judgment and requires that Bancolombia's management recommend to its shareholders  lists  of  director  nominees  of  which  at  least  25%  are  independent  directors.  The  Corporate Governance Code also includes additional independence standards that must be met by 5 of 7 directors. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank's board of directors included a majority of independent members (5 members of 7). For the independence test applicable to directors of Bancolombia, see Item 10. 'Additional Information. - B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Board of Directors'.\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Director Meetings. Pursuant to the NYSE listing standards, non-executive directors of U.S. listed companies must meet on a regular basis without management present. There is no prohibition under Colombian",

        "page_content": "regulations  for  officers  to  be  members  of  the  board  of  directors;  however,  it  is  customary  for  Colombian companies to maintain separation between the directors and management. Bancolombia's board of directors does not include any management members; however, the CEO attends the monthly meetings of the Bank's board of directors, and members of senior management may attend the meetings of the board of directors and committees to guarantee an adequate flow of information between employees, management and directors; in both cases, the CEO and members of senior management are not allowed to vote. In accordance with Law 964 of 2005 and the Bank's by-laws, no executive officer can be elected as chairman of the Bank's board of directors.\n\n- \u00b7 Committees of the Board of Directors. Under NYSE listing standards, all U.S. companies listed on the NYSE must have an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating/corporate governance committee and all members of such committees must be independent. In each case, the independence of directors must be established pursuant to highly detailed rules enacted by the NYSE and, in the case of the audit committee, the NYSE  and  the  SEC.  The  Bank's  board  of  directors  has  a  Designation,  Compensation  and  Development Committee, a Corporate Governance Committee, a Risk Committee and an Audit Committee, each of which is composed exclusively of directors (Audit Committee is composed exclusively of independent directors, whereas the other committees have both independent and non-independent directors). For a description of the Designation, Compensation  and  Development  Committee,  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  Audit  Committee  and  Risk Committee, see Item 6. 'Directors, Senior Management and Employees - C. Board Practices'.\n- \u00b7 Stockholders'  Approval  of  Dividends .  While  NYSE  corporate  governance  standards  do  not  require  listed companies  to  have  stockholders  approve  or  declare  dividends,  in  accordance  with  the  Colombian  Code  of Commerce, all dividends must be approved by Bancolombia's stockholders.\n\n## H.

A.\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position Bancolombia S. A. and its subsidiaries (the 'Bank') as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the two years ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). We also have audited the Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Bank maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Bank's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and on the Bank's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Bank in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nPwC Contadores y Auditores S.A.S.., Calle 7 Sur No. 42-70, Torre 2, Piso 11, Edificio Forum,  Medell\u00edn, Colombia, Tel: (57-4) 325 4320, Fax: (57-4) 325 4322, www.pwc.com/co",

        "page_content": "## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Allowance for loans, advances and lease losses\n\nAs described in Notes 2 (section D.7.4.5, E.1 and E.10), 6 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on evaluations of the loan portfolio utilizing objective and subjective criteria. As of December 31, 2021, the allowance for loan losses was COP$15,864,482 million on total loans of COP$220,323,483 million. As disclosed by management, Expected Credit Losses (ECL) are calculated using individual and collective models and methodologies based on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current borrower situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios. During 2021, some adjustments were implemented and updated in the methodology such as the Overlays made by management, as a consequence of the COVID-19 for: (1) to mitigate procyclical assumptions caused by the volatility of the macroeconomic forecasts and (2) to mitigate effect of grace periods or extended terms on some loans with relief granted. In addition, for loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, information on the credit behavior, the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence, and when the fundamental source of collection of the loan is a guarantee the market value of such collateral, estimated through appraisals.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Bank's allowance for loans, advances and lease losses is a critical audit matter are, (i) the significant judgment used by management in determining the expected credit losses, in particular the assumptions used in determining: probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios and the adjustments and Overlays implemented and updated by management in the methodology to mitigate procyclical assumptions caused by the volatility of the macroeconomic forecasts and the effect of grace periods or extended terms on some loans with relief granted. In addition, for loans individually assessed in Stage 3 analysis of the debt profile of each debtor, information on the credit behavior and the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence and the market",

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Bank's allowance for loans, advances and leasing losses estimation process, which included controls over the data, models and assumptions used in the estimation process. These procedures also included, among others: testing management's process for estimating the allowance for loan, advances and lease losses by (i) evaluating the appropriateness of  the models utilized for the estimation of the expected loss parameters and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions, such as default at 12 months and lifetime, loss given default and exposure at default with the inclusion of the forward-looking basis that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios, and evaluating the adjustments, including the impact of the Overlays, implemented and updated by management in the methodology to mitigate procyclical assumptions caused by the volatility of the macroeconomic forecasts and the effect of grace periods or extended terms on some loans with relief granted, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the estimate and the mathematical accuracy of the impairment calculation for the credit portfolios; and (iii) evaluating individual credit files to determine the reasonableness of management's estimation of the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios and the market value of collaterals, estimated through appraisals if applicable, estimated by management in the impairment for the credit portfolios. The procedures included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the models utilized by management, methodologies and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the credit loss estimates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessment\n\nAs described in Notes 2 (sections D.13, E.2 and E.10) and 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank's consolidated goodwill balance was COP$8.143.146. as of December 31, 2021. The Bank tests goodwill recognized upon business combinations for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the cash generating units may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined by management by reference to market value, if available, by pricing models, or with the assistance of a valuation specialist. Determination of recoverable amount requires management to make assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flows for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting, including the macroeconomic impacts originated by the outbreak of COVID-19 on such cash flows for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment of the appropriate discount rate and growth rate, estimation of the recoverable amount of cash generation units and the valuation of the separable assets of each business whose goodwill is being reviewed.",

In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements.

These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the recoverable amount estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering: (i) the current and past performance of the cash generating unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit and the impact of COVID-19, in  the economic budgets, forecasts and other assumptions used to determine the recoverable value of the goodwill.

A.\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of Bancolombia S. A. and its subsidiaries (the 'Bank') of income, other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the results of its operations and its cash flows of the year ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Bank in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\n\nOur audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltda.

The winding down of the operations will continue as the compromises related to assets and liabilities come to term. Their assets, liabilities and contracts will be transferred to other companies which are also part of Grupo Bancolombia.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the subsidiary Bancolombia Cayman recognized in its statement of financial position assets and liabilities, including loans and advances to customers, net for COP 8,634 and COP 6,539, debt investments for COP 189,220 and COP 241,154, cash and cash equivalents for COP 50,733 and COP 170,454 and other assets, net for COP 609 and COP 622, respectively.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## A. Basis for preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Bank are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (hereinafter, IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (hereinafter, IASB), as well as the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (hereinafter, IFRS-IC).\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates which,  by  definition,  will  seldom  equal  the  actual  results.  Therefore,  the  estimates  and  assumptions  are  constantly reviewed. Any revision is recognized in the same period if it affects the reviewed period; or in the reviewed period and future periods if it affects all the current and future periods.\n\n## Impacts of COVID-19 on the preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nDuring 2021, the macroeconomic and epidemiological context caused by the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Colombia and in the countries where the Bank operates were characterized less by the shock situation than that evidenced during 2020, despite the appearance and global expansion of the omicron variant, which caused a period of uncertainty in global  financial  markets.  Although  governments  have  provided  more  focused  responses  to  control  outbreaks  and vaccination programs are positively progressing to gradually cover a larger part of the population, an upward trend in the",

        "page_content": "infections level, marked by a reduction in the severity of infections, began to be observed as of December 31, 2021, due to  the  new  omicron  variant.  The  year  2021  was  characterized  by  the  beginning  of  the  economic  recovery  process, generating a significant positive rebound compared to 2020, due to the lower impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity,  reducing  its  overall  impact  and  making  it  possible  to  expect  the  world  to  move  officially  from  a pandemic to an endemic situation during 2022.\n\nDuring the year, there were occasional restrictions on mobility in Colombia and in other countries where the Bank operates during the peak of the pandemic in the first half of the year, but by the end of 2021, most of the controls had been lifted, returning to the normal development of daily activities. These elements have allowed the impact of the epidemiological situation to be relatively contained and the economic recovery to continue.\n\nThe progressive return to a normal economic and social environment has been the predominant factor as of December 31, 2021, despite the contagiousness of the new variant, positively impacting productive activity in Colombia and in the other countries  where  the  Bank  operates.  However,  increases  in  the  production  costs  of  goods  and  services  are  still  being experienced, due to the restrictions of previous periods, which caused increases in the materials prices and supply chain constraints.\n\nThese situations were periodically evaluated during 2021 by Management to take appropriate measures in the ongoing management of the business; accordingly, the Bank continues with customer support strategies through credit relief and concessions due the end of the debtor support programme ('PAD') in Colombia on August 31, 2021, enacted by the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia ('SFC'), and the end of the extension of the general relief law in force in Panama since 2020, which were intended to address the social and health situation, seeking to mitigate the direct and indirect effects thereof. The effects on the Bank's performance and financial position were included in the accompanying notes of the consolidated financial statements (see notes 3 to 32). Likewise, the Bank considered the current economic environment including  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  its  customers  economy  and  businesses  in  preparation  of  the consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  as  of  December  31,  2021,  taking  into  account  the  best  available  reliable information and the evolution of the key assumptions on estimates made at the date of preparation and issuance of these consolidated financial statements. For further information, see section E. Use of estimates and judgments, paragraph 10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other relevant issues on the Bank's judgements and estimates, set out below.\n\n## Preparation of the consolidated financial statements under going concern basis\n\nManagement has also assessed the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern and confirms that the Bank has adequate liquidity and solvency to continue operating the business for the foreseeable future, which is at least, but is not limited to, 12 months from the end of the reporting period. Based on the Bank's liquidity position at the date of authorization of the consolidated  financial  statements  and  taking  into  account  the  uncertainty  about  the  development  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, Management maintains a reasonable expectation that it has adequate liquidity and solvency to continue in operation for at least the next 12 months and that the going concern basis of accounting remains appropriate.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to the reported carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities and expenses that might otherwise be required if the going concern basis were not correct.\n\nAssets and liabilities are measured at cost or amortized cost, except for some financial assets and liabilities and investment properties that are measured at fair value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise those classified as assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, debt instruments and equity securities measured at fair value through  other  comprehensive  income  ('OCI')  and  derivative  instruments.  Likewise,  the  carrying  value  of  assets  and liabilities recognized as a fair value hedge are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are stated in Colombian pesos and figures are stated in millions or billions (when indicated), except earnings per share, diluted earnings per share and the market exchange rate, which are stated in units of Colombian pesos, while other currencies (dollars, euro, pounds, etc.) are stated in thousands.",

Presentation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Bank presents the consolidated statement of financial position ordered by liquidity and the consolidated statement of income  is  prepared  based  on  the  nature  of  expenses.  Revenues  and  expenses  are  not  offset  unless  such  treatment  is permitted or required by an accounting standard or interpretation and described in the Bank's policies.\n\nThe consolidated statement of comprehensive income presents net income and items of other comprehensive income ('OCI') classified by nature and grouped into those that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and those that will be reclassified when specific conditions are met. The Bank discloses the amount of income tax relating to each item of OCI.\n\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows was prepared using the indirect method, whereby net income is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, changes during the period in operating assets and liabilities, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows.\n\n## C. Consolidation\n\n## 1. Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Bancolombia S.A. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The parent company consolidates the financial results of the entities over which it exerts control.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements, a subsidiary is an entity controlled by any of the entities that comprise the Bank, as long as the controlling entity has:\n\n- \u00b7 Power over the investee that gives it the  ability  to  direct  their  relevant  activities  that  significantly  affect  the investee's returns.\n- \u00b7 Exposure or rights to variable returns for its involvement with the investee.\n- \u00b7 Ability to use its power over the investee to affect the investor's returns.\n\nThese type of entities include cases where the Bank has a high exposure to variable returns and retains decision-making power over the investee, either directly or through an agent.",

The wind-down was expected to be completed before the end of the year 2021. For further information, see Note 1. Reporting entity.\n- (12) Companies created by Valores Bancolombia S.A. Comisionista de Bolsa in October 2021. For further information see Note 1.

When the Bank loses control over a subsidiary, any residual interest remaining on the Bank's balances is measured at fair value; gains or losses arising from this measurement are recognized in net income.\n\nThe loan and financial leases originated by Banistmo and Bancolombia Panama are subject to prudential regulation in Panama by the Superintendencia de Bancos de Panam\u00e1 ('SBP') requiring the maintenance of minimum reserves as a countercyclical capital buffer. In the second quarter of 2020, this regulation was suspended, through the General Resolution of the Board of Directors SBP-GJD-0007-2020, to provide financial relief to the banks. For the years ended as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the reserves recognized amounted to COP 1,428,964 and COP 1,232,033. The establishment of these reserves restrict the ability of the aforementioned subsidiaries to pay dividends to Bancolombia S.A., the ultimate parent, except in the event of liquidation.\n\n## 2. Transactions between entities under common control\n\nCombinations of entities under common control, i.e., transactions in which all the combining entities are under the control of the Bank both before and after the combination, and that control is not transitory, are outside the scope of the IFRS 3 Business combinations. Currently, there is no specific guidance for these transactions under IFRS, therefore, as permitted by IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the Bank has developed an accounting policy considering  the  pronouncements  of  other  standard-setting  bodies.  The  assets  and  liabilities  recognized  as  a  result  of transactions  between  entities  under  common  control  are  recognized  at  the  carrying  value  of  the  acquirer's  financial statements. The Bank presents the net assets received prospectively from the date of the transfer.\n\n## 3. Investments in associates and joint ventures",

        "page_content": "An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nA joint venture is an entity that the Bank controls jointly with other participants, where the parties maintain a contractual agreement that establishes joint control over the relevant activities of the entity (which only exists when decisions about those activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control) and the parties have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the excess of the acquisition cost of the associate or joint venture shares exceeding the Bank's share of the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognized as goodwill and is included in the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  and  it  is  not  amortized.  When  necessary,  the  entire  carrying  amount  of  the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets. Impairment losses are recognized in net income and are calculated as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture, using the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal, and its carrying value.\n\nThe results and assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations. When an investment in an associate or joint venture is held by, or is held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organization, or a mutual fund, unit trust or similar entities, and such investment is measured at fair value through profit or loss in that entity, the Bank may elect to measure investments in those associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. This election is applied on an investment by investment basis.\n\nUnder the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Bank's share of the profits or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or join venture after the date of acquisition, less any impairment loss on the investment. When the Bank's share of losses of an associate or joint venture exceeds the Bank's interest in that associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Bank's net investment in the associate or joint venture), the Bank discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognized only to the extent that the Bank has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nWhen the equity method is applicable, adjustments are considered in order to adopt uniform accounting policies of the associate or joint venture with the Bank. The portion that corresponds to the Bank for changes in the investee's other comprehensive  income  items  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  comprehensive  income  as  'Unrealized gain/(loss) on investments in associates and joint ventures using equity method' and gains or losses of the associate or joint venture are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as 'Dividends and net income on equity investments', in accordance with the Bank's participation. Gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Bank and its associate or joint venture are recognized in the Bank's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of the unrelated investor's interest  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture.  The  equity  method  is  applied  from  the  acquisition  date  until  the  significant influence or joint control over the entity is lost.\n\nThe unrealized gain or loss of an associate or joint venture is presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, net of tax. Changes in the investment's participation that arise from changes in other comprehensive income of an associate or joint venture are recognized directly in the investor's statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe dividends received from the associate or joint venture reduce the investment carrying value.\n\nWhen the significant influence on the associate or the joint venture is lost, the Bank measures and recognizes any residual investment that remains at its fair value. The difference between the associate or joint venture carrying value (taking into account the relevant items of other comprehensive income), the fair value of the retained  residual investment and any proceeds from disposing of a partial interest in the associate or joint venture, is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. The currency translation adjustments recognized in equity are reclassified to net income at  the moment of disposal.",

Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\nThe Bank recognizes and measures assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in relation to its interest in joint operations in accordance with the applicable IFRS for the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\n\nIf the Bank acquires an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in IFRS 3, or when an existing business is contributed to the joint operation on its formation by one of the parties that participate in the joint operation, the Bank will apply all of the principles of IFRS 3. In this case, the Bank recognizes goodwill in the event that consideration transferred exceeds the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nWhen the Bank transacts with a joint operation in which the parent company or its subsidiaries is a joint operator (such as a sale or contribution of assets), the Bank is considered to be conducting the transaction with the other parties to the joint operation,  and  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  transactions  are  recognized  in  the  Bank's  consolidated  financial statements only to the extent of other parties' interests in the joint operation.\n\nWhen the Bank transacts with a joint operation in which the parent company or its subsidiaries is a joint operator (such as a purchase of assets), the Bank does not recognize its share of the gains and losses until it resells those assets to a third party.\n\n## 5. Fund's administration\n\nThe Bank manages assets held in mutual funds and other forms of investment. Assets managed by the Bank's subsidiaries and owned by third parties are not included in the consolidated financial statements unless control exists as structured entities.\n\nThe Bank consolidates the following funds:\n\n| Name                                        | Country  interest held by   | % of ownership   % of ownership   % of ownership    the Bank, 2021   | interest held by   the Bank, 2020   | interest held by   the Bank, 2019   | Assets managed  December 31,   December 31,   2021  2020   | Assets managed  December 31,   December 31,   2021  2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fondo de Capital Privado Fondo Inmobiliario | Colombia                    | 49.96 %                                                              | 49.96 %                             | 49.96 %                             | 4,415,509                                                  | 4,128,801                                                  |\n| Colombia  (1)                               |                             |                                                                      |                                     |                                     |                                                            |                                                            |\n| Fideicomiso Lote Abelardo Castro  (2)       | Colombia                    | -                                                                    | 66.77 %                             | 66.77 %                             | -                                                          | 13,314                                                     |\n| Fideicomiso Lote Distrito Vera B1B2  (3)    | Colombia                    | 66.49 %                                                              | 66.77 %                             | 66.77 %                             | 57,025                                                     | 58,459                                                     |\n| Fideicomiso Lote Distrito Vera B3B4  (3)    | Colombia                    | 66.49 %                                                              | 66.77 %                             | 66.77 %                             | 54,941                                                     | 56,364                                                     |\n| Banistmo Panam\u00e1 Fondo de Inversi\u00f3n S.A.     | Panama                      | 100.00 %                                                             | 100.00 %                            | 100.00 %                            | 414,962                                                    | 522,777                                                    |\n\nFor all the aforementioned funds, the Bank participated in the design of the structured entity, makes operating and financial decisions  on  behalf  of  the  funds  and  is  exposed  to  variable  returns  such  as  dividends  or  returns  paid  in  quarterly installments.\n\nCommissions earned by the management of funds that are not consolidated are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Fees and commissions income'.",

        "page_content": "## 6. Non-controlling interest\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately within the Bank's equity. Similarly, net income and other comprehensive income are also attributed to non-controlling interest and equity holders of the parent company. The amount of non-controlling interest may be initially measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest's proportionate share of the acquirer's identifiable net assets. The option for recognition is made on an investment by investment basis.\n\nAny purchase or sale of shares in subsidiaries that does not imply a loss or gain of control is directly recognized in equity.\n\n## 6.1. Significant non-controlling interest\n\n## FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the portion of non-controlling interest in the FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia was 50.04%, which is considered a significant non-controlling interest for the Bank and its subsidiaries. The principal place of business of FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia is Bogot\u00e1 (Colombia).\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, returns were delivered to the non-controlling interest in quarterly installments due to the nature of its business, which mainly comprises a long- term investment in real estate which is considered a low-risk portfolio. The return delivered amounted to COP 64,717 and COP 43,297, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe following table summarizes the assets, liabilities, net assets, net income and cash flows as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, related to the FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia:\n\n|                                                | As of December 31, 2021  As of December 31, 2020   In millions of COP   | As of December 31, 2021  As of December 31, 2020   In millions of COP   |                    |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Assets                                         | 4,415,509                                                               | 4,128,801                                                               |                    |\n| Liabilities                                    | 1,509,275                                                               | 1,450,781                                                               |                    |\n| Net assets                                     | 2,906,234                                                               | 2,678,020                                                               |                    |\n|                                                | Year-Ended 2021                                                         | Year-Ended 2020                                                         | Year-Ended 2019    |\n|                                                | In millions of COP                                                      | In millions of COP                                                      | In millions of COP |\n| Condensed statement of income                  |                                                                         |                                                                         |                    |\n| Income                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |                    |\n| Valuation of investment properties             | 85,148                                                                  | (8,251)                                                                 | 77,527             |\n| Valuation of trust rights                      | -

(the Bank's subsidiary domiciled in Panama) in accordance with preexisting agreements. On September 29, 2020, regulatory authorizations were obtained to complete the acquisition of the remaining 40.00% of the shareholding of the GAH. With those authorizations, the acquisition of 100.00% of the operations was completed and GAH is  no  longer  considered  a  significant  non-controlling  interest  for  the  Bank  and  its  subsidiaries.  Therefore,  in accordance with IFRS 10, changes in the parent's ownership interest in the subsidiary are considered as equity transactions.\n\nThe following table summarizes the net income and cash

        "page_content": "## 1. Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Bank's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Colombian pesos, which is the functional currency for the parent company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. All transactions and balances in other currency than pesos are considered as foreign currency.\n\n## 2. Transactions and balances in foreign currency\n\nForeign  currency  transactions  are  translated  into  the  functional  currency  using  the  exchange  rates  at  the  dates  of  the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are generally recognized in net income. They are deferred in equity (other comprehensive income) if they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured at cost are held at the exchange rate at the transaction date, while those which are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in net income, any exchange component of that gain or loss shall be recognized in net income.\n\n## 3. Foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the Bank's presentation currency is translated into the presentation currency, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that consolidated statement of financial position,\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses for each statement  of  income  and  statement  of  comprehensive  income  is  translated  at average exchange rates, and\n- \u00b7 All  resulting  exchange  differences  are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  in  translation  adjustment reserve.\n\nAs part of the consolidation process, exchange differences arising from debt securities in issue and the portion of other financial securities designated as hedges of foreign operations that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income in Translation adjustment reserve. When a foreign operation is sold or any debt securities in issue forming part of the net investment are repaid, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to net income, as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing exchange rate.\n\nThe table below sets forth the exchange rate used by the Bank and its subsidiaries to convert consolidated statement of financial position accounts and transactions in U.S. dollar into Colombian pesos:\n\n|                                      | December 31, 2021  December 31, 2020  December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2021  December 31, 2020  December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2021  December 31, 2020  December 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Year-end exchange rate               | 3,981.16                                                  | 3,432.50                                                  | 3,277.14                                                  |\n| Average rate for the period ended at | 3,747.24                                                  | 3,691.27                                                  | 3,282.39                                                  |",

Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Bank considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash and balances at banks and the Central Bank, interbank assets and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending that have original maturities up to 90 days, as shown in Note 4. Cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## 5. Security deposits\n\nSecurity deposits are assets pledged as collateral that correspond to cash guarantees made by the Bank to other financial institutions. The carrying amount is increased when a margin call is issued or when it is necessary to increase the trading quota; conversely, it is decreased when the aim is to lower that quota. The security deposits are recognized as other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position at the amount paid in favor of the counterpart and these assets are subject to interest recognition. These assets are included in the consolidated statement of financial position as 'Other assets, net'.\n\n## 6. Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  those  transactions  where  an  acquirer  obtains  control  of  a  business  (e.g.,  an  acquisition  or merger).\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as follows: a) identifiable acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the acquisition are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition; b) acquisition costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received; and c) goodwill is recognized as an asset in the consolidated statement of financial position or a gain from a bargain purchase.\n\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the Bank (if any).\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the value of any non-controlled interest and, when applicable, the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity, over the net  fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.\n\nFor  each  business  combination,  at  the  date  of  acquisition,  the  Bank  measures  the  non-controlling  interest  by  the proportional share of the identifiable assets acquired, as well as liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed by the acquired company, or by their fair value.\n\nAny contingent consideration in a business combination is classified as a liability or as equity and is recognized at fair value  at  the  date  of  acquisition,  the  liability  is  remeasured  at  subsequent  reporting  dates  in  accordance  with  IAS  37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, and the consideration classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.\n\nThe goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at the date of acquisition, to the Bank's cash-generating units (or group of cash generating units) which are expected to benefit from the combination, regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units or group of units.\n\nFor business combinations achieved in stages, any previous equity interest held by the Bank in the acquiree is remeasured at its fair value at the date of acquisition and any resulting gain (or loss) is reported in the consolidated statement of income or  other  comprehensive  income,  as  appropriate.  Amounts  related  to  such  investments  previously  recognized  in  other comprehensive income that must be recycled through net income are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income, as if such investment had been sold. When the associate had other comprehensive income, which was not reclassified to profit or loss, the amounts were reclassified within equity to retained earnings once the investment was sold.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, the Bank acquired control of Vlipco S.A.S., a company that provides technology services.

Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\n## 7.1. Recognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Bank becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way purchases and sales, which are those purchases and sales of financial assets that require the delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace. The Bank uses settlement date accounting for regular way contracts when recording financial asset transactions.\n\n## 7.2. Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are reported on a net basis on the consolidated statement of financial position if and only if (i) there is currently a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and (ii) there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Bank does not offset income and expenses, unless required or permitted by an IFRS.\n\n## 7.3. Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the consolidated statement of financial position date, for recognition or disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nTo  determine  fair  value,  characteristics  of  the  asset  or  liability  are  taken  into  account  in  the  same  way  that  market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date; the following items are taken into consideration to assess the estimates:\n\n- \u00b7 Based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to which the Bank can access at the measurement date (level 1).\n- \u00b7 Based on inputs of valuation methodologies commonly used by the market participants, these inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly; considering inputs as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  inputs  other  than quoted  prices  that  are  observable  for  the  assets  or liabilities like interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities and credit spreads, and market-corroborated inputs (level 2).\n- \u00b7 Based on internal valuation techniques of discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies, where one or more inputs are unobservable and therefore estimated by the Bank for the assets or liabilities, in the absence of observable inputs (level 3).\n\nThe accounting judgments used in determining fair value relate to matters such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. The changes in estimates related to these factors could affect the recognized fair value of the financial instruments.\n\nIn Note 30. Fair value of assets and liabilities, an analysis is provided of the fair values of financial instruments and nonfinancial assets and liabilities, including further details about the measurement of fair value, hierarchy levels and transfers between levels, if any.\n\n## 7.4. Financial assets\n\nAt initial recognition, the Bank measures financial assets at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets. Financial assets are then classified considering their subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss, fair value through OCI or amortized cost on the basis of the business model for managing the financial assets and the",

In addition, for particular investments in equity instruments, in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial instruments, the Bank made the irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.\n\n## 7.4.1 Money market operations\n\n## Interbank assets and interbank deposits\n\nThese are funds that the Bank lends to other financial institutions or borrows from the Central Bank and other financial institutions. The transactions in an asset position with maturity of up to ninety days are classified as cash equivalents, as long as they are not impacted by market fluctuations. The operations in an asset position with maturity greater than ninety days and all the operations in a liability position are measured at amortized cost and presented as 'Other assets, net' or 'Interbank deposits', respectively, in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Repurchase agreements and other similar secured transactions\n\n## \u00b7 Asset Position\n\nAsset position refers to transactions accounted for as collateralized lending in which the Bank purchases securities with an agreement to resell them back to the seller at a stated price plus interest at a specified date, not exceeding one year. Repos in asset position are initially recognized at the consideration paid and they are subsequently measured at amortized cost. The difference between the purchase value and resale price is recorded in net interest income and accrued over the life of the agreement using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## \u00b7 Liability Position\n\nLiability position refers to transactions accounted for as collateralized borrowing in which the Bank sells debt securities with an agreement to repurchase them back from the buyer at a stated price plus interest at a specified date, not exceeding one year.\n\nThe securities sold under those agreements are not derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position when the Bank substantially retains all of the risks and rewards of the securities. However, the securities are disclosed as pledged  assets.  The  amounts  received  are  initially  recognized,  at  fair  value,  as  a  financial  liability  and  subsequently measured at amortized cost. The difference between the sale value and the repurchase value is treated as interest expense and accrued over the life of the agreement by the effective interest rate method.\n\n## 7.4.2 Debt and equity securities\n\n## Securities at amortized cost\n\nDebt securities are classified at amortized cost only if the asset is maintained within a business model whose objective is to hold it in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the security give rise on specified dates to cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal  amount  outstanding.  The  subsequent measurement of its interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method used to calculate the amortized cost of an asset and to assign the income or cost in interest during the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the discount rate at which the present value of future estimated cash payments or those received through the expected life of the financial instrument, or, when appropriate, in a shorter time frame, are equal to the net carrying value at the beginning. To calculate the effective interest rate, the Bank estimates cash flows considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument, including transaction costs and premiums granted minus commissions and discounts, but without considering future credit losses.",

The difference between the current fair value and the immediately preceding fair value of the respective security is recorded as a higher or lower value of the asset, affecting the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nInvestments in debt securities are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are maintained under a business model whose objective is achieved by both obtaining the contractual cash flows and selling the instruments and, in addition, the instruments give rise, on specific dates to cash flows that correspond only to payments of capital and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nChanges in fair value of the investment are recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognized in profit or loss. When the financial asset is written off, the accumulated gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the consolidated statement of income. Interest income from these financial assets is recognized in the consolidated statement of income as 'Interest and valuation on financial instruments' of the consolidated statement of income, using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## 7.4.3 Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nThe Bank has made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income, subsequent changes in fair value of some equity instruments that are not held for trading. Dividends from this type of instrument are recognized in net income only when the entity's right to receive payment of the dividend is established.\n\n## 7.4.4 Loans and advances to customers and financial institutions, leases and other receivables\n\nThese are financial assets that consist primarily of corporate loans, personal loans (including mainly consumer finance and overdrafts), residential mortgage loans and financial leases. The Bank established that loans, advances to customers and other receivables are held within a business model whose objective is to hold them in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. They are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs and origination fees that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition.  They  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective interest rate method.\n\n## 7.4.5 Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 'FVTOCI'\n\n## 7.4.5.1 Allowance for loans, advances and leases\n\nAs described in section E. Use of estimates and judgments, paragraph 1. Credit risk Impairment and Note 6. Loans and advances to customers, net, Management assessed the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on evaluations of the  loan  portfolio  using  objective  and  subjective  criteria.  As  disclosed  by  Management,  expected  credit  losses  are calculated using individual and collective models and methodologies based on assumptions and judgements considering historical credit data, current borrower situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation (when the loan is classified as stage 2), loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the prospective approach that includes assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios. In addition, for loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, the fair value of guarantees granted, information on the credit behavior and the future cash flows expected from the client.",

The  model is structured in three phases in which the financial asset can be categorized, from its initial recognition, considering the degree of credit risk, and the circumstances that have produced a significant increase in it, as described below:\n\n| Stage 1                         | Stage 2  (Significant increase in credit risk   | Stage 3  (Credit-impaired assets)   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| (Initial recognition)           | since initial recognition)                      |                                     |\n| 12-month expected credit losses | Lifetime expected credit losses                 | Lifetime expected credit losses     |\n\nThe expected loss is based on estimates of losses, including reasonable information about past events, current situations, and forecasts about future economic conditions.\n\nThe Bank has determined that the measurement of impairment of the loan portfolio and financial leasing operations can be made through a collective or individual assessment, in accordance with the amount of and characteristics of the loan.\n\nCollective models include 12-months probability of default parameters (12-month PD), the lifetime probability of default (lifetime PD-when the loan is classified as stage 2), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) with the inclusion  of  the  prospective  approach.  The  individual  analysis  methodology  is  applied  to  significant  exposures  and includes the evaluation of weighted loss scenarios, considering the macroeconomic forecasts and the special conditions of each debtor for the future generation of the cash flow.\n\nDuring 2021, some adjustments were implemented in the methodology to better estimate the ECL in the loan portfolio. In addition, the Bank recorded a general provision adjustment (Overlay) on the loans with relief granted as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Panama and Colombia.\n\nThe probability of default models were not updated with recent information, in order to exclude data from grace periods or extended terms granted in response to the pandemic; therefore, the models incorporate data up to February 2020.\n\nThese adjustments are explained in detail later.\n\n## Staging assessment\n\nThe staging assessment of a significant increase in credit risk can be classified in different stages:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1: Financial instruments that have not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, or that have low credit risk at the reporting date.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2: Financial instruments that have had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (unless they have low credit risk at the reporting date), but that do not have objective evidence of impairment.\n- \u00b7 Stage 3: Financial assets that have objective evidence of impairment (OEI) at the reporting date.\n\nFor each of the stages, an expected credit loss (ECL) will be calculated which will include current and future conditions, both of the behavior of the portfolio and of different associated macroeconomic conditions. For stage 1, a 12-month ECL will be calculated which will acknowledge the expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date, while for stage 2 and 3 a Lifetime ECL will be calculated which contains the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument.\n\n## Significant increase in risk\n\nTo establish whether an asset presents a significant increase in risk since the initial recognition, the Bank performs an assessment of quantitative and qualitative factors and reviews, for each portfolio, the rebuttable presumption of more than",

The way in which the Bank determines whether the credit risk of financial instruments has increased significantly since the initial recognition is as follows:\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nLifetime PD assessment: The Bank has determined that the most suitable quantitative way to establish the  significant increase in credit risk is by comparing the residual lifetime PD at the initial recognition and the current lifetime PD. To measure this difference, two thresholds are defined:\n\n- \u00b7 Absolute  threshold:  Is  the  absolute  difference  between  the  value  of  the  residual  lifetime  PD  at  the  initial recognition  and  the  current  lifetime  PD.  This  threshold  determines  the  value  from  which  a  positive  absolute variation identifies an increase in the risk of the instrument.\n- \u00b7 Relative  threshold:  It  is  a  percentage  variation  between  the  value  of  the  residual  lifetime  PD  at  the  initial recognition and the current lifetime PD. This threshold determines the value from which a positive percentage variation identifies an increase in the instrument risk.\n\nIn the event the comparison of PD's results in the surpassing of one threshold but not the other, it is not considered that there is a significant increase in the risk for the instrument.\n\nIf the instrument does not exceed the threshold, other qualitative criteria are assessed, which can identify a significant increase in credit risk even when the obligation is very close to expiration. These criterions are the following:\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\n- \u00b7 The assets restructured by risk, where the client is experiencing financial difficulties, are classified in stage 2 and provisioned by lifetime expected credit loss until the instrument is canceled, or cured, or it is transferred to stage 3 because it fulfills the definition of default. The following table shows the cure period of the assets restructured by country:\n\n| Country                                       | Portfolio                  | Months      |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|\n| SME Commercial  Corporate  Mortgage  Consumer | 36  Does not apply  34  22 | Colombia    |\n| Consumer  Commercial  Mortgage                | 19  Does not apply  14     | Panama      |\n| Commercial  Consumer  Mortgage                | 18  18  34                 | El Salvador |\n\n- \u00b7 Clients on the watch list with medium risk level.\n- \u00b7 The Bank additionally reviews every six months if there are collective criteria for the migration of a group of clients to stage 2, for example, if a significant change has occurred from the commencement of a specific product or geographic region, or the occurrence of industry events, regulatory, market or any other, that is considered a significant event with impact on the generation of future cash flow of the customer's operation.\n\nThe Bank implemented the following measures in Staging assessment as a consequence of the reprofile of the loan's repayment schedule due to COVID-19:",

The clients that in 2020 were identified with medium or high risk and classified in stages 2 or 3 were reviewed again in 2021 at the AEC committee (Special Client Administration), and those which were identified with less risk returned to stage 1 or stage 2 in accordance with the new risk level.\n- 2. Clients who were given a relief in Colombia due to COVID-19 (similar to a restructuring), are classified in stage 2 for the following period of time:\n\n| Portfolio      | Months                  |\n|----------------|-------------------------|\n| SME Commercial | 12                      |\n| Corporate      | Client-to-client review |\n| Mortgage       | 16                      |\n| Consumer       | 12                      |\n\n- 3. Clients with payment concessions cannot upgrade a stage for a period of 3 months after the payment concession ends.\n\nIn Panama, at the end of December 2021, massive relief continues, so the following adjustments are made to the stage classifications:\n\n- \u00b7 Consumer loan clients identified as unemployed or whose wages have decreased and have not made at least 3 payments because these payments are not still due, are classified in stage 2.\n- \u00b7 In the mortgage portfolio, clients with massive relief who have not made at least 3 payments are not still due, are classified in stage 2.\n- \u00b7 Consumer loan clients without a payment agreement and who have not made any payment are classified in stage 3.\n\n## Measures applied in 2020:\n\n- 1. Clients identified with greater risk through the implementation of expert models and crisis forums are classified in stage 2.\n- 2. Clients with payment modifications that in the last year were past due more than 30 days are classified in stage 2.\n- 3. Clients with payment concessions cannot upgrade a stage for a period of 3 months after the payment concession was granted.\n- 4. Clients identified as affected by their ability to pay due to COVID-19 are classified in stage 2.\n\n## Refutable presumption of more than 30 days of default\n\nThe Bank has reviewed for each portfolio the presumption of a significant increase in 30 days past due and finds historical evidence that there is a relationship between this presumption and default, except for Banistmo's mortgage portfolio, where the Bank has refuted the presumption. The basis for refuting this presumption in Banistmo is that there is reasonable and sustainable information that shows that when the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, this does not represent a significant increase in the credit risk of a financial instrument, the main causes being:\n\n- \u00b7 Banistmo has a percentage of the mortgage portfolio that remains in the delinquency range of 31-60 days for operational  issues  due  to  the  collection  of  checks  (which  generate  a  high  operational  burden),  so  that  usual payment practice exceeds 30 days; in accordance with IFRS 9.B5.5.20, when a non-payment is an administrative oversight, instead of a financial difficulty of the borrower, this presumption may be refused.",

The basis for refuting this presumption is that there is historical evidence that shows that the default occurs at 180 days.\n\n## Measurement of expected credit losses by collective methodology\n\nThe quantification of the expected credit losses collectively is done according to the stage classification, the homogeneous groups defined in each type of portfolio and the client's risk level.\n\nThe segmentation of homogeneous groups is carried out by type of client; for individuals it is grouped by product and for companies by industry segments defined from the sales level of the client.\n\nSimilarly, risk level is assigned based on the type of client. For individuals, the risk is measured using a behavioral scoring model for consumer products and a behavioral scoring for housing products; the function of these models is to rank the clients  according  to  risk  and  thus  have  a  better  follow-up  with  them.  Scoring  is  based  on  historical  behavior  and management variables for  each  one of  the  products.  In  Colombia,  Guatemala  and  Panama,  the  rating  system  for  the consumer portfolio is assessed using random forest methodology, which are mathematical models that allow a greater number  of  variables  related  to  the  client  and  that  have  more  precise  rating  consistent  with  the  level  of  risk.  These methodologies have a fundamental role in the evaluation and monitoring of credit risk.\n\nFor companies, the level of risk is measured based on an internal rating model, which uses qualitative and quantitative variables as financial indicators of the client, with ranking on a scale between level 1 and 19. Also, involved in this process are qualification programs of the region, factors of the local market and the knowledge of the client in the market. In Colombia, a random forest methodology model is used for rating the SME portfolio; these are mathematical models which allow the use of a greater number of variables related to the client such as financial information, internal and external payment behavior, non- financial variables (such as: partners, seniority), sociodemographic and transactional information, imports, exports, among others, and have more precise rating consistent with the level of risk. These methodologies have a fundamental role in the evaluation and monitoring of credit risk.\n\nThe Bank implemented the following measures in the assignment of the score as a consequence of the reprofile of the loan's repayment schedule due to COVID-19:\n\n## Measures applied in 2021:\n\n- 1. Minimum qualification for customers with modified loans continues for 4 months after relief ends.\n\n## Measures applied in 2020:\n\n- 1. Commercial clients are individually analyzed through crisis forums and the portfolio rating process carried out at the end of 2020.\n- 2. Minimum score for modified or restructured clients.\n- 3. Consumer loans with current relief at the end of 2021 are assigned the highest impairment rating between the current month and the rating before COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020).\n\nFor further details, please see Note 31. Risk management, section Description of Loans and Financial Leases.\n\nTo estimate the expected credit losses (ECL) under the collective methodology, the following formula is used:\n\n## ECL = Probability of Default * Loss Given Default * Esposure At Default\n\nThe factors are estimated using statistical models developed from internal historical information of the entity and then adjusted with forward-looking information as described below:",

IFRS 9 proposes the specification of this parameter and its application according to the classification of stages 1, 2 and 3.\n- o PD  12  months:  The  estimated  probability  of  occurrence  of  a  default  in  the  next  12  months  of  the instrument's  life  as  of  the  date  of  analysis.  The  Bank  defines  the  use  of  PD  12  months  for  current portfolio that does not present a significant increase in credit risk or any impairment evidence (portfolio classified in stage 1). To estimate the probability of default for 12 months, the Bank uses traditional techniques such as logistic regression, modeling the behavior of the portfolio by level of risk for each of the segments.\n- o Lifetime  PD:  The  estimated  probability  of  occurrence  of  a  default  over  the  remaining  life  of  an instrument, being dependent on the conditions of the product and the level of risk. The Bank defines the use of lifetime PD for portfolio with a significant increase in credit risk (portfolio classified in stage 2).\n- The Bank estimates this factor using survival models which propose a statistical analysis to quantify the survival rate of a portfolio for a given period. One of the advantages of the methodology is the inclusion of prepaid models.\n- The Bank made improvement in the stage 2 ECL assessment methodology to measure losses over the lifetime of the loan (Cox proportional hazards model, sometimes abbreviated Cox Model), which allow a better adjustment of the macroeconomic variables in the face of the COVID-19 situation.\n- o PD stage  3:  The  customers  evaluated  by  the  collective  methodology  in  stage  3  have  an  associated probability of default of 100.00%.\n- \u00b7 Loss Given Default (LGD): The severity of Loss Given Default is the percentage of exposure that the entity ultimately expects to lose in the event of a default in a financial instrument. The general formulation for the calculation of the LGD is equal to (1 - Recovery Percentage), where the recovery percentage refers to the sum of the flows received from the transaction discounted at the rate for the client on the date of analysis on the total of the  exposure at the time of default, including contractual debt sales and other recovery strategy. For secured products,  this  is  primarily  based  on  collateral  type  and  projected  collateral  values,  the  use  of  appraisals  to determine the value of the collateral and time to repossession and recovery costs observed.\n- The Bank made adjustments in the LGD parameter (Loss Given Default) and the collateral methodology, in order to incorporate maintenance expenses of the collaterals foreclosed upon, implement a greater segregation of default bands and eliminate the loan portfolio historic data that were not representative of the current portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Exposure at Default (EAD): The exposed value of the asset valued at amortized cost (includes the balance of capital, interest and accounts receivable), this is based on the contractual repayments owed by the borrower over a 12 month or lifetime basis.\n\nFor revolving products and those with available borrowing that is likely to be used in its entirety, the Exposure At Default (EAD) estimate considers the use of the CCF (risk conversion factor), in order to find a relationship corresponding to the used and unused component of the instrument. To estimate the expected credit losses (ECL), a component of probability of becoming loan is included.\n\nTo estimate the lifetime expected credit loss, the exposed balance is projected annually, taking into account the discount of contractual payments agreed with the client for each year. Cash flows are discounted at the effective interest rate or an approximation of it.\n\nThe Bank changed one of the assumptions used to measure the expected loss of stage 1. Where in the past, it was assumed that the loss occurs at the beginning of the year, as best practice it is now assumed that the loss occurs in the middle of the year.",

        "page_content": "## Forward-looking information incorporated in the ECL models\n\nTo incorporate the prospective information to the factors defined for the estimation of the expected loss, the Bank uses methodologies  that  correlate  the  historical  behavior  of  the  portfolio  with  certain  economic  variables.  The  Bank  uses projections based on three macro scenarios (base, pessimistic and optimistic); each scenario has a plausible probability of occurrence to evaluate the best estimate of the expected loss under possible future economic conditions.\n\nTo make the projections, the Corporate Economic Research team has defined a process for the generation of estimates under two perspectives: thematic and analytical.\n\n- \u00b7 Thematic Perspective: In the first instance, a series of external variables are defined, which are those whose values are established at a global level and in whose definition the idiosyncratic dynamics of the analyzed country have no incidence. As these are issues whose detailed study is beyond the scope of the Corporate Economic Research team, the Bank uses as reference the estimates made by external analysts.\n- \u00b7 Analytical Perspective: This consists in the compilation of the historical information for the most important economic and financial variables of the country. The information bases are compiled from official sources, which mostly correspond to official authorities, such as the Superintendency or Central Bank of each country. The Bank estimates forecasts based on time series models widely used in econometrics.\n\nAs a result, projections are obtained for the economic variables of interest, which are formulated monthly in a time horizon that includes the current year and five subsequent years. After five years, given the technical difficulties and the high uncertainty, the projection of the economic variables for the total remaining useful life of each instrument corresponds to the value of the last projection.\n\nThe Bank considers that a five (5) years projection horizon continues to be reasonable and that maintaining the fifth-year estimate  for  subsequent  periods  is  a  good  approximation.  This  is  based  on  the  natural  behavior  of  any  statistical  or econometric exercise of variable projection, in which the series tend towards a reversion to the mean or, in this case, to the  long-term  trend  or  equilibrium  level.  Then,  in  subsequent  periods  they  remain  there  once  the  macroeconomic projections reach that steady state and only the materialization of a shock (unpredictable, so it is not possible to project when it will happen) would cause a deviation.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that in a period of 5 years, the macroeconomic variables projection would already be at a level very close to their equilibrium, since historically the maximum periods of consecutive deviation above or below the longterm trend (more or less 0.25 standard deviations of the variable) of the economic cycle (from the series of annual economic growth in the period 1972-2020) has been precisely a period of 5 years. With the current projections as of December 31, 2021,  although  the  economic  shock  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  was  of  unprecedented  magnitude,  the  subsequent economic recovery has also occurred at an unprecedented speed, so the scenario that incorporates the figures for the fifth year of the projection proposes records very close to the long-term levels of the variables and allows this assumption to remain valid.\n\n## Economic scenario weightings\n\nTo incorporate  not  only  a  perspective,  but  also  to  recognize  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  short  and  medium-term economic context that the country will experience, the projection work incorporates three scenarios: base, optimistic and pessimistic.\n\nIt  is  intended  that  each  perspective  contain  reasonable  expectations  and  that  each  has  a  relevant  level  of  probability associated with it. In other words, we seek to formulate possible, not extreme, scenarios. Due to economic events and risks related to COVID-19, at the closure of 2020 the economic scenario weightings were as follows: base scenario with a weighting of 60.00%, pessimistic scenario with a weighting of 30.00%, and finally optimistic scenario with a weighting of 10.00%. In 2021, the scenarios are weighted as follows:",

Since the shock generated by the pandemic led to a severe deterioration of real and financial variables, probabilities assigned to economic scenarios were adjusted in order to incorporate a higher likelihood of negative outcomes.\n\nHowever,  at  the  end  of  2021,  economic  conditions  have  improved  substantially.  Indeed,  the  recovery  of  productive activities has far exceeded the estimates made at the beginning of 2021. This has been possible thanks to the progress of vaccination plans, the deployment of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures, the rebound in private consumption, job recovery and the good performance of the financial sector. Thus, for 2021 the OECD estimates global GDP growth of 5.6%, while for Colombia the projection is 10%. Such figures would indicate that at the end of 2021, both the world economy and the Colombian economy would be larger than they were before the pandemic. In addition, the most recent perspectives suggest that from 2023 growth rates in the world would converge to the levels observed before COVID-19.\n\nIn accordance with the above, one of the main impacts on the provision is the update of the macroeconomic scenarios. The Bank implemented the following measures on the macroeconomic series generated by COVID-19.\n\n## Measures applied in 2021:\n\n- 1. On December 31, 2021 the moving averages explained below were eliminated.\n- 2. To mitigate excessively procyclical assumptions when determining the provisions caused by the volatility of the macroeconomic forecasts, the Bank used a temporary adjustment to the allowance as a single non-recurring event in  the  ECL  measurement  process  associated  with  the  mid-term  macroeconomic  forecasts  stabilization  in Colombia due to the smoothing of the macroeconomic variables. This analysis is based on the review of the strong contraction and recovery of macroeconomic variables during 2020 and 2021 and led to the constitution of COP 536,517 as an Overlay or additional provision which will be evaluated in the course of 2022.\n\n## Measures applied in 2020:\n\nA moving average of the macroeconomic variables was performed by the Bank, following the recommendations made by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), in order to consider the guidelines issued by international regulators regarding  the  application  of  the  IFRS  9  standard  in  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  as  a  means  to  mitigate excessively  procyclical  assumptions  when  determining  the  provisions  caused  by  the  volatility  of  the  macroeconomic forecasts that result in the constitution of significant allowances for loans followed by releases of allowances for loans in comparable magnitudes.\n\nThe two forms of moving average used were a seven -and thirteen-month window centered on the month of analysis. Thus, the new softened economic series will be for each month the average of the previous three or six months, of the current month and that of the following three or six months. These moving averages levels will be denoted \"3-1-3\" and \"6-1-6\", respectively.\n\nBelow were the moving averages applied to each geography in:\n\n- \u00b7 Panama: 6-1-6 moving averages.\n- \u00b7 Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala: 3-1-3 moving averages.",

guarantee, the amount of the loss is estimated as the balance owed minus the weighted net present value of the market value of the collateral, estimated through appraisals with an age no longer than one year, minus the costs of obtaining, maintaining and selling the collateral, and affected by several macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence that result in a weighted expected loss.\n\n## Individual methodology\n\nThe Bank will individually evaluate defaulted loans (stage 3) greater than COP 15,000 or USD 5 millions for foreign subsidiaries, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, the guarantees granted and information on the credit behavior of the client and of the sector. Significant financial assets are considered in default when, based on current or past information and events, it is probable that the entity will not be able to recover all the amounts described in the original contract, including the interest and commissions agreed to in the contract. When a significant financial asset has been identified as being in default, the amount of the loss is measured as the balance due minus the weighted net present value of the expected future cash flows under two minimum macroeconomic scenarios with an expected probability of occurrence.\n\nCustomers classified as individual  methodology will be evaluated at least twice a year and, additionally, each time a relevant event occurs that reflects in significant changes in their level of risk and that leads to a change in the scenarios previously analyzed. The relevant events can be:\n\n- \u00b7 Significant changes in the value of the guarantee,\n- \u00b7 Expected or adverse changes in the business,\n- \u00b7 Potentially shocking regulatory changes for the business,",

The loan restructuring is implemented through amendments to the contractual terms, resulting in changes of rates and payment terms. However, at the time of restructuring, the Bank seeks to retain and enhance the collateral available if possible.\n\nIn a restructuring, real and personal property can be received as foreclosed assets in partial cancellation of the receivables. The terms are reviewed in each negotiation to determine if the client should continue in the portfolio and, if so, the terms to restore the business relationship after a certain time.\n\nRestructuring  due  to  a  customer's  credit  risk  difficulties  is  typically  assessed  as  a  non-substantial  modification  and therefore  does  not  lead  to  derecognition.  When  a  financial  asset  is  restructured,  the  difference  between  the  original contractual cash flow and the new cash flow of the restructured asset discounted at the original effective interest rate is recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of income as 'Interest income on loan and financial leases', and the costs and fees are deferred and will be amortized by the remaining life of the modified asset.\n\n## Modifications\n\nFor other modifications that do not address credit risk, the Bank assesses whether the modification is substantial, given the  fact  that  the  changes  in  contractual  terms  differ  substantially  from  the  original  contract,  based  on  the  analysis  of qualitative variables (including returns based on profit sharing, guarantees, other collateral, or credit enhancements that significantly affect the credit risk profile associated with the loan, changes in currency and/or debtor) and quantitative assessments in some cases. When the modifications result in a derecognition, the renegotiated contract is a new loan and the  impairment  is  evaluated  in  accordance  with  the  Bank's  risk  policy,  initially  recognizing  the  loan  in  stage  1  and evaluating the significant increases in credit risk from the date of modification onwards. Likewise, the costs and fees are written  off,  which  are  recognized  immediately  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income.  New  credit-impaired  loans purchased or originated are not recognized.\n\nModifications that do not result in derecognition are assessed as non-substantial modifications, and the carrying amount is  recalculated  as  the  present  value  of  the  modified  contractual  cash  flows  discounted  at  the  original  interest  rate, recognizing the effect of modification in the consolidated statement of income as 'Interest income on loans and financial leases'. Similarly, costs and fees are deferred and will be amortized for the remaining life of the modified asset.\n\nFor further information about the relief provided by the Bank to company and individual customers and the impact on provisions for impairment of financial assets, see section E. Use of estimates and judgments, paragraph 10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other relevant issues on the Bank's judgements and estimates, set out below and Note 31. Risk management.\n\n## 7.4.7 Leases\n\n## 7.4.7.1 The Bank as lessee\n\nOn entering a new lease contract, the Bank recognizes a right-of-use asset and a liability. Both the right-of-use asset and the  lease  liability  are  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  remaining  lease  payments,  discounted  using  the  lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Additionally, the right-of-use asset includes 1) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability; 2) lease payments made, or costs incurred by the lessee at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; and 3) costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the contract.",

        "page_content": "Subsequently, the Bank measures the right-of-use asset at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The Bank measures the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made, and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any new expectation or lease modifications. Each lease payment has been allocated between the liability and interest expenses. The accrued interest on the lease liability for each period over the lease term will be the amount that produces a constant periodic rate of interest (incremental borrowing rate) on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\n\nThe Bank does not recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for 1) leases for a period of less than 12 months that do not contain a purchase option; and 2) leases in which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments related to these exemptions are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## 7.4.7.2 The Bank as lessor\n\nThe lease agreements entered into by the Bank are classified at the initial recognition as financial or operating leases.\n\nThe Bank classifies a lease as a financial lease when according to the agreement substantially all the inherent risks and benefits are transferred to the lessee. Financial leases are recognized as the sum of the minimum payments to be received and any unguaranteed residual value, discounted at the lease interest rate. Otherwise, the lease is classified as an operating lease, which is classified in the consolidated statement of financial position as premises and equipment or investment property. The initial direct costs incurred in the negotiation of an operating lease are added to the carrying value of the leased assets and recorded as a cost during the lease term on the same basis as the lease income. The contingent rents of the leases are recorded as income in the period in which they are obtained.\n\nAmong the risks transferred are the possibilities of losses through underutilization, technological obsolescence, decrease in profitability or changes in the economic environment. Among the benefits derived from the use are the expectation of profit over the economic life of the asset and eventually, the appreciation of the changes of its residual value or realization of the asset.\n\nThe following are indications of transfer of risk and rewards of ownership to the lessee:\n\n- \u00b7 The agreement indicates that the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be equal to or less than 10% of the fair value of the asset, upon termination of the lease.\n- \u00b7 The term of the lease covers most of the economic life of the asset, even when the lease does not transfer  the ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the end of the lease term, i.e., when the minimum lease term represents 75% or more of the economic life of the leased asset.\n- \u00b7 At the inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least 90% of the fair value of the leased asset.\n- \u00b7 The leased assets are of such a specialized nature that only the lessee has the possibility of using them without making significant modifications.\n\nIf during the lease term, the lessor and the lessee decide to modify the initial conditions, and the agreed changes result in a different classification, then the modified agreement will be considered a new lease with new clauses that will lead to the classification of a financial or operating lease, as appropriate.\n\n## 7.5. Financial liabilities\n\nAt  initial  recognition,  the  Bank  measures  its  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value.  The  transaction  costs  that  are  directly attributable to the financial liability are deducted from its fair value if the  instruments are subsequently recognized at amortized cost or will be recognized in the consolidated statement of income if the liabilities are measured at fair value.\n\nDerivative liabilities are measured at fair value through profit and loss and the gains  or losses of those liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statement of income for subsequent measurements. Non-derivative financial liabilities are",

Interest expenses are recognized in the consolidated statement of income unless the financial liability is designated as at fair value through profit or loss, for which it is required to present the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income.\n\n## 7.5.1 Compound instruments\n\nCompound financial instruments  that  are  comprised  of  both  a  liability  and  equity  component  must  be  separated  and accounted for separately. Therefore, for initial measurement, the liability component is the fair value of a similar liability which doesn't have an equity component (determined by discounting future cash flows using the market rate at the date of the issuance). The difference between the fair value of the liability component and the fair value of the compound financial instrument, considered as a whole, is the residual value assigned to the equity component. After initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity  component  of  a  compound  financial  instrument  is  not  re-measured  subsequent  to  initial  recognition.  The liability component corresponds to the preferred dividend related to 1% of the subscription price, which is the payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares for each period in accordance with the Bank's bylaws.\n\n## 7.5.2 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nIn order to meet the needs of its customers, the Bank issues financial standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and loan commitments. Loan commitments are those agreements under which the Bank has an irrevocable obligation to grant the loan. The financial guarantee contracts issued by the Bank are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due to accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nBoth financial  guarantee  contracts  and  loan  commitments are  initially  recognized  as  liabilities  at  fair  value,  which  is normally the fee received, adjusted for the directly attributable transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, liabilities are measured at the higher of the provision amount measured according to IFRS 9, and the amount initially recognized, less the accumulated amortization recognized according to IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nIncome derived from guarantees is recognized as fees and commission income in the consolidated statement of income over the term of the contract, in accordance with the method and frequency of commission's payments.\n\n## 7.6 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred, and the Bank has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or when the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership but it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nOn  derecognition  of  a  financial  asset,  the  difference  between  (a)  the  carrying  amount  (measured  at  the  date  of derecognition) and (b) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) is recognized in net income.\n\nIn transactions in which the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset, the Bank continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred financial asset.\n\nA financial liability is removed from the consolidated statement of financial position when it is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## Debt exchange\n\nThe Bank assesses whether the instruments subject to exchange are substantially different from each other, considering qualitative aspects such as currencies, terms, rates, conditions of subordination, regulatory framework, among others; and",

In this case, the amortized cost of the modified liability is adjusted to the present value of the estimated contractual cash flows which are discounted at the original effective interest rate of the financial instrument, and a gain or loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Incremental costs and commissions adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortized over the remaining life of the modified liability; its subsequent measurement  continues  at  amortized  cost.  In  debt  exchanges  where  the  new  instrument  is  considered  substantially different, the liability is derecognized against the consolidated statement of income, and a new financial liability arises.\n\n## 7.6.1 Written-Off loan portfolio\n\nLoans are written off when the Bank concludes there is no realistic expectation of recovery of the loans and receivables balances  from  a  client  or  third  party.

When default conditions are present, it is initially necessary to evaluate whether the collateral that supports the loan generates a reasonable expectation of recovery; if so, the necessary steps are taken to realize on the collateral prior to writing-off the loan. In cases where the collateral net fair value indicates that there are no reasonable expectations of recovery, loans are written-off in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 7.7. Derivatives financial instruments\n\nA financial derivative is an instrument whose value changes in response to changes in a variable such as an interest rate, exchange rate, the price of a financial instrument, a credit rating or a credit index. This instrument requires no initial payment, or a smaller investment than would be required for other financial instruments with a similar response to changes in market conditions, and it is generally settled at a future date. The Bank recognizes its derivatives financial instruments at fair value based on the prices and methodologies provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia). Counterparty credit-risk adjustments are applied to derivatives when the Bank's position is a derivative asset and the Bank's credit risk is incorporated when the position is a derivative liability. For further information, see Note 30. Fair value of assets and liabilities, section d. Credit valuation adjustment.\n\nThe Bank carries out derivative transactions to facilitate the business of clients related to the Management of their market and credit risk, managing the exposure in its own position to changes in interest rates and risks in exchange rates, or to obtain benefits from changes in valuations experienced by these instruments in the market. Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value through profit or loss, unless such derivatives are designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges or as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. In those cases, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in other comprehensive income. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.",

        "page_content": "## 7.7.1 Hedge accounting\n\nFair value hedges are used by the Bank, through its Panamanian subsidiary, Banistmo, to protect against changes in the fair  value  of  investment  securities  that  are  attributable  to  interest  rate  variability.  When  the  hedging  relationship  is considered to be highly effective, the changes in value of the hedging derivative are accounted for according to their classification, as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of net investment in foreign operations, as set out in the paragraph below.\n\nThe Bank assesses at the inception of the hedge and on a monthly basis during the life of the instrument, whether the hedge used in the transaction is expected to be aligned with the hedge effectiveness requirement (prospective effectiveness):\n\n- \u00b7 Economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\n- \u00b7 The effect of credit risk does not predominate over the value of the economic relationship.\n- \u00b7 Designated hedge ratio is consistent with risk management strategy.\n\nThe Bank discontinues the hedge accounting when the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria provided for hedge effectiveness or when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. Consequently, the item no longer complies with the hedge accounting conditions or the hedging relationship no longer complies with the risk management objective. When hedge accounting for a fair value hedge is terminated, the previous adjustments related to the changes in fair value of the hedged item are subsequently recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the same manner as other components of the carrying amount of that asset. When hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge is terminated, the accumulated gains and losses recorded in equity will be reclassified to the consolidated statement of income in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows are realized.\n\nBefore the establishment of hedge accounting, the Bank documents the relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments, as well as its risk management objectives and hedging strategies, which are approved by the Risk Management Committee as the body designated by the Board of Directors.\n\nHedge relationships are classified and accounted for in the following ways:\n\nFair value hedges are  designated to protect against the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or unrecognized firm commitments.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments in fair value hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as interest and valuation on financial instruments. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is included as part of the carrying value of the hedged item, and it is also recognized in the aforementioned item of the consolidated statement of income.\n\nFor fair value hedges that are related to items accounted for at amortized cost, the adjustments to the carrying value are amortized through the consolidated statement of income during the remaining term until their expiry.\n\nThe amortization of the effective interest rate shall begin as long as there is an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged  item  and  shall  begin  no  later  than  when  the  hedged  item  ceases  to  be  adjusted  for  changes  in  its  fair  value attributable  to  the  risk  being  hedged.  The  adjustment  is  based  on  a  recalculated  effective  interest  rate  at  the  date amortization begins. If the hedged item is derecognized, the non-amortized fair value is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income. If the hedge instrument expires or it is sold, terminated or exercised, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the Bank discontinues prospectively the hedge accounting. For the items hedged at amortized cost, the difference between the carrying value of the item hedged at the termination of the hedge and the nominal value are amortized using the effective rate method during the time beyond the original terms of the hedge. If the hedged item is derecognized, the remaining value to amortize is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income.",

The  ineffective  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging  instrument  is  recognized  in  the consolidated statement of income.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, without replacement or rollover into another hedging instrument, or if the hedging designation no longer meets the criteria provided for the hedge effectiveness requirements after any subsequent rebalancing adjustment, any accumulated gain or loss previously recognized in OCI remains in OCI, until the planned operation or the firm commitment affects the result.\n\nThe Bank ceases hedge accounting when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the objective of managing the hedged risk when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or  when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized in other comprehensive income when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in net income.

The hedge accounting requires that the Bank accounts for the gain or loss derived from the foreign exchange differences related to the debt securities that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income, as is the currency translation adjustment of the Banistmo operation into the presentation currency as required by IAS 21 Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates as detailed in 2.

However, the fair value of the financial asset or financial liability can be different from the transaction price at initial recognition. When the amounts are not equal, the asset or liability should be measured at fair value and the difference between the transaction price and fair value is required to be recognized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 If  the  fair  value  is  assessed  as  Level  1  based  on  the  inputs  or  the  valuation  technique  uses  only  data  from observable markets, therefore Bank recognizes the difference as a gain or loss on initial recognition.\n- \u00b7 In all other circumstances, the Bank defers day one gain or loss recognition in the consolidated statement of income over the life of the transaction.\n\n## 8. Premises and equipment\n\nPremises and equipment include tangible items that are held for use, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and are expected to be used for more than one period.\n\nItems of premises and equipment are expressed at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

The estimated useful lives for each asset group are:\n\n| Asset group                 | Useful life range   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Buildings                   | 10 to 75 years      |\n| Furniture and fixtures  (1) | 5 to 20 years       |\n| Computer equipment          | 3 to 20 years       |\n| Equipment and machinery     | 3 to 40 years       |\n| Vehicles                    | 3 to 6 years        |\n\nThe asset's residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. When there is a significant change, the depreciation and the charge to the consolidated statement of income are adjusted based on the new estimation.\n\nThe Bank assesses at the end of each year whether there is any indication of external or internal reduction in the asset's recoverable value. If there is any indication of impairment, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of the assets and then recognizes the impairment loss in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount and is recognized in the consolidated statement of income as 'Impairment, depreciation and amortization'.\n\nWhen the carrying value exceeds the recoverable value (the greater of fair value less the costs of sale and value in use), the carrying value is adjusted to its recoverable value, modifying the future charges for depreciation, according to its new remaining useful life.\n\nIn a similar way, when indications exist that the value of an asset has been recovered, reversal of an impairment loss is recognized  immediately  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  and  consequently  the  future  charges  for  the  asset's depreciation are adjusted. In any case, the reversal of the impairment loss of assets cannot increase it carrying value above the amount that it would have if impairment losses in previous periods had not been recognized.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the smallest identifiable group that generates cash inflows that  are  largely  independent  of  the  cash  inflows  from  other  assets  or  groups  of  assets  (cash-generating  units).  The evaluation can be carried out at the individual asset level when the fair value less the cost of sale can be reliably determined and the value in use is estimated to be close to its fair value less costs to sell and fair value less costs to sell can be determined.\n\nMaintenance expenses of the premises and equipment are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred and are registered in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other administrative and general expenses'.\n\nGains and losses in the sale of premises and equipment are registered in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating income' or 'Other operating expenses'.\n\n## 9. Investment properties\n\nLand and buildings that the Bank holds to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both rather than for their use in the supply of services or sale in the ordinary course of business are recognized as investment properties.\n\nThe investment properties are measured initially at cost, including the transaction costs. The carrying value includes the cost of replacement or substitution of a part of an investment property at the time the cost is incurred, if the cost meets the recognition criteria; and it excludes the daily maintenance costs of the investment property which are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating expenses'.",

        "page_content": "After the initial recognition, the investment properties are measured at fair value which reflects the market conditions at the consolidated statement of financial position date and are valued by external experts using valuation techniques based on comparable prices, direct capitalization, discounted cash flows and replacement cost. The gains and losses that arise from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating income'.\n\nThe  investment  properties  are  derecognized,  either  at  the  moment  of  their  disposal  or  when  they  are  permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of the investment properties and the carrying value is recognized in net income in the period the disposal occurs.\n\nTransfers of an asset to or from the investment properties are only made when there is a change in its use. For a transfer from an investment property to premises and equipment, the cost taken into account for its subsequent accounting is the fair value at the time of the change in use. If a premise and equipment becomes an investment property, it will be accounted for at its fair value.\n\n## 10. Intangible assets\n\nAn intangible asset is an  identifiable non-monetary asset with no physical appearance. Separately acquired intangible assets are measured initially at their cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in business combinations is their fair value at the date of acquisition. After the initial recognition, the intangible assets are accounted for at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment loss. The costs of internally generated intangible assets, excluding the costs from development that meet the recognition criteria, are not capitalized and the expense is reflected in the consolidated statement of income as it is incurred.\n\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are determined as finite or indefinite. The intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The amortization period and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at least annually. The expected changes in the useful life or in the pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits of the asset are accounted for when changing the period or amortization method, as appropriate, and they are treated as changes in the accounting estimates. The amortization expense of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. The useful lives of the intangible assets with finite life ranges between 1 and 10 years.\n\nWhen intangible assets with finite useful life are written-off, the expected future economic benefits period is reduced to increase the amount of amortization, resulting in the derecognition of the intangible asset in a shorter period than initially estimated.\n\nThe Bank assesses annually its intangible assets with finite life in order to identify whether any indications of impairment exist, as well as possible reversal of previous impairment losses.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization but are periodically tested to identify any impairment, either individually  or  at  the  cash-generating  unit  level.  The  assessment  of  the  indefinite  life  is  reviewed annually to determine if it continues being supportable. In the event that the assessment was not valid, the change from indefinite useful life to finite useful life is recognized prospectively.\n\nThe gain or loss that arises when an intangible asset is derecognized is measured as the difference between the disposal value and the carrying value of the asset and is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe Bank's intangible assets comprise mainly intangibles of finite useful life: licenses, software and computer applications, customer relationships and trademarks (See Note 9. Goodwill and intangible assets, net). Intangibles of indefinite useful life include Goodwill.\n\nFor  further  information  on  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  see  section  E.

For further details of this transaction, see Note 9.3. Business combination.\n\n## 10.1 Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs are recorded as expenses as they are incurred.\n\nCosts directly related to the development of a stand-alone project are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;\n- \u00b7 Management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;\n- \u00b7 There is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- \u00b7 It can be demonstrated how the asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n- \u00b7 Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available; and\n- \u00b7 The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured.\n\nIn  the  consolidated  statement of financial position, the related capitalized costs are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nCosts are capitalized during the application development stage and amortized on a straight-line basis from the beginning of the production stage over the period of expected future economic benefits. During the development period, the asset is subjected  to  impairment  testing  at  least  annually  to  determine  if  impairment  indications  exist.  The  research  and development costs that do not qualify for capitalization are recorded as expenses in the consolidated statement of income of the period (see item 13. Impairment of non-financial assets and cash-generating units and goodwill, set below).\n\n## 11.  Inventories\n\nThe inventories of returned property are those assets that come from an early termination of a lease (returned properties) or those upon which the lease has already concluded (premises and equipment), which are expected to be sold in the normal course of business. These are controlled by the Bank and are expected to generate future economic benefits.\n\nThe inventories of returned property are recognized as an asset from the date on which the Bank assumes the risks and benefits of the inventories, provided that the cost of the asset can be reliably measured, and it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits.\n\nThe inventories of returned property are valued using the specific identification method and their costs include the carrying value at the time the asset is returned.\n\nThe carrying value of returned property is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV). The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to sell. The adjustment in the carrying value to reflect the NRV is recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the period in which the goods are returned. The value of any reversion that comes from an increase in the NRV in which the increase occurs is recognized as a lower expense in the period.\n\nOther new inventories are measured initially at acquisition cost which comprises the sum of the purchase price, the import costs (if applicable), the non-recoverable taxes paid, the storage, the transport costs, and other attributable or necessary costs for their acquisition, less discounts, reductions or similar items. Those inventories do not include selling costs.\n\nThe Bank must review the NRV of its inventories at least annually or whenever necessary if indicated by market conditions. Any write-down adjustment must be recognized directly in the consolidated statement of income.",

Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nA non-current asset or a disposal group of assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use. These assets or groups of assets are shown separately in the consolidated statement of financial position at the lower of their carrying value and their fair value less costs to sell and they are not depreciated nor amortized from the date of their classification.\n\nThe held for sale condition is met if the assets or group of assets are available, in their current condition, for immediate sale and the sale transaction is highly probable and is expected to be completed within the year following the date of classification.\n\nThe Bank performs the measurement of the assets held for sale at the consolidated statement of financial position date. However,  these  assets  are  evaluated  quarterly  if  impairment  indicators  exist  that  imply  review  of  the  carrying  value recorded in the accounts. If those indications are identified, impairment losses are recognized for the difference between the  carrying  and  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  as  'Impairment,  depreciation  and  amortization'  in  the  consolidated statement of income.\n\nGains and losses in the sale of premises and equipment are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as 'Other operating income' or 'Other operating expenses'.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and represents  a  separate  major  line  of  business  or  a  geographical  area  of  operations,  is  part  of  a  single  coordinated  and individual plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nIncome  and  expenses  coming  from  a  discontinued  operation  must  be  disclosed  separately  from  those  coming  from continued operations, in a single item after the income tax, in the consolidated statement of income of the current period and comparatively with previous period even though the Bank retains a non-controlling interest in the subsidiary after the sale.\n\nManagement has developed quantitative thresholds such as 'rules of thumb' to determine the materiality of major line of business.  In  the  absence  of  particular  standards,  a  line  of  business  below  the  threshold  of  5%  of  net  assets  in  the consolidated statement of financial position is not considered material.\n\n## 13.  Impairment of non-financial assets and cash-generating units and goodwill\n\nThe Bank evaluates at the end of each period whether there is any indication that on a stand-alone basis non-financial assets  and  cash-generating  units  are  impaired.  If  some  indication  of  impairment  does  exist,  the  Bank  estimates  the recoverable amount of the assets and the loss by impairment, the impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the  carrying  amount  of  the  cash  generating  unit  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount.  Regardless  of  whether  impairment indicators exist, impairment of goodwill is assessed annually.\n\nThe recoverable amount is determined by Management by reference to market value, if available, by pricing models, or with  the  assistance  of  a  valuation  specialist.  Determination  of  the  recoverable  amount  requires  Management  to  make assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flow for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment of the appropriate discount rate and growth rate, estimation of the recoverable amount of cash generation units and the valuation of the separable assets of each business whose goodwill is being reviewed.\n\nIf an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from the rest of the assets or group of assets, the recoverable amount is determined by the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nA cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.",

Other assets\n\nThe Bank presents as other assets, among other things, (a) the expenses paid in advance incurred in the development of its business, in order to receive future services, which are amortized during the period in which services are received or the costs or expenses are recorded and (b) foreclosed assets that do not comply with the requirements to be recognized as assets held for sale and where there are no plans to use them in the supply of services or for administrative purposes.\n\nForeclosed assets are  initially  recognized  at  the  lower  of  net  amount  of  the  charged-off  financial  assets  to  which  the foreclosed assets relate and net realizable value of the foreclosed asset (the net realizable value will be the estimated selling price of the asset or its awarding value, less the estimated costs necessary to carry out its sale), pending obtaining a plan for  its  commercialization.  If  net  amount  of  the  charged-off  financial  assets  is  greater  than  net  realizable  value  of  the foreclosed asset, an adjustment for impairment of credit risk of the financial asset is recorded in the results for the period.\n\nThere is evidence of impairment when these group of assets remain in the consolidated statement of financial position for a period of time exceeding one year from the reception date, without buyer having been found, despite the Bank's ongoing efforts to sell them (even adjusting the selling price).\n\nForeclosed assets are subsequently assessed to determine whether an impairment lost must be recognized. In the case of events that arise that are beyond the control of the Bank and that make remote the realization of these assets, they are identified as \"non-tradable\" and a complete impairment is carried out.\n\n## 15.  Employee benefits\n\n## 15.1 Short term benefits\n\nThe Bank grants to its employees short-term benefits such as bonuses based on added value to clients and the Bank's results (which was suspended for the year 2020), salaries, accrued performance costs and social security that are expected to be wholly settled within 12 months. Expenses related to these benefits are recognized over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate. For further information, see Note 19. Employee benefit plans.\n\n## 15.2 Other long-term employee benefits\n\nThe Bank grants to its employees seniority bonuses as long-term employee benefits whose payment is not expected within the 12 months following the end of the annual period in which the employees have rendered their services. These benefits are projected up to the date of payment and are discounted through the projected unit credit method. The cost of long-term employee benefits is allocated across the period from the time the employee was hired by the Bank and the expected date of obtaining the benefit.\n\n## 15.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\n## -Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Bank makes monthly contributions to pension funds, due to legal requirements and it has no legal obligation to pay further contributions.\n\nThe  Bank  recognizes  contributions  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  once  the  contribution  is  accrued.  Any contributions unpaid at the consolidated statement of financial position date are included as a liability.",

The Bank makes an actuarial valuation based on the projected unit credit method and a risk-free rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money in each country, related to the characteristics and the benefit flows weighted average, to discount such obligation.\n\n## 16.  Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nProvisions are recorded when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nProvisions are determined by Management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  which  estimate  is  discounted  using  a  risk-free  rate  which  reflects  current  market assessments of the time value of money in each country, which for Colombia is the interest rate on treasury bonds (TES)1. The corresponding expense of any provision is recorded in the consolidated statement of income, as a provision, net of all expected reimbursement. The increase of the provision due to the time value of money is recognized as a financial expense.\n\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position, correspond mainly to:\n\n- -Provisions for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts; and\n- -Provisions for legal proceedings, classified as probable to be decided against the Bank.\n\nPossible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events, not wholly within the control of the Bank, or present obligations that arise from past events but are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations or the amount of the obligations cannot be measured with sufficient reliability, are not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position, but instead are disclosed as contingent liabilities,  unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote, in which case no disclosure is required.\n\nPossible assets that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, not wholly within the control of the Bank, are not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position; instead, these are disclosed as contingent assets where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.  When  the  realization  of  income  is  virtually  certain,  then  the  related  asset  is  not  a  contingent  asset  and  its recognition is appropriate.\n\n## 17.  Customer loyalty program\n\nThe Bank maintains a credit card loyalty program to provide incentives to its customers. The program allows customers to purchase goods and services, based on the exchange of awards points, which are awarded based on purchases using the Bank's credit cards and the fulfillment of certain conditions established in such program. The redemption of points for prizes is carried out by a third party. According to IFRS 15, the expenses of the Bank's commitments with its clients arising from this program are recognized as a lower value of the fees and commission income, considering the total number of points that can be redeemed over the accumulated prizes and taking into account the probability of redemptions.",

Revenue recognition\n\nThe Bank recognizes revenue from ordinary activities, which represent the transfer of goods or services committed with customers in exchange for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such assets or services. The recognition and measurement of interest income and dividend income from debt and equity instruments are not within the scope of IFRS 15. Instead, they are within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nThe Bank evaluates the contracts and commitments established with customers, identifying compliance with the five steps established in IFRS 15 as follows:\n\n- 1. Identifying  the  contract:  The  parties'  rights,  payment  conditions,  evaluation  of  the  commercial  basis  and characteristics  of  the  consideration  are  identified,  and  the  Bank  evaluates  if  there  are  modifications  or combinations that apply.\n- 2. Identifying performance obligations: The Bank evaluates the commitments included in the entity's contracts to identify when the customer makes use of the service and whether the obligations are identifiable separately.\n- 3. Determining  the  transaction  price:  The  characteristics  of  the  amounts  for  which  the  agreed  services  were exchanged are reviewed in the Bank's contracts, to estimate the effect of variable consideration in kind, or others payable to the customer.\n- 4. Allocating the transaction price to performance obligations: In the evaluation of prices under the Bank's contracts, these are allocated individually to the services provided by the Bank, even for products where there are packaged commitments.\n- 5. Satisfaction of performance obligations: The obligations established in contracts with customers are satisfied when the control of the service is transferred to the customer and the recognition is performed as established in IFRS 15, over time or at a point in time.\n\nThe Bank satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\n- a) The Bank's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use for the entity, and it has an enforceable right to receive payment for the performance completed to date.\n- b) The Bank's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced.\n- c) The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Bank's performance as the Bank performs.\n\nFor  performance  obligations  where  none  of  the  indicated  conditions  is  fulfilled,  the  Bank  satisfies  the  performance obligation at a point in time, at which the customer obtains control of the promised services and the entity satisfies a performance obligation.  When  the  Bank  fulfills  a  performance  obligation  through  the  delivery  of  promised  goods  or services, it creates a contractual asset for the consideration amount obtained with the performance.\n\nA contract asset is the right of the Bank to receive a payment in exchange for goods or services that the Bank has transferred to a customer, when that right is dependent on something other than the passage of time (for example, billing or delivery of other elements part of the contract). The Bank recognizes the contractual assets as current assets, as they are expected to be realized within the normal operating cycle.\n\nThe  costs  of  contracts  eligible  for  capitalization  as  incremental  costs  when  obtaining  a  contract  are  recognized  as  a contractual asset. Contractual costs are capitalized when incurred if the Bank expects to recover those costs. Contractual costs constitute non-current assets to the extent that the Bank expects to receive the economic benefits of those assets in a period greater than twelve months. The contractual costs are amortized systematically and consistently with the transfer of the services to the customer once the corresponding revenue has been recognized. The capitalized contractual costs are impaired if the customer withdraws or if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projection of the discounted cash flows that are related to the contract.",

Contract liabilities constitute the Bank's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer, for which the Bank has received a payment from the end customer or if the amount is past due. They also include deferred income related to goods or services that shall be delivered or provided in the future, which will be billed to the customer in advance, but which are not yet past due.\n\nRevenue  is  measured  based  on  the  consideration  specified  in  the  contract  with  the  customer,  and  excludes  amounts received on behalf of third parties when the Bank is an agent. The Bank recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a customer. Revenue is presented net of reimbursements and discounts and after eliminating intergroup sales. The Bank evaluates its revenue categories based on specific criteria to determine whether it acts as principal or agent. Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Bank and it is possible to reliably measure the related revenues and costs.\n\n## 18.1.  Interest income and expenses\n\nFor all financial instruments measured at amortized cost, interest income and interest expenses are recognized using the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts future estimated cash flows payments through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying value of the financial liability or asset. The computation takes into account all the contractual conditions of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes incremental fees or expenses that are directly attributed to the instrument and are an integral part of the Effective Interest Rate (EIR), but not future credit losses.\n\nFor debt securities  at  fair  value,  gains  and  losses  arising  from  changes  in  fair  value  are  included  in  the  consolidated statement of income as 'Interest and valuation on financial instruments'.\n\n## 18.2.  Fees and commission income\n\nThe Bank charges fees for the services it provides to its customers. Fee income can be divided into the following three categories:\n\n## Income from fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument\n\nCommissions for loan commitments that have a high probability of being used are deferred (together with any incremental cost) via the effective interest rate, once the loan is granted (in accordance with section 18.1). If the commitment expires and no loan is made, the fee is recognized as income at the time of termination.\n\nThe opening fees received for the issuance of a financial liability measured at amortized cost are included in the effective interest rate of the financial instrument and its recognition as income is generated during the estimated life of the asset.\n\n## Income from fees obtained from the services that are provided during a certain period of time\n\nThese payments include income from commissions and asset management, custody and other administration and advisory commissions. In loan commitments, when it is not possible to demonstrate the probability that a loan will be used, the opening fees of the loan are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as revenue from ordinary activities, in accordance with IFRS 15, and are recognized based on the past due and the frequency of fee payment.\n\n## Income from the provision of services\n\nFees arising from the negotiation or participation in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party, such as the acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses, are recognized at the closing of the underlying transaction. Commissions or fee components that are linked to a specified performance are recognized after the corresponding criteria are met.",

Income tax\n\nThe Bank recognizes, when appropriate, deferred tax assets and liabilities by estimating the future tax effects attributable to differences between book values of assets, liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rate that, in accordance with the valid tax laws in each country where the Bank has operations, must be applied in the year in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The future effects of changes in tax laws or tax rates are recognized in the deferred taxes as from the date of publication of the law providing for such changes.\n\nTax bases for deferred tax must be calculated by factoring in the definition of IAS 12 Income tax and the value of the assets and liabilities that will be realized or settled in the future according to the valid tax laws of each of the countries where the Bank has operations.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities due to deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiary and associated entities  or  shares  in  joint  ventures,  are  recognized,  except  when  the  Bank  is  able  to  control  the  period  in  which  the deductible  temporary  difference  is  reverted,  and  it  is  likely  that  the  temporary  difference  will  not  be  reverted  in  the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets, identified with temporary differences, are only recognized if it is considered likely that the Bank will have sufficient taxable income in the future that allows it to be recovered based on the stand-alone entity expected cash flow forecast for the next three years.\n\nTax credit from fiscal losses and surplus amounts from the presumptive income on the net income are recognized as a deferred asset, provided that it is likely that the Bank will generate future net income to allow their offset.\n\nThe deferred tax is recorded as debit or credit according to the result of each of the companies that form the Bank, and for the purpose of disclosure on the consolidated statement of financial position it is disclosed as net.\n\nThe deferred tax expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of income under the heading 'Income tax', except when referring to amounts directly recognized in OCI (Other Comprehensive Income).\n\nRegulatory changes in tax laws and in tax rates are recognized in the consolidated statement of income under the heading 'Income Tax' in the period when such rule becomes enforceable. Interest and fines are recognized in the consolidated statement of income under the other administrative and general expenses.\n\nThe Bank periodically assesses the tax positions adopted in tax returns, and, according to the results of the tax audits conducted by the tax authorities, determines possible tax outcomes provided it has a present obligation and it is more likely than not that the Bank will have to dispose of the economic resources to cancel the obligation, and the Bank can make an accurate  estimate  of  the  amount  of  the  obligation.  The  recorded  sums  are  based  on  the  estimated  fair  amount  that  is expected to cover the amount expected to be paid in the future. In 2021, the value of the uncertain tax position in Colombia was recovered, considering that the tax returns on which it was based were final in the course of the same year and no glosses were received from the Direcci\u00f3n de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales ('DIAN') on these aspects.",

For further information about deferred tax considerations derived from the last Colombian tax reform (Law 2155 of 2021), see Note 12. Income Tax.\n\n## Transfer pricing policy\n\nThe  Bank  has  as  a  general  policy  that  each  of  its  companies  be  responsible  for  their  income,  costs  and  expenses independently. The policy takes into account the regulation for the parent company provided for in the Organic Statute of the Financial System (article 119, numeral 4) which in relation to the autonomy of the subsidiaries states that: The activity of  the  subsidiaries  of  entities  subject  to  the  control  and  supervision  of  the  SFC  must  be  carried  out  in  conditions  of independence  and  administrative  autonomy,  so  that  they  have  sufficient  decision-making  capacity  to  carry  out  the operations that constitute their object.\n\nThe Bank recognizes arm's length operations with economic links. These operations are documented and reported to the tax Administration according to the last evaluation date corresponding to the previous year. Therefore, the income tax returns for 2020 and 2019, filed in 2021 and 2020, were adjusted for amount of COP 5,207 and COP 11,198, respectively.\n\n## 20.  Operating segments\n\nOperating segments are defined as components of the Bank that are engaged in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses, for which separate financial information is available that is regularly used by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\n\nThe  Bank  manages  and  measures  the  performance  of  its  operations  through  the  operating  segments  using  the  same accounting policies described in the summary of significant accounting policies described in Note 3. Operating segments.\n\n## 21.  Earnings per share\n\nThe basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\n\nTo calculate diluted earnings per share, the net income attributable to ordinary equity holders, and the weighted average number of outstanding shares, is adjusted by the dilutive effects inherent to potential ordinary shares. Currently, the Bank does not have any dilutive instruments as to be considered in diluted earnings per share due to the fact that the Bank's current common shares are anti-dilutive.\n\n## 22.  Paid-in capital\n\nPaid in capital represents the amount paid by the shareholders in excess of the nominal value of the shares.\n\n## E. Use of estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  requires  Bank's  Management  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\n\nThe  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis. Revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nJudgments or changes in assumptions are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if assumptions and conditions change.",

        "page_content": "The significant accounting estimates that the Bank uses in preparing its consolidated financial statements are detailed below:\n\n## 1. Credit risk impairment\n\nAs disclosed by Management and described in section D. Significant Accounting Policies, paragraph 7.4.5 Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 'FVTOCI', expected credit losses are calculated using individual and collective models and methodologies based on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current borrower situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Collective models include parameters of probability of default at 12 months, probability of default throughout the lifetime of the obligation, loss given default, and exposure at default with the inclusion of the prospective approach that include assumptions of future macroeconomic conditions in plausible future scenarios. In addition, for loans individually assessed in stage 3, the Bank will evaluate defaulted significant loans, analyzing the debt profile of each debtor, the fair value of guarantees granted, information on credit behavior and the future cash flows expected from the client.\n\nExpected  credit  losses  ('ECL')  are  calculated  using  individual  and  collective  models  and  methodologies  based  on assumptions and judgement considering historical credit data, current situation and reasonable and supportable forecasts of  future  economic  conditions.  The  impact  of  COVID-19  has  increased  the  uncertainty  around  ECL  impairment calculations and has required Management to make additional judgements and accounting estimates that affect the reported amount of assets and level of expenses regarding provisions. For further information, see section 10. Effects of the COVID19 pandemic and other relevant issues on the Bank's judgements and estimates, set out below.\n\nThe estimation of impairment charges is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of this line item, the sensitivity  of  the  charges  to  changes  in  assumptions  about  future  events  (behavior  of  the  expected  macroeconomic variables),  weighting  of  macroeconomic  scenarios,  uncertainty  about  the  COVID-19  effects  and  other  somewhat subjective judgments that are incorporated in the individual credit loss models.\n\nSome relevant assumptions must be made to operate the mathematical models behind the expected credit loss assessment. Assumptions are constructed from historical data to consider whether a customer has a significant increase in risk or is in default; these are reviewed by expert panels. Other assumptions such as future economic conditions, the simulation of reasonable  future  economic  scenarios  and  the  likelihood  of  those  scenarios  have  a  high  impact  on  lifetime  default probability models. These scenarios are determined and leveraged by the Direction of Economic Research, which operates independently of the Bank's risk Management division.\n\nThe main factors considered in collective estimations of credit losses are the definition of significant increase in credit risk, definition of default, collateral values, loan maturity and macroeconomic forecast of variables such as unemployment, GDP, interest  rates,  among  others.  It  is  also  important  to  consider  any  other  variable  that  could  influence  a  client's willingness to pay.\n\nIn addition, individual credit loss models consider assumptions on how the financial performance and future cash flow of a  client  could  be  affected,  the  client's  expected  future  operational  and  commercial  activity,  the  capacity  to  generate sufficient  cash  to  pay  debt  obligations  and  trends  and  regulatory  changes  in  the  economic  sector  in  which  the  client operates, changes in the collateral value, weighting of the scenarios used, as well as other internal or external factors.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the assessment of three following factors, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from the expectations on which Management's estimates are based:\n\n- \u00b7 Exposure  at  default :  The  exposed  balance  of  assets  to  the  current  capital  balance,  interest,  and  receivable accounts. In the case of products whose nature is revolving and that have an available borrowing that is susceptible to be used in its entirety according to loan contracts subscribed with clients, this parameter includes an estimation of the use of those products after the client's default.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Probability of default (PD): This is the probability that the debtor fails to fulfill their obligations of capital and/or interest payment over a period of 12 months. This is linked to the rating/scoring of each debtor/operation.\n- \u00b7 Loss given default (LGD): This is defined as the economic impairment that the entity would incur in the event of any instance of default. This depends mainly upon the characteristics of the debtor and upon the valuation of guarantees or collateral associated with the operation. This parameter has been assessed as a critical estimate due to the effects caused by COVID-19 in the real economy. For further information, see section 10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other relevant issues on the Bank's judgements and estimates, set out below.\n\nImpairment loss models and methodologies, and the related assumptions, are assessed by the Bank's Chief Risk Officer (CRO) on a regular basis, using robust validation procedures in order to assure a reasonable coverage of effective losses. This process enables Management to periodically determine whether assumptions and models used to measure credit risk impairment should be adjusted to achieve more precise estimations. Internal controls, data governance standards and approval processes, have been implemented by the Bank to make estimations more accurate.\n\nFor further details,  please  see  Note  2.  Significant  accounting  policies,  section  7.4.5  Impairment  of  financial  assets  at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income 'FVOCI'.\n\n## 2. Impairment testing of cash generating units ('CGU'), including goodwill\n\nThe Bank tests goodwill recognized upon business combinations for impairment at least annually. The impairment test for goodwill  involves  estimates  and  significant  judgments,  including  the  identification  of  cash  generating  units  and  the allocation of goodwill based on the expectations of which operating segments of the Bank will benefit from the acquisition. The fair value of the acquired companies is sensitive to changes in the valuation models' assumptions. Adverse changes in  any  of  the  factors  underlying  these  assumptions  could  lead  the  Bank  to  record  a  goodwill  impairment  charge. Management believes that  the  assumptions  and  estimates  used  are  reasonable  and  supportable  in  the  existing  market environment and commensurate with the risk profile of the assets valued. See Note 9. Goodwill and intangible assets, net, for  further  information  related  to  carrying  amount,  valuation  methodologies,  key  assumptions,  sensitivities  and  the allocation of goodwill. Having considered the extraordinary uncertainty created by COVID-19 and its potential impact on the carrying value of goodwill, Management performed multiple weighted scenarios for assessing the expected future cash flows for each CGU taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19. For further information, see section 10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other relevant issues on the Bank's judgements and estimates, set out below.\n\n## 3. Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on deductible or levied temporary differences originating between tax and accounting bases, taking into account the tax rules applicable in each country where the Bank has operations. Due to the changing conditions of the political, social and economic environment, the constant amendments to tax legislation and the permanent changes in the tax principles and changes in interpretations by tax authorities determining the tax bases for the deferred tax items involves difficult judgments including estimates of future gains, offsets or tax deductions.\n\nAccordingly, the determination of the deferred tax is considered a critical accounting policy.\n\nFor more information relating to the nature of deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized by the Bank, please see Note 12. Income tax.\n\n## 4. Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Bank is subject to contingent liabilities, including those arising from judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings, tax and other claims arising from the conduct of the Bank's business activities. These contingencies are evaluated based on Management's best estimates and provisions are established for legal and other claims by assessing the likelihood of the  loss  actually  occurring  as  probable,  possible  or  remote.  Contingences  are  provisioned  and  recorded  when  all  the information  available  indicates  that  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be required  to  settle  the  obligation  before  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  date  and  the  amounts  may  be",

The  Bank  engages  internal  and  external  experts  in  assessing  probability  and  in  estimating  any amounts involved.\n\nThroughout the life of a contingency, the Bank may learn of additional information that can affect assessments regarding probability or the estimates of amounts involved; changes in these assessments can lead to changes in recorded provisions.\n\nThe Bank considers the estimates used to determine the provisions for contingent liabilities critical estimates because the probability of their occurrence and the amounts that the Bank may be required to pay are based on the Bank's judgment and  those  of  its  internal  and  external  experts,  which  will  not  necessarily  coincide  with  the  future  outcome  of  the proceedings. For further information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and their carrying amounts, see Note 21. Provisions and contingent liabilities.\n\n## 5. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the Bank's statement of financial position include debt, equity securities  and  derivatives  classified  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  debt  classified  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income and equity securities which the Bank has made an irrevocable election to present changes in its fair value in other comprehensive income.\n\nTo  increase  consistency  and  comparability  in  fair  value  measurements  and  related  disclosures,  IFRS  13  Fair  value measurement specifies different levels of inputs that may be used to measure the fair value of financial instruments. In accordance with this standard, financial instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel  1: Assets  and  liabilities  are  classified  as  Level  1  if  there  are  observable  inputs  that  reflect  quoted  prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nInstruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions.\n\nLevel  2: Assets  and  liabilities  are  classified  as  Level  2  if  in  the  absence  of  a  market  price  for  a  specific  financial instrument, its fair value is estimated using models whose input data are observable for recent transactions of identical or similar instruments.\n\nLevel 3: Assets and liabilities are classified as level 3 if unobservable input data were used in the measurement of fair value that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of these assets or liabilities. The  fair  value  of  Level  3  financial  assets  and  liabilities  is  determined  using  pricing  models,  discounted  cash  flow methodologies or similar techniques.\n\nTransfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. All transfers between the aforementioned levels are assumed to occur at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe measurement of the fair value of financial instruments generally involves a higher degree of complexity and requires the application of judgments especially when the models use unobservable inputs (level 3) based on the assumptions that would be used in the market to determine the price for assets or liabilities. Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.\n\nWhen developing fair value measurements, the Bank maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Internal models used to determine fair value are validated in accordance with the Bank's policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, the Bank uses third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internally developed prices. Thirdparty price validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements.",

Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other relevant issues on the Bank's judgements and estimates, set out below.\n\n## 6. Measurement of Employee benefits\n\nThe measurement of post-employment benefit obligations and long-term employee benefits takes into account a range of inputs and it is dependent upon a series of assumptions of future events. The projected unit credit method is used to determine the present value of the obligation for the defined benefits  and its associated cost. Future measurements of obligations  may  differ  to  those  presented  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  among  others,  due  to  changes  in economic and demographic assumptions and significant events. As of December 31, 2021, an improvement in the actuarial valuation methodology of the post-employment and long-term benefit plans was presented, in order to include typified discount rates by each benefit plan, with the objective of presenting more relevant information on the value of these plans in the consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 19. Employee benefit plans.\n\n## 7. Transaction price determination\n\nWith respect to contracts with the Bank's customers, for the determination of the transaction price, the Bank allocates to each one of the performance obligations under the contract the price which represents the value expected to be received in respect of each such performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. Such price is determined based on the cost of each service, related tax and associated risks to the operation and inherent to the transaction, plus the margin expected to be received for the services, considering in each case the market price for the service, the conditions agreed with the customer and the customer's segment. The bank has fixed and variable prices considering the characteristics of each service, future events, discounts, returns and other variables that may influence the selling price. No significant financing components are factored in the determination of the selling price.\n\n## 8. Leases\n\nThe measurement of the right-of-use asset and of the lease liabilities requires a series of judgments, among which are the determination of the term of the lease and the rate used in discounting the cash flows. The term of the lease is defined according to the historical information of the contracts and the period over which an asset is expected to be economically usable, which involves a high degree of uncertainty due to the use of relevant information about past events. In the Bank's case, the weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate was used to discount the cash flows associated with the leasing contracts. The Bank performs analysis taking into account the currency, lease term, economic environment and class of underlying assets, as to determine the weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate. During the lockdowns that took place in 2021 and 2020 to stem the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank did not receive substantial rent concessions as lessee in the payment terms of its lease contracts. For further information, see section 10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other relevant issues on the Bank's judgements and estimates, set out below.\n\n## 9. Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments\n\nIn the process of determining the current and deferred tax for periods subject to review by the tax authority, the applicable rules have been applied and interpretations have been made to take positions, on which different interpretations could arise from those made by the entity. Due to the complexity of the tax system, the continuous modifications of the fiscal rules, the accounting changes with implications in the tax bases and in general the legal instability of the country, at any time the tax authority could have different criteria from the Bank. Therefore, a dispute or inspection by the tax authority on a specific tax treatment may affect the deferred or current tax asset or liability bank's accounting, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12.",

Income tax.\n\n## 10. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other relevant issues on the Bank's judgements and estimates\n\nThe progressive return to a normal economic and social environment has been the predominant factor as of December 31, 2021, despite the contagiousness of the omicron variant, positively impacting productive activity in Colombia and in the other countries where the Bank operates, as well as the future economy performance expectations. However, the Bank continues to assess the application of additional prudential measures to evaluate (a) whether uncertainties arose as to the ability to continue generating revenues from contracts with customers and commissions, (b) going concern considerations in  relation  to  liquidity,  regulatory  capital  requirements  and  concentrations  of  market  risk,  (c)  whether  fair  value adjustments were necessary for financial instruments, (d) the measurement of the impact of changes in loan terms agreed with customers, (e) whether a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) has occurred for its financial assets, and (f) any potential impact on the carrying value of goodwill and non-financial assets, among others:\n\n- *  Relevant  uncertainties  or  analysis  regarding  the  ability  to  continue  generating  revenues  from  contracts  with customers and commissions: Management assessed the estimates of variable consideration to determine the amount of income expected to be generated from its commission contracts, taking into account that the uncertainties relating to the coronavirus pandemic could result in modification to contracts with customers or reassessments whether it is probable that the Bank will collect substantially all the consideration to which is entitled. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank has concluded that there were no significant impacts on its ability to collect the amount that reflects the consideration to which the Bank expects to be entitled in exchange for providing financial services despite the detrimental impact upon the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- * Assessment of changes in business strategies and business model: Management has not made changes, or considered making significant changes in business strategy, which would lead  to any significant impact on the Bank's ability to continue as a business or affect the classification and valuation of its assets and liabilities. Considering the Bank's objective of supporting its clients during the months of the coronavirus pandemic, the Bank offered relief and support programs which  are  detailed  below  under  the  assessment  of  changes  in  credit  conditions,  in  section  E.  Use  of  judgments  and estimates. Furthermore, Management has concluded that temporary disruption of general economic activities did not result in  diminishing  demand  for  financial  products  or  services  offered  by  the  Bank  and  has  not  resulted  in  any  material uncertainty about the Bank's liquidity and solvency, due to the coronavirus pandemic as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. For further information, see Note 31. Risk management.\n- *  Assessment  of  significant  changes  in  fair  value  measurements  of  financial  instruments: Management  has determined as of the end of the reporting period of these consolidated financial statements that the fair value measurements of financial instruments reflect market participants' expectations and market data at the measurement date under current market conditions, ensuring that observable market data were incorporated even if the price fluctuations are considered temporary due to the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, for fair value measurements based on unobservable inputs (level 3), Management has ensured that the unobservable inputs used reflect how market participants would incorporate the effect of the coronavirus pandemic in their expectations of future cash flows, discount rates and other significant valuation inputs related to the asset or liability at the reporting date, if any, so that all fluctuations in current market conditions have been considered in the fair value hierarchy of valuation and disclosures, as shown in Note 30. Fair value of assets and liabilities. During  2021  and  2020,  the  valuation  restatements  on  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  were  recognized  in  the consolidated statement of income and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, given the improvement in the financial markets due to the return to a normal epidemiological environment during 2021 and the contraction experienced in the financial markets due to the COVID-19 outbreak and uncertainty generated by the measures taken by governments to contain the pandemic during 2020, without generating a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 5. Financial assets investments and derivatives.\n- * Assessment of changes in credit conditions: Measures taken to contain the virus have affected economic activity and, as a result, some governments in the countries where the Bank operates have requested private banks to make more flexible principal payments, reductions in interest rates and certain other concessions. In this regard, the Bank adopted special",

        "page_content": "temporary measures in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama, to support our customers who took a payment holiday and help them resume payment during this extraordinary situation.\n\nFurthermore, in order to provide an economic relief to customers whose ability to pay had been affected by the COVID19 situation, in June 2021 the Superintendencia de Bancos de Panam\u00e1 ('SPB') issued agreement number 002-2021 and the  General  Resolutions  of  the  Board  of  Directors  SBP-GJD-0003-2021  and  SBP-GJD-0004-2021,  which  established guidelines for credit and counterparty risk management of modified loans, granted new loan restructurings as of July 01, 2021 and until September 30, 2021, based on the debtor's payment capacity, financial viability and each bank's policies, and also established the mechanisms for reporting this portfolio to the SBP. These regulatory changes represented an extension of general relief law in force since 2020. In Colombia, the SFC had established a debtor support programme ('PAD') applicable until August 31, 2021, however, Bancolombia S.A. continues to offer concessions and relief to its customers under similar conditions to those established by the PAD, although not limited to those affecting customer's income or payment capacity as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 situation. In Banco Agr\u00edcola S.A., in accordance with the expectation of economic recovery and the degree to which the customer was affected by the pandemic, special concessions were granted until September 30, 2021.\n\nUntil September 30, 2021, the Bank maintained a program to support customers in accordance with each customer's individual situation to help them to resume payments by means of the modification of loan terms when the debtors have been financially affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the Bank established a segmentation of clients in specific groups based on their capability to resume payments (customers will be in a position to resume payments once the payment holiday arrangements expire and those who might need additional short or longer term support), for which the entity offers: i) reduction in the installment amounts without increasing the initially agreed interest rate and ii) periods of  payment  holidays  or  additional  extensions  of  time.  Some  of  these  reliefs  continue  to  be  granted,  as  a  way  of accommodating customers who have difficulties in meeting their credit obligations.\n\nIn this regard, Management has evaluated each of these relief efforts and granted and applied the corresponding judgment to assess, in each case, whether a modification is considered 'substantial' or 'non-substantial'. Therefore, the Bank has an accounting policy of applying the '10% test' for modified loans. Consequently, the terms are substantially different if the net present value of the cash flows under the new terms (including any fees paid net of any fees received) discounted using the original effective interest rate ('EIR'), is at least 10 percent different from the net present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial asset. If the relief results in a substantial modification, the financial asset should be derecognized.  When  the  contractual  cash  flows  of  a  financial  asset  are  renegotiated  or  otherwise  modified  and  the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset, the Bank adjusts the gross carrying amount of the existing loan to reflect the revised estimated cash flow payments discounted using the original EIR. The adjustment is recognized as a modification gain or loss in accordance with IFRS 9:5.4.3. The adjustment is recognized in the consolidated statement of income under the line \"Interest income on loans and financial leases\".\n\nThe aforementioned relief provided by the Bank to company and individual customers in some cases resulted in the renegotiation of the contractual terms. The impact of the relief provided to clients due to the holiday payments and loan modification amounted to COP 53,745 as of December 31, 2021 and was recognized as a higher value in the line 'Interest income on loans and financial leases' of the consolidated statement of income and amounted to COP 150,958 as a lower value in the same line of the consolidated statement of income as of December 31, 2020.\n\n* Credit risk impairment assessment: The Bank faced important challenges relating to selecting appropriate assumptions to assess and develop reliable estimates required by the expected loss models (ECL) due to the level of uncertainty derived from the current situation and the radical change in economic forecasts in all the countries where the Bank operates. Indeed, default  probability  models  incorporate  between  five  and  seven  years  of  history  for  their  estimates,  which  have  been historically characterized by good performance of most of the indicators in the countries where the Bank operates. These indicators were characterized by stable, although moderate, growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), contained inflation and stable or decreasing unemployment. However, the macroeconomic projections for all the regions where the Bank operates included a rapid contraction of GDP by 2020 and then a sharp recovery in 2021.\n\nFor 2021, the Bank updated its macroeconomic projections for all the countries in which it operates. This update considered the applicable government's measures announced for each country to support the economy. To the extent that the severity",

These probabilities, which reflect the expectations that the Bank has set for the future macroeconomic conditions, have been updated using the best available and reliable information based on past events, current conditions, and forecasts, in order to identify the increase in risk of debtors and to incorporate the economic perspectives in the expected loss models.\n\nIn order to mitigate excessively procyclical assumptions when determining the provisions caused by the volatility of the macroeconomic  forecasts  which  induce  significant  constitution  of  provisions  followed  by  releases  of  comparable magnitudes and given the high uncertainty associated with the economic behavior due to COVID-19, to measure forwardlooking effects, the Bank used a temporary adjustment to the allowance in the form of an Overlay as a single non-recurring event into the ECL measurement process associated with the mid-term macroeconomic forecasts stabilization in Colombia due to the smoothing of the macroeconomic variables.\n\nIn addition, the Bank made the following improvements to the methodologies used for the accounting for expected credit losses:\n\n- \u00b7 Improvement in the stage 2 ECL assessment methodology to measure losses over the lifetime of the loan (Cox proportional  hazards  model,  sometimes  abbreviated  Cox  model),  which  allow  a  better  adjustment  of  the macroeconomic variables in the face of the situation due to COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 Mid-term  macroeconomic  forecasts  stabilization  in  Colombia  due  to  the  smoothing  of  the  macroeconomic variables.\n- \u00b7 Change in one of the assumptions used to measure the expected loss of stage 1; while in the past, it was assumed that the loss occurs at the beginning of the year, as best practice it is now assumed that the loss occurs in the middle of the year.\n- \u00b7 Adjustments in the LGD parameter (Loss Given Default) and the collateral methodology, in order to incorporate external direct expenses and maintenance expenses of the collaterals received in payment, improve to a greater segregation of default bands and eliminate data that are not representative of the current portfolio.\n\nThese methodological improvements generated a Reversal of provision for credit losses of COP 383,790 as of December 2021.\n\nOn the other hand, the government support measures put into place in the countries in which the Bank operates may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it remains unclear how these will evolve and how they might impede the decrease in the risk deterioration metrics of our customers. For example, the governmental support measures may negatively impact the identification of customers that are in a difficult financial situation but that are not reaching the level of default to be considered customers with a significant risk increase, or at the default height of arrears.\n\nTo identify the increase in risk of debtors for which financial relief was granted, the Bank has added a Management Overlay adjustment, which is applied in countries where there was still a massive relief population, which allows for estimating the portfolio risk and reflects a level of expected credit losses in accordance with the current situation in the portfolio once the aforementioned relief efforts expire. In some cases, this loss allowance is recorded globally given the uncertainty in the portfolio subject to payment deferrals (Banistmo), where the Overlays were generated on populations identified as high risk (unemployed, uncontacted customers and decrease in income); in other cases, it was possible to incorporate the Overlay client by client (Colombia), either because they were identified through direct contact or by expert models, which allow increasing the risk rating and/or stage impairment.\n\nThe estimated Overlay considered by the Bank as of December 31, 2021, was COP 727,216. The Overlays will be released to the extent that the client presents good payment behavior or used in cases where the client does not comply with the agreement and consequently defaults.\n\n* Impairment of non-financial assets: The economies of the countries in which the Bank operates have improved despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in the Bank's macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the adverse scenarios that had been playing out in 2020, such as GDP behaviorsee Economic Scenario Weightings, in section D.

Management did not identify the existence of an impairment in associate's companies and joint ventures at the date of this report as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nAdditionally, the Bank has considered all macroeconomic impacts when developing the economic budget assessments, forecasts and other underlying assumptions commonly used to determine the recoverable value of non-financial long-lived assets, such as goodwill, intangibles, investment property, plant and equipment, among others. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, the total amount of the long-lived assets was concluded to be recoverable based on the assessments carried out by Management. However, for foreclosed assets, it has been necessary to recognize an impairment adjustment for amount of COP 39,173 and COP 48,257 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, based on updated appraisals. Further, for assets held for sale, the Bank recognized an impairment adjustment amounted to COP 1,339 as of December 31, 2020, for COVID-19 impacts presented mainly in the vehicles held for sale by the company Renting Colombia; as of December 31, 2021, this situation did not arise.\n\n## * Other issues:\n\n- -Recognition of provisions: As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Management has assessed the recognition of provisions  without  having  identified  any  circumstances  that  would  have  implied  the  recognition  of  present obligations that have a high probability of outflow of resources or the recognition of significant unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract that may exceed the benefits expected to be received, as onerous contracts by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- -Resources  to  promote  the  provision  of  services: Despite  the  pandemic,  the  Bank's  financial  subsidiaries continued  to  support  customers  by  providing  them  financial  services,  and  we  complied  with  the  biosecurity recommendations suggested by the World Health Organization, applicable to the financial services provided by the Bank. Accordingly, the Bank took the necessary measures to prepare its branches and administrative offices to comply with the biosafety requirements of the national government of each country in which the Bank operates, guaranteeing the availability of financial services and reducing the time customers and users of financial services spend in offices and branches. As a result of these measurements, the Bank allocated in expenses amounts of COP 3,339 and COP 39,421 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to put in place additional protocols that have worked effectively in Colombia and all other countries in which the Bank operates; however, by 2021, these expenses ceased to be temporary and were integrated as a part of the business operation. Additionally, to ensure service continuity in the network of bank branches in Colombia, the Bank has incurred in maintenance, repair and adaptation expenses an amount of COP 5,697 as of December 31, 2021, as a result of the damages to premises caused during the Colombian national strike, which began in April 2021 after the filing of the first tax reform bill called Ley de Solidaridad Sostenible, which was subsequently withdrawn in May 2021.\n- -Bitcoin Law in El Salvador: To promote financial inclusion and boost the economic growth of El Salvador, on June 8, 2021 the Bitcoin Law was issued, which authorized the circulation of the virtual currency Bitcoin as legal tender, on par with the US dollar, from September 7, 2021, whose value depend exclusively to free market criteria and will use the dollar as a reference currency. In this way, it was mandated that all economic agents accept the Bitcoin as payment currency, being able to express in such virtual currency any price or obligation, and the Government of El Salvador will guarantee, through the creation of a trust in the Banco de Desarrollo de El Salvador (BANDESAL), the automatic and instantaneous convertibility of the Bitcoin to the US dollar by any economic agent.\n\nThe guidelines for the authorization of the operation of the technological platform of services with Bitcoin and dollars, and the technical standards to facilitate the participation of financial entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem came into force on September 7, 2021 to comply with this law.

For these purposes, the Bank determined it to be a strategic priority to work with regulated suppliers that maintain the highest standards in their operations, particularly in terms of Money Laundering Prevention and Compliance.\n\nThus, the Bank opted for the immediate conversion of Bitcoin to U.S. dollars, at the time of receipt, in order to not have exposures in this virtual currency.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the transactionality level of Bitcoin payments that has occurred since the entry into force of this law has been low.\n\n- -Bonuses based on added value to clients and the Bank's results: During 2020, the Bank suspended bonuses based on added value to clients and the Bank's results to its employees (SVA bonus) as part of short-term benefits, due to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the Bank's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020; however, during 2021, the Bank reactivated the recognition of bonuses based on added value to clients and the Bank's results to its employees.\n- -Write-off of intangible assets: Given the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as of December 31, 2020, some specific intangible assets were de-recognized for an amount of COP 9,595 which was recognized in the consolidated statement of income as accelerated amortization.

Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure: In September 2019, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7, to address issues arising from the replacement of existing interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative risk-free interest rates (RFRs) in the context of hedge accounting. The Bank applies IFRS 9 hedge accounting, consequently the amendments to IAS 39 do not apply.\n\nThe amendments to IFRS 9 provided temporary exceptions to apply specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships, that are directly affected by the reform to LIBOR and other Interbank Offered Rates, which included:\n\n- -To assume that the expected hedged cash flows based on benchmark interest rates are not altered because of the reform.\n- -To assume that both the hedged cash flows and the hedged risk of a hedge exposed to benchmark interest rates are not altered because of the reform, in the prospective measurement of hedge effectiveness.\n- -Hedging  relationships  will  not  be  discontinued  because  of  ineffectiveness  arising  from  the  reform  to  the benchmark interest rate.\n\nThe Bank applied these amendments as of January 01, 2020.

Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement,  IFRS  7  Financial  Instruments:  Disclosure,  IFRS  4 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 16 Leases: In August 2020, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7,  IFRS  4  and  IFRS  16,  to  address  issues  that  might  affect  financial  reporting  during  the  reform  of  an  interest  rate benchmark, including changes to contractual cash flows of financial instruments; hedging relationships, insurance and lease contracts, arising from the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate.\n\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform-Phase 2 requires that, for financial instruments at amortized cost and at fair value through profit or loss, changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform are reflected by adjusting their effective interest rate. No immediate gain or loss is recognized. This expedient is only applicable to changes that are required by interest rate benchmark reform, which is the case if, and only if, the change is necessary as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform and the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis (that is, the basis immediately preceding the change). Where some or all change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset and liability does not meet the above criteria, the above practical expedient is first applied to the changes required by interest rate benchmark reform, including updating the instrument's effective interest rate. Any additional changes are accounted for in the normal way (that is, assessed for modification or derecognition, with the resulting modification gain / loss recognized immediately in profit or loss where the instrument is not derecognized).\n\nThe Bank applied these amendments after January 01, 2021, disclosing in its notes the nature and extent of risks to which it is exposed, the management of these risks and the progress to complete the transition to alternative benchmark rate. For further information, see Note 31. Risk Management, section Interest Rate Benchmark Reform.\n\nCovid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond June 30, 2021. Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases: In March 2021, the Board issued  COVID-19-Related  Rent  Concessions  beyond  June  30,  2021,  which  extended  the  availability  of  the  practical expedient in paragraph 46A of IFRS 16 by one year (amendment published in May 2020). Further, the Board proposed a practical expedient that permits lessees not to assess whether rent concessions that occur as a direct consequence of the COVID-19  pandemic  and  meet  specified  conditions  are  lease  modifications  and,  instead,  to  account  for  those  rent concessions as if they were not lease modifications.\n\nThe 2021 amendment resulted in the practical expedient applying to rent concessions for which any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before 30 June 2022, provided the other conditions for applying the practical expedient are met.\n\nManagement evaluated this practical expedient at the beginning of the annual reporting period on June 01,2020, with the May 2020, amendment to IFRS 16 Leases-Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions. However, no significant impacts were included in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021, due to the Bank not receiving substantial modifications as a lessee in the terms of payment of its lease contracts beyond June 30, 2022, as a result of the COVID19 pandemic.\n\n## b) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Applicable in Future Periods\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements : On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 to clarify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current.

The amendments must be applied retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8. Early application is permitted.",

IAS 37 provides the definition of an onerous contract, defined as one in which the costs of fulfilling the contract exceed the economic benefits received. The amendment clarifies that the costs of fulfilling a contract are those directly related to the contract, that is, the following: a) the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract; and (b) an allocation of other costs directly related to the fulfilling the contract.\n\nIn addition, this amendment clarifies that before recognizing the provision for loss on the onerous contract, impairment losses on the assets held to comply with the contract must be recognized, in accordance with IAS 36.\n\nThis amendment is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022 and early application is permitted.\n\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact that this amendment would have on the Bank's consolidated financial statement and disclosures.\n\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: In May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 3 to update a reference  to  the  Conceptual  Framework  for  Financial  Reporting,  without  changing  the  accounting  requirements  for business combinations. This amendment clarifies the compliance requirements of assets and liabilities restrictions for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by applying the acquisition method in a business combination. More specifically:\n\n- -The IASB may add an additional exception to the recognition principle in IFRS 3. This exception indicates that on the acquisition date the acquirer will account for contingent liabilities and liabilities within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 Levies if incurred separately, rather than assumed in a business combination.\n- -Explicitly incorporate the prohibition of the recognition of contingent assets acquired in a business combination, clarifying that the reference to the 2018 Conceptual Framework does not change the requirement for these assets.\n\nThe amendment to IFRS 3 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022. Early application is permitted if the Bank also applies all the modifications made by the amendments to the references to the Conceptual Framework in the IFRS Standards, issued in March  2018. Management evaluated the impact of the changes that the amendment to IFRS 3 would have on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and disclosures, and no impact is expected.\n\nAmendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Definition of Accounting Estimates: In  February  2021,  the  Board  issued  Definition  of  Accounting  Estimates,  which  amended  IAS  8.  The amendments introduced the definition of accounting estimates in paragraph 5 and included other amendments to IAS 8 to help entities distinguish changes in accounting estimates from changes in accounting policies. The amendment to IAS 8 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2023 and early application is permitted.\n\nManagement evaluated and concluded that no impact is expected, due to the new definition of accounting estimates being in accordance with that which the Bank currently applies and discloses.\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements.  Disclosure  of  Accounting  Policies: In  February  2021  the  Board  amended  IAS  1  and  IFRS  Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, to replace the term \"significant\" with \"material\", to require an entity to disclose its material accounting policy information rather than its significant accounting policies. Therefore, accounting policy information may be considered material when that information is considered together with other information in a complete set of financial statements. In the Board's view, accounting policy information is expected to be material if its disclosure was needed for primary users to understand information provided about material transactions, other events or conditions in the financial statements.

The  amendments  narrowed  the  scope  of  the  recognition  exemption  in  paragraphs  15  and  24  of  IAS  12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

The proposed amendment would remove potential for confusion regarding the treatment of lease incentives applying IFRS 16. These improvements apply from January 01, 2022.\n- \u00b7 Amendments  to  IFRS  9  Financial  Instruments-Fees  in  the  '10  percent'  test  for  derecognition  of  financial liabilities : In determining whether to derecognize a financial liability that has been modified or exchanged, an entity is required to assess whether the terms are substantially different. The Board clarified the fees that should be included by an entity when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. Based on this amendment, the entity shall include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf. This amendment is mandatory for the annual periods beginning on or after January 01, 2022. Earlier application is permitted. The Bank applied this amendment to financial liabilities that were modified or exchanged on the periods beginning on after January 01, 2020.\n\n## NOTE 3.

The Bank enters into derivative transactions to facilitate customer business, for hedging purposes and arbitrage activities, such as forwards, options or swaps where the underlying are exchange rates, interest rates and securities.\n\nA swap agreement is a contract  between  two  parties  to  exchange  cash  flows  based  on  specified  underlying  notional amounts, assets and/or indices. Financial futures and forward settlement contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of  a  financial  instrument  (including  another  derivative  financial  instrument),  index,  currency  or  commodity  at  a predetermined  rate  or  price  during  a  period  or  at  a  date  in  the  future.  Futures  and  option  contracts  are  standardized agreements for future delivery, traded on exchanges that typically act as a platform.\n\nFor further information related to the objectives, policies and processes for managing the Bank's risk, please see Note 31.

However, the fair value of the financial asset or liability at the time of initial recognition may be different from the transaction price, because the fair value includes variables in its valuation technique that include market information, such as interest rate yield curves, currencies rates, indicators, default factors among others. When the  values  are  not  equal,  the  asset  or  liability  must  be  measured  at  fair  value  and  the  difference  between  the transaction price and the fair value must be recognized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 If fair value is evidenced by Level 1 inputs or is based on a valuation technique that uses only observable market data,  the  Group  must  recognize  the  difference  as  a  gain  or  loss  on  initial  recognition  directly  in  the  income statement.\n- \u00b7 In all other circumstances, the entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and is recognized in the income statement over the life of the transaction.",

Those derivatives are designated as hedging instruments to protect the Bank against changes in the fair value of Banistmo's position in debt instruments issued by the Panamanian Government (fair value hedge). The hedge effectiveness assessment is performed on a monthly basis consistently throughout the hedging relationship. For fair value hedges, the changes in value of the hedging derivative, as well as the changes in value of the related hedged item concerning to the risk hedged, are reflected in the statement of income in the line 'Interest and valuation on financial instruments'.\n\n## Fair value hedging\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Banistmo has designated 8 derivative contracts (Interest rate swaps), as fair value hedging instruments with maturity dates ranging from July 2022.\n\nThe following table contains details of the hedged expresures covered by the Group's hedging strategies:\n\n| December 31, 2021  In millions of COP   | December 31, 2021  In millions of COP                              | December 31, 2021  In millions of COP   | December 31, 2021  In millions of COP   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                         | Carrying amount of hedged  Accumulated amount of fair value   item | adjustments on the hedged item          | Balance sheet line item                 |\n|                                         | Assets                                                             | Liabilities                             |                                         |\n| Fair value hedges                       | Fair value hedges                                                  | Fair value hedges                       | Fair value hedges                       |\n| Interest rate  - Fixed rate             | 333,407                                                            | (6,369)                                 | Financial assets investments            |",

The bank assumed that the hedge accounting will remain highly probable and that the hedge relationship will remain highly effective.\n\nThe Bank maintains swaps as hedging instruments where it changes flows as follows: it pays a fixed interest rate and receives floating interest to hedge the market risk of fixed rate debt instruments.\n\nThe table below shows the notional value of hedging instruments by benchmark interest rate impacted by the reform since December 31, 2020.\n\n| In thousands of USD   | In thousands of USD                    | In thousands of USD              |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                       | Notional value of  hedging instruments | Maturing after  31 December 2020 |\n| Fair value hedges     |                                        |                                  |\n| USD LIBOR             | 79,550                                 | 79,550                           |\n\nThe main sources of ineffectiveness for interest rate risk hedge accounting relationships are:\n\n- \u00b7 Differences in the interest rate market curves applied to discount the hedging instrument and the hedged instrument.

        "page_content": "## Impact of movements in the value of the portfolio and loss allowance by Stage\n\n## December 2021 vs December 2020\n\n## Stage 1 (12-month expected credit losses)\n\nThe exposure value in stage 1 increased by COP 28,847,204 and the loss allowance decreased by COP 878,256. The increase in the portfolio in this stage is mainly due to newly granted loans in 2021, which increased 34% from December 2020 to December 2021. The second cause of this increase is the currency conversion of loans from Dollars to Colombian Pesos due to the 16% increase in the Exchange Rate compared to the same period of the previous year. The decrease in the loss allowance is due to the change in macroeconomic expectations that are more favorable for this year.\n\n## Stage 2 (Lifetime expected credit losses)\n\nThe exposure value in stage 2 increased by COP 521,085 and the loss allowance also increased by COP 313,787. The increase in exposure in this stage is mainly explained by specific loan migrations from Stage 3 to Stage 2 from clients in the  agribusiness  sector  for  a  value  of  COP  681,480.  The  loss  allowance  increase  is  explained  mainly  by  exposures transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and the constitution of loss allowance made on debtors with financial relief, which allows reflecting a level of provisions in accordance with the situation that is expected to exist in the portfolio once the relief ends.\n\n## Stage 3 (Lifetime expected credit losses)\n\nThe exposure at default in stage 3 decreased by COP 454,536 and the loss allowance decreased by COP 208,353. The variation in exposure is mainly due to the charge-off of a significant client in the natural resources sector for a value of COP 401,163. The decrease of loss allowance is in line with the movements of the portfolio in this Stage, offset by the constitution of provision as a consequence of the increase of 16% in the restatement of credits compared to the same period of the previous year due to the effects of the foreign exchange differences and the increase in the loss allowance of new significant clients in default, especially in the building industry in Colombia for COP 45,868.\n\n## NOTE 7.

This model includes an impairment test that evaluates indicators that impact the assets, which  is  carried  out  annually.  The  test  evaluates  both  external  indicators  (economic  and  legal),  and  internal  ones (insurance, maintenance and used market sales). The Bank performs a detailed review process at the time of return of the asset by the lessees in order to guarantee their operating conditions. Additionally, the Bank employs experts apart from the sales force, who constantly monitor the conditions of the second-hand market, and carry out back-testing in order to determine the consistency of the residual value model, and periodically review the results together with key managers. All of the above is complemented by agreements with suppliers, which allow the exchange of information, knowledge and, in some cases, the structuring of residual risk mitigation mechanisms.\n\nIn order to manage the risks associated with the assets, the Bank also employs an insurance department, and engages an international broker and insurance companies. They all serve as support to design and define the strategies for the different types of protection that cover the lessor's risks, assets and customers.\n\nAdditionally, in Renting Colombia's vehicle rental business, assets are managed with the goal of preserving commercial value through necessary maintenance, which avoids deterioration beyond that generated by regular use. Service indicators with suppliers are periodically reviewed in order to ensure their quality and compliance with the expected levels. Safe mobility strategies are also defined based on the permanent analysis of the road safety indicators. These strategies aim at ensuring the status and useful life of the asset.\n\n## 7.2. Lessee\n\nThe Bank has entered into lease agreements as a lessee. These arrangements involve offices, branches and administrative offices as well as certain Computer equipment.

This standard establishes the principles of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all their leases under the same balance sheet model similar to the accounting under IAS 17 of the Finance leases. The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees: leasing of low-value assets (for example, personal computers) and short-term leases (that is, leases with a term of less than 12 months). At the beginning of the lease, the lessee recognizes a liability for lease payments (liability for lease) and an asset that represents the right to use the underlying asset during the term of the lease (right to use the asset). The Bank used the modified retrospective adoption method, where the right-of-use assets are measured as if IFRS 16 had always been applied, using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate known at the date of transition.  The change in accounting policy affected the following items in the consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2019:\n\n| Concepts                                          | January 1,  2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Increase in right of use assets (1)               | 1,543,427          |\n| Net of deferred tax                               | (119,173)          |\n| Increase in lease liabilities                     | 1,848,833          |\n| Net of effect of changes in foreign exchange rate | (9,560)            |\n| Decrease in retained earnings                     | 184,248            |\n\n## NOTE 8.

Determination of recoverable amount requires management to make assumptions and use estimates to forecast cash flow for periods that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment  of  the  appropriate  discount  rate;  estimation  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  cash-generation  units;  and  the valuation of the separable assets of each business whose goodwill is being reviewed.\n\nThe key assumptions used by management in determining the recoverable amount are:\n\n| Operating segment            | Goodwill 2021           | Valuation Methodology  Key Assumptions          | Discount Rate  (real)   | Growth rate  (real)             |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| In millions of COP           | In millions of COP      | In millions of COP                              | In millions of COP      | In millions of COP              |\n| Banking Panama               |                         | 6,080,314   Discounted Cash flow   5 years plan | 8.80% and 8.70 %        | 5.40 %                          |\n| Banking El                   | 1,122,986               | Discounted Cash flow  5 years plan              | 14.90                   | %  4.10  %                      |\n| Salvador  Banking  Guatemala | 929,186                 | Discounted Cash flow  5 years plan              | 10.10                   | %  5.10  %                      |\n| Others Segments (1)          | 10,660   Does not apply | Does not apply                                  |                         | Does not apply   Does not apply |",

Vlipco provides technology services to financial companies and qualifies as a business as defined in IFRS 3.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the Bank owned 91,838 shares of Vlipco that represented 47.40% of the total capital stock of the company, classified as an investment in joint venture.\n\nThe  transaction  was  completed  on  November  30,  2021,  upon  receipt  of  required  regulatory  approvals  from  the Superintendencia of Industry and Commerce, and as a result Bancolombia obtained control of Vlipco. The consideration paid by Bancolombia was COP 9,474, in cash.\n\nThe acquisition of Vlipco in stages is being accounted for under the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. Accordingly, the Bank has remeasured its previously held equity interest in Vlipco at its acquisition-date fair value and recognized the resulting gain or loss and equity method adjustment.\n\nThe purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date as summarized in the following table. The goodwill of COP 10,660 is calculated as the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired, and reflects the value expected from the synergies from",

The  fair  value  of  the  investment  properties  is  based  on  the comparative  market  approach,  which  reflects  the  prices  of  recent  transactions  with  similar  characteristics.  Upon determining the fair value of these investment properties, the greater and best use of these investment properties is their present use.

        "page_content": "## 12.2 Legal regulatory changes\n\n## Colombia:\n\nThe applicable Corporate Income Tax rate in Colombia for FY 2022 onwards is 35%. Financial institutions must add a surcharge of 3% on the general rate of the corporate income Tax until 2025. These additional points are applicable when taxable income exceeds over 120.000 UVT.\n\nFrom FY 2022, only 50% of the industry and trade Tax- ITT can be credited against the Corporate Income Tax liability.\n\nA reduced statute of limitations has been established for FY 2022 and 2023. The reduced statute of limitations applies for taxpayers that increase their net income tax liability by at least  35% or 25% with respect to the net income tax in the previous year. The limitation period will apply after 6 or 12 months, respectively, if the Tax Authority has not formally started a tax audit.\n\nArticle 616-1 of the Tax Statute was modified, leaving transitory paragraph 1 of the same article invalid, therefore, as of the year 2022, an electronic sales invoice, equivalent document and/or electronic documents will be required. current tax regulations as fiscal support for the origin of deductions in income tax and deductible taxes in sales tax (VAT).\n\nAt the same time, for the purposes of the electronic invoice being deemed as a support of costs, expenses and creditable taxes, when the sale of a good and / or the provision of a service is carried out on credit or a term is extended for the payment, the acquirer must confirm the reception of the electronic invoice and the goods or services acquired by electronic message  sent  to  the  issuer  for  issuance  of  the  same,  taking  into  account  the  deadlines,  as  well  as  the  conditions, mechanisms, technical and technological requirements established by the DIAN.\n\nThe Tax Administration will determine those who are obliged to provide information in accordance with the automatic exchange of information, as well as the information they must provide and the due diligence procedures they must comply with. In addition, authority for the superivision of the due diligence procedures has been transferred to the DIAN and the penalty system for the breach of obligations related to the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism applicable to the entities supervised by the respective superintendence has been deleted.\n\nFinally, the definition of 'final beneficiary' is modified into the tax legal system. On December 27th of 2021, the tax administration issued Ruling 164 which ruled sections 631-5 y 631-6 of the Colombian Tax code and set forth the terms and conditions applicable to the final beneficiary register by its acronym in spanish RUB.\n\n## Other Countries:\n\nThe income tax rate in the other countries where the Group has a presence amounts to 25% in Guatemala and Panama and 30% in El Salvador and Costa Rica. Until November 2020, a  5% surcharge was applied in El Salvador as a special contribution, of the value of income tax for net capital gains greater than USD$500.000.",

In the case of Colombian companies, dividends will be subject to the application of Articles 48 and 49 of the Tax Statute and consequently will be subject to withholding at source at the established rates, in accordance with the tax characteristics of each shareholder.\n\n## 12.8.2   Dividends received from Subsidiary Companies\n\nConsidering the historical tax status of the dividends received by the Bank from its affiliates and national subsidiaries, it is  expected that in the future dividends will be  received on the basis of non-income tax.  They will not be subject to withholding tax, taking into account that the Bank, its affiliates and national subsidiaries belong to the same business group.\n\n## 12.9      Tax contingent liabilities and assets\n\nIn  the  determination  of  the  effective  current  and  deferred  taxes  subject  to  review  by  the  tax  authority,  the  relevant regulations have been applied in accordance with the interpretations made by the Group Bancolombia.\n\nIn Colombia due to the complexity of the tax system, ongoing amendments to the tax regulations, accounting changes with implications on tax bases and in general the legal instability of the country, the tax authority may at any time have different criteria than that of the Bancolombia Group. Consequently, a dispute or inspection by the tax authority on a tax treatment may affect the Group Bancolombia accounting of assets or liabilities for deferred or current taxes, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12. In the other countries where the Group is present, uncertain tax positions have not not recognized.\n\nFor Colombia, the Group recognizes uncertain tax positions according to the criteria established in the interpretation of IFRIC 23.

Furthermore, the plan specifies the conditions to proceed with the selling process.\n\nThe total balance of assets held for sale, by operating segment, are detailed below:\n\n## As of December 31, 2021\n\n| Assets held for sale                              | Banking    Colombia   | Banking    Panama   | El Salvador  Guatemala   | Banking    Banking   | Total              |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                   | In millions of COP    | In millions of COP  | In millions of COP       | In millions of COP   | In millions of COP |\n| Machinery and equipment                           | 2,277                 | 2,063               | -                        | -                    | 4,340              |\n| Cost                                              | 2,305                 | 2,153               | -                        | -                    | 4,458              |\n| Impairment                                        | (28)                  | (90)                | -                        | -                    | (118)              |\n| Real estate for residential purposes              | 9,119   (1)           | 83,321   (2)        | 7,419                    |                      | 1,355   101,214    |\n| Cost                                              | 9,147                 | 85,315              | 7,642                    |                      | 1,699   103,803    |\n| Impairment                                        | (28)                  | (1,994)             | (223)                    |                      | (344)    (2,589)   |\n| Real estate different from residential properties | 13,817   (3)          | 14,326              | -                        |                      | -    28,143        |\n| Cost                                              | 13,817                | 14,383              | -                        |                      | -    28,200        |\n| Impairment                                        | -                     | (57)                | -                        | -                    | (57)               |\n| Total assets held for sale - cost                 | 25,269                | 101,851             | 7,642                    | 1,699                | 136,461            |\n| Total assets held for sale - impairment           | (56)                  | (2,141)             | (223)                    | (344)                | (2,764)            |\n| Total assets held for sale (4)                    | 25,213                | 99,710              | 7,419                    |                      | 1,355   133,697    |",

The Bank's legal retirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 relates to retired employees who rendered services to the Bank before the current regulations took effect. Under this unfunded plan, benefits are based on length of service and level of compensation. As of December 31, 2021, 555 participants were covered by this plan, and as of December 31, 2020, 603 participants.\n\nFor purposes of the projected assessment of the pension plan obligation, in the absence of an extensive market for highquality corporate debt, the sovereign bond curve of the Colombian government is used, with maturity similar to the residual",

In the opinion of management,  after receiving pertinent legal advice, the payments estimated to be made in connection with these proceedings will not generate significant losses in addition to the provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. In addition, the Bank does not expect to obtain any reimbursement from judicial proceedings raised against it and, therefore, has not recognized any assets for that purpose, see Note 21.2 Contingent liabilities.\n\n## Loan commitments\n\nIn order to meet the needs of its customers, the Bank issues loan commitments, letters of credit and bank guarantees. Loan commitments are those approved irrevocable loans, in which, despite having acquired a commitment to grant them, due to the contract or agreement or for any other reason they are still pending disbursement. See Note 2.D Significant Accounting Policies (7.5.2 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments).\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe Bank issues bank guarantees on behalf of its customers. A bank guarantee represents an irrevocable commitment pursuant  to  which  the  Bank  will  cover,  up  to  the  maximum  amount  guaranteed,a  breach  of  the  client's  contractual obligations  to  third  parties  for  a  certain  period  of  time.  These  are  commitments  issued  by  the  Bank  to  guarantee  the performance of a customer to a third party and are mainly issued to guarantee agreements established between parties from the energy sector, hydrocarbons sector, private sector and public procurement contracts. The Bank expects most of those guarantees  provided  to  expire  before  they  are  used.  See  Note  2.D  Significant  Accounting  Policies  (7.5.2  Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments).\n\nThe events or circumstances that would require the Bank to perform under a guarantee are determined by the type of guarantee:\n\n## Guarantees for the energy sector\n\nThe Bank is responsible before the guarantee's beneficiary in the following situations:\n\n- \u00b7 Lack of energy supply due to a low availability from the generating company (the guaranteed entity).\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with the contract signed by the guaranteed entity.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with the payment of energy supply.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with the construction and operating of power plants.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with the construction and operating of transmission lines.\n\n## Guarantees for the hydrocarbons sector\n\nThe Bank is responsible before the guarantee's beneficiary in the following situations:",

The  object  of  such  agreement  was  the  financing  of  the  project,  optimization,  design  and construction of the wastewater treatment plant PTAR Ch\u00eda I Delicias Sur; as of December 31, 2018, the agreement was in the advances stage (with payment of interest on the disbursements made to the supplier), which refers to the contractual stage in which the proceeds are delivered for the execution of the project in advance of the final payment. The current Mayor of the Municipality of Ch\u00eda has conveyed anomalies he has found in the execution of the aforementioned project and, as a consequence of the aforementioned anomalies, the Contralor\u00eda de Cundinamarca initiated a fiscal responsibility lawsuit  for  an  alleged  patrimonial  detriment  in  public  funds  of  the  amount  of  USD  5,846  against  GEHS  Global Environment and Health Solutions of Colombia (provider), Guillermo Varela Romero, Rafael Antonio Ballesteros G\u00f3mez, Luis Alejandro Prieto Gonz\u00e1lez and Bancolombia S.A.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fiscal responsibility lawsuit is pending for the appeal against the decision of the judge that denied the nullity of a judge resolution.  The pleadings stage has not started yet. The process has a provision of USD 1,145.\n\n## BANISTMO\n\n## Ordinary claim filed by Menelao Mora and Said Diaz:\n\nThe plaintiffs seek payment of the costs of the material and moral damages resulting from a criminal proceeding filed by Banistmo (28-10-2004) against them for alleged criminal acts that caused damage to the Bank because of the unauthorized use of credit lines to enterprises for which they acted as legal representatives.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek damages in the amount of USD 20,000. In initial judgment, Bank was ordered to repair the material damages, product of the criminal process against the plaintiffs, as well as to pay the sum of USD 2,300 to each of the plaintiffs for moral damages.\n\nThe Bank filed an appeal against the initial judgement, alleging errors made in the consideration of the evidence and legal grounds on which the decision was based. The external counsel has labeled this contingency as probable.\n\n## Ordinary Claim filed by Deniss Rafael P\u00e9rez Perozo, Carlos P\u00e9rez Leal et al.\n\nPromotora Terramar (a HSBC client) received USD 299 in payments through Visa Gift Cards issued by U.S Bank, as partial payment for two apartments in Panama City.\n\nThe Credit Card Securities and Fraud Prevention department of the HSBC bank detected an irregular activity promoted by Promotora Terramar on June 3rd, 2008, when a deposit monitoring alert was activated due to the high number of cards with the same BIN and Bank. Therefore, pursuant to the Business Establishments Affiliate Agreement, HSBC held USD 287 from Promotora Terramar's accounts; nevertheless, after further investigations the money was refunded.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed on October 2013 a claim for compensation of the material and moral damages caused, which according to their valuation amounts to USD 5,252,435. Although Banistmo was notified on November 26, 2014, as of December 31, 2021, the process is suspended and pending the initiation of the evidentiary stage. The external counsel has labeled this contingency as remote.",

Plaintiff asked to rescind the public documents effecting the transfer of the property, in which Limipa was the buyer. Limipa then took a credit from Banistmo and guaranteed its contractual obligation with an administration and guarantee trust, which was administrated by Banistmo Investments. Tymsa claims that the signature and fingerprint were forged.\n\nPlaintiff's  claims  are  in  an  amount  up  to  USD  10,000  plus  interests  and  other  expenses.  Banistmo  and  Banistmo Investments have contested their responsibility or guilty conduct related to the transfere of the property. Bank's counselors have qualified this contingency as eventual.

According to resolution of the appeal, the initial resolution from the authority on taxes was modified, adjusting the tax on income to the amount of USD 6,341 and repealing the penalties aware. The Bank intends to bring the case to the Administrative Judges to have nullified the initial decisions. According to external counselors, this contingency is qualified as remote.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Bank has not recorden provisions for this matter.\n\n## ARRENDADORA FINANCIERA S.A. ARFINSA SUBSIDIARY OF BANCO AGR\u00cdCOLA\n\n## Corporaci\u00f3n de Alimentos S.A. de CV- Cordal\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a claim for alleged damages derived from funds wrongfully delivered to third parties that were not entitled to receive said funds. Arfinsa claims that these funds were not under its responsibility as assignee or administrator. The claim seeks USD 6,454. As of December 31, 2021, the process is in the evidentiary stage, specifically in the discovery of accounting records. The external counsel has labeled this contingency as remote.\n\n## BANCO AGROMERCANTIL\n\n## Superintendence of Tax Administration\n\nThe Superintendence of Tax Administration of Guatemala (SAT) made a tax adjustment on the Income Tax return duly paid by BAM for 2014 fiscal year for a value of USD 13.617 (USD 6.808 tax plus 6.808 fine). This adjustment was not reserved for during the administrative pleading phase, therefore the Bank, arguing that the tax was paid correctly, initiated an [adversarial] administrative procedure against the SAT before the Court to oppose the alleged collection.\n\nThis trial is pending the first decision, as of December 31, 2021. There are no provisions recorded for this lawsuit.\n\n## Delicarnes, Sociedad An\u00f3nima\n\nDelicarnes, Sociedad An\u00f3nima, acquired a mortgage loan from BAM and failed to pay its obligation on the agreed date, so BAM filed a collection lawsuit against it. Delicarnes, in addition to opposing the collection lawsuit, filed against BAM an ordinary claim for damages caused, on the basis that Delicarnes believes it did not breach the contract and therefore, should not have been sued.\n\nIn 2021, the court ruled in favor of BAM, in the first instance. The judgement was appealed by the counterparty. As of December 31, 2021, the lawsuit was in appeal stage. There are no provisions recorded for this matter.",

Dividends must be approved at the ordinary general shareholders' meeting upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors. Under the Colombian Commercial Code, after payment of income taxes and appropriation of legal and other reserves, and after setting off losses from prior fiscal years, Bancolombia must distribute to its stockholders at least 50% of its annual net income or 70% of its annual net income if the total amount of reserves exceeds its outstanding capital, unless such minimum percentages are waived by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least 78% of the shares present at the  stockholders' meeting. Such dividend distribution must be made to all stockholders, in cash or in issued stock of Bancolombia, as may be determined by the stockholders, and within a year from the date of the annual general ordinary stockholders' meeting in which the dividend was declared.\n\nThe payment of dividends must be made in cash during the year following the applicable date for the annual general ordinary stockholders' meeting. If the payment is made in the Bank's own equity securities instead of cash, that must be approved by 80% of the outstanding common shareholders and 80% of the outstanding preferred shares.\n\nThe annual net profits of Bancolombia must be applied as follows: (i) first, an amount equal to 10% of Bancolombia's net profits to a legal reserve until such reserve is equal to at least 50% of the Bank's paid-in capital; (ii) second, to the payment of the minimum dividend on the preferred shares; and (iii) third, as may be determined in the ordinary  annual general ordinary stockholders' meeting by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Bancolombia S.A., considering the current capital levels and the results of operations and business of the Bancolombia Group in 2021, and recommended to management to review the dividend policy to increase the percentage of profit distribution to be proposed to shareholders at the next ordinary general shareholders' meeting\n\n|   Dividends declared with respect to  net income earned in: | Cash dividends per share  (Stated in COP)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                                        2021 | 3,120                                       |\n|                                                        2020 | 260                                         |\n|                                                        2019 | 1,638                                       |\n|                                                        2018 | 1,092                                       |\n|                                                        2017 | 1,020                                       |",

The Bank does not have a significant exposure to sub-prime securities. The assetbacked securities are denominated in local market TIPS and accounted for as investment at fair value through profit or loss. These asset-backed securities have different maturities and are generally classified by credit ratings. The Bank does not expect significant changes in those ratings. Also, the Bank retains beneficial interests in the form of servicing fees on the securitized mortgages.\n\nRevenues generated by the Bank's asset management, are derived from the following type of business lines: related trusts, mutual  funds  sold  to  individuals,  corporate  trusts,  escrow  accounts,  private  equity  funds,  and  delegated  tailor-made mandates from third parties. Generally, the revenues correspond to the fees received from the management of resources that  are  invested  in  several  instruments  and  management  of  properties  and  premises  related  to  real  estate  projects  in progress.\n\nLikewise, the Bank receives fees for management assets pledged as collateral for clients' commitments and obligations, and fees from management of resources of government agencies and entities.\n\nOn the other hand, there is not an additional exposure to loss, such as funding commitments with regards to the Bank's involvement with those entities.",

When the Bank incurs costs for providing the service prior to the invoicing, and if these are directly related with a contract, they improve the resources of the entity and are expected to recuperate, these costs correspond to a contract asset. Currently, the Group does not have assets related to contracts with customers.\n\nAs a  practical  expedient,  the  Bank  recognizes  the  incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  as  an  expense  when  the amortization period of the asset is one year or less.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nThe contract liabilities constitute the obligation of the Bank to transfer the services to a customer, for which the Group has received a payment on the part of the final customer or if the amount is due before the execution of the contract. They also include deferred income related to services that shall be delivered or provided in the future, which will be invoiced to the customer in advance, but which are still not due.\n\nThe  contract  liabilities  increased  COP  9,046  in  2021.  The  changes  in  contract  liabilities  are  due  to  performance circumscribed in the contract.\n\nThe following table shows the detail of accounts receivable, and contract liabilities balances as at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n|                                                       | 2021               | 2020               | 2019               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                       | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP |\n| Accounts receivable from contracts with customers (1) | 182,672            | 177,991            | 203,198            |\n| Liabilities from contracts with customers (2)         | 55,025             | 64,071             | 60,791             |\n\n## Fees and Commissions Expenses\n\n| Fees and Commissions Expenses             | 2021               | 2020               | 2019                                |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                           | In millions of COP | In millions of COP | In millions of COP                  |\n| Banking services                          | 798,729            | 587,531            | 585,593                             |\n| Sales, collections and other services (1) | 619,715            | 558,038            | 423,630                             |\n| Correspondent banking (2)                 | 307,308            | 213,850            | 176,326                             |\n| Payments and collections                  | 26,897             | 20,034             | 44,990                              |\n| Others                                    | 108,034            | 182,132            | 322,700                             |\n| Total expenses for commissions            |                    |                    | 1,860,683    1,561,585    1,553,239 |",

EARNING PER SHARE ('EPS')\n\nBasic EPS is calculated by reducing the income from continuing operations by the amount of dividends declared in the current period for each class of stock and by the contractual amount of dividends that must be paid for the current period, considering the allocation of remaining earnings to common stock and participating securities to the extent that each security may share in earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. EPS is determined by dividing the total earnings allocated to each security by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\n\nDiluted EPS assumes the issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The Bank had no dilutive potential common shares as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe following table summarizes information related to the computation of basic EPS for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions of pesos, except per share data):\n\n|                                                                                                   | 2021                   | 2020    | 2019                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|----------------------|\n| Income from continuing operations before attribution of non-controlling interests                 | 4,207,787              |         | 315,359    3,214,567 |\n| Less: Non-controlling interests from continuing operations                                        | 120,992                | 39,365  | 97,216               |\n| Net income from continuing operations                                                             | 4,086,795              |         | 275,994    3,117,351 |\n| Less: Preferred dividends declared                                                                | 59,851                 | 682,876 | 435,810              |\n| Less: Allocation of undistributed earnings to preferred stockholders                              | 1,830,636    (583,718) |         | 998,864              |\n| Net income allocated to common shareholders for basic and diluted EPS                             | 2,196,308              |         | 176,836    1,682,677 |\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in basic EPS  calculation (In millions) | 510                    | 510     | 510                  |\n| Basic and Diluted earnings per share to common shareholders                                       | 4,309                  | 347     | 3,301                |\n| Basic and Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations                                   | 4,309                  | 347     | 3,301                |\n\n## NOTE 28.

In accordance with IFRS the financial instruments are classified as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability being measured take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. Level 2 generally includes: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 : Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair  value  requires  significant  management  judgment  or  estimation.  This  category  generally  includes  certain  retained residual interests in securitizations, asset-backed securities (ABS) and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts where independent pricing information was not able to be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.",

        "page_content": "## \u00b7 Valuation process for fair value measurements\n\nThe valuation to fair value prices is performed using prices, methodologies and inputs provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia) to the Bank. All methodologies and procedures developed by the pricing services provider are supervised by the SFC, which has not objected to them.\n\nOn a daily basis, the back-office Service Valuation Officer (SVO) verifies the valuation of investments, and the Credit and Financial Risk Manager area reports the results of the portfolio's valuation.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\n## Assets and liabilities\n\n## a. Debt instruments\n\nThe Bank assigns prices to those debt investments, using the prices provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia) and assigns the appropriate level according to the procedure described above. For securities not traded or overthe-counter such as certain bonds issued by other financial institutions, the Bank generally determines fair value utilizing internal valuation and standard techniques. These techniques include determination of expected future cash flows which are discounted using curves of the applicable currencies and the Colombian consumer price index (interest rate in this case), modified by the credit risk and liquidity risk. The interest rate is generally computed using observable market data and reference yield curves derived from quoted interest in appropriate time bandings, which match the timings of the cash flows and maturities of the instruments.\n\n## b. Equity securities\n\nThe Bank performs the market price valuation of its investments in variable income using the prices provided by the official pricing services provider (Precia) and classifies those investments according to the procedure described above (Hierarchy of fair value section). Likewise, the fair value of unlisted equity securities is based on an assessment of each individual  investment  using  methodologies  that  include  publicly-traded  comparables  derived  by  multiplying  a  key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, and if necessary considered, are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Interests in investment funds, trusts and collective portfolios are valued using the investment unit value determined by the fund management company. For investment funds where the underlying assets are investment properties, the investment unit value depends on the investment properties value, determined as described below in 'i. Investment property'.\n\n## c. Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe  Bank  holds  positions  in  standardized  derivatives,  such  as  futures  over  local  stocks,  and  over  the  representative exchange rate (TRM). These instruments are evaluated according to the information provided by Precia, which perfectly matches the information provided by the Central Counterparty Clearing House - CCP.\n\nAdditionally, the Bank holds positions in OTC derivatives, which in the absence of prices, are valued using the inputs and methodologies provided by the pricing services provider.\n\nThe key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, the spot price of the underlying volatility, credit curves and correlation of such inputs.\n\n## d. Credit valuation adjustment\n\nThe Bank measures the effects of the credit risk of its counterparties and its own creditworthiness in determining fair value of the swap, option and forward derivatives.",

        "page_content": "Counterparty credit-risk adjustments are applied to derivatives when the Bank's position is a derivative asset and the Bank's credit risk is incorporated when the position is a derivative liability. The Bank attempts to mitigate credit risk to third parties which are international banks by entering into master netting agreements. The agreements allow to offset or bring net amounts that are liabilities, derivates from transactions carried out by the different agreements. Master netting agreements take different forms and may allow payments to be made under a variety of other master agreements or other negotiation agreements between the same parties; some may have a monthly basis and others only apply at the time the agreements are terminated.\n\nWhen assessing the impact of credit exposure, only the net counterparty exposure is considered at risk, due to the offsetting of certain same-counterparty positions and the application of cash and other collateral.\n\nThe Bank generally calculates the asset's credit risk adjustment for derivatives transacted with international financial institutions by incorporating indicative credit related pricing that is generally observable in the market ('CDS'). The creditrisk adjustment for derivatives transacted with non-public counterparties is calculated by incorporating unobservable credit data derived from internal credit qualifications to the financial institutions and corporate companies located in Colombia. The Bank also considers  its  own  creditworthiness  when  determining  the  fair  value  of  an  instrument,  including  OTC derivative instruments if the Bank believes market participants would take that into account when transacting the respective instrument. The approach to measuring the impact of the Bank's credit risk on an instrument transacted with international financial institutions is done using the asset swap curve calculated for subordinated bonds issued by the Bank in foreign currency. For derivatives transacted with local financial institutions,  the Bank calculates the credit risk adjustment by incorporating credit risk data provided by rating agencies and released in the Colombian financial market.\n\n## e. Impaired loans measured at fair value\n\nThe Bank measured certain impaired loans based on the fair value of the associated collateral less costs to sell. The fair values were determined as follows using external and internal valuation techniques or third party experts, depending on the type of underlying asset.\n\nFor vehicles under leasing arrangements, the Bank uses an internal valuation model based on price curves for each type of vehicle. Such curves show the expected price of the vehicle at different points in time based on the initial price and projection  of  economic  variables  such  as  inflation,  devaluation  and  customs.  The  prices  modelled  in  the  curves  are compared  every  six months  with  market  information  for  the  same  or  similar  vehicles  and  in  the  case  of  significant deviation; the curve is adjusted to reflect the market conditions.\n\nOther vehicles are measured using matrix pricing from a third party. This matrix is used by most of the market participants and is updated monthly. The matrix is developed from values provided by several price providers for identical or similar vehicles and considers brand, characteristics of the vehicles, and manufacturing date among other variables to determine the prices.\n\nFor real estate assets, a third-party qualified appraiser is used. The methodologies vary depending on the date of the last appraisal available for the property (the appraisal is estimated based on either of three approaches: cost, sales comparison and income approach, and is required every three years). When the property has been valued in the last 12 months and the market  conditions  have  not  shown  significant  changes,  the  most  recent  valuation  is  considered  the  fair  value  of  the property.\n\nFor all other cases (for example, appraisals older than 12 months) the value of the property is updated by adjusting the value in the last appraisal for weighted factors such as location, type and characteristics of the property, size, structural conditions and the expected sales prices, among others. The factors are determined based on current market information gathered from several external real estate specialists.\n\n## f. Assets held for sale measured at fair value less cost of sale\n\nThe Bank measures certain impaired foreclosed assets and premises and equipment held for sale based on fair value less costs to sell. The fair values were determined using external and internal valuation techniques, depending on the type of",

Those assets are comprised mainly of real estate properties for which the appraisal is conducted by experts considering factors such as the location, type and characteristics of the property, size, physical conditions and expected selling costs, among others. Likewise, in some cases the fair value is estimated considering comparable prices or promises of sale and offering prices from auctions process.\n\n## g. Mortgage-backed securities ('TIPS') and Asset-Backed securities\n\nThe Bank invests in asset-backed securities for which underlying assets are mortgages and earnings under contracts issued by  financial  institutions  and  corporations,  respectively.  The  Bank  does  not  have  a  significant  exposure  to  sub-prime securities. The asset-backed securities are denominated in local market TIPS and are classified as fair value through profit or loss. These asset-backed securities have different maturities and are generally classified by credit ratings.\n\nTIPS are part of the Bank portfolio and its fair value is measured with published price by the official pricing services provider. These securities are leveled by margin and are assigned level 2 or 3 based on the Precia information.\n\nResidual TIPS have their fair value measured using the discounted flow method, taking into account the amortization tables of the Titularizadora Colombiana, the betas in COP and UVR of Precia (used to construct the curves) and the margins; when they are residual TIPS of subordinated issues, a liquidity premium is applied. These securities are assigned level 3.\n\n## h. Investments in associates measured at fair value\n\nThe Bank recognizes its investments in P.A Viva Malls and P.A Distrito Vera as an associate at fair value. The estimated amount is provided by the fund manager as the variation of the units according to the units owned by the FCP Fondo Inmobiliario  Colombia.  The  associate's  assets  are  comprised  of investment  properties  which  are  measured  using  the following techniques: comparable prices, discounted cash flows, replacement cost and direct capitalization. For further information about techniques methodologies and inputs used by the external party see 'Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements'.\n\n## i. Investment property\n\nThe Bank's investment property is valued by external experts, who use valuation techniques based on comparable prices, direct capitalization, discounted cash flows and replacement costs.",

        "page_content": "## Short-term financial instruments\n\nShort-term financial instruments are valued at their carrying amounts included in the consolidated statement of financial position, which are reasonable estimates of fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity of the instruments. This approach was used for cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable, customers' acceptances, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest payable and bank acceptances outstanding.\n\n## Deposits from customers\n\nThe fair value of time deposits was estimated based on the discounted value of cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Fair value of deposits with no contractual maturities represents the amount payable on demand as of the statement of financial position date.\n\n## Interbank deposits and repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowings\n\nShort-term interbank borrowings and repurchase agreements have been valued at their carrying amounts because of their relatively short-term nature. Long-term and domestic development bank borrowings have also been valued at their carrying amount because they bear interest at variable rates.\n\n## Borrowings from other financial institutions\n\nThe fair value of borrowings from other financial institutions were determined using discounted cash flow models. The cash flows projection of capital and interest was made according to the contractual terms, considering capital amortization and interest bearing. Subsequently, the cash flows were discounted using reference curves formed by the weighted average of the Bank's deposit rates.\n\n## Debt instruments in issue\n\nThe fair value of debt instruments in issue, comprised of bonds issued by Bancolombia S.A. and its subsidiaries, was estimated substantially based on quoted market prices. The fair value of certain bonds which do not have a public trading market, were determined based on the discounted value of cash flows using the rates currently offered for bonds of similar remaining maturities and the Bank's creditworthiness.\n\n## Preferred shares\n\nIn the valuation of the liability component of preferred shares related to the minimum dividend of 1% of the subscription price, the Bank uses the Gordon Model to price the obligation, taking into account its own credit risk, which is measured using  the  market  spread  based  on  observable  inputs  such  as  quoted  prices  of  sovereign  debt.  The  Gordon  Model  is commonly used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock based on a future series of dividends that are estimated by the Bank and growth at a constant rate considering the Bank's own perspectives of the payout ratio.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nEstimating the fair value of loans and advances to customers is considered an area of considerable uncertainty as there is no observable market. The loan portfolio is stratified into tranches and loans segments suchs as commercial, consumer, small business loans, mortgage and leasing. The fair value of loans and advances to customers and financial institutions is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology, considering each credit's principal and interest projected cash flows to the prepayment date. The projected cash flows are discounted using reference curves according to the type of loan and its maturity date.\n\n## Items Measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\n\nThe Bank measures assets held for sale based on fair value less costs to sell. This category includes certain foreclosed assets and investments in associates held for sale. The fair values were determined using external and internal valuation",

Changing one or more of the inputs to the valuation models to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would change the fair values and therefore a valuation adjustment would be recognized in profit or loss. Favorable and unfavorable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable input as described in the table below.\n\nThe following table sets forth information about significant unobservable inputs related to the Bank's material categories of  Level  3  financial  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  sensitivity  of  these  fair  values  to  reasonably  possible  alternative assumptions.",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Bank's comprehensive risk management is developed in compliance with current regulations and internal standards as defined by the Board of Directors, in relation to market, credit/ counterparty, liquidity and operational risk. The SFC issued  the  External  Circular  Letter  018  as  of  September  2021,  with  guidelines  for  the  definition  of  the  risk  appetite framework and establishes a system that integrates the management of credit, market, liquidity, operational, counterparty, guarantee, insurance and country risks through the creation of Chapter XXXI \"Integral Risk Management System (SIAR)\" in the Basic Accounting and Financial Circular. This system provides for a comprehensive view of the risks to which an entity is exposed and is in alingment with international practices and recommendations made by multilateral organizations about the matter. In accordance with the requirements of the Circular, in December 2021 the \"Internal Implementation Plan\"  was  sent  to  the  SFC,  denoting  the  activities  proposed  for  the  compliance  and  development  of  the  instructions contained therein. The instructions indicated in the Circular will become effective as of June 1, 2023, with the exception of numeral 10 of Part II of Chapter XXXI related to the aggregation of data on risks and reporting, which will become effective no later than December 31, 2023.\n\nTo  strengthen  comprehensive  risk  management,  the  Bank  has  a  three  lines  of  defense  model,  with  a  cohesive  and coordinated approach, in which its independence is guaranteed. Within the Corporate Governance Framework, the roles of the responsible areas in each line are defined, according to the level of responsibility in Grupo Bancolombia, in order to guarantee effective and efficient coordination among them for risk management (in its different stages) and internal control.\n\nFirst  line:  The  owner  of  risks  and  its  management,  focused  on  self-control.  Performs  the  commercial  and operational management and the administration of controls; including the implementation of actions that ensure processes compliance for risk management.",

For the development of its supervisory functions, the Board has the support of the Risk Committee which is in charge of the approval, monitoring and control of policies,  methodologies, tools, guidelines and strategies for the identification, measurement, control and mitigation of risks. According to the corporate guidelines, the Risk Committee consists of members from the Board of Directors.\n\nThe main function of the Corporate Risk Vicepresidency is to design and propose risk management strategies to the Board of Directors and Senior Management, lead its execution and define the Group's risk appetite, in such a way as to ensure alignment with the corporate strategy of the Group. In addition, it defines the risk guidelines in policies, methodologies and tools for the Group.\n\nThe Risk Corporate Vicepresidency professionals manage the different risks inherent to the activities undertaken in the fulfillment of their responsibilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThird  line : Review  the  first  two  lines,  through  a  risk-based  approach,  guaranteeing  governance  effectiveness,  risk management  and  internal  control.  Provides  the  governance  structures  and  senior  management  with  an  adequate, independent and objective assurance of compliance within the organization.\n\nSpecifically, the Internal Audit function periodically evaluates the execution of the processes and the application of the methodologies for measurement and control of risks that support the operations carried out by the entity, in accordance with current regulations and internal regulations defined by the Board of Directors and Senior Management.\n\n## 31.1 Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of an economic loss to the Bank due to a non-fulfillment of financial obligations by a customer or counterparty and arises principally from the decline on borrower's creditworthiness or changes in the business climate. Credit risk is the single largest risk for the Bank's business; the Bank manages its exposure to credit risk.",

Credit Risk Management - Loans and Advances\n\nCredit risk management during 2021 continued to focus on the deployment of customer support strategies through the possibilities provided by local regulations and structural solutions offered by the bank to obtain repayment. Although the first half of the year was characterized by the most challenging situations related to the economic uncertainty concerning Covid-19 and the public order situation in Colombia, it was offset during the second half by general economic confidence due to the advance of vaccination plans in the countries where the Bank has a presence, as well as the gradual recovery in relevant economic sectors.\n\nUntil  the  third  quarter  of  the  year,  the  bank  continued  to  offer  alternatives  in  force  by  governments,  to  improve  the borrower's ability to repay loans. The key point for these solutions was their agreed application with the customer, knowing structural issues and focused actions tailored to their new economic reality following each country's regulatory framework.\n\nIn December 2021, the relief plans of local governments related to Covid-19 in the markets where the Bank has a presence expired. However, some provisions of those prior relief efforts are still active and are monitored by the Bank. Similarly, the Bank continued to offer alternatives to redefine conditions in the traditional regulatory framework, which includes facilities open to customers affected beyond Covid-19 situations.\n\nThe portfolio of loans subject to active financial is classified as follows:\n\n## December 31, 2021\n\n|                          | In millions of COP      | In millions of COP               |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                          | # financial obligations | Amount  ECL                      |\n| Stage 1                  | 18,900    1,947,617     | 54,551                           |\n| Stage 2                  | 39,067    5,708,061     | 577,688                          |\n| Stage 3                  | 21,693    1,567,188     | 810,867                          |\n| Total Loans and Advances |                         | 79,660    9,222,866    1,443,106 |\n\n## December 31, 2020\n\n|                          | # financial obligations  Amount    | ECL                              |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Stage 1                  | 479,512   17,866,538               | 724,148                          |\n| Stage 2                  |                                    | 220,256    9,782,256   1,458,818 |\n| Stage 3                  |                                    | 77,986    2,277,165   1,330,512  |\n| Total Loans and Advances | 777,754    29,925,959    3,513,478 |                                  |\n\nThe following table shows the 30-day past due loan ratio on portfolio loans that had Covid-19 financial reliefs during 2020 and 2021, and that were ended:",

In  addition,  the  credit  risk  department  has  developed  methodologies  and  manuals  that  specify  the  policies  and procedures for different products and segments managed by the Bank\n\nTo maintain credit quality and manage the risk arising from its lending activities, the Bank has established general loan policies, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit exposure limits: Contains guidelines with regards to the establishment of credit exposure limits. This is set as a result of legal requirements and according to the Bank's internal guidelines.\n- \u00b7 Origination policies: These policies aim to acquire ample and sufficient knowledge of the characteristics of potential borrowers and to select them properly. The risk level of the individual and legal entities is determined using rating and scoring models which define cut-off points that are applied in the process of issuing credit. These models use information such as the credit history of the borrower, sociodemographic particularities, the type of business the borrower engages in, the borrower's ability to repay the loan, and information received from the credit risk bureaus. In  addition,  sectorial  and  macroeconomic  behavior  is  taken  into  account.  Loan  applications,  depending  on  their amount and risk level, are presented for approval at the level of management authority required.\n- \u00b7 Collaterals policies: For the purpose of mitigating risk associated with non-fulfillment of obligations agreed upon by the borrower, the Bank has established policies for the valuation of collateral received as well as for the determination of the maximum loan amount that can be granted against the value of the collateral.",

In addition, this policy is meant to provide the guidelines to analyze the client's status and take the necessary actions in order to mitigate credit risk to which the Bank is exposed. For further information, please see Note 2.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring  policies: Contains  various  monitoring  procedures,  portfolio  reports  and  policies  for  the  purpose  of overseeing, in an adequate and timely manner, the evolution of credit risk. These procedures include a continuous process  of  classification  and  reassessment  of  credit  operations  and  they  maintain  consistency  with  the  policies implemented for granting loans.\n- \u00b7 Portfolio recovery policies: Through these policies, the Bank aims to establish those mechanisms that allow it to anticipate the action to be taken in the event of possible delays and minimize the impact resulting from non-fulfillment of payment or delays by the borrower. Additionally, the aspects established in this policy delimit what the Bank has defined as collection management and that make it possible to obtain information to improve the origination policies and  the  allowances  for  loans  and  advances  and  lease  losses  models.  The  established  actions  are  combined  with strategies to adjust to the economy, market and costumer conditions, allowing the Bank to offer alternatives tailored to each case, such as payment deals, foreclosed assets, cession agreements, modifications, restructuring, and so on.\n\nManagement of credit risk is carried out through all the credit life cycle. These processes are defined in the following way:\n\n- \u00b7 Origination: Knowing the borrower, payment capacity analysis, payment behavior and credit approval and structure.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring: Knowing the borrower's situation during the life of the credit.\n- \u00b7 Recovery: Collection management during the different stages of the same credit.\n\nIn order to support the credit origination processes, the Bank develops models, methodologies and analytic techniques based on statistical information or criteria from experts, which differentiate the risk levels of potential borrowers in order to support the decision-making process.\n\nThe Risk Corporate Vice Presidency is in charge of defining and documenting the specific characteristics of the models, methodologies and analytics techniques, as well as the parameters, variables and the cut-off points that are applied in the process of issuing credit, according to market and product conditions, as well as the appetite framework approved by the board of directors. Those models, methodologies and analytic techniques can incorporate different kinds of variables such as social demographic, qualitative issues, internal and external behavior, product parameters, etc. In addition, as defined for regulatory basis, Risk Corporate Vice Presidency performs back testing to these models and methodologies in order to evaluate their effectiveness, reporting their results to the board of directors.\n\nThe Risk Corporate Vice Presidency establishes through internal guidelines the scoring or cut-off points required in the different process of issuing credit. In the same way, this Vice Presidency can adjust parameters to give a different score considering relevant qualitative and quantitative information, such as customer's sector, financial indicators, historical payment behavior, etc.\n\nMoreover, on a monthly basis, the entire credit portfolio is rated considering the established internal models for the purpose of evaluating the credit risk of each borrower and constitutes the required allowance for loans and advances and lease losses.\n\nIn addition to the evaluation and qualification of the portfolio, the monthly allowance for loans and advances and lease losses serves to measure the present condition of the portfolio and the methodologies used for its calculation serve as a tool to evaluate risk, be it in a collective or individual manner. Collective evaluation of the portfolio applies the following parameters for measuring risk: probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). For",

The analysis is based on the projection of the individual client cash flow, parameters such as recovery rates estimated by models that include financial, behavioral information, collaterals and qualitative variables, which serve as elements to measure risk and define allowances for loans, advances and lease losses for each borrower.\n\nAnnual backtesting must be performed on the allowances for loans and advances and lease losses models for the purpose of maintaining suitable hedge levels in accordance with the Bank's risk appetite.\n\nThe Bank is continuously monitoring the concentration of risk groups, as well as carrying out a daily control of the exposure to different economic groups, evaluating the legal limits of indebtedness in order to fulfill the norms established about the concentration limits.\n\nThe  Bank  performs  international  references  determined  by  the  rankings  of  external  risks  that  allow  the  analysis  of concentration levels in different geographic areas. On the other hand, at the legal level, the Bank is governed by the concepts and methodologies established by the external norms regarding the construction, administration and control of the concentration of economic groups.\n\nThe following classifications are established for the analysis of concentration:\n\n- \u00b7 By country: Based on the country where the loans were originated.\n- \u00b7 By sector: According to the sectorial sub-segmentation defined by the Bank based mainly on the code CIIU 1 .\n- \u00b7 By categories: According to the portfolio category of each agreement (commercial, financial leases, consumer loans, small business loans and mortgages).\n- \u00b7 By economic group: According to the characteristics of economic groups as established by regulations.\n- \u00b7 By maturity: According to the remaining term to loan maturity.\n- \u00b7 By past due days: This concentration evaluates loans that are more than one month overdue.\n\n1 CIIU: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities.\n\n## b.     Credit Quality Analysis - Loans and Financial Leases\n\nAs a result of atypical effects during the year driven by economic and social uncertainty and general risks due COVID19, the Bank continues to apply different strategies focused on analysis and diagnosis of the portfolio, identifying early alerts to provide proactive solutions to their customers. Those strategies are aligned with the common monitoring process made by the Bank and the watch list methodology.\n\n## Rating System for Credit Risk Management\n\nThe principal aim of this rating system is to determine the risk profile of the borrower, which is obtained through a rating.\n\nThe rating for corporate loans is assigned principally based on the analysis of the interrelation of both qualitative and quantitative elements that can affect the fulfillment of the financial commitments acquired by a borrower. Information from financial  statements,  profit  and  loss  statements,  historical  payment  behavior both  with  the  Bank  and  with  other entities, and qualitative information on variables that are not explicit in the financial statements are taken into account.",

The 30-day past due loan ratio (consolidated) stood at 4.55% in December 2021 compared to 5.47% in December 2020, this decrease has been driven by the support given for the bank to costumers, offering tailored relief and financial structures according to the new reality due to COVID-19 effects.\n\n- \u00b7 Commercial loans and finance lease amounted to COP 140,031 billion, which represented an increase of 13.7% with respect to 2020. Its 30-day past due loan ratio was 3.77% compared to 4.90% in December 2020.\n- \u00b7 Consumer loans stood at COP 48,363 billion, which represented an increase of 17.8% with respect to 2020. Its 30day past due loan ratio was 5.63% compared to 6.76% in December 2020.\n- \u00b7 Mortgage loans came to COP 30,647 billion, which represented an increase of 18.06% with respect to 2020. Its 30day past due loan ratio was 6.04% compared to 5.71% in December 2020.\n- \u00b7 Small Business loans ended at COP 1,282 billion, which represented an increase of 4.07% with respect to 2020. Its 30-day past due loan ratio was 12.85% compared to 14.09% in December 2020.\n\nIn order to monitor credit risk associated with clients, the Bank has established regular meetings conducted by the AEC Committee to identify events that can lead to a reduction in borrowers' ability to pay. Generally, clients with good credit behavior could be included in the watch list in case of detecting any event that can lead to future financial difficulties to repay their loans; for instance, internal factors such as the economic activity and sector, financial weakness, impacts of macroeconomic conditions, changes in corporate governance and other situations that could affect clients' business. The amount and allowance of clients included in the described watch list, as of December 31, 2021 and December 2020 is shown below.",

Collateral is considered in the determination of the allowance for loans and advances and lease losses when it complies with the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 Its fair value was established according to technical and objective criteria.\n- \u00b7 The Bank is granted a preference to obtain the payment of the obligation, becoming an effective legal mechanism over it.\n- \u00b7 Its performance is reasonably possible.\n\nThe Bank has defined the criteria for collateral enforceability, which are established according to the classification of the loan portfolio. In addition, the Bank has set guidelines to value collateral and the frequency of such valuations, as well as those guidelines related to the legalization, registry and maintenance of the collateral. Likewise, the Bank has defined the criteria for insurability, custody and the necessary procedures for their cancellation.\n\nThe update of the fair value of mortgages and vehicles collaterals for the loan portfolio is made at least once a year. The methodology used to estimate the fair value of the properties is applied by external and independent entities. Updating the fair value of the vehicles is done through guides and valid values commonly used as reference to set the value of a vehicle. The fair value of real state and vehicles are classified in levels 2 and 3 depending on the observability and significance of the inputs used in the valuation techniques according to the hierarchy established by IFRS 13.\n\nTo determine the suitability of appraiser's selection, there are internal guidelines to be fulfilled related to independence, professional certification, reputation and experience. In a similar way, to validate the appraisal's suitability, the bank has defined guidelines based on current regulations which are related to methodologies, report quality and commercial value.",

The carrying amount of such financial assets is COP 204,268 as at 31 December 2021 and COP 424,883 as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Foreclosed assets and other credit mitigants\n\nAssets received in lieu of payment (foreclosed assets) are recognized on the statement of financial position when current possession of the asset takes place.\n\nForeclosed assets such as immovable and movable property, equity securities and other financial assets, are received based on a commercial valuation, and their net realizable value is given by a specialized team.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, Bancolombia Group recorded non-monetary transactions related to restructured loans and returned assets which were transferred to the balance sheet as assets held for sale that amounted to COP 672,586 and COP 508,040, respectively.\n\nThe Bank classifies foreclosed assets after acknowledgment of the exchange operation according to the intention of use, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-current assets held for sale.\n- \u00b7 Other marketable assets.\n- \u00b7 Other non-marketable assets.\n- \u00b7 Inventories.\n\nCollateral classified as non-current assets held for sale are those expected to be sold in the following 12 months. When there are market restrictions that do not allow their realization in less than 12 months and this period is extended, retroactive depreciation must be charged to results and the asset value will be reduced by the depreciation value.\n\nForeclosed assets classified as non-current assets held for sale are those expected to be sold in the following 12 months. The non-current assets held for sale that cease to comply with the guidelines of immediately sell, must be classified as 'Other marketable assets' and if it's necessary, their book value would be adjusted.",

Credit Quality Analysis - Other Financial Instruments:\n\nIn order to evaluate the credit quality of a counterparty or issuer (to determine a risk level or profile), the Bank relies on two rating systems: an external one and an internal one, both of which allow to identify a degree of risk differentiated by segment and country and to apply the policies that have been established for issuers or counterparties with different levels of risk, in order to limit the impact on liquidity and/or the income statement of the Bank.\n\nExternal credit rating system is divided by the type of rating applied to each instrument or counterparty; in this way the geographic location, the term and the type of instrument allow the assignment of a rating according to the methodology that each examining agency uses.\n\nInternal credit rating system: The 'ratings or risk profiles' scale is created with a range of levels that go from low exposure to high exposure (this can be reported in numerical or alphanumerical scales), where the rating model is sustained by the implementation and analysis of qualitative and quantitative variables at sector level, which according to the relative analysis of each variable, determine credit quality; in this way the internal credit rating system aims to establish adequate margin in decision-making regarding the management of financial instruments.\n\n## Credit Quality Analysis of the Group\n\n|                                 | Debt instruments   | Debt instruments                                                    | Equity                | Equity   | Derivatives (1)   | Derivatives (1)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                 | 2021               | 2020                                                                | 2021                  | 2020     | 2021              | 2020              |\n| Maximum Exposure to Credit Risk |                    |                                                                     |                       |          |                   |                   |\n| Low Risk                        |                    | 24,183,394   25,567,960   256,916   274,916   1,047,939   1,078,261 |                       |          |                   |                   |\n| Medium Risk                     |                    | 2,730,400    2,092,898                                              | 33,627                | 1,590    | 38,521            | 3,380             |\n| High Risk                       |                    | 1,920,034    1,343,064                                              | 12,526                | 5,767    | 3,661             | 1,207             |\n| Without Rating                  | -                  |                                                                     | -   177,084   305,934 |          | -                 | 10,509            |\n| Total                           |                    | 28,833,828   29,003,922   480,153   588,207   1,090,121   1,093,357 |                       |          |                   |                   |\n\nIn  accordance with the criteria and considerations specified in the internal rating allocation and external credit rating systems methodologies, the following schemes of relation can be established, according to credit quality given to each one of the qualification scales:\n\nLow Risk: All investment grade positions (from AAA to BBB-), as well as those issuers that according to the information available (financial statements, relevant information, external ratings, CDS, among others) reflect adequate credit quality.\n\nMedium Risk: All speculative grade positions (from BB+ to BB-), as well as those issuers that according to the available information (Financial statements, relevant information, external qualifications, CDS, among others) reflect weaknesses that could affect their financial situation in the medium term.\n\nHigh Risk: All positions of speculative grade (from B+ to D), as well as those issuers that according to the information available  (Financial  statements,  relevant  information,  external  qualifications,  CDS,  among  others)  reflect  a  high probability of default of financial obligations or that already have failed to fulfill them.",

This company acts on behalf of Bancolombia for making international margin calls and providing a better management of the collateral.\n\nCollateral adjustments for margin agreements: The adjustments will be determined by the criteria applied by both the external and internal regulations in effect, and at the same time, mitigation standards are maintained so that the operation fulfills the liquidity and solidity criteria for settlement. Among the main characteristics by product or market, we have:\n\n- -With respect to the derivative operations, these are carried out daily, with threshold levels of zero for the majority of counterparties, which reduces the exposure to a term that does not exceed 10 days, according to Basel.\n- -For buy-sell backs, repos and other securities financing transactions, daily monitoring is done in order to establish the need to adjust the collateral in such a way that these are applied in as little time as possible, according to the contracts or market conditions.\n- -For  all  international  counterparties,  margin  agreements  that  limit  exposure  to  the  maximum  and  with  a  daily adjustment period are celebrated. These margin agreements are celebrated under ISDA and GMRA (Global Master Repurchase Agreement) 4 both for OTC derivatives and securities financing transactions.\n- -For every local counterparty, the local framework agreement is signed (agreement developed by the industry) and the mitigating actions to apply in each operation are agreed upon, whether for margin agreements, re-couponing, early termination, among others.\n- -For repos, buy-sell backs and other securities financing transactions, these are agreed upon by organized markets that in general implicate complying with haircut or additional collateral rules.\n- -The central counterparty carries out daily control and monitoring processes in order to comply with the rules imposed by these organizations in such a way that we are always making daily adjustments at the demanded collateral level.\n\n## \u00b7 Level of collateral held:\n\n|                                  | Collateral*                | Collateral*   | Main type of collateral   | Main type of collateral   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                  | 2021                       | 2020          | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Maximum Exposure to Credit  Risk |                            |               |                           |                           |\n| Debt Securities                  | (1,214,692)    (2,529,943) |               | Government bonds (TES)    | Government bonds (TES)    |\n| Derivatives                      | (87)                       | (136)         | Cash                      | Government bonds (TES)    |\n| Equity                           | -                          | -             |                           |                           |\n| Total                            | (1,214,779)    (2,530,079) |               |                           |                           |",

        "page_content": "## Effects of Covid-19\n\nThe last quarter of 2021 presented a greater normalization of the economy, driven by a strengthening of domestic demand, so the Central Bank adjusted the monetary policy rate twice, in October and December, by increasing at each meeting of the board 50 bps, placing the interest rate at 3% from the 2.5% observed in September. These increases were based on data related to inflation. Annual inflation ended the year at 5.62%, with the increase in food and non-alcoholic beverages and Accommodation, water, electricity, gas and other fuels divisions contributing to this high figure compared to the end of 2020.\n\nIn international fixed income, the beginning of tapering was observed with reductions of 15 billion dollars in the purchase of assets, with which an increase in rates by the Fed is expected, so the treasury market suffered strong devaluations despite having had a strong rebound in the first 3 quarters of 2021,  however, there are additional pressures on prices due to the behavior  of  economic  activity  in  large  economies  due  to  uncertainties  caused  by  the  container  crisis  and  a  possible resurgence of the Covid-19 virus with the new Omicron variant.\n\nInternational fixed income: The expectation of devaluation of US treasury securities continues, explained by an increase in  Fed  interest  rates,  an  increase  in  global  inflation  affecting  emerging  economies,  explained  by  higher  logistics  and transport costs and a less dynamic labor market, thus revealing a greater aversion to investment.\n\nLocal fixed income: For December, 2021 the monthly trading volume of the TES in the COP and UVR references was reduced to 27.3 Bn, with which there was a decrease of 35.7% versus November, however, there  was an increase of 63% per year, mainly concentrated in TES COP 2024 and TES UVR 2023.\n\nThe local stock market was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, the COLCAP stock index as of 12/31/2021 accumulated an annual decrease of (-1.87%) declining from 1437.89 from 12/31/2020 to 1410.97 at the end of 2021. This is mainly explained by the level of uncertainty at a global level. Despite this, the trading volumes increased with respect to 2020 due to  the  start  of  vaccination  against  COVID-19,  the  stimuli  granted  by  large  economies  for  economic  reactivation  and particulary to the takeover bids offered by Gilinsky group on the Sura and Nutresa stocks.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the buying flows of local shares, for the most part, were from foreign investors, however, this is a risk factor because it is not capital that is established in the long term within the country. This had implications for the exchange rate during the course of 2021 due to the outflow of investments, reversal of operations and profittaking. The performance for the beginning of the year in the local market is due to returns in companies in cyclical sectors such as financial or infrastructure that, despite maintaining latent risks on the credit side, agents see potential for valorization.\n\nAs of December 2021, the consumer confidence index (ICC) presented a balance of (-7%), which indicates a decrease of 5.6  pps  compared  to  November,  this  decrease  is  explained  by  lower  consumer  expectations  in  the  general  economic conditions of the country, however, so far in 2021 a better perception of Colombian households and a willingness to buy durable goods was evidenced, vehicles and housing.",

        "page_content": "## 31.2 Market risk\n\nMarket risk refers to the risk of losses in the Bank's treasury book due to changes in equity prices, interest rates, foreignexchange rates and other indicators whose values are set in a public market. It also refers to the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income and equity economic value as a result of a change in market interest rates.\n\nMarket risk stems from the following activities at the Bank:\n\n- a)    Trading: includes purchase - sale and positioning mainly in fixed income securities, equities, currencies and derivatives, as well as the financial services provided to customers, such as brokerage. Trading instruments are recorded  in  the  treasury  book  and  are  managed  by  the  Treasury  Division  which  is  also  responsible  for  the aggregated management of exchange rate exposures arising from the banking book and treasury book.\n- b)    Balance sheet management: refers to the assets and liabilities management, due to mismatches in maturities and  repricing  of  them.  The  Assets  Liability  Management  Division  is  responsible  for  the  balance  sheet management, preserving the stability of the financial margin and the equity economic value, maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and solvency. Non-trading instruments are recorded in the Bank's banking book (the 'Banking Book'), which includes primarily loans, time deposits, checking accounts and savings accounts.\n\nIn the Bank, the market risks are identified, measured, monitored, controlled and reported in order to support the decisionmaking process for their mitigation, and to create greater shareholder value added.\n\nThe guidelines, policies and methodologies for market risks management are approved by the Board of Directors, thus guaranteeing the congruence and consistency in the risk appetite among subsidiaries. Each country has a local Market and Liquidity  Risk  Management  Office  that  applies  at  an  individual  level  the  principles  of  the  Bank's  Market  Risks Management Strategy. The Board of Directors and senior management have formalized the policies, procedures, strategies and  rules  of  action  for  market  risk  administration  in  its  'Market  Risk  Manual'.  This  manual  defines  the  roles  and responsibilities within each subdivision of the Bank and their interaction to ensure adequate market risk administration.\n\nThe Bank's Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office, responsible for monitoring and permanently controlling compliance with the limits established, is set up with clear independence from the trading and businesses units, ensuring enforcement authority. This independent control function is complemented by regular reviews conducted by the Internal Audit.\n\nThe Bank's Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office is responsible for: (a) identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling the market risk inherent in the Bank's businesses: (b) the Bank's exposure under stress scenarios and confirming compliance with the Bank's risk management policies: (c) designing the methodologies for valuation of the market value of certain securities and financial instruments: (d) reporting to senior management and the Board of Directors any violation of the Bank's risk management policies: (e) reporting to the senior management on a daily basis the levels of market risk associated with the trading instruments recorded in its treasury book, and (f) proposing policies to the Board of  Directors  and  to  senior  management  that  ensure  the  maintenance  of predetermined risk  levels.  The  Bank  has  also implemented an approval process for new products across each of its subdivisions. This process is designed to ensure that each subdivision is prepared to incorporate the new product into its procedures, that every risk is considered before the product is incorporated and that approval is obtained from the Board of Directors before the new product can be sold.\n\nMarket  risks  arising  from  trading  instruments  are  measured  at  the  Bank  using  two  different  Value  at  Risk  (VaR) methodologies: the standard methodology required by the SFC, and the internal methodology of historical simulation. The standard  methodology  is  established  by  'Chapter  XXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular',  based  on  the  model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee. The internal methodology of weighted historical simulation uses a confidence level of 99%, a holding period of 10 days, and a time frame of one year or at least 250 days from the reference date of the VaR calculation is used, obtained from the reference date  of  calculating  the  VaR.  The  standard  methodology  is  used  to  report  the  market  risk  exposure  to  the  Financial Superintendency and is also used to measure the capital requirements for the Bank, therefore the analysis below is based on information obtained from this model.",

        "page_content": "The Bank's VaR limits structure for trading activities, is sufficiently granular to conduct an effective control of the various types of market risk factors on which an exposure is held. It ensures that the market risk is not concentrated in certain asset classes and maximizes the portfolio diversification effect. These limits are defined by companies, products or by risk takers. The majority of the limits are based on the maximum VaR values to which a certain portfolio can be exposed, nevertheless, loss triggers, stop loss and sensitivity warning levels are also set, especially in the derivatives portfolios. The limits are approved by the Board of Directors, and set based on factors such as tolerance for losses, capital resources and market's complexity and volatility. They are monitored daily, and their excesses or violations are reported to the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee.\n\nAdditional measurements like stress tests are done, to identify extreme unusual situations that could cause severe losses. Stress  simulations  include  historical  events  and  hypothetical  scenarios.  Back  testing  or  model  validation  techniques through comparison of predicted and actual loss level are applied on a regular basis to analyze and contrast the accuracy of the VaR calculation methodology in order to confirm its reliability, and make adjustments to the models if necessary.\n\nWithin the control and monitoring processes of market risks, reports are elaborated on a daily and monthly basis. They include an analysis of the most relevant risk measures and allow for monitoring the exposure levels to market risks and to the legal and internal limits established for each one of the levels of the Bank. These reports are taken as an input for the decision-making process in the different Committees and management of the Bank.\n\n## Market Risk Management\n\nThe following section describes the market risks to which the Bank is exposed and the tools and methodologies used to measure these risks as of December 31, 2021. The Bank faces market risk as a consequence of its lending, trading and investments businesses.\n\nThe Bank uses VaR calculation to limit its exposure to the market risk of its Treasury Book. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR based on its assessment of the appropriate level of risk for Bancolombia. The Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR for each company and the Propietary Trading Risks Committee is responsible for establishing the maximum VaR by type of investment. These limits are supervised on a daily basis by the Market Risk Management Office.\n\nFor managing the interest rate risk from banking activities, the Bank analyzes the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities. In addition, the foreign currency exchange rate exposures arising from the banking book are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## a.     Measurement of market risk of trading instruments\n\nThe Bank currently measures the treasury book exposure to market risk (including OTC derivatives positions) as well as the currency risk exposure of the banking book, which is provided to the Treasury Division, using a VaR methodology established in accordance with 'Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular', issued by the SFC.\n\nThe  VaR  methodology  established  by  'Chapter  XXI  of  the  Basic  Accounting  Circular'  is  based  on  the  model recommended by the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of Basel Committee, which focuses on the treasury book and excludes investments classified as amortized cost which are not being given as collateral and any other investment that comprises the banking book, such as non-trading positions excluding the value of the currency the risk position stemming from investment in affiliated but not consolidated entities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the methodology aggregates all risks by the use of correlations, through an allocation system based on defined zones and bands, affected by given sensitivity factors.\n\nThe total market risk for the Bank is calculated by the arithmetical aggregation of the VaR calculated for each subsidiary. The aggregated VaR is reflected in the Bank's Capital Adequacy (Solvency) ratio, in accordance with Decree 2555 de 2010.",

        "page_content": "For purposes of VaR calculations, a risk exposure category is any market variable that is able to influence potential changes in the portfolio value. Taking into account a given risk exposure, the VaR model assesses the maximum loss not exceeded, over a given period of time. The fluctuations in the portfolio's VaR depend on volatility, modified duration and positions changes relating to the different instruments that are subject to market risk.\n\nThe relevant risk exposure categories for which VaR is computed by the Bank according to 'Chapter XXI, Appendix 1 of the Basic Accounting Circular' are: (i) interest rate risks relating to local currency, foreign currency and UVR; (ii) currency risk; (iii) stock price risk; (iv) fund risk. and (v) credit default swaps risk.\n\n## \u00b7 Interest Rate Risk (Treasury Book)\n\nThe interest rate risk is the probability of decrease in the market value of the position due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The Bank calculates the interest rate risk for positions in local currency, foreign currency and UVR separately; in accordance with Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting Circular issued by the SFC.\n\nIn the first instance, the interest rate risk exposure is determined by the sensitivity calculation for the net position of each instrument. This sensitivity is calculated as the net value market product, its corresponding modified duration and the estimated variation of interest rates. The possible variations in the interest rates are established by the SFC according to the historical behavior of these variables in the markets, and they are a function of the duration and currency, as seen in the following table.\n\n|        |      | Modified Duration   | Modified Duration   | Changes in Interest Rates (bps)   | Changes in Interest Rates (bps)   | Changes in Interest Rates (bps)   |\n|--------|------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Zone   | Band | Lower Limit         | Upper Limit         | Legal Currency                    | UVR                               | Foreign Currency                  |\n| Zone 1 | 1    | 0                   | 0.08                | 274                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 1 | 2    | 0.08                | 0.25                | 268                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 1 | 3    | 0.25                | 0.5                 | 259                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 1 | 4    | 0.5                 | 1                   | 233                               | 274                               | 100                               |\n| Zone 2 | 5    | 1                   | 1.9                 | 222                               | 250                               | 90                                |\n| Zone 2 | 6    | 1.9                 | 2.8                 | 222                               | 250                               | 80                                |\n| Zone 2 | 7    | 2.8                 | 3.6                 | 211                               | 220                               | 75                                |\n| Zone 3 | 8    | 3.6                 | 4.3                 | 211                               | 220                               | 75                                |\n| Zone 3 | 9    | 4.3                 | 5.7                 | 172                               | 200                               | 70                                |\n| Zone 3 | 10   | 5.7                 | 7.3                 | 162                               | 170                               | 65                                |\n| Zone 3 | 11   | 7.3                 | 9.3                 | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n| Zone 3 | 12   | 9.3                 | 10.6                | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n| Zone 3 | 13   | 10.6                | 12                  | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n| Zone 3 | 14   | 12                  | 20                  | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n| Zone 3 | 15   | 20                  |                     | 162                               | 170                               | 60                                |\n\nOnce the sensitivity factor is calculated for each position, the modified duration is then used to classify each position within its corresponding band. A net sensitivity is then calculated for each band, by determining the difference between the sum of all long-positions and the sum of all short-positions. Then a net position is calculated for each zone (which consists of a series of bands) determined by the SFC. The final step is to make adjustments within each band, across bands and within each zone, which results in a final number that is the interest rate risk VaR by currency. Each adjustment is performed following the guidelines established by the SFC.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to interest risk primarily arises from investments in Colombian government's treasury bonds (TES).\n\n## \u00b7 Currency (Treasury and Banking Book), Equity (Treasury Book) and Fund (Treasury Book) Risk\n\nThe VaR model uses a sensitivity factor to calculate the probability of loss due to fluctuations in the price of stocks, funds and currencies in which the Bank maintains a position. As previously indicated, the methodology used in these financial statements to measure such risk consists of computing VaR, which is derived by multiplying the position by the maximum",

Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as predictive of future results. The Bank may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by the Bank's VaR models. A VaR model does not calculate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the reasonable judgment of the Bank's risk management personnel.",

Non-trading instruments market risk measurement\n\nThe banking book's relevant risk exposure is interest rate risk, which is the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income as a result of a change in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the Bank's earnings because of timing differences on the repricing of the assets and liabilities. The Bank manages the interest rate risk arising from banking activities in non-trading instruments by analyzing the interest rate mismatches between its interest earning assets and  its  interest  bearing  liabilities.  The  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  exposures  arising  from  the  banking  book  are provided to the Treasury Division where these positions are aggregated and managed.\n\n## \u00b7 Interest Risk Exposure (Banking Book)\n\nThe Bank has performed a sensitivity analysis of market risk sensitive instruments estimating the impact on the net interest income of each position in the Banking Book, using a repricing model and assuming positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points (bps).\n\nThe table 1 provides information about Bancolombia's interest rate sensitivity for the statement of financial position items comprising the Banking Book.\n\nThe  chart  below  provides  information  about  Bancolombia's  interest  rate  risk  sensitivity  in  local  currency  (COP)  at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:\n\nTable 1.

A negative sensitivity denotes a higher sensitivity of liabilities than of assets and implies that a rise in interest rates will negatively affect the Bank's net interest income. In the event of a decrease in interest rates, the impacts on net interest income would be opposite to those described above.\n\n## Total Exposure:\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the net interest income sensitivity in local currency for the banking book instruments, entered for other than trading purposes with positive parallel shifts of 100 basis points was COP 440,094. The change in the net interest income sensitivity between 2021 and 2020 is due to the increase in the sensitivity of float loans.\n\nOn the other hand, the net interest income sensitivity in foreign currency, assuming the same parallel shift of 100 basis points, was USD 21,320 at December 31, 2021, compared with USD 10,568 at December 31, 2020. The increase in net interest income sensitivity due to interest rate risk between 2020 and 2019 occurred due to the  increase  in float loans.",

These positions are maintained mostly in the industrial and financial sectors. The market value of those investments incresed by 23% during the year, from COP 40,502 million as of December 31 st, 2020 to COP 49,925 million as of December 31, 2021, as a result mainly driven by the increase in the market value of the investments in Enka Shares.\n\nThe structural equity positions are exposed to market risk. Sensitivity calculations are made for those positions:\n\n|             |         | December 31, 2021    December 31, 2020   |\n|-------------|---------|------------------------------------------|\n| Fair Value  | 49,925  | 40,502                                   |\n| Delta       | 14.70 % | 14.70 %                                  |\n| Sensitivity | 7,339   | 5,954                                    |\n\nA negative impact of 14.7%, applied to the market value, produces a decrease of COP 7 billion in the structural equity investments market value, from COP 50 billion to COP 43 billion.\n\n## 31.3        Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the inability of a financial firm to meet its debt obligations without incurring unacceptably large losses. Thus, funding liquidity risk is the risk that a firm will not be able to meet its current and future cash flow and collateral  needs,  both  expected  and  unexpected,  without  materially  affecting  its  daily  operations  or  overall  financial condition. The Bank is sensitive to funding liquidity risk since debt maturity transformation is one of its key business areas.\n\nAt the Bank, liquidity prevails over any objective of growth or revenue. Managing liquidity has always been a fundamental pillar of its business strategy, together with capital, in supporting its statement of financial position.\n\nThe Bank's liquidity management model promotes the autonomy of subsidiaries, which must be self-sufficient in their structural funding. Each subsidiary is responsible for meeting the liquidity needs of its current and future activity, within a framework of management coordination at the Bank level. The metrics used to control liquidity risk are developed based on common and homogeneous concepts, but analysis and adaptation are made by each subsidiary.\n\nIn line with best governance practices, the Bank has established a clear division of function between executing liquidity management, responsibility of the Asset and Liability Division, and their monitoring and control, responsibility of the Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office.\n\nThe different  authorities  of  senior  management  define  the  policies  and  guidelines  for  managing  liquidity  risk.  These authorities are the Board of Directors, the Risk Committee, and senior management of the Parent Company, which set the risk appetite and define the financial strategy. The ALCO committees (Asset and liability committee) define the objective positioning of liquidity and the strategies that ensure the funding needs derived from businesses. The ALM division (Asset and liability management) and the Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office support the mentioned committees, which elaborate analysis and management proposals, and control compliance with the limits established.\n\nLiquidity Risks Management Office is responsible for proposing the minimum amount of the liquidity reserve, the policies of the liquidity portfolio, defining premises and metrics in order to model the behaviour of the cash flows, proposing and",

All of the above activities are verified and evaluated by the Internal Audit.\n\nThe measures to control liquidity risk include maintaining a portfolio of highly liquid assets, and the definition of triggers and liquidity limits, which enable evaluating the level of exposure of each one of the entities in a proactive way.\n\nThe methodologies used to control liquidity risk include the liquidity gaps and stress scenarios. The liquidity gaps measure the mismatches of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet position's cash flows, separately for local currency and foreign currency. Regulatory metrics are also applied, in which the contractual maturities are used; and internal models in which the cash flows are adjusted by different ratios, to reflect a more accurate behaviour.\n\nPeriodically, a validation of the policies, limits, processes, methodologies and tools to evaluate liquidity risk exposure is performed, in order to establish its pertinence and functionality, and to carry out the necessary adjustments. The Market and Liquidity Risks Management Office elaborate reports daily, weekly and monthly basis in order to monitor the exposure levels and the limits and triggers set up, and to support the decision-making process.\n\nEach subsidiary has its own liquidity contingency plan, which is tested annually. These contingency plans procure the optimization of different funding sources, including obtaining additional funding from the Parent Company.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Bank's Board of Directors sets the strategy for managing liquidity risk and delegates responsibility for oversight of the implementation of this policy to ALCO committee that approves the Bank's liquidity policies and procedures. The Treasury Division manages the Bank's liquidity position on a day-to-day basis and reviews daily reports covering the liquidity position. A summary report, including any exceptions and remedial action taken, is submitted regularly to Risk Committee and ALCO committees.\n\n## a.     Liquidity risk exposure:\n\nIn order to estimate liquidity risk, the Bank measures a liquidity coverage ratio to ensure holding liquid assets sufficient to cover potential net cash outflows over 30 days. This indicator allows the Bank to meet liquidity coverage for the next month. The liquidity coverage ratio is presented as follows:\n\n| Liquidity Coverage Ratio         |            | December 31, 2021    December 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Net cash outflows into 30 days** | 15,897,163 | 14,073,878                               |\n| Liquid Assets                    | 44,198,889 | 37,757,819                               |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio*        | 278.03 %   | 268.28 %                                 |\n\n## b.     Liquid Assets\n\nOne of the main guidelines of the Bank is to maintain a solid liquidity position, therefore, the ALCO  Committee, has established a minimum level of liquid assets, based on the funding needs of each subsidiary, to ensure, as far as possible, that  it  will  always  have  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  its  liabilities  when  they  are  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Bank's reputation.",

In addition, the transition process to an alternative reference rate could impact the Bank's business, financial condition or result of operations, as a result of:\n\n- \u00b7 An adverse impact in pricing, liquidity, value, return and trading for a broad array of financial products, loans and derivatives that are included in the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Extensive changes to internal processes and documentation that contain references to LIBOR or use formulas that depend on LIBOR.\n- \u00b7 Disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in LIBOR -based products such as fallback language or other related provisions.\n- \u00b7 The  transition  and  development  of  appropriate  systems  and  models  to  effectively  transition  the  Bank's  risk management processes from LIBOR -based products to those based on one or more alternative reference rates in a timely manner; and\n- \u00b7 An increase in prepayments of LIBOR -linked loans by the Bank's clients.\n\nFrom January 2022, products indexed to the SOFR rate began to be offered, additionally it was defined not to carry new operations indexed to the LIBOR rate.\n\nIn turn, as an organization, we will focus during 2022 on the definitions for the transition process of operations that are indexed to LIBOR.\n\n## 31.4 Capital management\n\nThe Capital Management function oversees Shareholders' equity and Bancolombia's capital structure, aiming for value generation through businesses related to financial activities and investments.\n\nThe goal is to have the enough capital to cover unexpected losses, and develope the business plan. To do so, the Capital and Corporate Investments area oversees Bancolombia's capital ratios and uses several mechanisms to optimize such ratios according to forecasted business conditions.\n\nThe monitoring of corporate investments and shareholders' equity, as well as different components of assets and associated risks, is executed for internal and external purposes. The results are presented to the Board of Directors and some support committees to make sure that all risks are properly managed and within risks appetite, guidelines, and regulation.",

Bancolombia  S.A. concluded that it has control over the PA FAI Calle 77 given that it has exposures, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement in the investee and also has the ability to use its power to affect returns from the rental housing activity, through its participation in executive committees, and has the capacity to direct the activity that most significantly affects returns of all business - namely, approval rights over the disposal of the real estate projects.\n\nThe transaction was completed on March 1, 2022, upon Bancolombia S.A.'s obtaining the registration that qualifies it as a lessor of real estate for urban housing from the 'Secretar\u00eda de Habitat' of Bogota. This registration was the condition to which the cession of the fiduciary rights was subject. Therefore, on March 1, 2022, the Group obtained control of the PA FAI Calle 77 Trust, and has an equity interest of 98%. This acquisition reflects the Group's objective to evolve its value",
