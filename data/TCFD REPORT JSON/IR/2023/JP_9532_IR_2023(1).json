Our human capital management strategy puts an emphasis on DE&I (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) to enhance employee engagement and connection to the company, adapting to their increasingly diverse values, ways of work, and even views of life affected by the pandemic. At the Daigas Group, we value a corporate culture that encourages collaboration among talents with diverse values to promote their development.

Simultaneously, we must advance the development of sustainable lifestyles for tomorrow, when today's social issues are resolved by achieving carbon neutrality and other goals for 2050. We believe the trend toward\n\ncarbon neutrality and the mounting instability of energy security will have the most profound impact on the Group's business development in the coming years.\n\nThe Group has been working toward achieving the Long-Term Management Vision 2030, which we announced in March 2017. In formulating the Medium-Term Management Plan 2026: Connecting Ambitious Dreams (CAD2026), we recognized the necessity of ultra-long-term perspectives that stretch beyond 2030.\n\nEnvisioning society around 2030, I imagine we would see greater diversity in values, a technologically advanced society driven by digitalization, and increased calls for companies to address social issues globally. The energy sector is in dire need of a powerful leader in building a pathway toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and implementing practical\n\n## solutions for the goal.\n\nWe aim to become such a pivotal player in the industry and contribute to this vital objective.\n\nThis aspiration is expressed as 'secure peace of mind today, build sustainable lifestyles for tomorrow' in CAD2026. It aligns with the Daigas Group's Corporate Principles and Corporate motto and takes into account ongoing changes in the business environment and our ultra-longterm perspectives. Embracing this aspiration, the Group strives to respond to immediate changes and devise solutions for a sustainable future.\n\n## Intentions incorporated in the Medium-Term Management Plan (CAD2026)\n\nTo realize this aspiration, we have identi/fied Three\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nw\n\nF",

The /first Commitment is to co-create value for a sustainable future by addressing social issues through the two-pronged approach of advancing carbon neutrality and promoting the use of natural gas. The second Commitment is to support employees in shining in their roles by cultivating a corporate culture that encourages the development of diverse talent through collaboration. The third Commitment is to evolve the business foundation by executing asset-light management throughout the Group. Our goal is to achieve the Group's continued growth and contribute to realizing a sustainable society.\n\nUnder our /first Commitment to co-create value for a sustainable future, we are developing e-methane technologies, building its supply chains, and working toward expanding renewable energies. We are also facilitating wider usage of natural gas as a key transition fuel globally to contribute to CO2 emissions reduction in the near term. In addition, we are responding swiftly to new developments in e-methane, such as the recent announcement of the Japanese government's Basic Hydrogen Strategy, which has garnered increased public recognition of e-methane. We are leveraging this opportunity to expedite our efforts to incorporate e-methane into international rules for CO2 emissions.\n\nWe are also improving our services with our digitalization solutions. We pursue advanced data utilization to provide comfortable lifestyles for residential energy customers. For commercial and industrial energy customers, we offer\n\nexpanded energy-related services, such as D-Lineup, to enhance their corporate value.\n\nEnergy safety, security, and resilience are essential in achieving our value co-creation. We take measures to reinforce the safety and stability of energy supply chains by striving for zero serious accidents and zero supply disruptions caused by our own company. We also aim to boost the resilience of customers and society by promoting the development and widespread use of fuel cells and other disasterresistant equipment and energy systems.\n\nOur second Commitment to support employees in excelling in their roles follows our Charter of Business Conduct, in which we advocate providing a work environment that supports employee development. This Commitment is also in sync with the ongoing changes in the environment surrounding our people.\n\nIn recent years, the values of working individuals have increasingly diversi/fied, accompanied by signi/ficant changes in the working environment. We have entered an era in which individual employees proactively manage their own drive and motivation toward their work. We /firmly believe that our distinctive corporate culture, which we have cultivated through many years of business operations, sets the standards for their judgements and actions. It also serves as the basis for improving the quality of work and the organization's solidarity. The corporate culture plays a crucial role in these times of growing diversity and uncertainty. We foresee a time when companies are chosen based on their corporate culture that resonates with customers, communities, and workers.\n\nSuch selected companies will attract more diverse talent and enhance corporate value through their collaboration where they are encouraged to perform to their fullest potential. This is what we aim to be, and we concentrate our efforts on acquiring, developing, upgrading, and deploying skilled talent to align with job requirements.\n\nI strongly believe that it is people who drive corporate activities, and I communicate this belief to employees whenever I have the opportunity. In my regular workplace visits and dialogues with employees, I talk with them about how to make our company more attractive and our working environment more comfortable. The employees always display a strong awareness, further strengthening my determination to respond to their expectations. I am dedicated to fostering a work environment where all employees have growth opportunities and derive satisfaction from collaborative efforts. I am con/fident that such a work environment will lead to the advancement and evolution of the Daigas Group.\n\nIn our third Commitment to evolve the business foundation, we are implementing asset-light\n\nPresident's dialogue with junior staff /filmed and posted on the inhouse website.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This committee, whose members include the heads of related organizations, coordinates and promotes sustainability activities in a cross-organizational manner. The setting of key issues (materiality), indicators and targets for ESG management, the status of achievement, and other matters are submitted to and deliberated at the ESG Council. The Board of Directors is then consulted on important matters related to sustainability activities and is responsible for decision-making and supervision.\n\nThe Group has also established the Environment Subcommittee, Social Contribution Subcommittee, and Compliance/Risk Management Subcommittee, and works closely with the subcommittees in promoting sustainability activities.\n\n## Identification of Materiality\n\nIn formulating the Medium-Term Management Plan 2026, the Daigas Group identi/fied materiality in light of experts' opinions and other factors, taking into account the progress of climate change countermeasures, changes in the business environment, and social trends related to sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Identified Materiality\n\n|   1 | Provide carbon neutral energy                                                             |\n|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2 | Enhance the resilience of customers and society                                           |\n|   3 | Co-create advanced, diverse solutions that meet customer values                           |\n|   4 | Create a work environment where employees and the company resonate and enhance each other |\n|   5 | Maintain and improve the soundness and flexibility of management foundation               |\n\n- \u25a0 Sustainability Promotion System (As of April 1, 2024)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Comments from an Expert\n\n## Identification of Materiality at the Daigas Group\n\nWhile the process for identifying materiality has not changed signi/ficantly from FY2021.3, when the previous MediumTerm Management Plan was formulated, relevance to corporate strategies is clearer this time. This can be attributable to the fact that materiality was identi/fied with consideration given to medium- to long-term targets, including the Carbon Neutral Vision announced in January 2021 to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. As with the last time, the Daigas Group adopted the idea of so-called double materiality, where both /financial impacts and social and environmental impacts are taken into account. This approach can be considered appropriate as the Group engages in infrastructure-related businesses that have considerable social and environmental impacts.\n\nHidemi Tomita CEO, Institute for Sustainability Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe identi/fied materiality has a limited number of\n\nelements, indicates overall directions, and is clearly aligned with 'Key Strategy: the Three Commitments' in the Medium-Term Management Plan 2026. When it comes to KPIs that are linked with materiality, /financial indicators are increasingly integrated with sustainability indicators with an eye on 2026, the target /fiscal year of the Medium-Term Management Plan. Meanwhile, part of the targets are qualitative. Going forward, I expect the Group to improve accountability for such targets and /fine-tune them.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite these challenges, we made progress in portfolio-focused management and business foundation enhancement.\n\n(See Page 19 for a review of the major indicators and Page 18 for trends in ordinary profit and segment profit.)\n\nMeeting the management indicator targets of Medium-Term Management Plan 2023\n\nManagement indicator targets of Medium-Term Management Plan 2026 and initiatives aimed at achieving them\n\nIn FY2024.3, the /final year of the Medium-Term Management Plan 2023, our investments in the International Energy segment led to signi/ficant pro/fit growth.\n\nIn addition, the Domestic Energy and Life & Business Solutions (LBS) segments achieved steady growth, and market conditions generated positive outcomes, such as foreign exchange gains from the weakened yen. As a result, our FY2024.3 ordinary pro/fit reached 198.0 billion yen, excluding time-lag pro/fit (or 226.5 billion yen, including time-lag pro/fit), far exceeding the forecast of 120.0 billion yen.

Our CN projects include renewables and the e-methane value chain, which form the essential foundations for our future growth in alignment with the transition to a CN society.\n\nROE: 7.5% ref. target in Medium-Term Management Plan 2023 \u2192 Approx. 8% in FY2027.3 and approx. 10% early in 2030s\n\nROE has been upgraded from a reference target in the previous medium-term plan to a key management indicator on the same level as ROIC. We will work to improve ROE from the dual aspects of increasing pro/fit and controlling shareholders' equity.\n\nShareholders' equity ratio: Approx. 50% in MediumTerm Management Plan 2023 \u2192 45% or higher in FY2027.3\n\nD/E ratio: Approx. 0.7 in Medium-Term Management Plan 2023 \u2192 0.8 or lower in FY2027.3\n\nOur targets for shareholders' equity ratio and D/E ratio have also been updated through the comprehensive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconsideration of factors, such as the shareholders' equity needed against risks and the impact of risks on our credit rating. This update was prompted by the increased operating cash /flow due to steady growth in the International Energy and LBS segments, as well as the improved stability of the management foundations resulting from the enhanced robustness of our business portfolio.\n\nEffective July 2024, the indicator used to determine performance-linked remuneration for executives responsible for business execution was changed from pro/fit attributable to owners of the parent to ROE and others. This change is intended to provide additional motivation for them to reach the Medium-Term Management Plan 2026 targets.\n\n## Asset-light management throughout the Group\n\nSince FY2022.3, the Daigas Group has pursued ROICfocused management, improving earning capacity and constructing a robust business portfolio. We also strive to evolve the business foundation, which is one of the Three Commitments of our Key Strategy in the Medium-Term Management Plan 2026. Our aim is to enhance corporate value without compromising capital ef/ficiency while investing in the CN /field and other future growth drivers. Furthermore, we intend to improve capital ef/ficiency through asset-light management, which is to identify value-generating assets in our portfolio and maximize their value.\n\nThe aim of asset-light management is to pursue securing value-generating assets as the sources of competitive edge and added value for our business, which are prioritized over non-value-generating ones. An example of our asset-light management is renewable energy projects, where we aim to maximize our off-take instead of pursuing ownership. We promote the implementation of asset-light management in each business to take maximum advantage of the asset value and enhance asset ef/ficiency.\n\n \n\n## Balanced investment in immediate growth drivers and future business foundations\n\nTo achieve sustainable growth, we pursue balanced investment in two types of business /fields. The /first is the primary growth /field, where we aim to expand pro/fitability during the immediate transition period. The second is the CN /field, where we lay the groundwork for future business development. Our total planned investment in these two areas amounts to 560.0 billion yen. Approximately 460.0 billion yen is earmarked for the primary growth /field (FY2025.3FY2027.3), including the construction of the Himeji Natural Gas Power Plant, other power business development, acceleration of shale gas production in the United States, and business expansion in the LBS segment. Approximately 100.0 billion yen is allocated to the CN /field, including renewable energy development in Japan and e-methane introduction to the Japanese market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FY2025.3 - FY2027.3\n\n- \u25cf Investment in immediate earnings drivers in the primary growth /field\n- Approx. 460 billion yen for thermal power plants, shale gas development, LBS, etc.\n- \u25cf Investment in future business foundation in the CN /field Approx. 100 billion yen for domestic renewable energy, e-methane, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has produced results. Under the Medium-Term Management Plan 2026, we aim to increase capital ef/ficiency and improve corporate value, while investing in the carbon neutrality /field and taking other measures to develop businesses for the future. To this end, we will take an asset-light approach to management, identifying sources for the generation of value in each area and maximizing the value of the assets we hold.\n\n\u25a0\n\n## Business Units and Main Businesses\n\n## Initiatives through FY2024.3\n\nWe introduced ROIC as a management indicator in the Medium-Term Management Plan 2023. Business units and corporate headquarter divisions worked together to improve ROIC while paying attention to capital costs (WACC).\n\nEach business unit rolled out initiatives autonomously and speedily, such as selling assets that have completed their purpose and taking other measures for asset replacement, implementing initiatives to raise NOPAT* 1 , and improving asset ef/ficiency by securitizing Group-owned real estate, etc. The headquarters divisions worked to deepen ROIC-focused management by reviewing medium-term business plans and resource allocation. *1 NOPAT=Ordinary pro/fit + Interest expenses - Interest income - Income taxes\n\n## Challenges\n\nIn light of changes in the business environment, such as the accelerating carbon neutral trend and soaring energy prices, we need to increase capital ef/ficiency and improve corporate value, while making investments in renewable energy and e-methane to prepare for a carbon-neautral future.\n\nNecessary measures to achieve this include expanding pro/fits by increasing the value of existing businesses and assets, taking advantage of our strengths developed in existing businesses and working on new businesses that enable value increase, and selling or moving off-balance sheet businesses and assets of lower capital ef/ficiency.\n\n## Initiatives Implemented under the Medium-Term Management Plan\n\n<!--

From FY2025.3 onward, we will continue with the discussions in each organization, identify issues, and advance transformation.\n\n## System reform\n\nIn FY2024.3, we introduced SaaS in such operations as sales, accounting, and internal communications, promoting operational reforms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAims of \"Daigas X\" are communicated and shared within the Group\n\nWe offered an environment where employees can try using generative AI, with information security guaranteed. More than 700 employees used it, and we con/firmed that ef/ficiency improved in such tasks as summarizing documents and drafting answers to inquiries. Going forward, we plan to expand the scope of use while paying attention to the accuracy of information, security, and other issues.\n\nIn FY2025.3, we will introduce an environment where all employees can use generative AI, accelerating new value creation and operational reform even further.\n\n## \u2778 DX Promotion Structure Enhancement\n\n## Promotion structure that aims to integrate business with digital\n\nIn FY2024.3, a new training program for managers was launched to improve their skills and transform their mindset. This adds to the lectures by and dialogues with external experts in place for the management since the previous year. We also enhanced the development of DX core staff, who play a core role in DX promotion. By implementing a development program that includes lectures, OJT, and feedback interviews and taking other measures, we have developed a total of approximately 180 DX core staff members as of April 2024. In addition, we offered a self-learning support program on DX for all employees, and approximately 700 employees took the program.\n\nFurthermore, OGIS-RI Co., Ltd. offers DX Practical Training, which is a service where IT professionals work together with organizations to help resolve issues. More than 100 cases a year were submitted for consultation. There was a case where using IT tools in answering inquiries halved the hours spent on the task. The training also functions as an opportunity to gain experience on DX while implementing the transformation. With these initiatives, we aim to build a system where top-down and bottom-up approaches create synergy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u25a0\n\n## Development Program by Job Level\n\n| Job level     | Development program                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Management    | \u25cf  Lectures by and dialogues with external experts  held about once a month (approx. 20 participants)                                                                      |\n| Managers      | \u25cf  Rollout of videos and textbooks to gain basic  knowledge, group training for part of managers                                                                           |\n| DX core staff | \u25cf  Development program including lectures, OJT,  and interviews (developed a total of approx. 180  employees)                                                              |\n| All employees | \u25cf  E-learning, courses for obtaining qualifications \u25cf  Share lectures for the management \u25cf  Offer a self-learning support program that mainly  consists of online learning |\n\ns",

From the Japanese government, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Financial Services Agency, and the Ministry of the Environment participate as observers in the consortium.\n\n## Climate Change Governance\n\nThe Daigas Group regards tackling climate change as a key management issue. Just as with other important business activities across the Group, the Board of Directors is responsible for making decisions on and supervising activities aimed at tackling climate change and other environmental issues. At the ESG Council (Management Meeting), which is held three times a year, executives discuss activity plans and activity reports related to ESG issues, including climate change issues, and submit reports to the Representative Director and President.\n\nThe Group also has the ESG Committee, chaired by the Head of ESG Promotion (Representative Director and Executive Vice-President), an executive who supervises the Group's sustainability activities, and consisting of the heads of related organizations. The ESG Committee meets three times a year for cross-organizational deliberation, coordination, and supervision of climate-change-related issues, including the planning and promotion of related business activities, progress in achieving relevant targets, and risk management and countermeasures. The committee submits to the Board of Directors deliberation proposals and reports on important agenda items, such as the status of achievement of sustainability-related ESG management targets and business projects expected to sustain a major financial impact due to climate change.\n\nDirectors other than Outside Directors are paid performance-linked remuneration, and the coefficient of ESG indicators achievement is used as one of the performance indicators. ESG indicators include CO2 emissions and other climate change-related indicators toward achieving carbon neutrality.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## \u25a0 Governance/Risk Management System for Climate Change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n## Plan formulation\n\n- Response to cross-cutting\n\n2\n\nissues relating to climate change*\n\n- - Formulation of strategies relating to climate change* 2\n- - Re/flection in activities of each organization\n- *2 Including risks and opportunities associated with climate change\n\n## Implementation/Operation\n\n- - Actions for each target - Performance tracking for each indicator\n\n## Checking\n\n- - Report and follow-up for each target and performance at the Environment Subcommittee, ESG Committee, and ESG Council (Management Meeting); third party veri/fication of environmental performance data\n\n## Review\n\n- - Identi/fication of issues - Evaluation and implementation of countermeasures\n- \u2605 Establishment of Carbon Neutrality Promotion Of/fice (April 2022) Oversight of establishment and promotion of strategies to achieve carbon neutrality; coordination, planning promotion and follow-up with each organization and af/filiate.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nThe Group has been working on climate change scenario analysis using scenarios published by an external organization (International Energy Agency, IEA) with the aim of understanding the impact of climate change on the Group's business on a medium- and long-term basis and using its results as reference material for evaluating and preparing countermeasures.\n\nWe assessed our energy businesses (gas, electricity and related businesses in Japan and overseas) which are expected to experience the greatest impact from climate change\n\namong the Group's businesses, assuming the scenarios that take into account the progress of energy conservation and changes in the composition of power sources, etc. (1.5\u02daC Scenario\n\n3\n\n(NZE2050) and 2.6\u02daC Scenario (STEPS)*\n\n).\n\nWe steadily implement initiatives to increase the resilience of the Group's businesses, while applying the suggestions gained from scenario analysis to our evaluation of medium- and long-term business strategies. Moreover, as the global response to climate change continues to progress, the scenario's preconditions may also change in the future. We will continue to deepen our scenario analysis, renewing our assumptions in line with the latest conditions as necessary, taking into account scenarios established by external authorities.\n\n*3 Authority: IEA 'World Energy Outlook 2021'",

The external environment is undergoing various changes due to climate change. We have classi/fied the major factors associated with these changes into 'transition risks' and 'physical risks,' and identi/fied the major risks and opportunities. Signi/ficant risks for the Group related to climate change include the possibility that rising sea levels and natural disasters such as typhoons and torrential rains due to localized abnormal weather events, etc. may cause damage to our manufacturing/distribution equipment. In addition, it is possible that our businesses may be affected by signi/ficant increases in the carbon tax rate in Japan, or an increased desire among our customers to switch to non-fossil fuels. However, promotion of the development and spread of renewable energy and technologies for carbon neutrality also represents a signi/ficant opportunity for the Group.\n\nThe Group will pursue sustainable growth by promoting portfolio management through diverse businesses in order to respond appropriately to the identi/fied risks and opportunities.\n\n## \u25a0 Evaluation of Risks and

        "page_content": "## Financial Impact of Climate Change Risks and Opportunities\n\nIn its Medium-Term Management Plan 2026, the Daigas Group expects to invest 100.0 billion yen in the carbon neutral /field (renewable energy, e-methane, etc.) for a future earnings structure as investment for growth from FY2025.3 to FY2027.3.\n\nThe Daigas Group is actively contributing to the spread of renewable energy, and estimates that the sales impact of expanding its renewable energy business in FY2031.3 will be on the order of 100 billion yen.\n\nIt should be noted that there are uncertainties and assumptions in the above estimation of /financial impact. In practice, the impact may vary signi/ficantly as a result of changes in key factors.\n\n## Initiatives to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nInitiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are a crucial mission for the Daigas Group. We focus on reducing CO2 emissions, not only from our own business activities, but also from customers who use the energy we provide. In the Daigas Group Energy Transition 2030 (ET2030), we have set a target of reducing CO2 emissions in our domestic supply chain by 5 million tons by FY2031.3 compared to FY2018.3, and we are taking various initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nUnder the Daigas Group Carbon Neutral Vision, we have established the goal of contributing 10 million tons per year of CO2 emissions reductions in FY2031.3. This indicator will enable us to contribute to reductions throughout society, and we therefore use it as a management target linked to the Group's business initiatives.\n\n## Initiatives Ensuring Resiliency for a Carbon Neutral Society\n\nSecuring a stable supply of energy, a core social infrastructure, is one of the major climate change-driven challenges facing society as a whole. By continuing to provide a range of services, including multiple sources of clean energy such as gas and electricity utilizing technologies for carbon neutrality, disaster response equipment, and the widespread and advanced use of energy, the Daigas Group will strive to contribute to society in terms of stable supply and resilience toward a carbon neutral society.\n\nThe Daigas Group will aim to achieve both business growth and stable social infrastructure, and promote activities that contribute to reducing CO2 emissions throughout society, promote the advanced use of gas, and develop technologies for carbon neutrality, in response to the growing global trend toward carbon neutrality.\n\nPlease see P.33-P.37 for an overall picture of the Daigas Group's efforts to provide carbon neutral energy.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nWhen deciding on the Daigas Group's business plan and investment plan, the internal organizations responsible for the gas, electricity and other businesses analyze the risk factors and their impact on each business, distill and identify risks, and submit these together with other business risks, etc. to the Management Meeting for deliberation. Climate change risks in the formulated plans are managed through a PDCA cycle, and are reported and followed up at the Environment Subcommittee, ESG Committee, and ESG Council (Management Meeting).\n\nDecisions on climate-related risks and sustainability, including investment decisions, are made by the Board of Directors and the Management Meeting. Matters related to climate change that were proposed or reported by March 31, 2024, included those listed below.\n\n- \u25cf   Resolutions for collaboration and participation in projects for a carbon neutral society, based on the Carbon Neutral Vision\n- \u25cf   Formulation and disclosure of Medium-Term Management Plan 2026\n- \u25cf   Monitoring of the results for indicators used to manage climate change response, etc.\n\nPlease see P.49 for the risk management system for climate change\n\n## Indicators and Targets\n\nThe Daigas Group will proceed to contribute to radically reducing CO2 emissions and realizing a carbon neutral society, through initiatives such as energy conservation, the advanced use of natural gas, and the widespread use of renewable energies.\n\n| Field

In accordance with 'the Daigas Group Human Rights Policy,' we are undertaking efforts that promote respect for human rights and the achievement of sustainable business growth by promoting the Human Rights Due Diligence.\n\n## Human Rights Due Diligence\n\n## System for Carrying Out Human Rights Due Diligence\n\nThe Human Rights Center in the Human Resources Dept., Compliance Of/fice and Internal Control Planning Team in the General Affairs Dept., and the ESG Of/fice in the Corporate Strategy Dept. work together to promote human rights due diligence activities.\n\nThe Board of Directors, which makes decisions on and supervises the important business activities throughout the Group, supervises matters involving human rights issues. At the ESG Council (Management Meeting), which is held three times a year, executives discuss activity plans and activity reports related to ESG issues, including human rights issues, and submit reports to the President.\n\nIn addition, the Group also has the ESG Committee, chaired by the Head of ESG Promotion (Representative Director and Executive Vice-President), who supervises the Group's sustainability activities, and consisting of the heads of related organizations. The ESG Committee is held three times a year in principle for cross-organizational deliberation, coordination, and supervision of issues and planning, promotion related to human rights due diligence.\n\n## Initiatives Undertaken in FY2024.3\n\nIn FY2024.3, we continued to conduct checks through the 'G-RIMS,' a self-inspection tool, a compliance survey of employees to see how well they understood compliance, and questionnaire surveys targeting major business partners of the Group. In addition, upon receiving opinions from external experts in the previous /fiscal year that highly serious human rights issues may occur overseas, we have worked to identify and address human rights risks at our overseas subsidiaries. We undertook efforts to gradually expand the scope of our investigation, including starting to conduct questionnaire surveys targeting major suppliers and conducting on-site audits by adding the con/firmation of human rights risks to the existing quality audit framework.\n\nThe investigation results showed no serious risks related to human rights.\n\n## \u25a0 Matrix Assessment of Human Rights Risks\n\nSeverity of infringement\n\n  \n\n<!-- image -->\n\n  \n\nLikelihood of occurrence\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, no signi/ficant changes from FY2023.3 were identi/fied.\n\nAmong the human rights risks that may occur in the course of the Group's business activities, 14 items were identi/fied as signi/ficant human rights risks. Such risks include forced labor, child labor, and bribery/corruption in the oversea business, and infringement of the rights of foreign workers or technical interns in the domestic business, in addition to lack of consideration for occupational health and safety, infringement of human rights caused by excessive working hours or unpaid wages, and harassment. We take various measures to prevent and mitigate these risks, under relevant policies and other systems.\n\nIn addition, during discussions with experts, recommendations were made regarding the importance of assessing human rights risks by business in the value chain, and continuing to conduct surveys, investigation, and audits in areas identi/fied as those with key human rights risks. We will continue to consider and respond to such issues.\n\nWe also assess human rights risks in new businesses. For example, we investigate the status of legal compliance concerning labor standards and health and safety as part of due diligence for M&A deals. We thus con/firm that serious human rights issues do not exist in companies joining the Group.\n\n## Initiatives for Compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's view on compliance is that it is not only about observing laws and regulations but also entails sensible corporate activities based on sound ethics. Recognizing that to maintain trust of stakeholders, it is essential to ensure that of/ficers and employees put compliance into practice, we are continually conducting training sessions and employee surveys to raise awareness.\n\nIn addition, 'Compliance Desks' have been established as one of the systems for early identi/fication of incidents of violations of laws and regulations or misconduct, and for prompt and appropriate response.\n\n## Initiatives Undertaken by the Compliance Desks (Internal Reporting System) in FY2024.3\n\nThe desks accepted a total of 173 consultations and reports in FY2024.3. We examined the necessity of factual investigations on these cases and conducted interviews, evidence checks, etc. Measures to remedy the situation and prevent recurrence were taken as necessary. We found no serious violations of laws and regulations.\n\nWhen cases are brought to the 'Compliance Desks,' violations of laws and regulations, etc., are remedied if any violations are found in the investigations. Even if no violations are found, improvements are made as necessary in order to maintain and improve a sound work environment.\n\nThe content of report accepted, investigation results, remedies, and other matters are reported to and shared by the Compliance/Risk Management Subcommittee and the ESG Committee to prevent recurrence.\n\n## \u25a0 Number of Consultations and Reports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u25a0\n\nBreakdown of Report Content in FY2024.3",

to questions regarding the status of discussions at the Board of Directors in the formulation of the Medium-Term Management Plan, evaluation of 2026 targets by Outside Directors, and views on the transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, from his perspective as an Outside Director who had led governance reform.\n\nParticipants made comments such as 'it was a good meeting

        "page_content": "##   Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\n\u25a0 Niizeki: Since joining the Board of Directors as an Outside Director appointed in June 2023, I have observed the effectiveness of our corporate governance. I appreciate how promptly governance issues are addressed.\n\nMeanwhile, I would like us to discuss the company's purpose and long-term challenges more thoroughly. To deepen such discussions, we should explore ways to stay updated on each line of work, besides management information, more closely than ever.\n\n\u25a0 Sato: I agree. During the previous Medium-Term Management Plan period, the entire company had to focus on addressing short-term issues, such as the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Freeport LNG's plant shutdown. Osaka Gas' decision to transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, as resolved at the June 2024 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, signi/fies the company's commitment to further exploring management policies and long-term strategies while enhancing corporate governance.\n\nAt the Remuneration Advisory Committee that I chair, we engage in dynamic discussions on of/ficers' remuneration and other pertinent matters. The debate about introducing ROE as an indicator for performance-linked remuneration was a signi/ficant step toward achieving the Medium-Term Management Plan 2026 goals.\n\n\u25a0 Kijima: I believe the Board of Directors operates effectively, with mechanisms being reinforced every year. Following our transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, it would be bene/ficial for the Board to strengthen relationships of\n\ntrust with organization heads and devote more discussion to the company's directions.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial to discuss future plans while reviewing the progress of the Medium-Term Management Plan execution. I believe that incorporating long-term, medium-term, and short-term perspectives in discussions will further enhance the effectiveness of the Board.\n\n\u25a0 Murao: I have observed a corporate culture that values open and honest communication in the Board of Directors meetings, which is valuable for its effectiveness. Separately from the Board of Directors, we also hold Outside directors' meetings, where discussions become more extensive every year. It is critical to continue aiming higher instead of settling for the status quo. I am con/fident that transitioning to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee will further enhance the Board of Directors as a platform for more substantive discussions. As Ms. Niizeki pointed out, it is essential for us to remain updated on current issues by engaging with relevant personnel, including Executive Of/ficers, to facilitate well-informed discussions on general subjects.\n\n## Discussions during the development of the Medium-Term Management Plan 2026 (CAD2026)\n\n\u25a0 Kijima: When formulating CAD2026, I emphasized the need for a thorough review of the results of the previous plan. I believe that delving deeply into the issues and clearly de/fining our starting line will help to clarify how the Group should evolve over the next three years.\n\nOn one other point, given the Group's impressive aspiration of 'secure peace of mind today, build\n\nsustainable lifestyles for tomorrow' declared in CAD2026, I think it will be critical to discuss how to put this aspiration into action.\n\n\u25a0 Niizeki: I remember that during the formulation of the Plan, we talked about the importance of clearly communicating the direction of the Daigas Group. There were also concerns about effectively communicating this Plan externally. It is vital to identify the target audience for speci/fic topics. Across the company, numerous exciting initiatives are underway. There may be an opportunity to be more creative in communicating these initiatives.\n\n\u25a0 Sato: Although the Group employs a variety of expressions to describe itself, as be/fits such a serious company, it might be more effective to communicate them in simpler, more easily conveyed terms for promoting our numerous excellent initiatives, as we have discussed previously.\n\n\u25a0 Murao: As already pointed out in this discussion, in formulating CAD2026, I emphasized the importance of considering the future state of the Daigas Group on several occasions. This is not just about the next several years but about how the company will contribute to society in 20 or 30 years. I believe this discussion is crucial.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCor p or a t e G ove r n a n c e",

        "page_content": "While discussing investment for growth as an extension of current business is essential, we should also look further into the future. We need to expand our businesses that give hope and dreams to society and help result its issues. These discussions require long-term perspectives and should be led by emerging talent within the company rather than the current management executives. It would be bene/ficial to explore new ideas, such as what the nature of the business will look like in 30 years.\n\n## Initiatives in the Medium-Term Management Plan 2026 (CAD2026)\n\n\u25a0 Murao: CAD2026 focuses on allocating cash generated from successful management strategies executed to date. It is important for the Group to balance capital allocation between shareholder returns and investment for medium- to long-term business growth and human resource development.\n\n\u25a0 Niizeki: I am proud of the Group's ongoing progress in e-methane and renewable energy initiatives, aiming to become a leading company in a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncarbon neutral society. This progress will create value for a sustainable future. When it comes to co-creating value for a sustainable future, which is the /first of the Three Commitments,* the Key Strategy for the current medium-term period, we need to enhance our engagement in co-creating such value globally, going beyond the borders of the Kansai region and Japan. *Please see P.31 for details about the Three Commitments.\n\nIn terms of the second Commitment to supporting employees in shining in their roles, DE&I (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) is a signi/ficant challenge. We need to identify ways to further advance employees' inclusion, or in other words, co-creating value with them, as well as providing a pleasant working environment for all our employees.\n\nRegarding the third Commitment to evolving the business foundation, I strongly support the strategies of setting targets for ROE and ROIC, as well as pursuing asset rebalancing. Meanwhile, it will also be increasingly critical to update our long-term strategies, such as how to deploy future-oriented investment for growth by leveraging the Group's /financial soundness.\n\n\u25a0 Kijima: The Key Strategy's Three Commitments are all equally important, and I believe they serve as excellent guiding principles that will steer the Daigas Group toward a successful future. Echoing the words of management scholar Peter Drucker, 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast,' I would like to emphasize the importance of assessing the corporate culture as the driving force behind strategy implementation, which the Group has fostered over the years. While revisiting the core purpose of Group as a gas business operator, we need to continue upholding a corporate ethos centered on a strong sense of mission in its contributions and roles as a down-to-earth business.\n\n\u25a0 Sato: I admire the Group's aspiration of 'Secure peace of mind today, build sustainable lifestyles for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntomorrow,' the Purpose declared in CAD2026. I have always seen the Daigas Group as an 'audacious' company that daringly takes on various challenges. While the Group is addressing a wide variety of issues in our evolving society, the company needs to improve its communication of these efforts to the public in light of how we want them to be perceived by society.\n\nRegarding the issue of DE&I that Ms. Niizeki mentioned, while I acknowledge the Group's steady progress in implementing its plans, I believe we need to communicate more vigorous and straightforward messages internally to boost the morale of the entire Group. I support the Group's innovative approaches based on diverse ideas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nG\n\nro\n\nup\n\nE\n\nn\n\nvi\n\ns\n\ni\n\no\n\nn\n\ns\n\nF\n\nu\n\nt\n\nu\n\nr\n\ne t\n\nh\n\ne D\n\na\n\ni\n\ng\n\na\n\ns",

Identifying what should be /firmly upheld and what should be changed will provide clarity on the key areas that require our attention. As we implement CAD2026, we must foster a shared understanding across the organization regarding what must be maintained and what must be updated before undertaking the Three Commitments.\n\n\u25a0 Murao: The Group's gas business, which is our core operation that supports people's daily lives and businesses, must operate steadily, prudently, and with a down-to-earth approach. Meanwhile, in sectors beyond gas and pipelines, the Group needs to evolve into an innovation business. This transformation requires investment in research and development. In addition to the ongoing research on methanation,  we need to explore our involvement in hydrogen energy utilization, increasingly competitive storage battery development, and other emerging sectors. We should also aim to enhance our businesses in the Life & Business Solutions segment. I am dedicated to providing valuable recommendations.\n\n\u25a0 Sato: In the future, we cannot rely solely on the Japanese markets. Instead, we must expand our overseas businesses with strong commitment. Business planning based on the current market conditions will not lead to sustainable growth. It is essential to send our emerging talent into global markets to collaborate with individuals from diverse backgrounds. While there may be instances of failure and the subsequent pain in business retreat, there is much to be gained and many lessons to be learned from these experiences. The Group is already advancing its initiatives overseas, and these invaluable experiences will develop human resources needed to drive our future business growth.\n\n\u25a0 Niizeki: From the perspective of society's sustainability, the Daigas Group must establish systems to address carbon neutrality and other pressing challenges ahead of others, which requires innovation. One area of particular focus for me is corporate governance. While I believe the Group can swiftly respond to management risks, I also see the importance of promoting shared approaches to risks and risk hedging across the organization from company-wide perspectives. Strengthening governance in this manner will contribute to the sustainable growth of the Group.\n\n## Anticipations for the Daigas Group\n\n\u25a0 Sato: I hope that the Daigas Group will continue to be 'audacious' in a positive way, known for its intriguing undertakings that give hopes and dreams to society. The Group comprises exceptional individuals with tremendous potential. I look forward to the Group's evolution into a business organization that embraces challenges of a grand scale.\n\n\u25a0 Niizeki: Similar to what Ms. Sato mentioned, I want the Daigas Group to embody its catchphrase, 'SasuGas' (a play on words combining the Japanese word 'sasuga,' meaning 'just as you would expect,' and the English word 'gas'). I hope the Daigas Group always aspires to be a corporate group that meets and even goes beyond people's expectations in taking on challenges, engaging with local communities, and performing meticulous work.\n\n\u25a0 Kijima: I have high hopes for the Daigas Group to become a standout business entity in 2040 and 2050. Achieving this requires three key factors: /first, establishing robust governance; second, aligning business strategies with environmental changes; and third, adapting organizational culture in response to these changes. Combining these factors will make the outlook for 2050 promising. The basis for achieving this goal is the human resources strategy. Given the ongoing social transition to carbon neutrality, we need to enhance the skills of a limited workforce, cultivate the right talent to tackle future social challenges, and reform personnel systems and the frameworks for education and training. As an Outside Director, I am committed to carefully considering solutions to these challenges.\n\n\u25a0 Murao: I want the Daigas Group to continue pursuing innovation. It will play a key role in realizing the ambition to become a leading company 20 or 30 years from now in business /fields that are entirely different from the Group's origin. Taking real estate development business in the Life & Business Solutions segment as an example, I hope our endeavors extend beyond building condominiums to offering comprehensive daily-life solutions encompassing energy, transportation, and community development tailored to future needs. I eagerly anticipate the transformation of the Daigas Group into an integrated innovation business by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns",

In addition, the Group will continue to enhance and strengthen corporate governance in order to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in the business environment surrounding the Group, make transparent, fair, and decisive decisions, and execute business ef/ficiently and appropriately.\n\n## Corporate Governance System\n\nOsaka Gas has transitioned from a Company with an Audit & Supervisory Board to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee following a resolution at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2024 to partially amend its Articles of Incorporation to include the transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee. The transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee is intended to enhance discussion of management policies and strategies by the Board of Directors, further strengthen the supervisory function, and achieve more /flexible decision-making.

        "page_content": "## Overview of Corporate Governance System\n\n## Board of Directors, Directors of the Company\n\nThe Board of Directors consists of at least one-third of the 15 Directors, 7 of whom are Outside Directors and discusses management policies and strategies to ensure prompt and accurate decision-making and enhance supervisory functions.\n\nThe Company's Articles of Incorporation stipulate that there shall be no more than 15 Directors (excluding Directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee Members), and that the number of Directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee Members shall be no more than 5. They also direct that the appointment of Directors is to take place with a quorum of shareholders possessing at least one-third of shareholder voting rights and by a majority of voting rights held by shareholders present, distinguishing between Directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee Members and those who are not. In addition, they stipulate that no cumulative voting may be used for appointing Directors.\n\nIn FY2024.3, the Board of Directors held 13 meetings, with 100% attendance by all Directors.

Executive Of/ficers perform duties determined by the Board of Directors, and some Representative Directors and Directors concurrently serve as Executive Of/ficers to make management decision-making more accurate and ef/ficient.\n\n## Management Meeting\n\nThe Company examines basic management policies and important management issues at the Management Meeting and fully deliberates the foregoing before decision-making. In accordance with internal regulations, the Management Meeting consists of President, Executive Vice President, Senior Executive Of/ficer and head of each headquarter and business unit.

Based on a yearly auditing plan, it audits, from independent and neutral viewpoints, the status of execution of business activities. Audit results are reported regularly to all attendees of the Board of Directors and the Audit and Supervisory Committee, in addition to periodic reports at the Management Meetings. In the event that an internal audit identi/fies a matter that may have a signi/ficant impact on management, it is reported to the Board of Directors (dual reporting). The Auditing Department evaluates internal control over /financial reporting based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The Head of the Auditing Department regularly exchanges opinions with the Audit and Supervisory Committee and the accounting auditor.\n\n## Advisory Committee\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Management consists of all Outside Directors (7 members), the President and, if necessary, a person appointed by the President (the President may appoint up to one person from among other Representative Directors). From the perspective of enhancing corporate value, the committee deliberates on key issues such as medium- and long-term management strategy, sustainability, risk management, and DX.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Appointment and the Advisory Committee on Remuneration consist of all Outside Directors (4 members, excluding Directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee Members), the President and, if necessary, a person appointed by the President (the President may appoint up to one person from among other Representative Directors). From the perspective of ensuring objectivity and transparency in the decision-making process, the Advisory Committee on Appointment and Remuneration deliberates on matters related to the election of candidates for Directors, the selection and dismissal of Representative Directors and other Executive Directors, and matters related to the remuneration of Directors. In addition, one Director who is the Audit and Supervisory Committee Member participates in each Advisory Committee meeting as an observer. All committees are chaired by outside directors.\n\n## ESG Committee\n\nThe Company has established the ESG Committee to promote activities relating to the Group's sustainability, including the environment, compliance, social contribution, respect for human rights, etc.\n\n(Chairman: Head of ESG Promotion/Representative Director and Executive Vice President)\n\n## Safety and Disaster Prevention Committee\n\nIn order to take all possible measures to ensure safety, disaster prevention, and gas supply stability after the legal spin-off of the gas pipeline service business, the Company established the Safety and Disaster Prevention Committee to centrally manage events and promote measures, related to safety, disaster prevention, and gas supply stability within the Group. (Chairman: Head of Safety/Senior Executive Of/ficer)\n\n## Cyber Security Committee\n\nThe Company has established the Cyber Security Committee to reinforce the cyber security measures of the Group. (Chairman: Head of Technology/Representative Director and Executive Vice President)\n\n## Investment Evaluation Committee\n\nThe Company has established the Investment Evaluation Committee to examine risk and return and assess investments in excess of a certain amount, and report /findings to the Management Meeting to help make appropriate investment decisions.\n\n(Chairman: President of the Corporate Planning HQ/ Representative Director and Executive Vice President)\n\n## DX Committee\n\nThe Company has established the DX Committee to promote DX for the entire group while coordinating the alignment with business, IT, and /financial strategies across the organization. (Chairman: President of the Corporate Planning HQ/ Representative Director and Executive Vice President)\n\n## Risk Management Committee\n\nIn April 2024, the Company established the Risk Management Committee to strengthen appropriate responses to risks in its Group, which is expanding its business domain.\n\n(Chairman: Head of Risk Management/Representative Director and Executive Vice President)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns",

Moreover, in light of the medium- and long-term management plans, we have de/fined corporate management, marketing, technology/R&D, DX, global management, ESG, /finance/accounting, legal/risk management, and human resources development as area of expertise that the Board of Directors should possess.\n\nIn addition, we have long since de/fined the term of Director as one year in order to respond /flexibly to changes in our business environment and clarify management responsibility.\n\nBased on the above-mentioned policy, decisions on the selection of candidates for Directors and the appointment and dismissal of Representative Directors and other Executive Directors are made based on deliberations by a voluntarily appointed Advisory Committee made up of a majority of Outside Directors in order to ensure objectivity and transparency in decision-making.\n\nThe following is a list of the skills that the Board of Directors should possess as identi/fied in light of the medium- to long-term management plan as well as the particularly signi/ficant skills of each Director.\n\n## \u25a0 Skills Matrix (as of June 27, 2024)\n\n|                     |

management practices (Gas Group Risk Management System)\n- *3 The new 'CSR Committee' was established to coordinate and promote the activities of the committees (Compliance Committee and Energy & Global Environment Committee), which had been operating separately by /field, as well as community and social contribution, human rights, employment, and other activities promoted by the organizations in charge, on a cross-organizational basis.\n- *4 Rules on the purchase and management of third-party stocks were established. The Board of Directors examines the signi/ficance of each individual stock holding. If the signi/ficance of holding an issue has waned, we sell it sequentially. With respect to the exercise of voting rights, a standard for exercising voting rights was established (in 2016). We examine the content of proposals through various methods, including dialogue with investees, and decide whether to approve or disapprove.\n\n## \u25a0 Diversity of Directors (as of June 27, 2024)\n\n<!-- image -->",

held in June 2024.\n- *2 Appointed on June 23, 2023\n- *3 Deliberations on Directors' remuneration levels, etc. are not subject to attendance.\n\n## Training Policy for Directors and Succession Plan\n\nWhen appointed, the Company provides Internal Directors an opportunity to acquire knowledge regarding their roles, legal duties to be complied with, and responsibilities expected of a Director. Subsequently, the Company regularly provides opportunities internally or externally for Directors to receive training regarding legal affairs, risk management, compliance, and other matters to continue to acquire the knowledge necessary for the comprehension of legal revisions and other latest world trends. Further, the Company formulates a succession plan for top management, and fosters human resources to oversee the Company's management through such means as the systematic rotation of the areas of responsibility of Internal Directors and Executive Of/ficers.\n\nAs for Outside Directors, the Company provides opportunities for them to deepen their understanding upon appointment, such as by explaining the nature of the Group's businesses, so that they can put to practice their expertise and experience in each of their /fields for supervising and auditing the Company's business. Later, the Company also offers opportunities as necessary in which the business environment and business trends are explained accurately in a timely manner so that Outside Directors can gain an understanding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The same shall apply hereinafter) shall be provided in a remuneration system designed to raise motivation for Directors to achieve sustainable growth and mid- to long-term increase in corporate value. Remuneration for Executive Directors shall consist of basic remuneration as /fixed remuneration, performancelinked remuneration and stock-based remuneration, and remuneration for Director, Chairman of the Board shall consist of basic remuneration as /fixed remuneration and stock-based remuneration in order to clarify the separation of business execution and supervision. Remuneration for Outside Directors shall only consist of basic remuneration as /fixed remuneration, as they have a standpoint independent of business execution.\n\nRemuneration for Directors shall be determined within the total amount of remuneration*1 approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, after deliberation at a voluntarily appointed Advisory Committee on Remuneration made up of a majority of the Outside Directors, from the perspective of ensuring objectivity and seeking transparency in the decision-making process.*2\n\nThe Company has established a policy on determining the remuneration of Directors as prescribed by the resolution of the Board of Directors after deliberation at a voluntarily appointed Advisory Committee made up of a majority of Outside Directors.

In this environment, as the Daigas Group develops and expands its various businesses in various regions, risk management is becoming increasingly important.\n\nRecognizing the importance of risk management, the Group has established in its regulations basic guidelines for risk-related actions and is promoting efforts in this area.\n\n## Risk Management System\n\nThe Company has been implementing risk preventive maintenance planning and progress follow-up through corporate committees such as the ESG Committee, the Safety and Disaster Prevention Committee, and the Cyber Security Committee. As the Group's business domain expands, the Risk Management Committee, a corporate committee independent from the Audit & Supervisory Committee has been established in April 2024 in addition to the above framework to comprehensively manage key risks across the entire company.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee is chaired by the Executive Of/ficer in Charge of Risk Management (Representative Director and Executive Vice President), who oversees the Group's risk management, and includes the heads of related organizations as members.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee meets in principle twice a year to review and select key risks on a regular basis, deliberate on preventive maintenance plans and results for key risks that may affect business performance and /financial position, and implement ef/ficient and effective risk management.\n\nIn addition, risk preventive maintenance activities are reported and discussed at the Management Meeting, which is chaired by the Representative Director and President, regarding plans, results, and other matters related to risk preventive maintenance activities. Matters that have a signi/ficant impact on management are submitted to the Board of Directors for decision-making and oversight.\n\n## \u25a0 Group-wide Risk Management System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 Group-wide Risk Management Cycle\n\n## Plan\n\n- \u20dd   Development and sharing of preventive maintenance plans for key risks\n- \u20dd   Reporting and evaluation of activity plans to the Management Meeting and Board of Directors\n\n## Execution\n\n- \u20dd   Implementation and progress report of activities based on the key plan\n- \u20dd   Reporting and sharing of key risk predictions and occurrences\n\n## Confirmation, improvement and countermeasures\n\n- \u20dd   Reporting and evaluation of activity results to the Management Meeting and Board of Directors\n- \u20dd   Recon/firmation and re-selection of key risks\n- \u20dd   Risk preventive maintenance plan study based on activity results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns",

The Company con/firms the operating status of the internal control systems periodically by identifying items to con/firm for various matters and receiving reports from the organizational heads and other persons concerned. At the meeting of the Board of Directors held on April 25, 2024, it was reported that the internal control systems were operating in a proper manner.\n\n## Overview of Operating Status of the Internal Control Systems (FY2024.3)\n\n## \u2460 Matters concerning compliance, etc.\n\nThe ESG Committee promotes initiatives in each domain, including sustainability activities, through the Compliance and Risk Management Subcommittee, Environment Subcommittee, and Social Contribution Subcommittee. Educational materials, including a guide to the Daigas Group Code of Business Conduct, are posted on the intranet at all times to familiarize of/ficers and employees of the Group with said Code to promote and ensure its understanding.\n\nTo ensure compliance with laws and regulations related to appropriate gas transactions, we held legal lectures on the Antimonopoly Law and provided education on regulations conduct.\n\nCD Energy Direct, Inc. received an order from the Consumer Affairs Agency to suspend its door-to-door sales operations (for six months) based on the Act on Speci/fied Commercial Transactions, for some inappropriate business practices in door-to-door sales by a subcontractor. In order to prevent recurrence, the company is reviewing its compliance system and strengthening the supervision and education of its contractors. In addition, legal training sessions on the Act on Speci/fied Commercial Transactions were held within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u2461 Matters concerning risk management, etc.\n\nOrganizational heads of the Company and presidents of the affiliates promote the management of the risk of losses and periodically conduct risk management assessments. Each basic organization or affiliate identifies risk items, checks the status of management concerning the risk items, and conducts follow-ups or other measures by using such means as the 'G-RIMS (Gas Group Risk Management System),' which systematizes the self-assessment of risk management practices.\n\nFollowing the fire incident at the Freeport LNG plant in the U.S., we have reviewed and implemented risk management measures and rules for the LNG trade business. In response to the fire accident at Sodegaura Biomass Power Co., Ltd, we have reviewed risks and countermeasures related to biomass power plant operations and fuel management, and are implemented them horizontally at our Group's biomass power plants.\n\nRegarding the management of risks concerning security and disaster prevention which are common to the Group, the organization in charge is clearly specified, and the organization supports each basic organization and affiliate to ensure risk management on a Group-wide basis.\n\nWe established a Security and Disaster Prevention Committee to coordinate and promote cross-organizational measures related to safety and disaster prevention within the Group, and are taking all possible measures to ensure safety and disaster prevention after the legal separation. The Network Company also implemented internal investigations to confirm the status of measures to block the transfer of information between the Network Company and the Company which is gas retailer, as well as the Network Company and affiliated companies which are gas retailers, and the status of information management at each company.\n\nTo prepare for emergencies, regulations for disaster countermeasures and business continuity plans (BCP) are prepared. We also carry out Group-wide disaster-prevention drills, which consist of earthquake drills and BCP exercises.\n\nThe Cyber Security Committee has been established to further strengthen measures against cyberattacks from outside the Group's network such as by carrying out periodic inspections and following up on the Group's security.\n\nIn April 2024, we established the Risk Management Committee to comprehensively manage the risks of the Group, which is expanding its business domain, with the aim of strengthening its risk monitoring function.\n\n## \u2462 Matters concerning the management of businesses in the Group\n\nThe af/filiates to be managed by the Core Non-Energy Business Companies, the Network Company, the Overseas Regional Headquarters, or the management support organizations are designated and their managerial tasks are monitored by receiving periodic reports and reports on important issues from the af/filiates. In addition, day-to-day management of those af/filiates is performed by using the G-RIMS and/or conducting audits.\n\nThe Company's Auditing Department, which conducts internal audits, implements planned internal audits of the Company's organizations and af/filiates and provides follow-up audits after a certain period of time.\n\n## \u2463 Matters concerning the effectiveness of audits by Audit & Supervisory Board Members\n\nFull-time Audit & Supervisory Board Members have periodic exchanges of opinion with the Director and Chairman of the Board, the Representative Director and President and the accounting auditor, in which Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members also participate as necessary. Partly through the opportunity to exchange opinions with the accounting auditor, Audit & Supervisory Board Members evaluate the qualifications, expertise and independence of the accounting auditor.\n\nFull-time Audit & Supervisory Board Members attend important meetings such as the Management Meeting, the ESG Council, the Investment Evaluation Committee, etc., and read approval documents and other important documents. Through the Board of Directors' resolution on the internal control systems, they also clarify important matters to be reported to Audit & Supervisory Board Members and disseminate information thereof.\n\nFive assistants to Audit & Supervisory Board Members are in place to engage solely in assisting Audit & Supervisory Board Members in the performance of their duties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns",
