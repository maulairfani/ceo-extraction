Despite some encouraging news about the slowdown in greenhouse gas emissions, changes in climate are already a constant that we will have to live with in the coming decades. According to the World Economic Forum, extreme weather events and critical changes in earth systems have become one of the major global concerns of the decade. The year 2023 closed as the hottest year on record.\n\nHuman history is filled with challenges and lessons, where technology has played a crucial role. Recognising the threats, we are developing and applying transformative solutions at an impressive pace. The expansion of renewable energy is facilitating the development and growth of new technologies and businesses, such as battery storage, new energy vectors or the modernization of clean road transport. These are just some of the first initiatives that will create a series of cascading e/ffects having a positive impact on global emissions and contributing substantially to the modernization of the economy.\n\nWe believe that, in this accelerated transformation, agility and consistency of vision will be key. Our business strategy, closely aligned with global trends, places ACCIONA in a privileged position to respond to today's demands, consolidating its position as the world's most complete provider of sustainable infrastructure solutions.\n\nLetter from the Chairman\n\nAbout ACCIONA\n\nDrivers of change\n\nACCIONA, the \u2082rst company in a new sector\n\nStrategic capabilities and results\n\nSocial CashGLYPH<31>ow\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## POSITIVE BALANCE AT THE END OF THE YEAR\n\nACCIONA achieved revenues of 17,021 million euros, EBITDA of almost 2,000 million euros and net profit of 541 million euros in 2023. We have made net investments totalling 3,327 million euros, bringing the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio to 3.3 times.\n\n2023 was a year of significant achievements for ACCIONA, marked mainly by three milestones. Firstly, we set an all-time record in infrastructure contracting, with 9.4 billion euros awarded and 34 billion euros in the infrastructure backlog. Secondly, we achieved a record in new megawatts of renewable generation installed in a single financial year, adding 1,700 MW. And third, the change in Nordex's economic and financial trend, returning to positive EBITDA figures after complicated years for this industry.",

        "page_content": "## Positive contribution and robust balance sheet\n\nThroughout our history, ACCIONA has demonstrated our ability to adapt to change, always with the aim of driving the transformation of economic models towards more sustainable development, as demonstrated by our results.\n\n- { Commitment to sustainability: Our investments are 99% aligned with the European Taxonomy of Sustainable Activities, reflecting our commitment to sustainability. This positive impact is evidenced by 79% of our gross corporate debt being green or sustainability-linked. Clean electricity generation has avoided the emission of 13.6 million tonnes of CO2 this year. In addition, we continue to promote the development of water resilience. In total, 1,190 hm\u00b3 of water was treated this year, 47% of which was in water-stressed countries.\n- { Social contribution: ACCIONA continues to stand out for its contribution to the creation of wealth for society as a whole, which we call social cash flow. In 2023, this flow reached 19,407 million euros, 59% more than in 2022. This figure was mainly distributed in payments to suppliers amounting to 12,453 million euros, 2,056 million euros in tax contributions, up 36% compared to 2022, and 1,943 million euros in wages and salaries, 42% more than in the previous year.\n- { Robust financial strategy: On the financial front, ACCIONA continues to increase the number of concession assets in various sectors - including energy, infrastructure and water - enabling recurring and predictable cash flows in the medium and long term. In 2023, more than 86% of our accumulated capital (11,394 million euros) was allocated to businesses such as renewable generation, infrastructure concessions (transport, social and water) and real estate. This capital allocation strategy reflects our focus on stable, low-risk investments that support sustainable growth and lasting value creation.\n\nLetter from the Chairman\n\nAbout ACCIONA\n\nDrivers of change\n\nACCIONA, the \u2082rst company in a new sector\n\nStrategic capabilities and results\n\nSocial CashGLYPH<31>ow\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities in a new sector\n\nThe decarbonisation of the economy is already underway and ACCIONA will continue to contribute to accelerating this process. However, we must still face the impacts and consequences of global warming. Our business model, focused on clean energy and sustainable solutions such as regenerative infrastructure and low-emission transport, is now more necessary than ever.\n\nGlobally, investment in zero-carbon technologies already far outpaces investment in fossil fuels. And while we are at a crossroads of climate policy urgencies and the e/ffects of global warming, exponential investment in decarbonisation o/ffers hope of reversing this trend.\n\nAhead of us lie years that, far from being quiet, will be full of transformations. These promise to be challenging, but also full of opportunities. ACCIONA, thanks to its unique business model, has managed to stay at the forefront of change, growing and taking advantage of transformative opportunities.\n\nLet me conclude by remembering the work of all those who have contributed to our progress over the years, and especially our late Luis Castilla, whose legacy of experience, talent and charisma lives on. I am confident that together we will continue to work towards a more sustainable future, contributing to the continued success of our company for decades to come.",

VARIOUS EVENTS AND CONFLICTS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY RESHAPED GLOBAL STRUCTURES AND RELATIONS\n\nGeopolitical risk could negatively a/ffect the global economy and cause financial instability through several di/fferent channels. On the economy side, it may negatively impact real GDP growth, inflation, trade, investment, consumption, and savings.\n\nBusinesses must be prepared for the possibility that these tensions could fragment markets, create bottlenecks, or trigger economic conflicts leading to disconnected supply chains. Central banks are preparing to recalibrate monetary and fiscal policies. Global economic fragmentation, geopolitical tensions, and troubled restructurings could increase pressure on government public debt over the next decade, resulting in a greater need for private capital for infrastructure development.\n\nAccording to the OECD's latest outlook report, although the major shocks to energy prices have passed, inflation is expected to persist until at least 2025. In response, central banks have implemented tighter monetary policies to mitigate price increases.\n\nAlthough global GDP increased by about 3.3% in 2023, this growth is moderated by tight financial conditions, weaker trade, and weaker consumer confidence. These challenges continue to emphasize the need for adaptability and strategic planning in economic policies to navigate a volatile global environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe convergence of global trends that once seemed distant is giving rise to a new modernity\n\nSocial\n\nCashflow",

Global warming is having a devastating impact: inflating national budgets, raising food prices, destroying entire ecosystems, disrupting energy markets, and exacerbating a cost-of-living crisis. In response, governments are implementing transition plans to decarbonize and increase the productivity of their economies. Currently, 91% of global GDP is committed to national zero emissions targets, with a primary focus on increasing renewable energy as a key strategy to catalyze future action.\n\nChange is happening at an exponential rate. Renewable energy capacity, following an 'S-curve', is catalyzing positive socio-economic tipping points. Having passed the first tipping point in the energy sector, we are moving towards the second in road transport, anticipating the emergence of the 'The Breakthrough  E/ffect'.

This is causing a significant and universal transformation of the economy. According to a study by the consulting firm McKinsey, called 'The Great Reallocation', this shift would require an average annual expenditure of $9.2 trillion on physical assets, which is $3.5 trillion more than current spending.\n\nIn this context, ACCIONA is positioned as the most complete provider of sustainable infrastructure solutions in the world , gaining privileged access to this unique opportunity.

Health, represented by SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), includes investments in building infrastructure such as hospitals and clinics. Education on the other hand, represented by SDG 4 (Quality education), covers investments in educational infrastructure such as schools, colleges, and universities.\n\nAccording to UNCTAD estimates, the capital expenditure required for developing economies fluctuates between 100 billion and 600 billion dollars per year . In the area of health, the investment gap is estimated at 100-400 billion dollars, with a significant component of at least 125 billion dollars earmarked specifically for new health infrastructure.\n\nIn the education sector, the annual investment shortfall is estimated at 200 billion dollars for developing economies.

SDG 11, which promotes sustainable cities and communities, is specifically relevant, but the influence of cities extends to many other SDGs. The OECD estimates that 65% of the 169 SDG targets can only be achieved with the active engagement of cities.\n\nIn the context of the investment needed to achieve these goals, it is important to note that figures related to sectors such as energy, water, sanitation, and transport have already been discussed above. To avoid duplication and overestimation in UNCTAD's consolidated analysis, no city-specific proxy figure is provided.\n\n## ACCIONA BUSINESS:\n\nReal Estate : It is a unique player in the sector, specializing in the development of high added value projects, with innovative and sustainable solutions.\n\nMobility & Silence: ACCIONA is a key player in urban electric mobility.

The service has started to use Battery Stations in Madrid and Barcelona, improving the ergonomics of the swapping process and the agility during the exchange.\n\nMobility has a renewed fleet in more than half of the cities, with new driving modes, and improves the user experience with details such as new cell phone holders and the original trunk with better connectivity and ease of use.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the company manages a fleet of more than 12,400 electric scooters, making it the largest global operator in this sector.

In 2023, Silence sold 9,178 units, demonstrating their ability to capture a large part of the urban commuting market, where the average distance is less than 10 kilometres. This expansion in electric mobility contributes significantly to the reduction of emissions and to the development of cleaner and more e/fficient cities.\n\nUnder ACCIONA's promise to drive the transition to sustainable mobility, Battery Stations (BS) are born. Battery Stations are a network of battery interchangers strategically located to facilitate access to users. With 110 stations already installed in Spain and plans to expand throughout Europe by the end of the year, these interchanges allow users of Silence vehicles, both 2- and 4-wheeled, to replace their batteries immediately.\n\nThis innovative system, managed through an APP, not only reduces the economic barriers associated with the purchase of electric vehicles, but also ensures virtually infinite autonomy by enabling the rapid exchange of batteries. In addition, the project contributes significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and noise in urban areas, aligning with Europe's environmental strategies and promoting the development of charging infrastructures that will improve the quality of life in our cities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLetter from the Chairman\n\nAbout ACCIONA\n\nDrivers of change\n\nACCIONA, the GLYPH<31>rst company in a new sector\n\nStrategic capabilities and results\n\nSocial Cash-ow",

It represents the economic value generated - items that represent an actual cash inflow - and the economic value distributed - actual cash outflows - by the company. The contribution of value is measured both by the cash flows generated by ACCIONA (received from its customers or divestments) and by the cash flows distributed (payments to suppliers, Public Administrations, shareholders and employees, among others).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLetter from\n\nthe Chairman\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n## Economic value generated and distributed\n\n## MILLION EUROS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbout\n\nA\n\nC\n\nCIONA\n\nDrivers of\n\nchange\n\nA\n\nC\n\nCIONA, the GLYPH<31>rst\n\ncompany in a new sector\n\nStrategic capabilities\n\nand results\n\nSocial\n\nCashGLYPH<31>ow",
