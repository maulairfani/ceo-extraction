Additionally, we strive to convey our sustainable value creation cycle model, driven by initiatives that provide and co-create value with stakeholders, as a cohesive story. For the 2024 edition, we have structured the report into two sections to make these points more comprehensible for our readers. The /first half focuses on the Value Creation Story, while the second half is dedicated to sustainability reporting, speci/fically disclosing ESG information. We hope that this report will help our stakeholders gain a deeper understanding of our Group's initiatives and encourage more constructive dialogue and efforts toward value co-creation.\n\n## Editorial Policy\n\nSince FY2013, we have been issuing the Value Report, our integrated report. This report, which refers to the IIRC framework, provides updates on our sustainability activities and their outcomes as we work toward enhancing corporate value and realizing our Purpose and Vision. We position this report as a communication tool to help our shareholders and investors understand our  initiatives  aimed  at  achieving  long-term  corporate  value  and  a sustainable society.\n\n## Reporting Scope\n\nReporting Period: April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024 (FY2023), with some information included from after April 2024.\n\n## Sustainability-Related Information\n\n## Value Report\n\nA communication tool designed to explain our company's  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term value creation process from both /financial and non-/financial perspectives, helping stakeholders understand  the  story  behind  our  efforts  to achieve sustained corporate value enhancement. Additionally, it serves as a tool for reporting our annual activities and  data  from  an  ESG perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nManagement strategies and plans, /financial forecasts, future projections and policies, and R&D information that our Group discloses are all classi/fied as 'Daiichi Sankyo's future prospects.'

The development of Dato-DXd* 2 and HER3-DXd* 3 , which will follow Enhertu, has also progressed smoothly towards their market launch. Additionally, we have commenced a strategic alliance with Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA (Merck) for HER3-DXd, I-DXd* 4 , and DS-6000* 5 , of which we have accumulated favorable clinical data, further enhancing the product potential. As a result, the development plans for the three partnered products have been rapidly expanding. With the smooth progress of the current 5-year business plan, we have gained greater con/fidence in achieving our FY2025 target of becoming a 'Global Pharma Innovator with Competitive Advantage in Oncology.' We are now moving towards a new stage to realize our 2030 Vision of becoming an 'Innovative Global Healthcare Company Contributing to the Sustainable Development of Society.' While striving to expand our revenue and pro/fit, we are making investments for future growth. We are fully committed as a company to continuously enhancing our corporate value.\n\nThe successful establishment of the strategic alliance with Merck can be seen as evidence of the smooth start of the new regime under our new president, Mr. Okuzawa. As our company rapidly transforms into a global healthcare company, leadership that drives both growth strategies and internal transformation with a long-term perspective is crucial, along with effective business execution. President Okuzawa possesses both perspectives and ca-\n\npabilities, and in FY2023, he has driven further transformation to strengthen the executive structure and expand our global business. As global attention towards our company increases, we should meet the expectations of various global stakeholders and fulfill our corporate responsibilities appropriately. However, we will continue to work together as a group to achieve our Purpose, Mission, and 2030 Vision.\n\nLooking at society, we face various changes and numerous challenges towards a sustainable society, such as the intensification of weather disasters and damage to infrastructure due to climate change, con/flicts in various regions including the prolonged Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the acceleration of digital transformation (DX) and changes in life and work due to AI. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in 2020, has left a significant mark on our lives, reinforcing the recognition that a sustainable society cannot be achieved without the health of its people. We have once again embraced the importance of our purpose, 'Contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world,' and are committed to practicing purpose-driven management.\n\n- *1 anti-HER2 ADC, Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (generic name)\n- *2 anti-TROP2 ADC, Datopotamab Deruxtecan (generic name)\n\n*3 anti-HER3 ADC, Patritumab Deruxtecan (generic name)\n\n- *4 anti-B7-H3 ADC, I/finatamab Deruxtecan (generic name)\n- *5 anti-CDH6 ADC, raludotatug deruxtecan (generic name in Japan not yet determined)",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Practicing Purpose-Driven Management\n\nFor over 100 years, we have created numerous new drugs and delivered them to patients suffering from illnesses. We always consider what we can do for patients and practice purpose-driven management. When infectious diseases were a social issue, we contributed by introducing antibiotics. As the number of patients with lifestyle-related diseases increased, we released treatments for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and anticoagulants, thereby aiding patients. More recently, in response to the medical needs for cancer and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, we have launched and provided anti-cancer drugs and COVID-19 vaccines. By continuing the legacy of our founding DNA in drug discovery, we strive to continuously enhance Daiichi Sankyo's commitment to society.\n\nWe believe that this DNA of drug discovery is embodied in 'Science & Technology', which we position as our greatest strength. The technology of drug development and the successful experiences of drug discovery have been cultivated and passed down within our organization, fostering the craftsmanship for creating drugs. Our Group's research institutes have an organizational culture that allows researchers to challenge uncertain and unexplored areas driven by their scienti/fic curiosity and hypotheses. Despite facing numerous\n\nfailures, we continue to take on valuable challenges, share the lessons learned, and apply them to future endeavors. The accumulation of this cycle has led to the buildup of unique knowledge and experience, which serves as the source of continuous innovation.\n\nThe passion supporting researchers who challenge innovation is driven by a 'Patient Centric Mindset.' If we can deliver the new drugs we create more quickly and to more patients, providing effective treatments, it will improve their lives and enhance the health of society as a whole. This is the very essence of practicing our Purpose. By positioning 'compassion for patients and passion for innovation' at the core of our corporate activities, and ensuring that not only researchers but also individuals across all organizations embrace 'Patient Centric Mindset,' we will promote Patient Centricity initiatives throughout the entire value chain and practice purpose-driven management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Patient Centric Mindset\n\nStrengthen initiatives throughout the value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEducation/\n\nInformation\n\nGathering and\n\nProvision\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nV\n\n## Towards a Innovative Global Healthcare Company\n\nLast year, we entered into a strategic alliance with Merck for three DXd ADC products, which we believe was the best choice for achieving sustainable growth. For HER3-DXd, I-DXd, and DS-6000, we have accumulated favorable clinical data and have moved to a stage where we plan to maximize the value of these products. In addition, as many oncology companies are focusing on the development of ADCs and the development competition intensi/fies, the need to enhance capacity, resources, and capabilities to maximize the DXd ADC franchise has increased. Through joint development and co-promotion with Merck, we aim to maximize the value of these products. This alliance will enable us to 'deliver innovative drugs to more patients more quickly,' which aligns with our group's Purpose, 'Contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world,' and our Mission, 'Create innovative pharmaceuticals addressing diverse medical needs.' The alliance will accelerate the development of the three DXd ADC products, and by leveraging Merck's sales network, we will expand the countries and regions where they are marketed. At the same time, we recognize that we are entering a period of rapid business expansion and globalization at an unprecedented level, necessitating the expansion and restructuring of our management foundation in various areas, including human resources and organizational structure. To promote global management, we are transforming our organization from regional management to global cross-functional management. We are building a structure to quickly share success stories and other key information from all organizations globally. Additionally, we are appointing many international talents to the roles of global heads of various functions, thereby strengthening our management foundation to enable rapid decision-making with diverse perspectives and a global outlook. In April of this year, we launched the 'DS Academy' as a program to develop future global leaders. To ensure that\n\nDaiichi Sankyo provides value continuously and globally, lectures are given by our own executives in addition to outside experts. The program will focus on understanding the history of the Daiichi Sankyo Group as a century-old company and its DNA of innovation. We plan to develop the next generation of leaders by enhancing advanced management skills and the ability to view the business from a long-term and ultra-long-term perspective.\n\nAmidst such rapid globalization and organizational transformation, the foundation of our group management towards realizing our Purpose and Vision is our 'Core Behaviors,' consisting of three modes of behaviors: 'Be Inclusive & Embrace Diversity,' 'Collaborate & Trust,' and 'Develop & Grow.' We are fostering a corporate culture where employees around the world, sharing common behaviors, can cooperate and trust each other, aiming to create a comfortable workplace where each individual's abilities and skills can be fully utilized. As part of our efforts to foster these behaviors, we hold discussions at the executive level based on the results of our annual engagement survey, and I communicate our global commitment to all employees. In FY2023, we promoted initiatives under the theme of 'Fostering a Culture of Learning' and shared best practices through the Core Behavior Awards, where we recognized employees who exemplify the Core Behaviors. We believe that by having each employee globally collaborate towards common goals, we can continuously create innovative pharmaceuticals and provide better value to our customers.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Value Creation by the Daiichi Sankyo Group\n\nOur Group leverages 'Science & Technology' as its greatest strength to continuously create innovative pharmaceuticals and provide medicines that meet diverse needs. We practice long-term management to sustain the value creation model of our Group. Our strength in 'Science & Technology' is the source of our sustainable value creation, and our DNA of drug discovery has been continuously passed down throughout the long history of our Group. Since last year, we have been promoting the Innovation Hub concept with the aim of actively incorporating the world's most advanced technologies. Through the establishment of research centers in the Boston area in the U.S., a center of research innovation in life sciences, and in Europe, we plan to drive innovation in our research activities by leveraging external partnerships and resources.\n\nHuman resources are the most important capital driving sustainable value creation based on our strength in 'Science & Technology.' To globally expand our oncology business, we believe that acquiring and developing diverse talent and implementing effective talent management are the sources of our competitive advantage. We are currently strengthening our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhuman resources foundation, including our global organizational structure and human resources systems. In Japan, we are promoting initiatives to transform into a more productive and efficient organization in response to changes in the Japanese business environment. In addition, we are advancing the development of specialized professionals, including global professionals, bio-professionals, and DX professionals.\n\nAs a pharmaceutical company conducting business globally, we must address unmet medical needs, improve access to medicines, respond to global environmental issues, maintain high ethical standards as a life science company, and meet various social demands and expectations related to ESG. We must also sincerely address and respond to matters speci/fic to each country and region. Therefore, we are promoting dialogue with stakeholders, including patients and investors, to /flexibly respond to new social issues and changes in the social environment and to incorporate external perspectives into our management strategy. Through dialogue, we identify key issues that need to be addressed for sustainable growth as Materiality. We practice initiatives that lead to the sustainable development of society and business opportunities, such as creating innovative pharmaceuticals and expanding access to healthcare. By creating shared value with stakeholders, I believe we can provide them with the social and economic value we generate, and reinvesting it as capital in a circular process will achieve sustainable growth for both the company and society. President Okuzawa often expresses the sustainable growth of the company and society with the term sanpoyoshi (Three-Way Good), and I completely agree. Without creation of shared value with stakeholders, sustainable growth of the company cannot be achieved.\n\n## CEO Commitment for the Future\n\nFor our sustainable growth towards achieving our Purpose, I believe that enhancing our greatest strength, 'Science & Technology,' developing human resources, and fostering 'One DS Culture,' which will be the core of our value creation, are of utmost importance. Also linked to the practice of purpose-driven management, the Patient Centric Mindset is the driving force behind the growth of our company and the personal development of employees. I believe it is essential to further strengthen this mindset globally and cross-functionally. When I was young, I had the opportunity to work in a university pathology department, where I realized the importance of a patient-centered approach. In that setting, various departments within the hospital, including pathology, collaborated to ensure that physicians could provide the best diagnosis and treatment. This collaboration in the clinical setting played a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. At the center of this collaboration was always the 'patient.' As someone who believed that the goal of a pharmaceutical company was to create highly effective and safe drugs, this experience made me strongly recognize that our goal is not merely to manufacture pharmaceuticals, but to contribute to the 'patient.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf Oncology business launched\n- \u25cf Edoxaban growing\n- \u25cf Regional value being enhanced\n- \u25cf AstraZeneca strategic alliance\n- \u25cf Increased R&D investment\n\nCurrent 5-year Business Plan (FY2021-FY2025) Achieve FY2025 Target\n\nWith the new leadership under President Okuzawa, our company has entered an era of transformation and growth, driven by rapid business expansion and globalization. Additionally, the societal and business environment surrounding our Group is continuously changing, increasing the expectations and responsibilities from all our stakeholders. In such an environment, I am reaf/firming the importance of listening to the voices of all our stakeholders, and integrating the various demands and expectations from society into our corporate management, in order to achieve sustainable growth for both the company and society.\n\nFor our shareholders and investors, we regularly hold briefings on R&D, Enhertu business, and ESG. We will continue to enhance information disclosure and dialogue in the future. Looking ahead to our 2030 Vision, we will further deepen discussions on the evolution of Materiality, the articulation of social value, and the value we co-create with stakeholders, including patients.

I am also very pleased that we were able to contribute signi/ficantly to the public health and the security in Japan by supplying DAICHIRONA \u00ae , the /first mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 made in Japan. This achievement is a testament to the strengths of the Science & Technology generated\n\n## by our people.\n\nOnce again, I am reminded that the source of our global growth lies in our people. We are building a solid foundation to bring together highly specialized talent globally, leveraging our strengths in Science & Technology to create innovation, and to deliver these innovations to patients around the world.\n\nmunication with approximately 9,000 employees. Through the caravan, I felt that employees began to perceive the company's challenges and goals as their own. This experience also significantly heightened my expectations and confidence in the mutual sustainable growth of employees and the company. In the rapidly growing Daiichi Sankyo, I have the impression that many employees see opportunities to create their own careers through proactive career development. One thing I often convey to employees is the concept of an 'Accountable Mindset,' which is the awareness to proactively take action, considering oneself part of the problem until the desired outcome is achieved, to break through the status quo. I believe that when diverse talents from around the world embrace this mindset and find alignment between the company's Purpose and their own, we can create strong engagement, fostering strong organizations capable of continuous growth.\n\nOne of the areas I have focused on is engaging in dialogue with our employees. During the 'President's Caravan' conducted in FY2023, I visited all our business locations in Japan, conveyed the company's management policies and my thoughts, and engaged in two-way com-\n\n## 5-year Business Plan to achieve the 2025 Goals of becoming a 'Global Pharma Innovator with Competitive Advantage in Oncology'\n\nThree years have passed since we announced our 5-year business plan (FY2021-FY2025) aimed at achieving the 2025 Goals of becoming a 'Global Pharma Innovator with Competitive Advantage in Oncology'. The four strategic pillars towards realizing our 2030 Vision of being an 'Innovative Global Healthcare Company Contributing to the Sustainable Development of Society' are all progressing smoothly.\n\n## Realization of Maximizing 3ADCs\n\nMaximizing the product value of the three DXd ADCs (Enhertu \u00ae , Dato-DXd, HER3-DXd, hereafter referred to as 3ADCs), which are ahead of the curve in commercialization and development, is the most important issue of the\n\ncurrent 5-year business plan. Enhertu, launched in 2020, is contributing to patient treatment at a pace exceeding initial plans through steady market penetration, expansion of launch countries and regions, and acquisition of additional indications, meeting the expectations of the medical field. Following Enhertu, Dato-DXd and HER3-DXd are also progressing smoothly in their development, with preparations accelerating for their launch in FY2024. For HER3-DXd, along with I-DXd and DS-6000, we have entered into a strategic partnership with Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA to deliver these treatments to more patients faster. We are working towards maximizing their value through joint development and promotion. In anticipation of increased demand for DXd ADC products with the acceleration of",

Furthermore, the sales of products such as Tarlige \u00ae , Venofer \u00ae , and Nilemdo \u00ae /Nustendi \u00ae are also steadily increasing. The profits generated from these medicines serve as a source of investment for the sustainable growth of DXd ADC products and other initiatives. In addition, the transformation towards a revenue structure centered on new drugs is progressing smoothly in each country and region, accelerating the shift towards a business structure that supports sustainable pro/fit growth.\n\n## Identi/fication and Establishment of Further Growth Pillars\n\nFor I-DXd and DS-6000, accumulating favorable clinical data has further enhanced their product potential. As a result, we have positioned them as growth drivers following the 3ADCs. We are accelerating R&D activities by evolving our previous R&D strategy '3ADCs and Alpha' to '5DXd ADCs and Next Wave.' Additionally, we are advancing research and development towards selecting post-DXd ADC modalities, such as initiating clinical trials for the second-generation ADC DS-9606.\n\n## Create Shared Value with Stakeholders.\n\nWe have made progress in addressing pandemic risks, including the supply of DAICHIRONA, the first mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 made in Japan. Additionally, we have made progress in addressing environmental issues by joining 'RE100,' an international initiative aiming to use 100% renewable energy for business operations. We are transitioning to renewable energy at our own sites and have begun engaging with business partners to reduce the environmental impact across the entire value chain. Additionally, we are fostering the One DS Culture across the entire Group, and creating an environment where the organization can move more cohesively towards its goals by promoting the mutual sustainable growth of employees and the company through the practice of Core Behaviors.\n\nOver the past three years, the growth of Enhertu has significantly exceeded initial plans, achieving substantial sales and pro/fit growth. As details will be provided in the message from CFO Ogawa, the revenue for FY2025 is projected to reach 2.1 trillion yen, exceeding the target by 500 billion yen due to increased revenue in the oncology business. The core operating pro/fit margin before R&D expenses is aimed to achieve the initial plan of 40%. Additionally, by improving capital ef/ficiency, we aim to achieve our target of an ROE of 16% or higher. We also aim to enhance shareholder returns further, targeting a DOE of 8.5% or higher, exceeding our initial goal of 8%.\n\nFor the CFO message, click\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Towards Sustainable Growth Beyond FY2025\n\nWe are working to expand our pipeline to realize our 2030 Vision of becoming an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of society, and to drive sustainable growth beyond that. Needless to say what truly supports this growth is our people. It is our people who generate the strengths in Science & Technology, and it is also our people who strengthen the entire value chain to develop innovations and deliver them as products to patients. Going forward, we will strengthen our investment in human resources, continuously developing and enhancing them and enriching our intellectual property, including our pipeline, products, technologies, know-how, and information, to drive future growth.\n\nMeanwhile, in the dynamic and highly competitive environment surrounding us, we must swiftly adapt to rapid changes inside and outside the company that impact our business. To facilitate our response to such changes, we are aligning our management and human resources strategies, advancing internal reforms, and creating an environment to acquire, develop, and enable the success of talent that will drive global management and business. Currently, we are actively advancing global recruitment and development, while also globalizing our organizational structure and establishing a uni/fied global human resources system. Our corporate culture, the One DS Culture, is creating a highly engaged and diverse workforce, fostering an environment that generates competitiveness\n\nand advantages through the practice of Core Behaviors. Fostering the One DS Culture contributes to our performance, internal and external collaborations, and most importantly, our ability to create innovative pharmaceuticals that meet diverse medical needs.\n\nThe results of the Global Engagement Survey for FY2023 show that the overall score has increased by 2 points from FY2022, and scores for all questions have improved compared to the previous year. Through positive feedback from many employees, we were able to sense their commitment to contributing to patients around the world. The efforts towards fostering a 'culture of learning,' which has been a challenge, have also improved the related engagement scores. We will continue to make organizational efforts in learning and create an environment where employees can actively share their successes and failures and discuss root causes and potential solutions.\n\nIt is also very important to support each employee's challenges and develop internal talent who can lead and execute the next transformation with a global mindset. Through the practice of Develop & Grow, one of our Core Behaviors, we aim to foster a 'culture of learning' where employees acquire new skills in addition to their existing experiences and knowledge, and a 'culture of nurturing' where organizational leaders and senior employees take the lead in development efforts.\n\nFurthermore, considering the rapidly changing business environment and the evolving skills required of employees, we are advancing 'Project\n\n## COO's Commitment for the Future\n\nTraditionally, Japan has a concept known as sanpoyoshi or the 'Three-Way Good,' which means 'Good for the seller, good for the buyer, and good for society.' This idea holds that business should be bene/ficial for all parties involved-ourselves, our customers, and society. In modern terms, this means creating shared value with multiple stakeholders, which is precisely Daiichi Sankyo's value co-creation model. We aim to grow as a company by realizing our Purpose and contributing more to patients. The resources obtained from this growth will be returned to each stakeholder in a bal-\n\nEPOCH' to further optimize the entire Japanese organization, including group companies, and to further promote globalization from Japan. To allocate talents to new areas and roles where needed, we are implementing personnel transfers along with talent development programs that ensure the acquisition and enhancement of new expertise through practical work in the new positions. This initiative aims to encourage employees to proactively consider their careers and support their new challenges in required roles and tasks.\n\nFor details on the speci/fic initiatives of Project EPOCH, click\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeveloping global leaders is also one of our top priorities. In April, we launched the 'DS Academy' with CFO Ogawa as its inaugural dean, aiming to cultivate leaders who will lead our global organization. This academy offers various programs to help participants acquire advanced management skills and leadership capabilities. Among these, we believe it is highly signi/ficant to deepen understanding of Daiichi Sankyo's over 100-year history and DNA, and to discuss the strategies our company should adopt for the future.\n\nAdditionally, by adopting a new global management system that includes the appointment of senior members outside of Japan, we are strengthening the global management foundation that supports our business growth.\n\nanced manner. It is crucial for us to be a company that is recognized and continuously meeting the expectations of society, where all stakeholders can bene/fit from our growth.

Our Group is experiencing globalization at an unprecedented speed and scale, driven by the rapid expansion of our oncology business. We believe that the growth and increased engagement of each employee are essential to supporting this rapid business growth. At the core of Daiichi Sankyo Group, an innovative pharmaceutical company, lies a commitment to 'putting patients /first' and 'making decisions based on science.' We are convinced that all employees embrace these two mindsets as the foundation for their daily activities and decision-making. Because of this, we believe our strength lies in our ability to unite and tackle even the most dif/ficult challenges together.\n\nMatsumoto When our Group shifted to the oncology business, there was a challenge of whether the existing culture could support our growth strategy. To become an organization that acts with a sense of speed as One Team globally, we analyzed what was lacking and what needed to be strengthened. Based on the results, we formulated our Core Behaviors. We then rede/fined and articulated this as the One DS Culture, incorporating it into our Purpose, Mission, Vision, and Core Values. Since it is important for the management to be united in order to promote the widespread understanding of the corporate culture, we /first brought together around 200 global leaders several times, including the members of the Executive Management Committee (EMC) and their direct reports, to deepen their understanding of the importance of the One DS Culture. Furthermore, in 2022, we appointed Culture Ambassadors in each organization to promote the cultivation of the One DS Culture. We feel that the Ambassadors around the world who are advancing this initiative have created a positive movement, leading to the widespread penetration of the One DS Culture.\n\nWhat do you think of the initiatives of the 'One DS Culture' and the strengths in terms of talent and organizational culture?\n\nNohara While the globalization of Japanese companies often involves importing overseas talent strategies and human resources systems, our Group has fostered the One DS Culture without overly conforming to foreign workplace cultures. Instead, we have recognized and appreciated the strengths and differences of each culture, promoting mutual harmony. I believe this approach, distinct from what I've seen before, is uniquely characteristic of our company. As a result, many key positions in our overseas units are held by non-Japanese members who have worked with us for many years. We have numerous talented individuals who resonate with our company's culture and values. Additionally, at the FY2024 Senior Management Meeting held this April, which was attended by about 160 core members from global units, I got the impression that all departments\n\nare working organically towards the 2030 Vision, fulfilling their roles to maximize pro/fitability and contribute to patients. I believe our Group has become a workplace that is ful/filling, shares common goals, and inspires dreams.\n\nNishii Not only diversity but also the promotion of inclusion towards our Vision is undoubtedly one of our strengths. Currently, we are aiming to become a world-class company in the /field of oncology, but it must have been quite challenging to /find the path from the cardiovascular domain to oncology. Speci/fically, since we are a Japanese company, there is a cultural tendency for long-term employment within a single company. On the other hand, there can be a mismatch in values with the talent employed to expand our business primarily in Western countries. In creating the One DS Culture, I believe there must have been many con/flicts, but I can sense the strength that has come from overcoming these challenges. In pursuing our Purpose and Vision, the business environment can change rapidly, and it is essential that our strategies adapt /flexibly to these changes. Additionally,",

        "page_content": "all companies face the risk of organizational unrest and the breakdown of inclusion during times of poor performance. We strongly feel that, armed with the experiences we have overcome, we are currently in a period where we are leveraging Daiichi Sankyo's strengths to pursue our Purpose and Vision.\n\n## Please tell us about the positioning and importance of human resources in our Group aiming to achieve the 2030 Vision.\n\nOkuzawa Despite the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 'PBR below 1 issue,' our company's PBR is currently at a very high level of 6 (as of the end of July in 2024). There is off-balance-sheet corporate value (intangible assets, products, and pipeline) that far exceeds the net assets on our balance sheet, and it is undoubtedly our employees who are creating this value. That is why we position our human resources as the most important invisible asset bearers. We believe that a condition for a sustainable company under our 2030 Vision: 'Innovative Global Healthcare Company Contributing to the Sustainable Development of Society' is to consistently have our exceptional talent continue building intangible assets. I love the sanpoyoshi (bene/fit for all three parties) philosophy of the Omi merchants, and I want all our global employees to embrace this management philosophy. We aim to promote the belief that we always thrive and are supported within the development of society.\n\nMatsumoto To realize a company that continually builds intangible assets, it is crucial to understand the talent needed and to undertake initiatives to bridge the gap between the current state and the desired outcome in terms of talent acquisition and development. For example, as our business shifts from a focus on small molecules to biopharmaceutical, there is a shortage of biopharmaceutical talent in various areas such as development, manufacturing, and quality assurance. Therefore, we are placing a strong emphasis on increasing biopharmaceutical talent both in Japan and internationally. Additionally, we believe that it is essential to develop talent capable of competing on a global scale. In March 2024, we established the Daiichi Sankyo Group People Philosophy, which serves as the foundation for our human resources initiatives aimed at globalization. Through this, we conveyed the message to all employees that people are our most important asset. We aim to establish a foundation where we can effectively secure, develop, and enable our talent to thrive, no matter where they are in the world.\n\n## Please tell us about the current challenges and the direction for strengthening our talent.\n\nNishii As a prerequisite for securing and developing talent, we believe that further discussion is needed regarding our desired state in 2030. Healthcare is a very broad /field, and clearly de/fining the type of healthcare company we aspire to become is a signi/ficant challenge. During the con-\n\nsideration of our next 5-year business plan, we need to clearly de/fine our Vision and have thorough discussions to clarify the type of talent required. We believe that the strategic partnership with global mega-pharma companies has not only yielded results in oncology but has also had a signi/ficantly positive impact on our talent and organizational culture. We hope to progress towards our 2030 Vision by learning from the strengths of our global partner.\n\nOkuzawa I believe we have gained many valuable insights and experiences through partnering with a global mega-pharma company. We aim to see our Group grow into a true global company, one that can genuinely stand shoulder to shoulder with mega-pharma companies. To achieve this, we will /first transform the EMC into a truly global management team. Since the EMC members are the heads of each unit, it can sometimes appear as if silos are being created within the scope of their respective roles and responsibilities, and the representatives of these silos coming together. While it is understandable and necessary to value one's own organization, as EMC members, we want to build a One Team that sets aside individual units to engage in discussions and decision-making for the overall optimization of our Group.\n\nNishii A good example from the EMC is the discussion of the 2024 budget. The increase in initial R&D costs, which deviated from the budget guidelines, was identi/fied as a challenge. However, it was adjusted precisely within just a few months. The process at that time was neither a top-down approach nor a simple bottom-up process. Instead, it involved thorough discussions between each EMC member and their respective team members, and decisions were made after reaching a consensus. Deciding to prioritize R&D funding over the immediate pro/fits of one's own organization is not an easy decision, and I believe it was a remarkable example of decision-making as a team. I believe this was possible because the longterm value of helping more patients in the future is shared across the entire company.\n\nNohara As the competition for talent domestically and internationally intensi/fies, the challenge is how to demonstrate our Group's position and continue to attract top performers. I believe that improving our recognition and branding overseas to attract both talent and intellectual property is also necessary. From the perspective of empowerment of women, while our Group is highly regarded for its efforts among Japanese companies, there is still a signi/ficant gap between Japan and other regions. The progress of globalization presents an opportunity to introduce overseas systems, ideas, and strengths into Japan, driving transformative change. Until now, discussions and measures to accelerate empowerment of women have been primarily led by Japanese members. However, I believe that by involving a more global team in these discussions moving forward, we can also drive changes in the domestic environment.\n\nMatsumoto As globalization progresses within each unit and organization, we are currently working to unify our approach to evaluations, grades, and compensation globally to avoid con/flicts between Japanese and international practices. At the same time, we are advancing the development\n\nof HR Information System, and we believe that once these supporting systems are in place, we can /finally move on to the talent management, which is the next step. While it's important for Japanese employees to be able to compete globally, it's also crucial to establish a foundation that supports career development and enables overseas members to envision a long-term career with our company. Additionally, as Director Nohara pointed out, there are signi/ficant challenges regarding empowerment of women in Japan, and we need to develop systematic initiatives to globalize our approach to nationality and diversity as well.\n\n## Finally, please share your expectations for human resources strategies and strengthening human capital, as well as how you plan to be involved.\n\nNishii In aiming to become a global healthcare company, the perspective of digital transformation (DX) is indispensable for the future. In advancing transformations using technology, traditional Japanese practices and age-based role de/finitions may become obstacles. I am interested in how human resources (HR) will address and resolve these challenges. I believe that HR innovation is needed not only in terms of nationality and gender but also in recruiting and empowering those who have fresh and new knowledge in the digital /field, and I would like to focus on this aspect. Nohara The essence of Inclusion & Diversity goes beyond correcting formal disparities such as gender, nationality, or age. It involves cultivating an organizational culture where members with diverse values and expertise can engage in broad, multi-faceted discussions and create something meaningful from that dialogue. Many Japanese companies predominantly\n\nhire new graduates, which can lead to a somewhat standardized workforce. Moving forward, it is important to acquire and include talent with diverse careers, areas of expertise, and values to create a more inclusive workplace. I will also support the spread of such thinking and actions throughout all workplaces.\n\nMatsumoto I am determined to develop and promote a robust human resources strategy that supports our business and management strategies. Currently, our development pipeline is attracting talent, but I have a dream of becoming a company where our culture and people act as a magnet, drawing others in. I aspire to create a workplace and company, both in Japan and globally, that makes people think 'Daiichi Sankyo puts people /first, and it's the people themselves that are the excellence of the company' and 'I want to work for Daiichi Sankyo.'\n\nOkuzawa I'm glad we had such a meaningful and in-depth discussion. Our company has established the organizational culture known as 'One DS Culture,' which encompasses our Purpose and Mission, the 2030 Vision, Core Values, and Core Behaviors. By embedding these throughout the entire Group, we aim to foster and strengthen a global sense of unity. I believe it is most important for me, as the leader, to deeply commit to and actively practice these principles myself. Through this commitment, I aim to contribute to all our multi-stakeholders, including patients, shareholders, and employees, as a part of the Daiichi Sankyo Group.\n\nAs a leader, I will effectively convey our corporate philosophy, commitment to stakeholders, strengths in Science & Technology, and emphasis on human capital through two-way communication and dialogue with stakeholders. I value the feedback we receive from stakeholders and aim to utilize it into our management practices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This foundation is driven by the 'people' at Daiichi Sankyo who generate these innovations.\n\n- \u2776 Organizational Culture that Promotes Innovation :  Our company has an organizational culture that nurtures highly specialized talents who have long tenures and continue to pursue scienti/fic research. This environment fosters innovation within our organization. Additionally, our culture promotes diversity, including the active participation of women and international talents and experts. This diversity contributes to the creation of further innovations.\n- \u2777 Creation of Education and Growth Opportunities at Overseas Research Laboratories : Our company creates opportunities for many researchers to study at overseas research laboratories with cutting-edge science. The growth and development of these employees lead to their active contributions upon returning to our research laboratories, thereby revitalizing the organization.\n- \u2778 Human Resource Enhancement in Key Areas : Our top-class achievements in drug discovery research have attracted exceptional talent\n\nin Japan. By continuously hiring outstanding talents, we aim to strengthen our workforce of employees with scienti/fic and technological expertise. In addition, we strategically reassign highly skilled researchers within the company to key areas, fostering the development of specialized drug discovery talent.

This will be vital to achieving our Purpose and Mission. The concept of \"Intelligent Failure,\" also known around the world as \"kaizen,\" is deeply rooted within the Daiichi Sankyo organization.In some business cultures, there is a prioritization of moving on to new challenges immediately after a project is completed, rather than taking the time to re/flect. However, even if we make mistakes, I believe it is crucial to re/flect on our actions by focusing on facts rather than judging people, and we can promote next challenges through this Lessons Learned processes by broadening our perspective, sharing with other teams, and accepting new discoveries /flexibly. I believe this is extremely important to maintain our excellent DNA rooted in Daiichi Sankyo, which continuously generates innovation. Expanding this concept of \"Intelligent Failure\" to more functions and sections throughout our global organization will further enhance Daiichi Sankyo's strengths in Science & Technology and drive our initiative for growth.\n\nHead of Therapeutic Area Strategies, Research & Development Unit Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.

To achieve our Purpose and Mission, we aim to maximize human capital through the promotion and development of talent across various areas of the value chain, striving for mutual sustainable growth for both employees and the company. All business activities are supported by talent, and we believe that acquiring diverse talent and implementing effective human capital management in our global business expansion are sources of competitiveness. In our Group,\n\n'human capital' is defined as a combination of three elements: 'Power of individual' (strengthening individual strengths), 'Power in numbers' (continuous supply of talent to areas of focus), and 'Power of synergy' (structures, systems, and measures to create synergy among people and organizations). In line with our business strategy, we monitor the various elements of human capital that need strengthening, while working on evaluating the effectiveness of measures and further enhancing human capital expansion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Output of HR measures\n\nRealization of a talent portfolio linked to the management strategy\n\nDevelop talent who can /flexibly adapt to change and autonomously take on challenges and grow\n\nEstablish an environment and foster a culture in which employees can work energetically and productively\n\nDevelop organizations and HR infrastructure to accelerate global collaboration\n\n## Global Initiatives\n\nWe have established a global common top-level concept and guideline known as 'People Philosophy,' and based on this, we design and promote each HR measure. We are also committed to fostering a global common corporate culture, 'One DS Culture,' and through the practice of the three Core Behaviors, we strive to build trust across functions and regions and achieve collaboration. Since 2022, we have been implementing the 'Core Behavior Awards,' which recognize and reward employees who embody Core Behaviors, to promote  and encourage these Behaviors. Additionally, to promote sustainable growth through global collaboration, we are advancing the construction and implementation of a global common HR system and HR information system.\n\nIn the FY2023, we have seconded 111 employees from Japan to the United States, 32 employees to Europe, and 22 employees to Asia, Central and South America. This allows for talent development through exposure to different cultures and management practices. Also, we have 11 employees seconded from overseas group companies to Japan, facilitating mutual exchange and development opportunities. Additionally,\n\nto support further employee growth, we have created global standardized content and conducted coaching and feedback training targeted at management positions. Furthermore, we have established the 'Global I&D Statement,' which clearly outlines our stance and approach to Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) both internally and externally.

We have established organizations responsible for developing specialized talent in these areas and are constructing systematic training programs. Additionally, to increase the number of specialized professionals, we implement an inter-\n\nnal recruitment system (Career Challenge Program) to support employees' autonomous career development and reskilling efforts. Furthermore, to foster a 'culture of learning and training' within the organizations responsible for development, we conduct 'Trainer-Trainee Training' aimed at developing essential mindsets and skills for both trainers and trainees.

Given the nature of our business, which has a strong focus on oncology, we recognize the challenges in reaching low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we are engaging with the Access to Medicine Foundation and leading investors to improve access to healthcare. We are engaging in the initiative jointly with the Foundation in collaboration with our lead investor, Nomura Asset Management. On behalf of the investors, Nomura Asset Management communicated our requests and activities to the Foundation. At the same time, we received a great deal of feedback on the current status and challenges of our Group, which reaf/firmed the importance of our information disclosure regarding access to healthcare. Additionally, through this engagement, the Foundation gained the opportunity to consider the signi/ficance of our efforts for expanding access to healthcare.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- This initiative was featured in Nomura Asset Management's Responsible Investment Report.\n- https://www.nomura-am.co.jp/special/esg/library/ri-report.html\n\nFor more information on our access to healthcare initiatives, click\n\nDr. Iyer, CEO of the Access to Medicine Foundation, and Dr. Manabe, our CEO, held discussions on the challenges related to access to healthcare for Daiichi Sankyo products (October 15, 2023)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Message from the Lead Investor, Nomura Asset Management\n\nOur company participates in many international initiatives that address social issues, and we place signi/ficant importance on the activities of the Access to Medicine Foundation. Since 2023, we have been responsible for collaborative engagement with Daiichi Sankyo as the lead investor. It is not easy for Japanese pharmaceutical companies to enhance access to healthcare due to limited infrastructure such as distribution networks in low- and middle-income countries, to enhance access to healthcare. In this context, Daiichi Sankyo's efforts to improve access through its partnership with AstraZeneca are an excellent initiative. We are very pleased that through engagement, we were able to convey the signi/ficance and initiatives of the alliance model to the Access to Medicine Foundation, leading to a reconsideration of their evaluation of Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nNomura Asset Management Engagement Engagement Dept., Inagaki (left) Responsible Investment Dept., Takeuchi (right)\n\n<!-- image -->",

We lead proactive safety monitoring and risk management throughout the entire product lifecycle from development to post-marketing and ensure Patient Safety.\n\nWe implement various initiatives to ensure the safety of our medicines and enable patients in need to use them as quickly as possible, while complying with regulations in each country. The concept of Patient Centricity is the fundamental principle of our safety management..\n\nFor example, we have programs that allow patients to access our products imported from overseas prior to new drug approval and market launch. Even in such exceptional cases, to ensure patient safety, we implement various measures such as conducting training for healthcare professionals, distributing materials explaining proper usage, and continuously monitoring usage conditions. These efforts ensure that treatments are administered appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, under the leadership of the CSPV Unit, we implement safety management through close collaboration with the development department, medical affairs department,\n\nand partner companies.\n\nWe tailor our activities to the regulations and conditions of different countries around the world, by collecting safety-related needs from healthcare professionals and patients in various countries, sharing those safety issues and developing safety management strategies.\n\nIn Japan, we have established an information provision system using a real-time side effects search system. This system enables us to quickly provide healthcare professionals with the latest side effects information, including detailed clinical courses for individual patients. This helps reduce the risks of side effects and improves treatment continuity for patients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Message from the Head of CSPV Division\n\nMedicines become truly effective only when 'top-quality pharmaceutical products' are combined with the 'provision of appropriate information.' Additionally, no matter how excellent a drug's ef/ficacy may be, there is no medication without the risk of side effects. It is important to analyze the safety and ef/ficacy information of pharmaceuticals, evaluate them based on the bene/fit-risk balance, and provide the necessary information to ensure that our products with excellent ef/ficacy are used appropriately. The CSPV Unit upholds the 'Patient First' mindset and implements safety monitoring and risk management globally throughout the product lifecycle, from development to post-marketing. We strive to provide timely and appropriate usage information so that healthcare professionals, particularly physicians, can offer optimal treatments to patients, ensuring that patients can use our products with con/fidence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u2777 Promoting the Use of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO)\n\nOur Group actively utilizes Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO), which incorporate patients' subjective assessments of symptoms, Quality of Life (QOL), and other factors into clinical trials. For Enhertu \u00ae , the PRO-DUCE study conducted in Japan demonstrated that breast cancer patients who used electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (ePRO) monitoring via devices such as smartphones, in addition to usual care, showed a signi/ficant\n\nimprovement in QOL scores compared to the usual care group. Additionally, the DESTINY-Breast02, 03, and 04 trials have also demonstrated signi/ficant control and improvement of health conditions, such as fatigue and pain, during the treatment period. Moving forward, we will continue to utilize PRO to accurately capture the patient's perspective and pursue further contributions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u2778 Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) Re/flecting Patients' Voices in Drug Development\n\nRe/flecting 'patients' voices' in clinical trials leads to reduced burden on patients, improved understanding, enhanced quality of clinical trials, and accelerated progress, ultimately allowing new drugs to reach patients more quickly. Since 2022, we have established a specialized team within our development function dedicated to executing Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) initiatives that re/flect 'patients' voices' in drug development. This team has built a framework for timely communication with patients and clinical trial coordinators, focusing on the review of clinical trial-related materials and actively engaging in Patient and Public Involvement (PPI). As speci/fic examples of our activities, we not only review clinical trial protocols and informed consent forms (ICF) but also provide lay summaries and Thank You Letters *7 . Based on the feedback from patients, we have made changes to clinical trial plans, including adjustments to in-hospital\n\nwaiting times for patients, the testing schedule related to the initiation of investigational drug administration, and the relaxation of exclusion criteria. For the ICF, we addressed issues such as literal translations from English that resulted in awkward Japanese expressions, insuf/ficient explanations of medical terminology, and sentence structures that could easily lead to misunderstandings. These improvements have been incorporated into the templates for clinical trial-related documents. Currently, PFDD initiatives are being implemented in Japan. However, we plan to expand these efforts globally by taking into consideration ICH and FDA guidelines and collaborating with our overseas Group companies. Moving forward, we will strive to contribute to better healthcare by promoting and strengthening industry-wide efforts to re/flect \"patients' voices\" into clinical trials.\n\n- * 7  A card that includes a thank you message to clinical trial participants and information about the disclosure of clinical trial results.\n\n## PFDD Framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHead of CSPV Division Wada Kento\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this regard, we organized a panel discussion involving the Outside Director with experience in clinical medicine and public health, the Patient Centricity Special Assignment, and top managements from our global organizations, who are leading Patient Centricity initiatives in the oncology and specialty areas to exchange opinions on our Group's perspective regarding Patient Centricity.\n\nGlobal Head of Advocacy & Strategic Relations, Global Medical Affairs, Oncology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGissoo DeCotiis\n\nHead of European Specialty Business Unit Oliver Appelhans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUeno I was appointed to Patient Centricity Special Assignment starting this /fiscal year. Patient Centricity is a vital value for our Group, as it serves as a core of our business activities. To further contribute to patients, the entire Group must share the understanding of Patient Centricity and strengthen it globally and cross-functionally. In this panel discussion, I would like to share our activities based on our compassion for patients, and exchange opinions on Patient Centricity, focusing on the challenges faced in the medical /field. I hope to convey our concept of Patient Centricity to all our readers.\n\n## Introduction of experiences, insights, and current positions regarding Patient Centricity\n\nUeno First, Dr. Komatsu, could you share your opinions on the current state of Patient Centricity in the medical /field, based on your own experiences and insights?\n\nKomatsu When considering Patient Centricity, direct care for patients, the hospital management & administration, research and policy initiatives are important. Among these, the essence of Patient Centricity at the direct care level is to share common goals and values between patients and healthcare professionals *1 . In the healthcare field, there has been an increasing emphasis on healthcare that takes into account the values and perspectives of patients. However, despite our efforts as healthcare professionals to understand and explain what is important to patients and provide healthcare, there is still a challenge of patients unable to voice the questions they want to ask. It is necessary to build a trusting relationship where patients can freely communicate so that healthcare providers can truly understand their needs. 40 years ago, the paternalistic model was predominant in healthcare where physicians decided the treatment for the patient and obtained patients' consent. However, nowadays, Shared decision-making, which involves collaboration between healthcare professionals and patients, considering both medical and patients' needs, is highly valued. In my opinion, the essence of Patient Centricity is to discuss what is most important and optimal for each patient and reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.\n\nUeno Next, I would like to ask Gissoo and Oliver about promoting Patient Centricity within our company. Based on your own experiences and insights, could you tell us how you are ful/filling your roles?\n\nGissoo As the Head of Advocacy, Global Oncology Medical Affairs, I encourage our internal and external stakeholders to be focused on the needs of the patients and always keep the patient at the top of their mind when they go through their day-to-day work. Particularly in the /field of oncology, asking patients' perspectives about their lived experience with cancer and considering how to meet the unmet needs of the patients is very important. For example, we strive to incorporate the voices and perspectives of patients throughout the development process, from preclinical stages to late-stage\n\n*1 https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1133\n\nclinical trials all the way to commercialization and every step in between. What we truly aim for is \"inclusion\" of patients in the entire process to share their valuable lived experiences which will make our processes more robust and patient centric.\n\nOliver Looking back at the start of my career in the pharmaceutical industry, I worked as a sales representative 20 years ago. At that time, I had the opportunity to experience direct exchange with patients, by educating and raising awareness among patients. It also left me with the fundamental understanding that patients really must be the foundation of our decision-making.\n\nThis experience perfectly aligns with the concept of Patient Centricity that our Group aims for. One concrete example of putting this experience into practice is the launch of Lixiana \u00ae , the anticoagulant, in Europe, where I collaborated with Arrhythmia Alliance, the leading global Patient Organization in the field of arrhythmias. Together, we promoted various initiatives and educational campaigns with a patient-centric approach. Additionally, while I served as General Manager at Daiichi Sankyo Germany, I established strong relationships with patient organizations such as the German Stroke Foundation and the German Hypertension League. We discussed the current status and challenges of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) with diverse stakeholders from the patient's perspective and provided support to improve quality of life (QOL).\n\n## Global Initiatives for Patient Centricity\n\nUeno Please provide speci/fic examples of initiatives and achievements related to Patient Centricity in the oncology and specialty /fields.\n\nGissoo The Global Patient Advocacy team that I lead primarily focuses on cancer patients, caregivers, and other like-minded stakeholders. We focus on activities that add value to patients through our pharmaceutical products and services and enable cancer patients to live longer and better lives with less side effects. Speci/fically, we actively engage with many patients to gain a better understanding of their daily lives and the challenges they face in their treatment, access to medicines, mental health support and overarching survivorship needs. Additionally, we engage with over 900 patient advocacy groups worldwide throughout the year. We are actively collaborating with the most suitable organizations to establish long-term relationships and jointly develop programs such as awareness-raising campaigns and educational initiatives that will help patients' quality of life. Regarding the process, we developed the Patient Steering Committee that re/flects the patients' voices. Within this committee, we have identi/fied challenges for cancer patients and are conducting activities to tackle the challenges based on our Advocacy Engagement Strategy (see Figure 1). One of the goals of our Advocacy Engagement Strategy is to identify the unmet needs of patients in the disease areas of interest to our pipeline assets. For instance, many cancer patients",

To address these issues, we collaborate with relevant organizations to raise awareness of the importance of testing and to provide support in improving patient access to clinical trials and increase biomarker testing rates. Additionally, we conduct surveys to directly ask patients about their reasons for choosing speci/fic treatments or clinical trials, and we also established advisory committees with a focus on patient experiences with ADCs in both the US and Europe. These initiatives provide us valuable insights. Furthermore, we support public education and campaigns to raise awareness in order to reduce the social stigma associated with cancer. Our daily efforts are to improve the quality of life for patients, with the goal for them to \"thrive with cancer', and to provide the necessary support for patients and their families to live better and longer lives.\n\nOliver I will discuss Patient Centricity with a focus on CVD. CVD is a\n\nleading cause of death worldwide, with Europe alone experiencing more than 10,000 deaths per day. Additionally, it is projected that the population of individuals aged 65 and above in Europe will reach 155 million by 2040, further increasing the incidence of CVD. Considering this situation, the EU Specialty Business Unit has implemented three speci/fic initiatives. Firstly, we established a Patient Engagement function in 2023 to strengthen our collaboration with patient organizations. This function is working closely with the Oncology Business Unit Patient Advocacy team to ensure a consistent approach across our entire Group. We aim to support healthcare professionals in managing the entire life journey of patients with cardiovascular disease from a long-term perspective, providing comprehensive care and support. The second is to strengthen our relationship with patient organizations.

Based on these results, we have established cooperative relationships with 4 relevant patient organizations in Europe *2 . The third initiative is to raise patients' awareness through education and campaigns. We have launched disease awareness campaigns for atrial /fibrillation and dyslipidemia through two patient-focused websites *3 , to increase their literacy and also to promote the prevention in\n\na holistic and human-centric way. We also provide information on CVD through the website, 'We Care for Every Heartbeat *4 ', which serves as a central hub for all activities. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Oncology Business Unit, we organize the \"O-Mamori Award\" to support organizations implementing innovative projects that contribute to improving the quality of life, prevention, and education for patients.  Following last year's event, we are planning to hold the \"Dyslipidemia Flash Mob\" event\n\nfor disease awareness on this year's World Heart Day, with the sponsorship of three patient organizations.\n\nUeno I believe the collaboration with over 900 patient organizations by Patient Advocacy and the comprehensive activities in the /field of CVD by DSE are truly commendable. Dr. Komatsu, could you please provide your comments on Daiichi Sankyo's global initiatives?\n\nKomatsu I am deeply impressed by the efforts to build relationships with numerous patient organizations and the wide range of activities incorporating Patient Centricity. I believe it is important to promote Patient Advocacy activities based on trust relationships with those organizations, as it allows us to provide appropriate information to patients and understand their actual concerns and needs. Furthermore, I also hope that by utilizing various types of media for educational activities, Daiichi Sankyo Group can contribute to the reduction of the stigma associated with cancer.\n\n## Challenges towards realizing Patient Centricity in the medical /field\n\nUeno I would like to ask Dr. Komatsu about the challenges in realizing Patient Centricity in the healthcare /field, from the perspective of an expert in\n\nFigure1 Advocacy Engagement Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of the \"We Care For Every Heartbeat\" initiative, we are conducting the European Survey of Cardiovascular Disease to assess the current understanding and perceptions of CVD in order to improve early diagnosis and treatment for patients. * The survey targets over 6,000 individuals from five countries (Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK) and will take place in October 2021.\n\nhttps://www.a/fibmatters.org/\n\n## clinical and public health.\n\nKomatsu While Patient Centricity is an important concept, many challenges and barriers still exist. For example, in the clinical setting, there is a signi/ficant gap in understanding between healthcare professionals and patients. Even if healthcare professionals strive to understand patients' values, there are still cases where patients themselves are unaware of their own needs. Therefore, it is necessary for us to strengthen our relationship with patients and their families and create opportunities for patients to freely express their thoughts, in order to identify their individual values and needs. To accurately understand patients' needs, we need to utilize various channels. One initiative I am working on is the development of decision-making support and communication tools for patients. The tool is composed of a six-page note in which patients can record their daily lives, changes in their condition, and any questions they may have. By sharing this with their doctors during consultations, it enables patients and doctors to communicate smoothly and certainly. Even patients who may hesitate to express their concerns verbally can share information through the note. Developing such materials and tools can be challenging for individual healthcare institutions, so I believe that involving pharmaceutical companies and advocacy organizations in development would be bene/ficial for both patients and healthcare professionals.\n\n## Challenges and expectations for the future promotion of Patient Centricity\n\nUeno Oliver, Gissoo, could you share your thoughts on the challenges in promoting Patient Centricity within your respective organizations and the expectations for our Group in promoting further co-creation of value with patients?\n\nOliver We have varying strict regulatory environments in Europe. Therefore, signi/ficant efforts are required to communicate with patients in meaningful ways and provide value. Patients now have access to a wealth of information about their symptoms, diseases, and side effects, and their needs and demands have become diverse. In particular, in recent years, the importance of prevention has increased significantly, and patient organizations are increasingly engaged in disease awareness and education. In the midst of these societal changes, the pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility to support communication between healthcare professionals and patients and contribute to the transformation of healthcare by not only providing valuable contributions through medicines but also enhancing patient empowerment through the provision of comprehensive disease awareness information. In our global market strategy, in order to enable healthcare professionals, payers, and other stakeholders to make the best choices for patients, we focus on providing information from a deeper patient perspective and support on their activities. Collaboration with patient organizations is essential in these\n\nV\n\nactivities. We will continue to work responsibly and build long-term trusted relationships with patient organizations, as we believe that this is the key to success.\n\nGissoo I agree with Oliver's opinion. It is a wonderful thing to have cross-organizational activities, especially when signi/ficant changes are happening throughout our organization. Patient Centricity is a challenge that concerns all of us. It is important for each individual, within their respective organizations and daily work, to consider how they can take actions with the patients' perspectives. Although some teams may not be able to engage directly with patients, all of our work is ultimately connected to providing value to patients. I think 'listening' is the most important part, hearing what the patient's needs are and working internally with all of our cross-functional partners and alliance partners to be able to deliver on that promise to the patients that we could make their quality of lives better.\n\nKomatsu There is a concept called the Socio-Ecological Framework that is highly regarded in public health. It suggests that various levels of interaction, such as individual, interpersonal, community, and societal/policy levels, in/fluence people's health and behavior. Although companies have limited contact with individuals, society, and policy levels due to various regulations, I believe that they can contribute to the Socio-Ecological Framework by supporting patients in collaboration with healthcare providers. Furthermore, patient involvement is needed to enhance the quality of clinical trials. To encourage active patient participation in clinical trials, it is important for patients to consider themselves not just as research subjects but as 'co-creators of pharmaceuticals' whose participation can bene/fit other patients. Through this process, doctors and pharmaceutical companies can gain insights from patients' experiences in clinical trials and Patient Journeys. By re/flecting them, I believe we can achieve further improvement and success in clinical trials. In addition to individual patients, social-wide public awareness initiative is also important. This is something that cannot be achieved by healthcare providers alone in hospitals, and I believe that pharmaceutical companies should exert greater in/fluence in this area.\n\nUeno Through today's discussion, we have gained many insights from each specialized /field. Firstly, it is necessary to further spread the mindset of Patient Centricity in all countries, regions, and organizations within the Daiichi Sankyo Group. Everything we do as pharmaceutical companies contributes to improving patients' lives. By carefully listening to patients' opinions and incorporating their voices into our work and decision-making processes, we can provide effective solutions.\n\nCollaboration with various stakeholders, including patient organizations, is essential for co-creating value with patients. We will continue to strengthen communication with various organizations and work towards a better society with Patient Centricity as our guiding principle.",

Re/flecting on this past year, I /find the following three points particularly signi/ficant. First, the decision to establish a strategic alliance with Merck & Co., Inc. in the United States. This alliance has enabled us to deliver our products to more patients, more quickly, while also enhancing our internal capacity, resources, and capabilities. The second signi/ficant point is that we updated the expectation on numerical targets (KPIs) for FY2025 under our current 5-year business plan (FY2021-FY2025) and simultaneously decided to acquire our own shares. Over the past year, I have had the opportunity to engage in dialogue with many investors and shareholders. Based on these engagements, I believe we have successfully balanced future-oriented growth investments with enhanced shareholder returns. The /final point is the preparation for the launch of our global organizational structure. Aiming to become a true business partner, we initiated a new global organizational structure with standardized processes in April 2024. With this structure, we believe we can now execute swift and accurate decision-making and optimal resource allocation on a global scale, under the leadership of the CFO. Moving forward, I am committed to continuing to provide leadership toward realizing our 2030 Vision of becoming an 'Innovative Global Healthcare Company Contributing to the Sustainable Development of Society.'\n\n## Progress and update on the current 5-year business plan (FY2021-FY2025)\n\nThe Daiichi Sankyo Group is working on its current 5-year business plan (FY2021-FY2025) aimed at achieving its FY2025 target of becoming an innovative global healthcare company with a competitive advantage in oncology and shift to further growth to achieve our 2030 Vision. Speci/fically, by implementing the four strategic pillars and strengthening the foundation that supports these strategies, we aim to achieve our KPI targets of \u00a51.6 trillion in revenue (\u00a5600 billion or more from the oncology business), a core operating pro/fit ratio before R&D expenses *1 of 40%, Return on Equity (ROE) of 16% or more, and DOE (dividend on equity ratio) *2 of 8% or more in FY2025, which is\n\n## the /final /fiscal year of the plan.\n\nThree years have passed since the launch of the current 5-year business plan, and the four strategic pillars are progressing smoothly, increasing our confidence in achieving the FY2025 goals. I will provide an update on the progress of 'Maximizing 3ADCs' and 'pro/fit growth for current business and products.'\n\nRegarding the most important of the four strategic pillars, 'Maximizing 3ADCs,' our global product, the anticancer agent Enhertu \u00ae , has been growing steadily across countries and regions, exceeding our initial expectations.\n\nIn the United States, we have secured market leadership across all indications obtained, particularly in breast cancer. While market share has grown to a significantly high level, Enhertu represents a major shift from traditional standard treatments, and some physicians remain cautious about switching from established therapies. Currently, we are strengthening information provision to such physicians while aiming to further expand our market share. In Europe, market share is steadily growing in major markets like Germany and France, and market penetration is progressing smoothly in Italy, where the product was newly launched in 2023. In Japan as well, prescriptions are steadily increasing, particularly for breast and gastric cancers, securing top market share across all obtained indications. Furthermore, in the ASCA (Asia, South & Central America) regions, prescriptions have grown signi/ficantly, especially in Brazil and China.\n\nRegarding 'profit growth for current business and products,' the sales of our global product, the anticoagulant Lixiana \u00ae are progressing smoothly in Japan, Europe, and the ASCA regions. Additionally, sales of the pain treatment Tarlige \u00ae in Japan, the iron de/ficiency anemia treatment Venofer \u00ae in the U.S., and the hypercholesterolemia treatments Nilemdo \u00ae /Nustendi \u00ae in Europe have shown steady growth, signi/ficantly contributing to the creation of resources for investments in sustainable growth and shareholder returns. Furthermore, the pro/fits from the steadily growing American Regent, which sells iron de/ficiency anemia treatment drugs and generic injectables in the United States, and Daiichi Sankyo Healthcare, which sells OTC pharmaceutical products in Japan, are steadily growing. It is expected that their pro/fits will account for approximately half of the consolidated core operating pro/fit in FY2024.\n\n## Expectation on achieving FY2025 KPIs (As of Apr. 2024)\n\n|                                                     | At the time of planning 5YBP   | As of Apr. 2024   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Revenue                                             | 1.6 Tr JPY                     | 2.1 Tr JPY        |\n| Revenue in Oncology                                 | 600 Bn JPY                     | 1,000 Bn JPY      |\n| Core Operating Pro/fit ratio* 1 before R&D expenses | 40%                            | 40%               |\n| ROE                                                 | 16%                            | 16%               |\n| DOE* 2                                              | 8%                             | 8.5%              |\n\nCurrency rate assumptions\n\n1 USD=105 JPY 1 EUR=120 JPY\n\n1 USD=145 JPY 1 EUR=155 JPY",

        "page_content": "## C F O   M e s s a g e\n\n## Expectation on FY2025 KPI achievement (as of April 2024)\n\nBased on the steady progress over the three years since the start of the current 5-year business plan, we anticipate that FY2025 revenue will reach \u00a52.1 trillion, exceeding our target of \u00a51.6 trillion by \u00a5500 billion, driven by increased revenue projections in the oncology /field.\n\nIn FY2025, we anticipate that revenue from the oncology /field will exceed \u00a51 trillion within the consolidated revenue. However, the revenue forecast for Dato-DXd in FY2025 has been revised downward due to a reevaluation of the target patient population based on clinical trial results and adjustments to the timeline. On the other hand, for Enhertu, we anticipate further revenue growth in the breast cancer market based on clinical trial results. Additionally, due to the revenue impact from the upfront payment received upon entering into the strategic alliance with Merck in the U.S. for HER3-DXd, I-DXd, and DS-6000, we expect oncology revenue for FY2025 to exceed \u00a51 trillion, surpassing the target of \u00a5600 billion by \u00a5400 billion.\n\nWith the increase in revenue, we expect higher costs of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. However, improvements in cost ratios due to changes in product mix and efficient, effective expense management will enable us to continue aiming for a core operating profit margin before R&D expense of 40%. Furthermore, as the potential of our R&D pipeline continues to expand smoothly, we will actively invest in research and development for sustained growth. We aim to maintain a ROE of 16% or more. Additionally, we anticipate that our DOE will exceed our target of 8% and reach 8.5% or more, due to improved capital ef/ficiency and enhanced shareholder returns.\n\nThree years have passed since the start of the current 5-year business plan, we strongly feel that the pro/fit expansion phase moving beyond the investment phase is now approaching.\n\n## Well-Balanced investment for growth and shareholder returns (Cash Allocation)\n\nDuring the current 5-year business plan period, we will follow a policy of well-balanced cash allocation between investment for growth and shareholder returns. Specifically, a portion of the cash allocation will be dedicated to investment for growth (such as R&D and capital expenditures) and shareholder returns. The remaining portion will be /flexibly allocated based on the progress of the R&D pipeline, considering a balance between further growth-oriented R&D investments and shareholder returns.\n\nThe cash allocation for the current 5-year business plan period, comprising the initial cash on hand at the start of the current 5-year business plan and the operating cash /flow before R&D expenses over the /five years, is expected to increase by approximately \u00a5900 billion to around \u00a53.7 trillion compared to the initial forecast, due to the receipt of upfront payments from the strategic alliance with Merck in the U.S. The increased cash allocation will primarily be used for enhancing R&D investments, capital expenditures for future growth, and further strengthening shareholder returns.\n\nFor R&D expenses prioritized for the development of DXd ADCs, we plan to increase the allocation by \u00a5450 billion compared to the initial forecast of the current 5-year business plan, totaling approximately \u00a51.95 trillion over the /five years. Of this, the R&D expenses for FY2024 and FY2025 are expected to be around \u00a51 trillion, due to the initiation of new trials for products such as Enhertu. Compared to the initial forecast, for HER3-DXd, I-DXd, and DS-6000, we will accelerate development to maximize product value through strategic alliance with Merck in the U.S., which will speed up expansion trials and the initiation of new trials. On the other hand, due to the impact of development cost sharing from the strategic alliance, the projected R&D expenses for these three products have decreased compared to one year ago. The resources se-\n\n## Well-balanced investment for growth and shareholder returns Cash allocation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nV\n\ncured through development cost sharing will be actively invested in initiatives for sustainable growth, progressing towards building new pillars of growth following the 5DXd ADCs. Additionally, we anticipate an increase in R&D expenses due to expanded medical affairs activities (new evidence creation and delivery) along with such as expanding evidence creation and information dissemination related to the expansion of indications for Enhertu, and the launch of Dato-DXd and HER3-DXd. We will also further strengthen our R&D infrastructure including expanding our development staff to accelerate and expand the development of 5DXd ADCs and other products.\n\nRegarding capital expenditures, we plan to increase the allocation by \u00a5300 billion compared to the initial forecast of the current 5-year business plan, totaling approximately \u00a5800 billion over /five years. The primary purpose of this increase is to strengthen our production infrastructure, with a signi/ficant portion allocated to enhancing the production infrastructure for DXd ADCs. We will address the growing demand for DXd ADCs resulting from the steady growth of the Enhertu business, advancements in the development of Enhertu and Dato-DXd, and the strategic alliance and development progress with Merck in the U.S. for HER3-DXd, I-DXd, and DS-6000. Going forward, we will continue to invest in both our own production facilities and external contract manufacturing organizations in a balanced manner. For DXd ADCs production facilities, we will invest not only in our plants in Japan but also in utilizing our facilities in the U.S. and Germany as DXd ADCs production sites.\n\nWe will further strengthen shareholder returns through increased dividends in line with pro/fit growth and /flexible acquisition of our own shares. These aspects will be explained in detail in the following section.\n\n## Shareholder return policy\n\nIn the current 5-year business plan, we have adopted DOE as a KPI for shareholder returns, aiming to achieve a rate of 8% or more, which exceeds the cost of equity capital, in FY2025.\n\nDOE is an indicator that combines ROE and the dividend payout ratio, encompassing both capital efficiency and shareholder returns, which are crucial for enhancing corporate value. As the company transitions to a pro/fit growth phase under the current 5-year business plan, it is essential to consider dividends in conjunction with capital costs and capital ef/ficiency. Therefore, we have adopted DOE as our key indicator.\n\nRegarding ROE, we aim to achieve a rate in the high 11% range\n\nDOE (Dividend on Equity) = Total Dividends \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity =  ROE (Net Income \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity) \u00d7 Payout Ratio (Total Dividends \u00f7 Net Income)\n\nfor the FY2024 and 16% or more for the FY2025 by expanding capital ef/ficiency through revenue growth driven by Enhertu and /flexible acquisition of our own shares.\n\nRegarding the equity ratio, we consider approximately 60% to be an appropriate level from both /financial security and capital ef/ficiency perspectives. Although the equity ratio has temporarily decreased due to the strategic alliance with Merck, where a portion of the upfront payment received is recorded as deferred revenue (liability) for future sales revenue, we expect to gradually bring the equity ratio back to around 60% over the coming years as we recognize deferred revenue as sales revenue. Regarding cross-shareholdings, we generally do not hold listed shares, except when it is deemed to contribute to maintaining or strengthening long-term business relationships and enhancing our corporate value. We are progressively selling these shares, taking into account their impact on the market and other factors.\n\nWe aim to further enhance shareholder returns through increased dividends in line with pro/fit growth and /flexible acquisition of our own shares. With the expansion of Enhertu sales, the likelihood of achieving the key numerical targets for FY2025 has increased, so we plan to continue increasing dividends in FY2024, as we did in FY2022 and FY2023. Additionally, to enhance shareholder returns and improve capital ef/ficiency, we have decided and are implementing own shares acquisition program with a total purchase amount of \u00a5200 billion and a maximum of 55 million shares.\n\nAs a result of these initiatives, we expect DOE to exceed the target of 8% by 0.5%, reaching 8.5% or more.\n\n## Commitment as CFO\n\n## towards maximizing shareholder value\n\nIn the year since my appointment as CFO, I have engaged in discussions with many shareholders and investors about our Group's sustainable growth through advancements in the oncology business and our innovative development pipeline. Through these dialogues, I aim to enhance our company's valuation in the stock market. Our company aims to manage in a way that contributes to the increase in Total Shareholder Return (TSR), which is the sum of dividends and capital gains divided by the investment amount. As of the end of July 2024, our market capitalization exceeds \u00a511 trillion, and the PBR (Price-to-Book Ratio) is over 6 times, indicating that our company's value is highly appreciated by the stock market. Moving forward, we will continue to strive for maximizing corporate value through active dialogue with shareholders, investors, and all stakeholders.",

Under the leadership of the Head of Global Information Security, we are implementing information security measures on a global scale. Additionally, the Chief Digital Transformation Officer (CDXO), the chief officer in the digital domain with information management functions, supervises digital transformation for the entire organization and oversees the conduct of its operations.\n\nOur information and system assets referred to in the information security policy include information on our business units, as well as our business partners and customers, and data, media, information systems, and industrial systems that include the information. We have standardized information management measures among Group companies in Japan and are continuously assessing them to ensure thorough information management. In information security, we have established the Daiichi Sankyo Group Information Security Standard to enhance the level of security measures globally. We assess compliance with these standards and implement continuous improvements based on the results. Furthermore, since FY2023, we have transferred the information security function to the digital transformation management department, 'Global DX', to further strengthen information security across the entire group. To protect information resources from security threats, raising awareness among all employees is crucial. As part of our information security awareness activities tailored to the specific circumstances of each company, we educate employees about cyber-attacks and targeted e-mails, etc. on an ongoing basis.\n\nMoreover, under the leadership of the Head of Global Information Security, we operate a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) *2 , which conducts 24-hour security monitoring with the support of external security partners. To effectively counter cyberattacks, collaboration with other organizations is essential. We work closely with external expert organizations and other CSIRTs to gather information and develop and promote security\n\nmeasures. By building such cooperative relationships, we contribute not only to the security within our Group but also to the overall enhancement of security in society.\n\nFurthermore, to address the risk of cyberattacks on control devices and systems involved in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process, we are actively promoting Operational Technology (OT) security measures. Specifically, we are advancing security measures by designing a standard model that organizes recommended security technologies, as well as processes for evaluating and managing OT security risks. With these measures, we minimize risks related to quality control and stable supply, thereby contributing to the provision of pharmaceuticals to patients.\n\n*1 Abbreviation for Chief Digital Transformation Officer\n\n*2 A framework for dealing with incidents relating to computer security in enterprises\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strengthening the Management System for Safety and Quality Assurance\n\nTo deliver safe and high-quality products that patients can use with confidence, we have established and strengthened a management system that complies with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality control, as well as Good Distribution Practice (GDP) for ensuring the quality of pharmaceuticals during transportation and storage. This comprehensive quality assurance approach covers the entire process, from the procurement and storage of raw materials to pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution. In addition, we conduct regular audits of our group company sites and business partners to ensure the maintenance and\n\nenhancement of an appropriate quality management system, as well as to reduce risks.\n\nRegarding safety, we have established a system that enables us to conduct safety monitoring activities on a global scale. We promote activities aimed at minimizing risks on patient safety by evaluating, reviewing, and analyzing safety information (such as side effect information) collected from around the world and promptly providing the results to healthcare professionals. Additionally, we conduct annual training on safety information for all employees, striving to foster a strong awareness of Patient Safety.",

And what do you think of the new executive structure following the appointment of President Okuzawa?\n\nDirector Kama I am working to ensure a clear separation between the execution and supervision of management. In addition, based on the annual board evaluation, I am striving to further strengthen the oversight function by improving operational aspects.\n\nThe role of the Board of Directors is to 'enrich discussions aimed at sustainable growth and steadily ful/fill its supervisory role.'

Additionally, based on the revised matters for deliberation and reported matters of the Board, we are optimizing items for deliberation and reporting and advancing the delegation of authority from the Board of Directors to the execution team. We also conduct thorough pre-meetings with the CEO and COO regarding the selection and content of agenda items.\n\nAs we enter a phase of full-scale globalization, we selected Mr. Okuzawa as the President and COO based on his extensive global work experience and ability to embody our Core Values and Core Behaviors that serve as the foundation for fostering our company culture, which will be crucial skills and experiences required for the president over the next few years. Amid the rapidly changing business environment, we highly appreciate President Okuzawa's leadership in driving organizational transformation to strengthen global management.

Specifically, besides discussions on the portfolio centered on the ADC business, we also discussed global human resources and the One DS Culture. Additionally, we have been receiving timely reports on the globalization of corporate functions, the CxO structure initiated in FY2023, and the progress of various projects. As the Board of Directors, we believe it is important to ensure that appropriate business plans and progress are being made, and that appropriate risks are being taken as part of 'offensive governance.' Therefore, we monitor whether the necessary actions are taken and ask the relevant questions to encourage the executive side. In this way, as an Outside Director and the Chairperson of the Board, I strive to participate in discussions and manage the board operations from a third-party perspective. Particularly last year, through discussions on the strategic alliance with Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA, we were able to enhance our discussions on long-term strategies.\n\nAmid the rapid expansion of our global business and the acceleration of global management, we aim to deepen discussions on the 'global healthcare company' we are aiming to become, while listening to the challenges and\n\nprogress reported by the executive side.\n\nIn light of the remarks from Director Kama, would you please update us on the progress of the executive initiatives? In particular, we would like to hear about the key discussion points regarding the strategic alliance with Merck.\n\nCEO Manabe There have been various opinions within the company regarding our strategic alliance with Merck. I believe that we have chosen the best means to embody our Purpose, 'Contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world,' and our Mission, 'Create innovative pharmaceuticals addressing diverse medical needs,' in order to deliver innovative medicines to more patients more quickly. We determined that, considering the increasing need to enhance capacity, resources, and capabilities for maximizing the DXd ADC franchise, as well as the intensifying competition in development, opting for a strategic alliance rather than pursuing in-house development and commercialization would achieve greater corporate and product value. This conclusion was reached after thorough deliberation by the execution team, taking into account both internal and external environmental changes. We believe that, in terms of speed and scale, we can expect to create a social impact that Daiichi Sankyo alone could not achieve. Furthermore, through the upfront payment received as part of the strategic alliance agreement, we have the opportunity to allocate funds towards increased research and development expenses, facility investments, and further strengthening of shareholder returns for future growth.\n\nDuring the Board of Directors' deliberations, the execution team engaged in extensive discussions with Outside Directors from various perspectives. These\n\ndiscussions included the risks associated with entering into a new alliance in addition to the existing one with AstraZeneca, as well as the potential for business growth independently. From an oversight perspective, we received various advice on the content of the deliberations, helping us understand and support the fact that this decision is crucial for the company's mid- to long-term growth.\n\nRegarding the strategic alliance with Merck, could you please elaborate on the key points that the Board of Directors emphasized, the future challenges, and the details of the discussions?\n\nDirector Kama The recent strategic alliance with Merck has a signi/ficant impact on our business strategy. The Board of Directors received multiple brie/fings and engaged in extensive discussions about it. We also addressed concerns regarding entering a strategic alliance with another company while we are already partnered with AstraZeneca, and discussed the reasons for selecting Merck as our new partner. From the perspectives of pursuing our Purpose and Mission, ensuring sustainable growth, enhancing corporate value, and strengthening competitiveness, I believe we have selected the best partner under the best terms. The Board of Directors also felt that we were able to support the executives from the standpoint of 'offensive governance'.\n\nWhile maximizing the business value in the oncology /field is crucial, from the perspective of 'defensive governance,' it is also essential for the Board of Directors to appropriately oversee the execution team's efforts to strengthen internal controls, manage company-wide risks, and ensure proper compliance. Governance includes not only supervision but also supporting and encouraging the executives. We believe it is necessary to clearly distinguish between risks to be taken and risks to be avoided, thereby increasing the emphasis on offensive governance. As the Chairperson of the Board, I am committed to facilitating discussions that will contribute to the sustainable growth and long-term enhancement of corporate value for Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nStriving to Optimize the Balance Between Oversight and Execution, and Strengthening Operations to Enhance the Effectiveness of the Oversight Function\n\nPlease tell us about the initiatives related to one of the priority measures for FY2023, 'Enhancement in terms of operation for further strengthening of the decision-making functions and oversight functions of the Board.'\n\nDirector Kama In order to review the balance between supervision and execution for our company and to optimize the matters for deliberation and reporting, we revised the standard for submitting matters for deliberation and reported matters of the Board, effective from FY2023. Speci/fically, we advanced the delegation of authority from the Board of Directors to the execution team,\n\nstreamlined the matters for deliberation and reporting, and enriched discussions on important business execution matters. We believe this has also enhanced /flexibility and agility in business operations. Additionally, in FY2023, we also revised the matters for deliberation and reporting within the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee.\n\nAs for opportunities for discussions outside the Board of Directors, a total of nine meetings were held last year, including Outside Directors' meeting, brie/fing for Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and meetings to exchange views among Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. We are enhancing discussions among board members to further strengthen the decision-making and oversight functions of the Board of Directors. We also held quarterly meetings consisting solely of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, where active discussions took place.\n\nWe also conducted detailed pre-meetings with the CEO and COO regarding the selection and content of agenda items and carefully worked out the time allocation. I feel that the Board of Directors, particularly the Outside Directors, are having a more active exchange of opinions. This is not just my impression; I have also received similar feedback from everyone during the meetings for Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members and in the board evaluation.\n\nPlease tell us about the division of roles in the operations of the Board of Directors and decision-making in management, as well as efforts to deepen discussions.\n\nCEO Manabe Detailed monthly meetings are held with the Chairperson of the Board, including the COO, regarding the selection and management of board agenda items. For Outside Directors, we provide individual pre-meetings to explain the content of the Board meetings and invite them to attend the Executive Management Committee (EMC) Meeting as observers, ensuring that discussions at the Board meetings are more in-depth. As for the matters for deliberation and reporting at the Board of Directors, the execution team thoroughly discusses these items at the EMC Meeting and then reports them to the Board. We believe the Board's role is to supervise these discussions, provide expert advice, and assess risks.\n\nOutside of the Board meetings, we held briefings to deepen their understanding of the ADC business strategy, R&D activities and other initiatives on the executive side. We deeply feel that all Outside Directors strongly empathize with and support our company's Purpose and Vision. Additionally, we received numerous valuable insights from them, leveraging their experiences to support the sustainable growth of our Group. Particularly, we received precise and insightful comments in the discussions about our strategic alliance with Merck, including both positive and negative viewpoints.\n\nPlease tell us about the operational status of the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee, as well as the performance evaluations of the CEO and COO conducted by the joint meeting.",

        "page_content": "Director Kama Both committees, which had been established as advisory bodies to the President, were restructured as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors in 2020. The two committees were composed of four Outside Directors, with one Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member participating as an observer. However, starting from FY2024, with the addition of Director Honma, the committees now consist of five Outside Directors. In the FY2021 board evaluation by a third-party organization, our Board of Directors and its advisory bodies, the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee, were assessed as functioning appropriately. We also plan to conduct a third-party evaluation this /fiscal year.\n\nIn FY2023, the Nomination Committee convened nine times, and the Compensation Committee eleven times. In addition to the regular committee meetings, joint meetings of the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee were held in March and September for further discussions. Regarding the goal setting and evaluation of the CEO and COO, in March we conducted the /final evaluation of the current /fiscal year's performance and set the goals for the next fiscal year. In September, we reviewed the progress towards achieving these goals. In the September discussions, we deliberated on the reappointment or dismissal of the CEO and COO. The performance evaluations conducted in March are then connected to the discussions of the Compensation Committee. The activities of both committees and joint meetings are reported to the Board of Directors every three months. We believe that through these processes, which ensure objectivity and transparency, we are strengthening governance and that the Board of Directors is fully ful/filling its expected role.\n\nIncreasing the Number of Outside Directors to Optimize the Composition of the Board of Directors, and Initiatives for Globalization and Development of Next-Generation Leaders\n\nPlease provide an update on the initiatives related to the FY2023 priority measures of 'Further considerations for optimizing the Board composition.' Additionally, please explain the reasons for appointing Outside Director Honma.\n\nDirector Kama Our Board of Directors has identi/fied nine key skills that are considered particularly important in light of our company's management direction, our Purpose and Mission, long-term management direction, and business strategies. These skills are crucial for realizing the 2030 Vision and for the Board to ful/fill its functions effectively. Regarding Directors, we select Board members from among the candidates by considering diversity and balance to ensure none of these skills are lacking. This selection is based on strengthening the decision-making and oversight functions. Recognizing the need for a majority of Outside Directors, we decided to increase the number of Outside Directors in FY2023 and appointed Yo Honma, the President and CEO of NTT Data Group\n\nCorporation (stepping down in June 2024), starting in FY2024. Outside Director Honma brings extensive experience and broad knowledge in overall corporate management, IT and digital technology, and corporate globalization, stemming from his background as a company executive in the information and communication sector. We are con/fident that he will leverage his extensive experience and broad knowledge to address challenges related to global management transformation and the acceleration of innovation through digital transformation (DX), which are critical for our company's sustainable growth.\n\nWe continue to recognize challenges related to the number of Directors, the ratio of Inside to Outside Directors, and diversity in terms of gender and international representation. We are actively considering these factors to achieve an optimal board composition.\n\nPlease share your thoughts on management diversity, including gender and international representation, as well as the optimal composition of members, including the executive structure.\n\nCEO Manabe Against the backdrop of the rapid business expansion in oncology and the acceleration of global management, ensuring diversity among Directors, including gender and international representation, is more important than ever for the Board of Directors. We sometimes receive external opinions regarding the appointment of executives and CxO experienced individuals from companies in the same industry. However, we intend to actively consider capable candidates regardless of whether they are from companies in the same industry.\n\nOn the executive side, as globalization progresses, there is a need to expand and build the management foundation, including organization and human resources. We are promoting the appointment of candidates of diverse nationalities to Global Head positions, strengthening the global management structure, and fostering global leaders and talents.\n\nIn April, we launched the 'DS Academy,' a program aimed at developing future global leaders, and it has had a successful start as expected. In order for the Daiichi Sankyo Group to continuously and globally provide value, we aim to develop the next generation of leaders by having not only external lecturers but also our own executives take the rostrum. They will focus on deepening understanding of the history, innovation, and DNA of the Daiichi Sankyo Group as a century-old company. In addition to advanced management skills, we seek to strengthen their ability to see the business from a long-term and ultra-longterm perspective.\n\n## Sustainable Growth and Further Enhancement of Corporate Value\n\nPlease share your initiatives and thoughts on realizing the 2030 Vision and enhancing corporate value.\n\nCEO Manabe With the expansion of our oncology business and the global\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstrengthening of each function, it is essential to enhance our most important capital-human capital-by securing and developing talents. Additionally, we aim to realize our Purpose and Vision by promoting the One DS Culture, which is fundamental to our value creation process. In 2024, we have established the Daiichi Sankyo Group People Philosophy, focusing on creating an inclusive environment where diverse employees can maximize their abilities through mutual cooperation and trust, and where each individual's opinions are respected. Through these initiatives focusing on human resources, we will maximize 'human capital' and make it the driving force for sustainable value creation, thereby enhancing corporate value even further.\n\nAdditionally, strengthening 'Science & Technology,' the source of value creation, is crucial for sustainable growth. Even in uncertain /fields or uncharted territories, fostering an organizational culture that encourages researchers to pursue their scienti/fic interests, supports valuable challenges with hypotheses, repeats worthwhile challenges, and shares learnings from many failures to inform the next endeavor, is key. The accumulation of those cycles leads to the buildup of unique knowledge and experiences, which serve as a continuous source of innovation. We believe that the continued trust placed in our research and development capabilities by successive generations of management has been instrumental in driving innovation.\n\nOur Group has positioned 'creating shared value with stakeholders' as one of the strategic pillars of our current 5-year business plan. With 'Passion for Innovation. Compassion for Patients.' at the core of our corporate activities, we are promoting Patient Centricity initiatives across the entire value chain. Through these initiatives, we aim to enhance our social signi/ficance by keeping patients in mind in all our business activities, and always returning to our Purpose, 'Contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world,'.\n\nPlease share the challenges to enhance sustainable corporate value, the role of the Board of Directors in addressing these challenges, and your message to stakeholders.\n\nDirector Kama To support 'Science & Technology' and to continuously create innovative new medicines, we need to maintain active investment. On the other hand, while balancing returns to shareholders, we believe it is necessary to secure a /flexible allocation framework that can respond to changes in the business environment, and to invest for sustainable growth and enhancement of corporate value with an eye on 2030 and beyond.\n\nTo speed up execution through the delegation of authority to the execution team, it is also important to build trust alongside optimizing the balance between oversight and execution. Although we believe that a suf/ficient level of trust has already been established, we aim to further enhance this relationship through discussions on the pursuit of Daiichi Sankyo's Purpose and the enhancement of corporate value.\n\nIt is necessary to have continuous discussions about what the corporate value of our company is for all stakeholders, including patients and healthcare professionals, by considering the value provided by the Daiichi Sankyo Group as a combination of social value, environmental value, and /financial value. This /fiscal year, we will continue to engage in high-quality discussions from a long-term perspective. By achieving sustainable growth for the company and enhancing mid- to long-term corporate value, we will ultimately meet the expectations and trust of all our stakeholders.",

Structure\n\nTo clarify Directors management responsibility and reinforce their oversight of management and the conduct of operations, their terms of of/fice are set at one year, and /five out of our ten Directors are Outside Directors. Since June 2020, an Outside Director has been appointed Chairperson of the Board of Directors. To ensure management transparency, the Company has established two voluntary committees as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors: the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee. Both committees respectively deliberate on selections or dismissals of CEO and COO, the succession plan of CEO, selections of Director and Audit & Supervisory Board Member candidates, the compensation policy for Directors, the individual amounts of compensation of Directors, and other matters. It is comprised by /five Outside Directors and one Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member participates as the observer in each committee. For audits of legal compliance and soundness of management, the Company has adopted an Audit & Supervisory Board system and established the Audit & Supervisory Board comprising /five Audit & Supervisory Board Members, including three Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The Company prescribes speci/fic criteria on the judgment of independence of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members and basic matters regarding execution of duties by Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. Under the global management structure, the\n\nthe Board of Directors to make important business decisions and oversee its management appropriately, establishing an internal control system that ensures proper delegation of power from the Board of Directors, and making sure the Board of Directors will improve its function and effectiveness.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to work on further optimizing the Board of Directors' composition,  strengthening our corporate governance systems, as well as securing and improving the functions and effectiveness of the Board of Directors.\n\nManagement Executive Meeting with CxOs, Unit Heads, and Heads of Global Corporate Functions as members is held as appropriate to deliberate on important matters related to the strategy, policy, and execution of group management, and to contribute to management decision-making.\n\nThe Company employs a Corporate Of/ficer System which contributes to appropriate and swift management decision-making and the conduct of operations. With the aims of ensuring effectiveness and ef/ficiency of operations, ensuring reliability of /financial reporting, complying with applicable laws and regulations relevant to business activities, and safeguarding assets, the Company structures its internal control system to consist of self-monitoring carried out by respective organizations which execute its functions (primary controls), policy development and monitoring for respective organizations carried out by the corporate organization (secondary controls), and internal auditing encompassing monitoring carried out by the Internal Audit Department (tertiary controls). We have adopted this corporate governance structure to be optimal for establishing a management structure that can respond swiftly and /flexibly to changes in the business environment, for ensuring legal compliance and management transparency, and for strengthening the oversight functions over the management and the execution of business.\n\n## Overview of the Corporate Governance Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*The Corporate Ethics Committee and the EHS (Environment, Health, and Safety) Management Committee each held two meetings in FY2023.

With the revised standard for submitting deliberation and reported matters of the Board, we are now able to allocate suf/ficient time for deliberation, leading to more active discussions. I believe that the Board of Directors was able to support the executive side by holding multiple discussions regarding the strategic partnership with Merck. An additional Outside Director was appointed, bringing the number of Inside and Outside Directors to /five each. In our efforts to optimize the composition of the Board of Directors, we recognize challenges related to the total number of members, the ratio of Inside to Outside Directors as well as diversity in terms of gender and international representation, and we will continue to review these matters. This /fiscal year, we will continue to enhance discussions aimed at the sustainable growth of our group, supporting the executive side with offensive governance while also ensuring that we ful/fill our supervisory role with defensive governance. In doing so, we will consistently keep in mind the perspectives of our stakeholders, including patients and healthcare professionals.\n\nOutside Director (Independent Director)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKazuaki Kama",

Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members shall be con/firmed to have no problems according to speci/fic criteria on the judgment of independence. Directors should attend the Board of Directors and maintain an attendance rate of at least 75% or more unless there are unavoidable circumstances. The Company recognizes that ensuring the diversity of Directors particularly in terms of gender, nationality, race, etc. as well as incorporating diverse opinions into management are important for strengthening the decision-making functions and the oversight function of the Board of Directors. The Company will continue to discuss the selection of candidates for Directors with such aspects in mind.\n\n## Composition of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n50\n\n%\n\n## Policies and Procedures for Appointment/Dismissal\n\nThe Company has de/fined policies and procedures for the appointment and dismissal of Directors, the CEO, and the COO, as well as for the appointment of Audit & Supervisory Board Members. When selecting the candidates for Directors, the Board of Directors shall select the candidates after they have been suf/ficiently deliberated by the Nomination Committee, of which Outside Directors form a majority. When selecting the candidates for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members, the General Shareholders Meeting shall select them after the relevant proposal. CEO candidates are appointed in accordance with the succession plan, quali/fication requirement de/finitions, etc. that have been discussed by the Nomination Committee, and the appointment (including reappointment) of the CEO and the COO is determined by resolution of the Board of Directors following suf/ficient\n\ndeliberation and subsequent recommendation by the Nomination Committee. If any Director is found not meeting eligibility requirements or requirements for execution of the duties de/fined in the Companies Act or the Directors Regulations, following deliberation at the Nomination Committee and the Board of Directors, the General Meeting of Shareholders shall deem that it meets criteria for dismissal of Directors, and resolve dismissal of such Director after the relevant proposal. Dismissal of CEO and COO shall be called into account in light of the Companies Act, defined CEO eligibility requirements or requirements for the execution of duties, and determined in the same manner as appointment, by resolution of the Board of Directors over a recommendation from the Nomination Committee that the Committee submits after suf/ficient deliberation.\n\n## Message from the Chairperson of the Nomination Committee\n\nI believe that the role of the Nomination Committee is to thoroughly deliberate and make recommendations to the Board of Directors in order to select and dismiss the CEO, COO, and other key executives who will lead our company as an 'innovative global healthcare company,' and to establish the appropriate structure of the Board and the Audit & Supervisory Board, considering the necessary skills that the Board should possess. Last year, the Nomination Committee undertook activities essential for the succession plan, including monitoring the effectiveness of the newly established CEO and COO structure and the advancement of our global management structure, as well as conducting interviews with potential next-generation leaders. Additionally, the committee deliberated on the composition-related issues of the Board of Directors, including the number of members, the ratio of Inside and Outside Directors, and diversity, including the appointment of women. Based on these discussions, we provided recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding this year's structure.This year, our global management is expected to progress even further. I anticipate that discussions related to the 6th 5-year business plan will also become more active. With this in mind, the Nomination Committee will deepen its discussions accordingly.\n\n## Message from the Newly Appointed Outside Director\n\nDaiichi Sankyo is leveraging its strengths in Science & Technology to contribute to the realization of its purpose of 'contributing to the enrichment of quality of life around the world.' This involves the creation of innovative pharmaceuticals, the development of a total care ecosystem, and the construction of a total care platform in collaboration with other companies. Additionally, the company is striving to achieve 'Healthcare as a Service (HaaS),' which aims to provide optimal health and medical services tailored to each individual. For many years, I have been committed to contributing to the growth of numerous businesses by leveraging IT and digital technologies, as well as addressing various social issues. Our company has set forth our 2030 Vision to become an 'Innovative Global Healthcare Company Contributing to the Sustainable Development of Society' To achieve this, we are actively promoting digital transformation (DX) by creating new value through the utilization of data and effectively leveraging advanced digital technologies. To ensure that these initiatives lead to tangible results, I aim to contribute by leveraging my experience and expertise in areas such as DX and IT, global operations, and sustainability and ESG perspectives.\n\nOutside Director (Independent Director)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTakaaki Nishii\n\nOutside Director (Independent Director)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYo Honma",

Speci/fically, the Company mainly compares companies within the top 100 companies by market capitalization among the companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and also refer to the levels of major domestic pharmaceutical companies.\n\n## Composition of compensation for Directors (excluding Outside Directors)\n\nThe compensation structure consists of four components: basic, fixed compensation, annual performance-based bonuses, which is a variable compensation serving as short-term incentive, and restricted share-based compensation and medium-term performance-based share compensation serving as long-term incentive.  Retirement bene/fit system is not adopted.\n\n## (Figure 1) Ratio of the Composition of Compensations\n\nRepresentative Director, President and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOutside Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Composition of compensation for Outside Directors\n\nCompensation to Outside Directors who are in charge of management oversight and are not in the position to take charge of business execution is only basic, /fixed compensation. Incentive bonuses and retirement bene/fit system are not adopted.\n\n## Ratio of the composition of compensations\n\nThe composition ratio of the compensation for the President and CEO is designed as shown in Figure 1. The ratio of the composition of compensations of other Directors (excluding Outside Directors) will be determined in consideration of the responsibilities and the level of compensation according to the ratio of composition of compensation of Representative Director, President and CEO.\n\n## Basic compensation\n\nBasic compensation to Directors shall be paid on one regular day of each month during their tenure, and the amount of individual compensation is determined according to the compensations policy and the level of compensations.\n\n## Annual performance-based bonuses (short-term incentive)\n\nThe amount of annual performance-based bonuses, which are shortterm incentive remuneration, will be decided according to the degree of achievement of the earnings forecasts announced at the beginning of the fiscal year about revenue, core operating profit ratio * , and profit attributable to owners of the Company, and the evaluation of goals and tasks which each Director set at the beginning of the fiscal year. The formula for calculating the amount of payment and mechanism of annual performance-based bonuses are as follows.\n\n* Core operating pro/fit ratio: an indicator of ordinary pro/fitability calculated by excluding temporary income and expenses from operating pro/fit.\n\n- 1. Calculation formula for annual performance-based bonuses\n\nBonus payment amount = Standard amount by position \u00d7 Achievement of annual targets (revenue + core operating pro/fit ratio + pro/fit attributable to owners of the Company) \u00d7 Performance evaluation\n\n## 2. Performance evaluation\n\nIt will be converted into a coef/ficient and calculated according to the degree of achievement of each Director's goals and tasks set at the beginning of the /fiscal year.\n\nThe performance evaluation of the Executive Chairperson and the President will be determined after deliberation at a joint meeting of the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee.\n\nFor other Directors, the evaluation decided by CEO after deliberation at the performance meeting shall be applied. The evaluation results of Directors will be reported to the Compensation Committee.\n\n## Message from the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee\n\nI will continue to serve as the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee this year. The Compensation Committee deliberates and discusses matters related to the compensation policy and compensation system for our Company's executives and provides recommendations to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe current executive compensation system, established in FY2021, is planned to be continuously implemented until FY2025, during the current 5-year business plan period. However, as our Group expands its oncology business, the development of personnel policies related to globalization, such as the global management structure and global HR system, is rapidly progressing. Therefore, in addition to our usual deliberations, we plan to receive reports on the compensation of top executives within the global management structure, including CxOs, Unit Heads, and Heads of Global Corporate Function. We will also examine and discuss future issues and points of consideration regarding our executive compensation system by analyzing the compensation systems and trends at benchmark companies both domestically and internationally.\n\n## Restricted share-based compensation (long-term incentive)\n\nThe Company grants, every year in principle, shares with transfer restriction until the time immediately after resignation or retirement of a Director. The objective of the system is to give incentives to sustainably increase the value of the Company and to promote sharing the same value between shareholders and Directors for as long as possible by having the restricted shares. The total number of the ordinary shares of the Company to be issued or disposed of is 240 thousand shares or less per year. When restricted share-based compensation is paid, monetary compensation receivables will be paid to Directors based on a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, and Directors will pay the paid monetary compensation receivables as in-kind contribution assets of the Company's ordinary shares and will be issued them.\n\n*  If a share split of the Company's ordinary shares (including a gratis allotment of the Company's ordinary shares) or a share consolidation occurs, or if there is any other reason that requires adjustment of the total number, the Company will adjust the number in a reasonable range as necessary according to the split or consolidation ratio.\n\nOutside Director (Independent Director)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSawako Nohara",

In addition, the Compensation Committee discusses and con/firms the detailed design of indices for the achievement of each compensation, and also veri/fies the compensation levels for each position.\n\nThe amount of compensation for each individual Director of the Company is /first deliberated by the Compensation Committee, and then based on the deliberation results, each type of the compensation will be determined by a resolution of the Board within the total amount of compensation resolved at the General Shareholders Meeting.\n\nSee               for an overview of the compensation system Here\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Approach to Audit & Supervisory Board Member Compensation\n\nCompensation to Audit & Supervisory Board Members is only basic, /fixed compensation in view of the role of oversight of management and no position to take charge of business execution. The level of basic compensations is set aiming to provide high level compensations in the industrial sector, referring to the levels of other companies learned from the surveys of external specialist institutions. Speci/fically, a group of companies is selected for comparison from the top 100 listed companies on the Tokyo Stock\n\nExchange with the largest market capitalization. The Company also refers to the levels of other leading domestic pharmaceutical companies. The amount of the compensation for each Audit & Supervisory Board Member has been determined through the discussion and with the unanimous consent in the Audit & Supervisory Board meetings within the total amount of the compensation approved by the General Shareholders Meeting.\n\nAbout Daiichi Sankyo\n\n## Enhancing the Effectiveness and Functions of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Company utilizes the board evaluation in order for the Board of Directors and Directors themselves to assess their current status and identify issues to be addressed, continuously making efforts to improve the functions and effectiveness of its Board of Directors. The Company has conducted board evaluation of the Board of Directors every /fiscal year and addressed the issues identi/fied for improvement through the board evaluation. In the subsequent board evaluation, the Company assesses the latest status and con/firms the status of improvement from the previous /fiscal year.\n\n## Implementation Method of the Board of Directors Evaluation for FY2023\n\nThe Company determines the board evaluation items including the items to be evaluated by the Directors themselves in addition to the evaluation of the Board of Directors as a whole as the contents and items for evaluation relating to the effectiveness of the Board as a whole with reference to the principle and supplementary principle associated with the general principle 4, 'Roles and Responsibilities of the Board' of Japan's Corporate Governance Code.

The latest round of self-evaluation generated quite a few candid opinions by selecting grades and using a free-description format. Based on these results, the Company has identi/fied the issues and matters which leads to improvements in the Board of Director's functions and effectiveness.\n\n## Results of the Board Evaluation for FY2023\n\nThe result of the Board of Directors Evaluation for FY2023, concluded that in terms of its roles, responsibilities, operation and composition, the Board of Directors of the Company, as well as the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee, which are advisory bodies to the Board of Directors, are functioning appropriately, and that the effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a whole has been ensured.

for FY2023\n\nAudit & Supervisory Board evaluation for FY2023 is conducted to heighten its effectiveness of the Audit & Supervisory Board.\n\n## Method of the Audit & Supervisory Board evaluation\n\nAudit & Supervisory Board determined a wide range of evaluation items associated with Audit & Supervisory Board effectiveness. Each Audit & Supervisory Board Member conducted a self-evaluation of the Audit & Supervisory Board, then discussed those matters.\n\n## Evaluation results of the Audit and Supervisory Board\n\nThe results con/firmed that Audit & Supervisory Board largely carries out its activities appropriately and that its effectiveness has been ensured. In the next /fiscal year, Audit & Supervisory Board will pay particular attention to the status of further strengthening corporate functions in the midst of global business expansion, as well as monitoring the progress of building a data-driven management platform.\n\n## Message from Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members\n\n## Questions\n\n- Please tell us about the role you have played based on your experience and expertise, and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for enhancing the corporate value of our group. 1\n- What are the types of governance that is appropriate for our company and your initiatives to improve transparency and fairness? 2\n\nOutside Audit & Supervisory Board Member (Independent Auditor)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYukiko Imazu\n\nOutside Audit & Supervisory Board Member (Independent Auditor)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Masako Watanabe\n\nOutside Audit & Supervisory Board Member (Independent Auditor)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mitsuhiro Matsumoto\n\n1 It is of utmost importance that our company complies with laws and regulations and maintains a constant awareness of legal risks to maintain a sound corporate governance system that lives up to society's trust in the Company. Based on my many experiences as an attorney-at-law, I have contributed to the sound and legal corporate management of Daiichi Sankyo by expressing my opinions objectively as an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member with a legal mindset, thereby avoiding unnecessary legal risks.\n\n1 Based on my extensive experience and knowledge as a certi/fied public accountant, having conducted audits of numerous companies' /financial statements, I have actively provided insights and veri/fied the appropriateness of /financial reporting, the nature of information disclosure-including non-financial information-and the effectiveness of internal control systems from an external perspective. Through these efforts, I have contributed to enhancing governance functions. Additionally, I have facilitated effective communication with internal audits (Global Internal Audit) and the accounting auditors, contributing to the enhancement of audit effectiveness and ef/ficiency.\n\n1 Where cyberattacks and economic security issues are among the factors that could impede the smooth development of our global structure. Drawing on my experience in addressing these challenges, I tried my best to provide the necessary checks as an Audit & Supervisory Board Member. With globalisation and the alliance with Merck & Co., Inc., our stakeholder base, is expanding further; we need to gain and retain their trust. We must further consolidate our governance to this end.\n\n2 To gain investor confidence, risks must be operated fairly. Organisational practices and behaviors perceived as opaque or unfair by global standards create reputational risks. Constant efforts must also be made to eliminate external diseconomies. In order for R&D, manufacturing, quality assurance, sales and marketing and other business sites to contribute to society and continue to earn the trust of the market, it is necessary to create a fair governance system makes risk factors transparent, eliminates them and prepares for unforeseen risks.\n\n2 To improve the transparency and fairness of corporate management, it is necessary not only to further strengthen internal autonomy and self-regulatory functions but also to be always mindful of external perspectives. In addition to having an Outside Director serving as Chairperson of the Board since 2020, Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members participate very actively in discussions of the Company, resulting in a highly transparent and fair corporate governance system that fully re/flects the opinions of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. I will continue to make every effort to further improve the transparency and fairness of our corporate management, fully aware of the importance of the role expected from an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member.\n\n2 As our stakeholders continue to expand, the importance of transparency and fairness in corporate management has increased. To enhance these aspects, it is essential to have a governance system that allows external directors to accurately understand the actual state of the company's management and effectively re/flect their opinions. At our company, we continuously implement initiatives such as pre-meeting brie/fings, opinion exchange sessions, and site visits to deepen the understanding of external directors about our business.

We believe that this long-term focused management will lead to sustainable growth of both our company and society.\n\nIn our current 5-year business plan, we have identi/fied material issues that must be addressed to achieve sustainable growth as 'materiality' and been promoting initiatives that lead to sustainable development of society and business opportunities, such as the creation of innovative pharmaceuticals and improvement of access to healthcare. In addition to the promotion of environmental management and compliance management, we are also working to promote the success and development of a diverse range of people who create our competitive advantages, which is the source of our strengths.\n\nWe believe that the pipeline of innovative pharmaceuticals and the value we contribute to our shareholders & investors, employees, and other stakeholders, as well as society and the natural environment, which are created through these efforts, will lead to non-/financial value, and we will further promote ESG management in order to enhance mid-to-long-term corporate value.\n\nDirector Senior Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHead of Global Corporate Strategy CStO\n\n## Takashi Fukuoka\n\n| Sustainability Activities   |   71 |\n|-----------------------------|------|\n| Materiality                 |   73 |\n\nE\n\nS\n\nG\n\n| Environment                          |   75 |\n|--------------------------------------|------|\n| \u25cf  Climate Change                    |   76 |\n| \u25cf  Pollution                         |   79 |\n| \u25cf  Water, Biodiversity               |   81 |\n| \u25cf  Resource Use and Circular Economy |   83 |\n\n| Social                       |   85 |\n|------------------------------|------|\n| \u25cf  Our Group Employees       |   86 |\n| \u25cf  Human Rights              |   90 |\n| \u25cf  Access to Healthcare      |   91 |\n| \u25cf  Safety of Pharmaceuticals |   95 |\n\n| Governance                                       |   97 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|\n| \u25cf  Compliance                                    |   98 |\n| \u25cf  Protection of Whistle-blowers, Animal Welfare |  101 |\n| \u25cf  Relationship with Business Partners           |  102 |\n| \u25cf Prevention of Bribery and Corruption           |  104 |\n\n| External ESG Evaluations                    |   105 |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Independent Assurance Report                |   107 |\n| Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards |   108 |\n| ESG Data                                    |   109 |",

We then sorted these issues into two groups: Materiality on business and Materiality on business foundations. Upon formulating our current 5-year business plan, in addition to long-term targets and challenges for each Materiality, we set Materiality key performance indicators (KPIs) as initiative indicators.\n\n## Materiality Identi/fication and KPIs Setting Process\n\nIn identifying and sorting material issues, 36 issues were selected from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective in FY2015. In March 2020, we identified eight material issues based on several reviews and active discussions at Executive Management Committee and Board of Directors, and dialogue with our stakeholders. Subsequently, we announced KPIs, indicators of initiatives for each Materiality in April 2021. Our Materiality identi/fication and KPI setting process is shown in the /figure below.\n\n## Materiality identi/fication and KPI setting process (FY2015 to FY2021)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvery /fiscal year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality Management\n\nWe promote Materiality management under a system in which the Corporate Planning Department and Sustainability Department serve as the administrative of/fice. In addition, regarding matters related to EHS management and compliance management, our cross-organizational committees (EHS Management Committee, Corporate Ethics Committee) decide on our action policies and strive to promote them throughout our company while also reporting important issues to the Executive Management Committee and Board of Directors.\n\nIn order to promptly re/flect any change in the impact on the business of the Group due to changes in the expectations and requests from society as well as our external environment to our Materiality and to work toward further evolution, we set targets and conduct reviews of each relevant material\n\nissue, manage the progress, and promote regular discussions by the Executive Management Committee and Board of Directors in the annual management cycle. During our FY2023 discussions, the progress and evolution of the Materiality was reported and discussed twice at the Board of Directors and the Executive Management Committee, and it was decided to continue the current Materiality and KPIs in FY2024.\n\nThrough the implementation of ESG brie/fings and daily interview, we engage in constructive dialogue with our stakeholders both within and outside the Company, including investors, to gain an understanding of the expectations and needs of society and to apply the knowledge to sustainability promotion.\n\n## Materiality Management System\n\n*A team that promotes human rights due diligence as a cross-functional organization within the Company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EHS Management Committee\n\n## Corporate Ethics Committee\n\nStriving to protect the environment and ensure health and safety while achieving the uniform management and promotion of environment, health, and safety management for which there is a high likelihood of risks occurring\n\nPromoting management that complies with domestic and international laws and corporate ethics as well as corporate ethics and ful/fills our CSR, ensuring that executives and employees put compliance into practice",

Under the Daiichi Sankyo Group Corporate Conduct Charter and the Daiichi Sankyo Group EHS* 5 Policy, we are promoting environmental management and practicing responsible corporate activities to mitigate climate change and other environmental challenges. We expressed our support for the recommendations of the TCFD* 6 in May 2019, and disclosed information such as governance and results of scenario analysis in accordance with the TCFD disclosure framework in 2020. In addition, we will disclose information in accordance with the TCFD recommendations revised in October 2021, and aim to further strengthen our climate change-related governance and business strategies to proactively respond to climate change, which is a\n\n## global issue.\n\nWe have established the EHS Management Committee in an effort to protect the environment and ensure the health and safety of employees while achieving uniform management. The committee is chaired by the Chief Executive Of/ficer of EHS Management, and consists of relevant division heads and presidents of the group companies. The EHS Management Committee discusses and reports on policies, target setting, and activities related to global EHS management twice a year, and matters to be discussed and reported are submitted to the Board of Directors, which supervises the committee activities. In FY2023, the committee discussed the promotion of business partner engagement for Scope 3 reduction and the development of a net-zero transition plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society\n\nCO2 emissions (Scope1+Scope2) for FY2023 were 109,239 t-CO2, a 49.8% reduction compared to FY2015. Not limited to our efforts to 'mitigate' CO2 emissions and other environmentally hazardous actions, we facilitate initiatives to 'adapt' to impacts that have become tangible or in/fluence that is inevitable in the mid- to long-term. By scope, FY2023 performance for the entire Group was 85,245 t-CO2 for Scope 1 and 23,994 t-CO2 for Scope 2, which were 0.9% lower and 1.1% higher than in FY2022, respectively.\n\nScope 3 CO2 emissions were 4,430,241t, showing an increase from FY2022. The increase is largely due to an increase in purchased goods and services (Cat.1).\n\nTo reduce Scope 3 (Cat. 1) emissions, we have set a KPI in our current mid-term business plan for more than 70% of suppliers to have a 1.5\u00b0C targets, and are currently strengthening engagement.\n\n## FY2025 and FY2030 Target(Scope1+2) toward Carbon Neutrality\n\n(t-CO2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information disclosure based on the recommendations of the TCFD\n\n## Utilization of Renewable Energy\n\nAt the Daiichi Sankyo Europe Pfaffenhofen Plant in Germany, which has been converting all purchased electricity to electricity generated from renewable energy since 2014, a self-consumption solar power system (annual energy production of 580 MWh) constructed on the plant's premises began operation in February 2022, and its amount of electricity generated is increasing every year. Moreover, in FY2023, we began converting to renewable fuels by using biomass wood pellets for steam production. In addition, in January 2023, the Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceutical (Shanghai) Shanghai Plant began using a solar power plant (with annual energy production of approx. 540 MWh), which is able to cover the annual energy consumption of the plant's administrative building. This is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 300 t-CO2 per year.\n\nMoreover, at the Daiichi Sankyo Chemical Pharma Onahama Plant, which started operation of the solar power system with annual energy production of approx. 4,000 MWh in December 2020, /finished construction of the Daiichi Sankyo Group's /first Nearly ZEB-certi/fied building, its new of/fice, in March 2023. This of/fice generates electricity using solar power and saves energy by effectively combining high-ef/ficiency air conditioning, water heating, and lighting equipment, thereby cutting standard building energy consumption by 78% (51.9% from energy savings and 26.9% from energy generation).\n\nThe Group is a member of RE100 and aims to achieve a 100% utilization rate of electricity derived from renewable energy sources by FY2030 and a materiality KPI of at least 60% by FY2025. The renewable electricity utilization rate in FY2023 is 80.0%, well on track to achieve RE100. We will continue to actively introduce various renewable energy sources, including solar power generation.\n\nDaiichi Sankyo Chemical Pharma Onahama Plant New management building\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDaiichi Sankyo Pharmaceutical (Shanghai) Shanghai Plant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Listed on CDP's Climate Change A List 2023\n\nIn February 2024, the Group has been recognized for leadership in corporate transparency and performance on climate change by global environmental non-pro/fit CDP* 7 , securing a place on its prestigious 'A List' for the fourth consecutive year. With the growing social demand for carbon neutrality, the Group revised the target to a more ambitious one with the 1.5\u00b0C target of the Paris Agreement in June 2022. Our GHG emission reduction targets and supplier engagement target have been approved as 1.5\u00b0C targets by SBTi in July 2023. Furthermore, we have submitted a commitment letter to the SBTi declaring its goals for reducing GHG emissions, including net-zero standard. To achieve net-zero GHG emissions by FY2050, we aim to obtain net-zero certi/fication for our 'Transition Plan for Climate Change' and targets.\n\n* 7 Global non-pro/fit that runs the world's environmental disclosure system for companies, cities, states and regions\n\n<!-- image -->",

The of/fices that have already taken measures, such as puri/fication, continue to monitor and report the result of analysis to governmental of/fices and community members.\n\n## Progress of Measures for Soil Puri/fication\n\n| Of/fice                                               | Overview                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The site of former Yasugawa plant  (Yasu City, Shiga) | We have been continuously monitoring the groundwater since we completed on-site environmental improvement work in 2006.

These evaluations indicate that operating sites with the highest water risks among our Group are one plant in China and one in Brazil. Water withdrawal restrictions and other strengthened regulations are considered to be major risk factors. In those plants, we are paying attention to regulatory trends and optimizing water usage.\n\n## Water use by plants located in high water risk areas (FY2023)\n\n| Site                      | River basin   |   Water withdrawals(kilo m 3 ) |   Water discharges(kilo m 3 ) |   Water consumption(kilo m 3 ) |\n|---------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Shanghai Plant (China)    | Yangtze River |                           41.4 |                          33.8 |                            7.6 |\n| Alphaville Plant (Brazil) | Parana        |                           10.1 |                           5.5 |                            4.6 |\n|                           | Total         |                           51.5 |                          39.3 |                           12.2 |\n\n## Initiatives for Biodiversity\n\nEHS Basic Policy and EHS Management Policy (FY2021-FY2025) stipulate that business activities must consider biodiversity and ecosystem services. The Group has established the Basic Biodiversity Principles and Action Guidelines based on these policies. When these were established, the Group surveyed its initiatives on biodiversity, the use of natural resources, and status of efforts to comply with the Cartagena Protocol both inside and outside of Japan. Additionally, the Group assessed the relationship between its business activities and\n\n## biodiversity.\n\nThe Group believes that biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of ecosystem services are essential in performing business. We promote raising awareness and understanding of employees, as well as the strengthening of environmental conservation activities in collaboration with business partners and private groups, to procure materials with less environmental burden, and to socially contribute towards biodiversity conservation.\n\n## Map of Corporate Activities and Biodiversity *\u00b9\n\n*1 Prepared with reference to the 'Map of Corporate Activities and Biodiversity' developed by the Japan Business Initiative for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity (JBIB) *2 Access to genetic resources and bene/fit sharing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nV\n\n## Biodiversity Conservation Activities\n\nOur group is promoting activities to contribute to the conservation of local biodiversity at each site.

The assessed EF is used as a comprehensive indicator of environmental burdens, including those related to biodiversity, by reviewing and monitoring long-term changes in the relationship between the reduction of environmental burdens and biodiversity conservation (trade-off) in the Group.\n\nThis initiative has been recognized as an action for achieving the Aichi Target (20 targets) that was adopted at COP10 (the 10th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya) and has been registered on the Nijyu-Maru Project as well.\n\n## TNFD Disclosure\n\nThe Group believes that biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of ecosystem services are essential in performing business. We promote biodiversity initiatives to achieve the 2030 Nature Positive* 1 .\n\nIn May 2024, we registered as a 'TNFD* 2 Adopter'* 3 , which indicates our support for the TNFD recommendations and our commitment to TNFD disclosure. Currently, we are conducting a brief evaluation of nature-related risks in our supply chain for our main products, and identifying key issues and conducting a locality Analysis.

In addition to understanding the risks and challenges associated with water consumption and the status of water resources in countries and regions where our operation sites are located, we also implement measures including consuming water reasonably and ef/ficiently, promoting reuse with puri/fication equipment, and reducing the amount of water used.\n\nThe water consumed per unit of net sales in FY2023 was 5.1 Thousand m 3 /billion yen (down 40.7% from FY2020); while the total volume of water used by the entire Group was 8,191 thousand m 3 (down 2.4% from FY2020).\n\nFurthermore, water intake by the Group did not have signi/ficant impact on water sources.\n\n## Waste Reduction Targets and Performance\n\nThe Group de/fines zero emissions for waste as the /final disposal rate representing less than 1% of the total amount of waste.\n\nAt our plants and research centers, the Group has established waste reduction and resource ef/ficiency as important issues. Consequently, we seek to save resources through efforts such as the streamlining of resources used in manufacturing and packaging processes, the comprehensive separation of unnecessary and waste materials, the reduction of the total volume of unnecessary and waste material, and resource recycling. Whenever possible, the Group chooses waste disposal /firms that recycle thoroughly.\n\nAt each of/fice, we promote the thorough separation of trash, double-sided printing of of/fice paper, paperless operations and other measures.\n\n## After use PTP Sheet Recycling Program\n\nDaiichi Sankyo Healthcare has started Japan's /first demonstration experiment of the 'After use PTP Sheet Recycling Program' in the city of Yokohama in October 2022.\n\nAs of the end of September 2024, the collection sites were set up at 102 locations in pharmacies, drugstores, hospitals, and public facilities and a cumulative total of approximately 5 tons of used PTP sheets have been collected. The collected PTPs are recycled into new products. Collection boxes are also available at the Daiichi Sankyo Kusuri Museum on the /first /floor of the headquarter building in Japan.\n\n## Closed-loop Recycling Efforts\n\nOur special subsidiary, Daiichi Sankyo Happiness's Hiratsuka site, conducts closed-loop recycling* 1 as a contribution to a recycling-oriented society through employing disabled people. Collected documents and other materials are sorted into reusable paper only and recycled into toilet paper by a partner company, which is then used at the site where the documents and other materials are collected. We contribute to solving social issues by horizontally spreading the program to other sites and introducing it as a good practice in our environmental e-learning program for all employees.\n\n*1  Reusing or recycling materials recovered from their own used products into their own product.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nV\n\n'Okusuri Sheet Kururin BOX' at the Daiichi Sankyo Kusuri Museum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water consumed (Withdrawal) and Wastewater Discharged Global (Plants and research falicilites)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outsourced waste treatment, Recycled Waste, and Final disposal amount Global (Plants and research falicilites)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recent examples of our efforts include the participation of employees with nationality outside of Japan in various recruitment events and the use of recruiting agents who specialize in recruiting global talents. To further enhance our strengths, namely our position as a global organization and our talents, we need external talents who\n\nunderstand diverse environments and cultures, respect different values, and are able to grow together.\n\nIn addition to the above, we are promoting a project called 'Global Talent Acquisition.' Employees responsible for recruiting at Daiichi Sankyo's global of/fices in Japan, the U.S., the EU, Asia and Oceania, South and Central America, etc., continue to cooperate to share information and collaborate to proactively hire global talents.\n\n## Human Resource Development and Career Support\n\nWe provide various training and self-learning platforms as learning opportunities for employees to achieve our 2030 Vision. We also offer training and seminars to support career path development, and have established a career support help desk. In terms of global human resource development, we promote global talent management and leadership development in cooperation with Group Companies outside of Japan, and we have a system\n\nin place to nurture the next generation of leaders.

The Group works to address access to\n\nhealthcare across its entire value chain, which spans everything from drug discovery and research, clinical development, supply chain, and value delivery, and prioritizes the following three areas: Research & Development, Availability, and Capacity Building. Our Group established a 'Head of Access to Healthcare' to promote efforts to resolve these issues related to access to healthcare and improves access to healthcare through collaboration with partners as well as related organizations within the Group.\n\nThrough addressing these issues, our Group contributes to the accomplishment of the Sustainable Development Goals set forth by the United Nations, particularly 'Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*1 Antimicrobial Resistance *2 Neglected Tropical Diseases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResearch & Development\n\nAvailability\n\nCapacity Building\n\nV\n\n## Research & Development\n\n## Partnership with the GHIT Fund\n\nWe are promoting partnership-based drug discovery to make the best use of its accumulated scienti/fic /findings and global network. Partnerships bring synergies to initiatives that cannot be completed by the Group alone. This initiative contributes to Goal 17: 'Partnerships for the Goals' of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations member states.\n\nThe Group has funded the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (hereinafter referred to as the 'GHIT Fund') since its establishment in April 2013. To promote the development of drugs for combating infectious diseases in developing countries, the GHIT Fund was established as a public-private part-\n\nnership originating in Japan and was supported by the government of Japan, /five Japanese pharmaceutical companies, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nWe are utilizing the partnership through the GHIT Fund structure to undertake a number of projects, including one to explore clinical candidate compounds for the treatment of Chagas disease, which is considered to be a neglected tropical disease (NTD), and another to explore candidate anti-tuberculosis drugs from natural products.\n\n## Efforts to address Antimicrobial Resistance (Participation in AMR Action Fund)\n\nThe threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is now a major global public health issue. Unless appropriate measures are taken now, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria may cause approximately 10 million deaths per year by 2050. Thus, in July 2020, the AMR Action Fund was established to support the clinical development of novel antimicrobials and to create a sustainable antimicrobial market. The Fund aims to commercialize two to four new antibiotics by 2030 by providing a total of USD 1 billion in investments and technical assistance to several small biotech companies, and as of the end of May 2023 investments in /five companies, Adaptive Phage Therapeutics, Venatorx Pharmaceuticals, BioVersys AG, Vedanta Biosciences, and Pattern\n\nBioscience, have been announced. We have contributed a total of USD 20 million to the Fund to promote the development of innovative antimicrobials and contribute to the rapid resolution of AMR issues around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This integration facilitates the centralized management of information, enabling a /flexible and ef/ficient manufacturing and supply system (supply chain management).\n\nThe Group has also established a stable supply system for the global market by seamlessly linking its production bases inside and outside of Japan. Consistently supplying highly reliable products that reproduce the quality of the pharmaceutical as designed requires a production management system relying on technical veri/fication of both facility and human operations. Through its quality and safety management system, the Group has established its own high standards with world-class validation processes and has developed a highly reliable global supply system.\n\n## Measures for Combating Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals\n\nIn response to the growing threat of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, we are reconsidering the sealing materials and changing the specifications of individual packaging for our products, as well as investigating and introducing anti-counterfeit technologies. We have achieved application of GS1 codes to our pharmaceutical products and medical narcotic products which was the requirement to incorporate expiration dates and serial numbers on each package for traceability purpose. We will continue to ful/fill our roles as a mar-\n\nketing authorization holder and conduct product risk mitigation measures by collaborating with the pharmaceutical industry and related organizations.\n\nWe also actively comply with GDP* 1 to ensure the quality and integrity of our products during storage and transportation.

The Global Hotline is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for compliance reporting and consultation. It is available in the languages of all countries and regions where the Group companies are located. The Group also accepts reports and consultations from people outside the Group on the Company and Group websites. In Japan, we have established and operated internal hotlines for whistleblowing via dedicated telephone lines and e-mail addresses, as well as a harassment reporting and\n\nconsultation service. In addition, the Group maintains a procedure requiring a direct report to the Chief Compliance Of/ficer of the Group when a compliance officer of any Group company worldwide suspects significant misconduct involving speci/fic Senior Executives (Senior Executive Misconduct Reporting Procedure: SEMRP). In accordance with the revision of the Whistleblower Protection Act in Japan, which took effect on June 1, 2022, the Company and the Group companies in Japan are revising their rules for handling whistleblowing and related matters in a timely manner.\n\n## Compliance Data for FY2023 (Global consolidated)\n\nNumber of allegations received (excluding through our compliance monitoring processes): 315\n\n- \u00b7  Measures: On the basis of the reports that we received, we conducted appropriate investigations for cases determined to require investigation.

We are monitoring approximately 6,400 companies at this point. For business partners identi/fied as high risk before and during the transaction, the Group decides on the advisability of the trans-\n\naction, considering the impact on the business and social credibility of the Group. In Japan, Daiichi Sankyo established the Business Partner Management Guideline (Japanese version), which summarizes the Business Partner Management process, in September 2021.

The survey is also aligned with the principles of the PSCI *1 , a non-pro/fit organization composed of global pharmaceutical companies.\n\n## Measures to Ensure Stable Procurement\n\nIn recent years, many companies are facing unprecedented natural disasters, infectious diseases, and geopolitical risks. Maintaining and stabilizing the supply chain, not limited to Tier 1 suppliers, but including Tier 2 or 3, which are upstream suppliers, is a challenge. In Japan, we conducted a retrospective assessment of suppliers covering approximately 1,200 raw materials for our /five main plants in Hiratsuka, Odawara, Onahama, Tatebayashi and Kitamoto to understand geographical risks. Of these, we asked Non-Tier 1 suppliers of\n\n## Declaration of Partnership Building\n\nThe Group endorses the purpose of the 'Conference for the Promotion of Building Partnerships for the Future,' which is being promoted by the Cabinet Of/fice, the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, and other public and private organizations, and joined the 'Declaration of Partnership' as of January 30,\n\nDuring the cycle covering the period of FY2020-FY2022, the survey was sent to 403 business partners of Daiichi Sankyo in Japan and overseas, and as of the end of March 2023, 399 companies (99%) have responded.

This document serves as the Group's common global policy with the aim of maintaining a high standard of ethics when interacting with healthcare professionals, medical institutions, and patient organizations, as well as when promoting pharmaceutical products.\n\nIn this global policy, we clearly state that relationships between each Group company and healthcare professionals must be maintained for the purpose of improving the quality of healthcare, with a focus on providing information on pharmaceutical products to healthcare professionals, providing scienti/fic and educational information, and supporting medical research and education. In line with the revision of the IFPMA Code in January 2019, we revised the policy, prohibiting the provision of gifts and promotional aids to healthcare professionals, etc. We also prohibit the provision of entertainment, cash, and other personal gifts and stipulate stricter terms and conditions of contract in cases where we pay remuneration to healthcare professionals, as well as consider the appropriateness of the remuneration. In this way, we promote appropriate marketing practices in accordance with the IFPMA Code.\n\n## Compliance with Global Policies Related to Preventing Bribery and Corruption\n\nLaws and regulations against bribery and other forms of corruption in countries around the world continue to be strengthened each year. Thus, it is becoming increasingly important for global companies to implement initiatives for detecting and preventing bribery and other forms of corruption.\n\nThe Group has specified the prevention of bribery and corruption in the ECC. In order to further ensure compliance particularly in this regard, we have also established the Daiichi Sankyo Group Anti-Bribery & Anti-Corruption Policy, which sets forth more detailed rules on the prevention of bribery and\n\ncorruption, including the prohibition of cash payments to government of/ficials and healthcare professionals.\n\nThe Group also continues to conduct training for anti-bribery and anti-corruption to further bolster our anti-bribery and anti-corruption structure. In addition, we have implemented at each Group Company a due diligence monitoring process for bribery and corruption risks of our third-party suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDaiichi Sankyo Group Anti-Bribery & Anti-Corruption Policy",

The limited assurance engagement consisted of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other procedures, and the procedures performed vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance provided is thus not as high as that provided by a reasonable assurance engagement.
