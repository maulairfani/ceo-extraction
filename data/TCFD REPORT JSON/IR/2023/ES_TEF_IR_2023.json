Technology must be used \"to make the world more human by connecting lives.\" This is exactly Telef\u00f3nica's mission.\n\nIn 2024, we are celebrating our centenary as a powerful driver of value to society and our shareholders. Although, we are facing complex and uncertain times, tremendous opportunities related to connectivity and digitalisation await. Telef\u00f3nica is ready.\n\nOur centenary serves to remind us of our unique legacy and vocation of service and commitment, a vocation that drives us to strengthen our business from both a financial and non-financial point of view. This is because for Telef\u00f3nica, sustainability means thinking about society and the planet and orienting the business to be part of the solution to the challenges facing humanity.

Thanks to our business activity, in 2023 we generated over \u20ac49 billion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in our major markets and more than 10 jobs are created for every employee in the Company. Over recent years, we have consistently demonstrated an annual socioeconomic contribution, aligned with the SDGs of around \u20ac100 billion.\n\nReflecting on what we have achieved during the past year gives us cause for optimism. In addition to announcing a new strategic plan, GPS (Growth, Profit and Sustainability), we met our economic targets and made progress on ESG aspects in order to build a greener future, help society thrive and lead by example with the aim of:\n\n- \u00b7 Accelerating the green transition: our Climate Action Plan is our roadmap for reaching net zero emissions by 2040, becoming more circular and helping our customers decarbonise thanks to our connectivity and Eco Smart digital solutions. Since 2015 we have reduced our energy consumption by 89% per unit of traffic and now all of our electricity consumption in Europe, Brazil, Chile and Peru comes from renewable sources. This has enabled us to reduce Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions by 51% over the last eight years.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring progress and opportunities for all: as well as connecting more people and businesses every day, we promote accessibility, and digital skills help us to improve the employability of both our employees and the most vulnerable members of society. Only trained, diverse and motivated talent can make the most of digitalisation. We focus on our customers and provide them with solutions that allow them to continue to grow by leveraging the possibilities offered by the digital era. This has been so successful that our NPS (Net Promoter Score) has increased by over 10 points since 2017.\n- \u00b7 Building trust through an ethical and exemplary approach: we strive to maintain high standards of governance, security, privacy and transparency. Our Board is more diverse with 40% female Directors and a large majority of independents. Last year, we published the first report on our environmental and Human Rights Due Diligence process in line with future requirements and we are ready to align ourselves with new regulations such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this new era, Telef\u00f3nica is uniquely positioned to bring together the best that technology and people have to offer. In this spirit we have raised our ambitions by updating several ESG targets . We will reduce operational emissions (Scope 1+2) by 90% globally by 2030 (-81% since 2015), we will have 37% of our executive positions filled by women by 2027 (32.8% in 2023) and around 40% of our financing activity will meet sustainable criteria by 2026 (33.6% at the end of 2023).\n\n## In 2023 we generated over \u20ac49 billion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in our major markets.\n\nThese goals join the other important targets we had already outlined as part of our roadmap, namely to reduce Scope 3 emissions and, to ensure that more people have access to broadband telecommunications networks in all regions, urban and rural and to foster sustainability among our key suppliers.\n\nLooking forward, our GPS plan, backed by our principles of integrity, commitment and transparency, will allow us to continue to deliver value. Here's to the next 100 years.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete Chairman of Telef\u00f3nica\n\n<!-- image -->",

An uncertain macroeconomic and political environment compounded by conflict hotspots and sustainability challenges\n\nIn 2023 the global economy returned to levels closer to those resembling normality following the resumption of economic activity in China. Despite the resilience of the major economies (especially the US) and the avoidance of the initial threat of a recession, global growth remained low, especially in Europe, and looks set to remain so throughout 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 High levels of inflation show signs of stabilising and are expected to ease in the coming year, albeit remaining above the reference levels projected by the main central banks. Contained energy costs are helping to reduce inflationary pressure, although tensions surrounding raw materials and labour costs are growing. Price rises continue to have an impact on business expectations and disposable income.\n- \u00b7 The fight against inflation has marked a year of sharp increases in benchmark interest rates by central banks. The paradigm of the previous decade, with nearzero or negative rates aimed at stimulating the economy after the financial crisis, seems to have completely changed. Expectations over the medium term are that rates will remain at current levels until inflation is fully under control, despite the risks of an economic slowdown.\n- \u00b7 Similarly, the expansionary fiscal policies of the last decade are beginning to be adjusted in an attempt to balance public accounts. Public spending restraint measures are expected across the major economies.\n- \u00b7 The combination of inflation, higher interest rates and (potentially) lower public spending threatens the consumption and savings capacities of the most vulnerable households and individuals, who suffer most from the impacts of the new crisis.\n- \u00b7 The major geopolitical conflicts that affected global security in 2023 have continued to worsen, with no clear prospects for stability in the medium to long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe war in Ukraine continues to unfold without significant progress or a peace plan. Geopolitical tensions have increased following the outbreak of a new military conflict in the Gaza Strip, which threatens progress and current stability in the Middle East. Both conflicts have worsened the threat of a potential energy crisis due to their impact on major oil and gas producers.\n\n- \u00b7 Global tensions have spilled over into national or regional political environments in the form of increasing polarisation . A declining number of the world's population live in demonstrably democratic states. All over the world, the results of the latest elections reveal significant changes in the direction of governments, bringing with them a deterioration in the conditions of legal certainty necessary for long-term business investments.\n\n## 1.1.2. A telecommunications sector that is increasingly strategic and undergoing continuous transformation despite strong competition\n\nTelecommunications services are strategic to economic and societal development. The use of connectivity services (and the traffic supported by the networks deployed by operators) by both our residential and corporate customers continues to grow exponentially.\n\nIndividual consumers and households spend a greater proportion of their lives interacting digitally and consuming technology as more and more services become digitalised.\n\nSimilarly, businesses and public administrations continue to accelerate their digitalisation in order to be competitive in a globalised market. Reliable and quality connectivity services are essential for them.\n\nThe telecommunications market in Europe is strategic and highly competitive . Monopolies no longer exist, and today consumers can find a wide range of quality and affordable alternatives on the main markets. Some are",

Connectivity is now provided over fibre and 5G, guaranteeing customers the best connectivity for advanced services. New networks are able to deliver different kinds of connectivity according to service type, based on new technologies such as edge computing. They are also able to open up to third parties via standardised APIs in order to generate new business models in collaboration with external developers (e.g. the GSMA Open Gateway/CAMARA initiative).\n\nSeveral leading companies in the sector (including Telef\u00f3nica) have reported progress in building new networks following recent peaks in investment. Technology and new network architectures (open, based on market standards and incorporating AI), progress towards the softwarisation of operations and the shutdown of legacy technologies will all be crucial to making operators more cost-efficient and sustainable in the future.\n\nIn addition, the long-term sustainability of the sector requires operators to make progress towards collaborating on industry initiatives (GSMA and others). These initiatives may cover various issues, such as the standardisation of networks, systems and devices. Alongside these initiatives, operators are collaborating more closely on the joint deployment of infrastructure (network sharing, fibrecos, etc.) in order to gain efficiency.\n\n## Regulatory challenges\n\nRegarding regulation, the industry continues to propose solutions to structural problems that put national and European connectivity targets at risk. For example, the sector has expressed its position in forums and before the relevant authorities vis-\u00e0-vis the contribution to investment by internet companies and the updating of operators' regulatory obligations. With regard to the national consolidation processes pending approval, the leading companies in the sector (including Telef\u00f3nica) have been generally in favour of approving these transactions without imposing any burdensome conditions.\n\nThe urgent need to make progress towards the sustainability goals set out in the United Nations 2030 Agenda continues to grow. Against this backdrop, governments and other regulators continue to place increased pressure on companies:\n\n- \u00b7 The new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) establishes more stringent requirements for sustainability reporting in the European Union from 2024. Meanwhile, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) have been integrated with the CSRD.\n- \u00b7 The EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) is currently being negotiated at European level. This draft focuses on corporate governance, strategy and management to integrate a continuous process to identify, prevent, mitigate and respond to actual/potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts linked to business activity. A similar law is already in force in Germany through the Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz), which entered into force on 1 January 2023.\n- \u00b7 The European Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852) laid the foundations for a regulatory framework on a classification system that sets out the requirements for an economic activity to be classified as sustainable in the EU. This framework forms part of the EU's Sustainable Growth Financing Action Plan and Green Deal with the aim of promoting the investments needed to achieve a circular, competitive and climate-neutral economy by 2050. It involves the reporting of financial KPIs (revenue, CapEx and OpEx) of sustainable activities.\n\nThe telecommunications industry advocates the need for taxonomies to recognise the role of connectivity and digitisation for the green transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This draft standard will affect companies with instruments listed on US markets and will require detailed information on carbon footprints, emissions and climate-change-related risks, opportunities and impacts.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nIn terms of the technological revolution, artificial intelligence (AI ) was a big focus of 2023. Despite its positive and transformative qualities, AI can have negative repercussions (impacts on employment, concentration of wealth, misinformation, deep fakes, etc.). It is therefore necessary to ensure it is used ethically, transparently and in an accountable way. Various groups, including governments and businesses, have called for regulatory frameworks and guidelines on best practices to protect the rights and well-being of society.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is firmly committed to the ethical development of AI and has launched several initiatives, built around three pillars, to improve how the technology is governed:\n\n- \u00b7 Collaborate with international bodies (e.g. UNESCO) and bodies within our sector (e.g. GSMA) to establish comprehensive rules of engagement.\n- \u00b7 Advocate for the self-regulation of companies in order to allow for the necessary flexibility in design while maintaining fundamental ethical standards.\n- \u00b7 Define a risk-based regulatory framework (reflecting the EU's position in its 'AI Act' regulation) in order to ensure adequate risk control for our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Mission GRI 2-22\n\n## 'To make our world more human by connecting lives'.\n\nOur mission puts people at the centre of everything we do. We want to be a company that is trusted by customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and society in general. Our mission has two objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 To make the world more human: corporate ethics are at the heart of everything we do, constantly driving us to place technology at the service of people and to protect the planet through digitalisation. We take into account our various stakeholders' expectations and needs in order to build relationships of trust.\n- \u00b7 To connect people's lives: we aim to digitalise society as a whole, leaving no one behind, and to reduce the digital divide in terms of access, affordability, accessibility and digital skills training. This part of our mission both drives us to innovate so that we can offer products and services that add value and contribute to improving people's lives and leads us to leverage digital solutions to decarbonise the economy.\n\nWithout connectivity and digitalisation, there is no green transition. Our networks are key to the health, education, industry, agriculture, transportation, and employment of the future.\n\nThe telecommunications sector is a pillar of our society. In the coming years the sector will continue to play a key role in our economic and social recovery and in building a greener and fairer economy for all.\n\n## 1.2.1. Aligned with the 2030 Agenda\n\nOur corporate purpose combines naturally with the United Nations 2030 Agenda , which explicitly highlights the key role of technology, innovation and communications in addressing the great challenges facing humanity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.13. Contribution and impact on communities\n\nDeploying infrastructure is essential, but it is not sufficient on its own. We need to use this infrastructure to develop services that add value and allow us to reap the full socioeconomic benefits of technology. We also need to increase digital skills across society and businesses. We want to be recognised as a key player in the sustainable development of a society and an enabler in tackling emerging socio-economic and environmental challenges.\n\n## 1.2.2. Aligned with our Responsible Business Principles\n\nTo make our mission a reality, we must have clear principles that consistently guide our decisions and actions inside and outside the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.15. Governance and a culture of sustainability\n\nWe have a code of ethics and conduct - our Responsible Business Principles - and a Sustainability Policy, which help to ensure we act with integrity, commitment and transparency.\n\nBrand and culture alignment is also key. Our aim is for Telef\u00f3nica's corporate purpose and values to be reflected in our conduct, processes and targets, ensuring consistency between what we say and what we do so that this shared vision spreads from employees to customers, and from customers to society. This culture is strengthened when we are consistent in how we behave within the Company and how we present ourselves, which in turn helps us clarify our raison d'\u00eatre and how we can help make the world a better place.",

Operations are more agile, efficient and futureproof.\n\n## 1.3.2. Transformation of telecommunications networks towards earth computing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn recent years, profound and disruptive innovation has been unfolding across multiple intersecting technologies in a similar way to when mobile internet converged with computing. That convergence transformed a device intended to support voice functionalities into a smartphone, ushering in digital native companies and radically changing market dynamics.\n\nWe are now in the midst of an era change, driven by the convergence of telcos, computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and Web3. This change has led to radical disruption on all four fronts, giving rise to a new wave of digital services requiring mass communication solutions, full interoperability and real-time computing.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Telef\u00f3nica has the unique opportunity to improve people's lives by offering products and services through our networks. However, with that opportunity comes the responsibility of managing the increase in data traffic and delivering high-performance connectivity, overcoming technological challenges such as latency, capacity and personalisation to do so.\n\nPersonalisation must be prioritised in order to address customers' diverse needs. The increase in traffic will require high-performance connectivity and distributed computing capacities, while solutions beyond cloud technology will need to be explored in order to ensure optimal efficiency and performance for our products and services.\n\nConnectivity is the foundation of all things digital, both today and tomorrow. The telco of the future will rely on networks that are:\n\n- \u00b7 UBB and low latency\n- \u00b7 Programmable and AI-based\n- \u00b7 Cloud-connected\n\nTo adopt technology that promotes efficiency and a good customer experience, it is crucial to move towards a simpler approach, continuing to shut down legacy networks, simplifying the next wave of operations and scaling down our infrastructure. It will also be crucial to step up efforts in the area of hyper-automation, with a focus on operations and content management, contactless network management and next generation customer acquisition.\n\nThe transition towards increasingly automated networks requires the implementation of new AI-based technologies. For Telef\u00f3nica, AI is a key element of the digital customer experience and is a prime contributor to efficiency. There are many practical examples of how AI and machine learning techniques have been applied in our networks. Telef\u00f3nica has created a specific program for the move towards autonomous networks (the Autonomous Network Journey Program) that seeks to deliver greater speed (improved deployment and response times), intelligence (predictive networks), improved quality (for our customers), efficiency (in costs) and sustainability (mainly in the area of energy consumption).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Network and IT components are being broken down into individual microservices, which can be sold through a developer-centric marketplace within the cloud ecosystem.\n\nSoftware developers and integrators can access code through these marketplaces, allowing them to integrate microservices into their applications, such as device location. They will also be able to create configurable and scalable products based on information and network quality.\n\nThis change is a collective industry effort, collaborating to define a new standard within GSMA and CAMARA. Standardisation and simplicity are essential to unlocking the enormous value that lies hidden in connectivity.\n\nThe industry is ready to serve a platform that reaches 5,400 million people daily. This readiness demonstrates the sector's ability to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by this new era of digital connectivity.\n\nThe implementation of next generation infrastructure is underway, with UBB connectivity already deployed and our networks undergoing a transformation towards softwarisation and hyper-automation.\n\nThe data- and API-based abstraction layer helps orchestrate this infrastructure and seamlessly connect it to the digital world. In building an earth computing stack coordinated by telecommunications, all the necessary intelligence is being deployed.\n\nAutomation and data management will streamline innovative service offerings, providing high-quality digital connectivity and services to B2C customers, driving digital transformation in B2B and facilitating wholesale connectivity to a variety of partners, from other telcos to developers.\n\nThis large scale transformation we have undertaken, which has improved networks and customer interactions, streamlined operations and ensured the sustainability of the business, puts the Company in a significantly better position than the rest of the industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Context analysis\n\nThe first step in this process consisted of analysing both the internal and external sustainability environment, taking into account our business model, our value chain and our stakeholders.\n\nFor this we used the following sources :\n\n## External\n\n- \u00b7 Global ESG regulatory context : analysis of international environmental, social and corporate governance standards, as well as legal requirements, globally applied regional and/or local standards, economic policies, self-regulation standards, etc.\n- \u00b7 Benchmark : materiality matrices of the leaders in our sector.\n- \u00b7 Analysts and investors : expectations from our investors and ESG rating analysts such as MSCI, S&P and Sustainalytics, among others.\n- \u00b7 Sectoral reports: to identify global, sectoral and specific trends, challenges and risks pertaining to the business model in the area of sustainability.\n- \u00b7 Expectations from our stakeholders: to identify priority issues reported through the various engagement channels we have with them. For further information, see our table of stakeholder communication channels at the end of this chapter.\n\n## Internal\n\nBesides analysing relevant internal documentation, we also consulted with those responsible of the Company's most pertinent business areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see Appendix 2.20.3.Material issues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## B. Identification of topics, sub-topics, and impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs)\n\nThe results of the contextual analysis performed in the previous step, together with those of our 2022 double materiality process, enabled us to obtain a preliminary list of topics and sub-topics that are potentially material for the Company. This was subsequently validated by the relevant Company areas in order to ensure a thorough and sound exercise.\n\nSimilarly, a set of impacts, risks and opportunities linked to each of the identified topics and sub-topics were defined.. The main sources used were the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Positive impacts: Telef\u00f3nica's Socioeconomic Contribution Report 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.13. Contribution and impact on communities\n\nNegative impacts: human rights and environmental impact assessment, as well as Telef\u00f3nica's due diligence analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.14. Human rights\n\nRisks: Telef\u00f3nica's risk matrix and management process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 3.1. Risk management framework\n\nOpportunities: based on an internal analysis performed by the Strategy area, we estimated a number of opportunities linked to the potentially material topics and sub-topics identified, in terms of both potential new revenues and sources of efficiencies.\n\nAs  part  of  this  identification  process,  we  also  took  into consideration  the  Climate  Action  Plan  and  the  Natural Capital Impact Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Assessment of potentially material impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nThe impacts, risks and opportunities identified in the previous step were assessed from both an impact and a financial perspective:\n\n## Impact, risk and opportunity (IRO) assessment criteria\n\n| Positive Impact   | Actual  Potential Actual                                | Scale + Scope + Economic Assessment (Scale + Scope + Economic Assessment) x Likelihood Scale + Scope + Remediability   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Negative  Impact  | Potential                                               | (Scale + Scope + Remediability) x Likelihood                                                                           |\n| Opportunities     | Scale + Economic Assessment x Likelihood for potential. | Scale + Economic Assessment x Likelihood for potential.                                                                |\n\nIn addition, we quantitatively assessed each of the metrics used according to:\n\n- \u00b7 Scale : the level of importance attributed by stakeholders to each impact, risk and opportunity. We obtain this information through consultations and studies performed via our various engagement channels for customers, employees, suppliers, society, analysts, investors, insurance and competing companies.\n\nThe results were obtained from the following sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Customers : the importance attributed by our customers in the multi-channel relational survey.\n- \u00b7 Suppliers : 2023 Supplier Survey.\n- \u00b7 Employees : Telef\u00f3nica Annual Motivation Survey.\n- \u00b7 Analysts and investors : analysis of questions and feedback from investors and ESG analysts 2023.\n- \u00b7 Society : weightings given by the public in the survey performed for RepTrak.\n- \u00b7 Insurance : weight given by insurance analysts to sustainability issues in our sector.\n\n- \u00b7 Peers : to estimate the importance of ESG issues for companies in our sector, we compared and contrasted the result of their materiality analysis.\n- \u00b7 Interviews with internal and external stakeholders as part of the environmental and human rights impact assessment process.\n\nMore information is provided in the Stakeholder engagement section later on in this chapter.\n\n- \u00b7 Scope : To evaluate the extent of the impact, we took into account the assessments performed in previous processes (the Human Rights and Environmental Impact Assessment, the Due Diligence Analysis and our Socioeconomic Contribution Report) and assigned the following scale:\n\n|   Assessment | Scope of impact   | Definition                      |\n|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|\n|            5 | Global            | Affects several  regions        |\n|            4 | Regional          | Affects a number of  countries  |\n|            3 | National          | Has an impact at  country level |\n|            2 | Local             | Specific impact                 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The risks and opportunities metric is determined by the negative or positive financial impact that the risks or opportunities may generate for the Company. These values are provided by the Group's risk model (in the case of risks) and the Company's strategy area (in the case of opportunities). The strategy area determines the values based on a thorough analysis backed by objective and quantifiable data.\n- \u00b7 Likelihood : the probability that the previously identified impacts, risks and opportunities will occur. This is determined by the human rights and environmental impact assessment (in the case of potential negative impacts), the Company's risk model (in the case of risks) and the likelihood of opportunity capture as determined by the strategy area (in the case of opportunities). The following thresholds were established:\n\n| Likelihood    | Thresholds   |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Very probable | 81-100%      |\n| Probable      | 51-80%       |\n| Very possible | 31-50%       |\n| Possible      | 11-30%       |\n| Remote        | 0-10%        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRemediability : the parameter of remediability applies to negative impacts only and is determined based on whether action is required to mitigate the negative impact or whether it cannot be remedied by any action.\n\n## D. Determination of material issues\n\nThe evaluation of the topics and sub-topics is determined by the estimated values of each of the impacts, risks and opportunities.\n\nThe final determination of materiality is established by comparing these evaluations with the materiality thresholds set for this purpose. Thus, all those topics which obtain a score of over 60% of the maximum value of the topics evaluated in either of the two perspectives (impact and financial) are deemed to be material.\n\n## E. Oversight and validation of materiality\n\nIn this step we presented and cross-checked the results obtained. This was done in conjunction with all the areas at a global level that took part in the process, as well as with various managers and internal bodies, such as the Executive Committee and the Sustainability and Regulation Committee",

Double materiality matrix\n\nAltogether, the steps described above produced a double materiality matrix from a global perspective that was based on the impact that ESG issues have on Telef\u00f3nica's value and on Telef\u00f3nica's impact on society and the environment. The result provided the basis for the Consolidated Management Report 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis analysis is integrated into the Sustainability Strategy, leads to the establishment of objectives, policies and action plans and serves as a tool that supports our internal management of sustainability.\n\nFour topics have been identified as highly relevant for the Company: responsible management of the customer experience, network and data security, digital inclusion and contribution to decarbonisation of the economy. On the other hand, water, pollution on the environment, terrestrial ecosystems and marine ecosystems are considered non-material.\n\nFor more information on non-material issues, see chapter Biodiversity, water and other environmental aspects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.4.4.

Stakeholder engagement GRI 2-29\n\nOur commitment and stakeholder engagement strategy is based on increasing transparency and effective dialogue to build relationships of trust.\n\nThese relationships enable us to determine which topics are considered most significant by our stakeholders and to identify new trends in the field of sustainability. The significance of these topics is an essential part of the impact, risk and opportunity assessment within the double materiality process, and that significance is included in the assessment criteria. This process enables us to set our short-, medium- and long-term targets and to define the Responsible Business Plan, as well as to monitor our ability to meet our stakeholders' expectations.\n\nOur stakeholder management is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Collaboration : we foster cooperation with our stakeholders in order to advance towards achieving our purpose and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n- \u00b7 Continuous improvement: we regularly review our stakeholder communication mechanisms to make engagement as easy, effective and collaborative as possible, in accordance with the needs at any given time.\n- \u00b7 Consensus : we strive to create shared value by participating in industry organisations' working groups and taking into consideration the points of view and expectations of local communities.\n- \u00b7 Transparency : we share truthful, relevant, complete, clear and useful information.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we have regulations that govern information shared with markets and other stakeholders in order to guarantee that the information is known, thereby maximising the reach and quality of this content.\n\nBelow are the main publications that report on our activities and help to ensure clear and transparent communication:\n\n- - Consolidated Management Report.\n- - Quarterly results presentations.\n- - Prospectuses, mainly those meeting legal requirements in the markets where Company shares are traded (20F or Registration Document).\n- - All our policies are public and available on the Telef\u00f3nica website.\n- - Publications on the global and local Telef\u00f3nica websites.\n- - Social media presence: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube.\n- \u00b7 Consultation and participation: we maintain ongoing conversations with our stakeholders through active listening, the promotion of two-way and effective communication, and direct, fluid, constructive, diverse, inclusive and inter-cultural dialogue that enables us to understand their expectations and address their priorities.\n\nThis ongoing dialogue forms part of our daily operations and is built around each of the interactions that stakeholders have with us through the different channels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 2.20.1. Telef\u00f3nica stakeholders\n\nBy constantly monitoring the main channels for dialogue with major stakeholders, allows us to measure the impact of our relations with and commitment to them, and can thus establish action plans to meet needs, boost positive impacts and avoid or mitigate any that are negative. This enables us to know how important ESG aspects are to our stakeholders, and we include the level of importance attributed to each impact, risk and opportunity in our assessment of the scale.",

Strategy\n\n## Key points\n\n## Growth\n\nthanks to our network and differential attention in B2C, the digitalisation of companies and the expansion of the wholesale business with new services.\n\n## Profitability\n\ndriven by the efficiencies resulting from the Company's technological and energy transformation and circular practices.\n\n## 1.5.1. GPS: a stronger and more ambitious company\n\nIn 2016 Telef\u00f3nica stepped up the transformation process it had begun years before, accelerating its transition from a traditional voice services operator to a technology company. In 2019 we adopted a new five-pillar action plan that redefined our organisational structure and accelerated our transformation. The Company has surpassed the targets set:\n\n- \u00b7 We have strengthened our main operators in the markets in which the Company has its most significant presence (Spain, Brazil, UK and Germany), thereby moving towards a long-term sustainable model.\n- \u00b7 We are capitalising on growth opportunities in digital professional services through Telef\u00f3nica Tech, which has become a driver of growth across our B2B activities.\n- \u00b7 Through Telef\u00f3nica Infra we have maximised the value of our infrastructure assets, selling assets at the right time, achieving significant multiples and accelerating fibre deployments through agreements with financial partners.\n- \u00b7 Telef\u00f3nica Hispanoamerica is on its way to financial sustainability thanks to differential regional management that focuses on efficiency and shared network costs. As a result, we have reduced our exposure and risk in the region.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nwith the reduction of leverage and the creation of value for stakeholders through an attractive dividend and ambitious ESG objectives.\n\n- \u00b7 The implementation of a new operating model has contributed to further streamlining and improving the efficiency of our organisation, enhancing our operating leverage.\n\nThe fruits of this transformation are clear to see from the significant increase in network quality and customer satisfaction, the shift in the revenue mix towards digital products and services, and a return to more profitable and sustainable growth.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's new plan follows a major transformation process that has enabled the Company to raise its ambitions and prepare for its centenary celebrations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Maintaining B2C revenue growth by implementing a strategy aimed at attracting and retaining customers through attractive propositions that leverage the quality of our network and product offerings with integrated services beyond connectivity. The strategy will be delivered through B2C digital ecosystems and by capitalising on the strong and trusted brands we have in our markets.\n- 2. Sustaining the momentum of the B2B business . The needs of our B2B customers have evolved; they now require advanced solutions beyond connectivity. This change has led to a significant increase in market potential and growth opportunities. Telef\u00f3nica Tech, which has established itself as a leading provider of advanced solutions (cloud, cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), big data) and professional services, is well positioned to capitalise on this change, also offering sustainable services with environmental benefits and more accessibility. To this end, we will focus on further expanding our portfolio of solutions to support our customers as they digitalise their businesses.\n- 3. Developing wholesale revenues and revenues from the Company's partner agreements into a valuable revenue stream that optimises network utilisation, provides access to different customer segments and contributes to the return on investment of our networks. To this end, we have designed a customised plan for strengthening our wholesale business in each of our main markets (Spain, Germany, Brazil and UK). In addition to the traditional wholesale business, we are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBusiness Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nimplementing new services and entering fast-growing markets such as Network as a Service, aiming to attract software developers and integrators as new customers, thereby allowing us to expand the API-based market through the Open Gateway initiative.\n\n- 4. Achieving efficiencies that help to reduce the cost structure through technological transformation. Next year, Spain will be the first country in the European Union to shut down its old copper network and switch to full fibre optic networks, which are more costeffective due to their energy efficiency and lower operational and maintenance costs. In addition, Telef\u00f3nica is continuing to switch off 2G and 3G networks across its coverage area and driving circurlarity. In terms of operational efficiency, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation into our organisation will result in a more efficient and faster execution of our services, allowing us to become an agile company adapted to the demands of the future.\n- 5. Reducing levels of investment activity but maintaining Telef\u00f3nica's unique profile by capitalising on early investment in fibre and 5G and the conclusion of the main 5G spectrum auctions. This will allow us to move past the Company's CapEx peak while continuing to optimise network deployments through agreements with investment partners and Telef\u00f3nica Infra. Meanwhile, Telef\u00f3nica has reaffirmed its continued commitment to technology, software and AI investments that support the Company's historically unique profile by ensuring a strong position in terms of both advanced infrastructure and the ability to lead change in the future.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is ready and committed to achieving its renewed ambition and leading the future. In this regard, the GPS plan incorporates specifically designed actions in each of the Company's four major markets:\n\n- \u00b7 In Spain , the focus will be on continuing to grow B2C revenues by capitalising on our premium consumer segment and accelerating our B2B momentum while advancing operational leverage through efficiencies, copper shutdown, automation and optimising the size of the organisation. In addition, thanks to early investment in fibre, we will continue to optimise the level of our investment activity.\n- \u00b7 In Brazil , we remain in a strong position in a growing market and are looking to broaden our customer base and expand our margins by developing a complete portfolio of digital services for the B2C and B2B segments. We're continuing to roll out the fibre network at a rapid pace, using sharing models that allow for quick and cost-effective deployment.",

Our goal is to maintain our momentum in the consumer segment while stepping it up in the enterprise segment. We have implemented plans to mitigate the loss of the wholesale contract at the same time as we ramp up efforts to transform and simplify the business in order to reduce costs. In addition, in November 2023, we submitted a voluntary partial tender offer to the shareholders of Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland Holding AG (Telef\u00f3nica Germany) as a result of which we have acquired 93% of the shares. Thus, we reinforce Telef\u00f3nica's strategy of focusing on our core geographic markets and our firm commitment to the German telecommunications market, which is one of the most attractive and stable in Europe\n- \u00b7 Lastly, in UK we will continue to focus on B2C growth through fixed-mobile convergence and to boost our unique commercial standing through digitalisation and AI. We will also continue to pursue synergies and optimise CapEx through the Nexfibre vehicle as we decommission old technologies; for example, the 3G network shutdown is planned for 2025.\n\nOur GPS plan also introduces new features into the financial reporting system with the aim of simplifying concepts and reinforcing our commitment to transparency vis-\u00e0-vis the market. Guidance is therefore now expressed in reported terms and a new benchmark for cash flow generation is used, among other changes.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica also expects a positive change in the net financial debt ratio and remains committed to shareholder value creation, guaranteeing a minimum dividend payment of \u20ac0.30 per share during the 2023-2026 period.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is presenting these targets at a time when its financial fundamentals are stronger and more resilient and when it has a bespoke value creation strategy and a strict capital management policy, which has made it easier to set more ambitious and robust targets. The Company has a strong balance sheet that enables it to cope with a dynamic macroeconomic environment and gives it the flexibility to access financial markets. It also has sufficient liquidity to handle the current maturity schedule.\n\n## 1.5.2. Sustainability integrated into Telef\u00f3nica's strategy GRI 2-22\n\nTelef\u00f3nica incorporates all the main aspects of sustainability into its strategy, aligned with the double materiality analysis. These ESG commitments are reflected in the 2024-26 Responsible Business Plan , which follows the GPS framework (growth, profitability and sustainability):\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growth\n\nIn order to drive the sustainable growth of our Company, we focus on strengthening our customer relationships. That is why we plan to implement a new global customer responsibility policy aimed at building unique experiences that are underpinned by sustainable communication.\n\nIn addition, we seek to expand our range of products and services by capitalising on the opportunities offered by an ESG perspective. This approach involves promoting Eco smart products, encouraging responsible design practices and boosting digital inclusion through the development of accessible solutions with a positive social impact. Through these initiatives, we seek not only to set ourselves apart in the market, but also to build stronger and longer-lasting relationships with our customers.\n\n## Profitability\n\nIn order to generate a higher return on our investments, we aim to optimise how we use our assets. This involves decarbonising our operations and reducing our energy consumption by using renewable sources and applying energy efficiency practices. We also seek to promote the circularity of our processes in order to explore new business models (reuse of customer equipment and mobile devices) and generate efficiencies.\n\nMeanwhile, we are working to incorporate sustainability criteria into our financing. This has resulted in the creation of new financial instruments linked to ESG targets and an increase in the proportion of financing linked to sustainability projects.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIn order to ensure that sustainability is a driving force for Telef\u00f3nica's value creation, we have undertaken management commitments that enable us to be positioned as leaders in the diverse ESG ratings of reference.\n\nTo achieve this, we emphasise the importance of promoting excellence in governance and accountability, underpinned by a strong ESG culture. We also implement extensive due diligence processes to ensure sustainable management throughout our value chain.\n\nUltimately, we reinforce our commitment to human talent through practices that prioritise employee well-being, enhance their skills and promote diversity.",

Finance for the transition to a sustainable economy\n\n## Key points\n\n## ~\u20ac18.8bn\n\nin sustainable finance 1 at the end of 2023, positioning Telef\u00f3nica among the sector leaders.\n\n## 33.6 %\n\nfinancing linked to sustainability criteria in Telef\u00f3nica, representing an increase of 6.3 p.p. compared to 2022.\n\n## 1.7.1. Context\n\nThe European Union (EU) Sustainable Finance Action Plan , adopted in 2018, aims to reorient capital flows and align them with the needs of the economy in order to benefit the planet and society. Its main purpose is to move towards a climate-neutral economy by 2050 . This plan is aligned with the targets of the Paris Agreement and the commitment to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nIn 2020 the EU agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, which is expected to require an additional investment of approximately \u20ac700 billion per year 2 .\n\nAt a time when not all the technologies needed for a sustainable economy are yet available on the market, the EU is urging all financial market participants to support the funding of the transition to a carbonneutral economy, and to do so quickly enough to meet the EU's climate and environmental targets.\n\n## > 37%\n\nof our institutional investors follow strict environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, representing an increase of 0.8 p.p. over the course of 2023.\n\nThe transition offers opportunities for those companies that are working to transform their business activities but require further investment to do so, as long as their plans and targets are science-based and\n\nbacked by information that ensures integrity, transparency and accountability.\n\n## In this regard, the Recommendation on Facilitating Finance for the Transition to a Sustainable Economy,\n\npublished in June 2023 by the European Commission, invites investors and banks to assess transition and investment plans together with companies' extensive non-financial reporting when financing this transition through the capital market (bonds and other instruments) and green or sustainability-linked loans.\n\nInvestors followed very closely the latest developments related to the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) , which seeks to minimise the risk of greenwashing 3 by investors and encourage greater allocation of capital towards the climate transition and other sustainability goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite continuing to grow, it did so at a much slower pace than in the two previous years 4 .\n\nTelef\u00f3nica continues to monitor these regulatory and ESG market developments, allowing us to stay one step ahead and anticipate the information needs of investors and other stakeholders, which is key to consolidating our leading position in sustainability and transparency.\n\n## 1.7.2. Climate transition finance strategy\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's main finance commitment centres on mitigating the impact of our operations and therefore contributing to the green and digital transition in all sectors. Connectivity and digitalisation are essential to making progress towards this climate transition.\n\nIn this regard, we have approved an ambitious Climate Action Plan that contains specific measures aimed at achieving our decarbonisation targets. These measures, which include the transformation of networks towards more efficient technologies and the use of renewable energy, are linked to Telef\u00f3nica's strategy and investments.\n\nThe Climate Action Plan therefore sets out the strategy for financing the transformation of our business and accessing sustainable sources of finance with which to approach the transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2 Energy and climate change\n\n## 1.7.3. Financing tools\n\nAs part of Telef\u00f3nica's finance strategy, the Group published its first Sustainable Finance Framework in 2018, which was subsequently updated in January 2021 and again more recently in July 2023. All updates have received independent positive Second Party Opinion from Sustainalytics. Accordingly, the framework supports the issuance of bonds, hybrid instruments, loans and other financial\n\ninstruments in a green, social and sustainable format.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The framework is linked to projects that are critical to\n\nthe transformation of the business, mainly through the deployment of high-speed networks that are more energy efficient and facilitate the implementation of smart solutions, thereby reducing the environmental impact on other sectors of the economy and society.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica was a pioneer in the capital market in terms of sustainable finance and stands out for the volume and diversification of its financial instruments. In 2019 it became the first company in the telecommunications sector to issue a green bond, a green hybrid in 2020 and a sustainable hybrid in 2021.\n\nIn addition to green senior bonds and hybrid instruments, we use other sustainable financing tools linked to sustainability targets , such as bank loans and credits or the issuance of local bonds. That allow us to continue making steady progress towards important corporate targets such as those relating to emissions reductions and gender equality.\n\nThese instruments (bonds, hybrid instruments and bank financing) are becoming increasingly important in shaping the Group's financing structure and are voluntary tools recognised in the financial markets for their role in fostering the transition to a more sustainable economy.\n\n## 1.7.3.1. Progress in 2023\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Telef\u00f3nica Group's sustainable finance 5 activity amounted to \u20ac18.8 billion. This represents 33.6% of total financing and positions the Company among the market leaders in the global telecommunications sector in terms of issuance volume and diversification of instruments.\n\nThis percentage was also within the range of the 30-35% target set by the Company at the beginning of the year for 2024. As a result, the Company has announced an updated target, aiming for around 40% of financing to meet sustainable criteria by 2026.\n\n## Updating the financing framework 6\n\nIn 2023 the Sustainable Finance Framework was updated to keep it in line with best market practices and investor expectations.\n\nThe framework is aligned with the four pillars that make up the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA)\n\nGreen Bond Principles and Social Bond Principles, updated in June 2023, as well as the external review component. As a new development, it also follows the Loan Market Association (LMA), Asian Pacific Loan\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, despite this backdrop, Telef\u00f3nica successfully raised a total of \u20ac2.6 billion of green debt on the capital market during the year.\n\nIn January Telef\u00f3nica re-entered the sustainable debt market with the issuance of a green hybrid bond for an amount of \u20ac1 billion and a maturity of 7.25 years. Later,\n\nin September, a new green hybrid amounting to \u20ac750 million , with a redemption date of eight years was issued.\n\nThe Company also launched several bond repurchase offers at the time of these issuances and continues to proactively manage its hybrid capital base.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica received the Most Impressive Corporate Hybrid Capital Issuer 2023 award from Global Capital, one of the most important international publications in the sector.\n\n## In November, the Company also launched a 10-year green bond for an amount of \u20ac850 million.\n\nThe strong demand from investors for all issuances, mainly international, has also made it possible to increase the amount of financing obtained and to improve financing conditions significantly, with very competitive interest rates.\n\nLastly, in January 2024, Telef\u00f3nica made a new green issuance of \u20ac1.75 billion, structured in two senior tranches of 8 and 12 years. This is the Company's largest issuance since 2020.\n\n## Loans and lines linked to sustainability targets\n\nIn terms of bank financing, in 2022 the Group's main syndicated loan was refinanced at a corporate level for the amount of \u20ac5.5 billion , of which the interest applied is linked to compliance with sustainability targets.",

In line with the above, the indicator linked to lending was also updated.\n\nThe second target is linked to an increase in the number of women in senior management positions at our Company to 37% by 2027.\n\nAt the end of the year, Telef\u00f3nica met the objectives committed to financial entities.\n\n| KPI                                                    | Benchmark  value       | 2023    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Reduction of Scope 1 and 2  greenhouse gases (%)       | (Year 2015)  1.811.155 | -81.4 % |\n| Women in senior management  positions in the Group (%) | (Year 2020)  27,4%     | 32.8%   |\n\nCommitted bilateral lines operations with several financial entities reach a total volume of \u20ac4,032 million at the close of 2023, the interest applied to which is also linked to compliance with sustainability targets.\n\n## Sustainable finance at country level\n\nThis finance model has also been implemented in the countries in which the Group operates. In Brazil, Vivo issued its first sustainability-linked bond (SLB) in 2022 for a total amount of R$3.5 billion (equivalent to \u20ac654 million using the 2023 year-end exchange rate). Financing costs are linked to compliance with environmental and social targets by 2027.\n\nIn Colombia , Telef\u00f3nica has loans amounting to $1,098 billion COP (equivalent to \u20ac260 million using the 2023 year-end exchange rate). These are related to, inter alia, the achievement of energy efficiency and cybersecurity training targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.7.4. Impact of transition finance\n\nIn line with the Company's Climate Action Plan, the proceeds obtained are mainly used for projects aimed at transforming and modernising telecommunication networks with a view to improving their energy efficiency and reducing their carbon footprint , and thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable economy. To measure their impact, Telef\u00f3nica monitors the changes in the ratio of energy consumption per unit of traffic (MWh/PB), energy saved and emissions avoided.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, the investment focused on mobile broadband deployment projects in rural areas . The impact of this is measured by the number of people who benefit and the total number of Telef\u00f3nica users in these areas at the end of each period.\n\nThe allocation of funds and the associated environmental and social impacts are disclosed annually in accordance with the commitments made by Telef\u00f3nica to its investors in each instance. In addition, and as required by the framework, all information is audited by an independent third party.\n\n## 1.7.4.1. Progress in 2023\n\nDuring the year the allocation to projects and the impact of the senior sustainable bond issued in May 2022 for \u20ac1 billion, the green hybrid bond issued November 2022 for \u20ac750 million and the green hybrid bond launched in January 2023 amounting to \u20ac1 billion were validated.\n\nIn total, over \u20ac6 billion has been allocated to sustainable projects since 2016 . From an environmental perspective, it is important to point out that more than 80% of the funds have been allocated to fixed and mobile network transformation projects . The relationship between the funds and the\n\nenvironmental and social impacts is as follows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustainable and Responsible Investment\n\n## Investors' and ESG analysts' positive perception of Telef\u00f3nica's sustainability strategy and its\n\nimplementation places our Company in a strong position for accessing ESG capital on the equity market as well as on the fixed income market, as mentioned above.\n\nThe SFDR represents an important milestone, now requiring investment funds that promote themselves as sustainable or ESG (investment funds focused on climate change solutions, ethical funds, etc.) to seek more quantitative and qualitative information on the companies in which they invest.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has sought to anticipate the growing investor need for more in-depth sustainability disclosures by making its Principal Adverse Impacts (PAIs) available for the second consecutive year, and becoming one of the first companies to do so. Our PAI indicators are included in the Appendix (both the mandatory and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noptional indicators), which investors can use to regularly monitor their investment portfolios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 2.20. Appendix\n\nTo ensure that Telef\u00f3nica's ambitious sustainability targets benefit from this growing influx of sustainable investment, we are focusing on four main areas:\n\n- 1. For the second consecutive year, Telef\u00f3nica has published data on the alignment of its activities with the EU taxonomy alongside the eligibility analysis, which was published for the first time in 2021.\n- 2. In addition, we seek to continue to anticipate investors' needs for additional disclosures from companies to help them comply with their own SFDR disclosure requirements.\n- 3. To demonstrate our positive impact, we continue to assess our sustainability impacts through a detailed sustainability impact assessment based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, Telef\u00f3nica has received endorsements from institutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Another fundamental pillar of the ESG investment strategy is our proactive engagement with financial market participants , in particular institutional investors, analysts and ESG information providers.\n\nOur ongoing dialogue with these stakeholders is geared towards meeting their needs for sustainability-related information, listening to their changing expectations and keeping them up to date with Telef\u00f3nica's sustainability strategy. This task is particularly important given the diverse set of criteria and weightings used in assessing our performance.\n\nOur continual exchange of information and feedback with investors supports our drive for continuous improvement while strengthening our leadership position in matters of sustainability. This is ultimately reflected in our Company's ratings and our inclusion in ESG benchmark indices such as the Dow Jones Sustainability\u2122 Europe Index.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 1.9. Main indicators and footprint\n\n## Fonditel\n\nThe Company's commitment to sustainability can be demonstrated through its pension fund, Fonditel. Fonditel is the Telef\u00f3nica Group's independent management company. It has over 30 years of experience in managing pension funds and investment funds that are tailored to the risk profile of its clients.\n\nAs part of its Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) purpose, Fonditel is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), which, together with the SDGs , form the fundamental pillars of its SRI philosophy, thereby contributing to the development of a more sustainable global financial system.\n\nFonditel sees the integration of ESG issues into its investment process as an opportunity and the best way to fulfil its fiduciary duty to its investors rather than something that is solely a regulatory requirement.\n\nThe events of recent years have only strengthened the fund manager's belief that it must support the transition to a more sustainable world and, as institutional investors, be an active part of it by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nencouraging the reorientation of capital flows towards socially responsible and eco-friendly activities that are aligned with the 2030 Agenda . With this in mind, Fonditel continues to develop investment funds linked to the SDGs that have a positive impact on the environment and society in addition to the economic value of the investments.\n\nLooking ahead, Fonditel plans to continue to build on its commitment to sustainable and responsible investment with the aim of contributing to sustainable economic, social and environmental development and fostering a fairer, more inclusive and caring society. In doing so, it maintains its long-term vision, resolutely committed to continue generating sustainable returns for its customers.\n\n## 1.7.5.1. Progress in 2023\n\n## Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI)\n\nThere was a noticeable deceleration of capital flows to the ESG market during 2023. For example, according to Morningstar, sustainable funds decreased globally, from 161 billion USD to 63 billion during the year. Despite this trend, share ownership in Telef\u00f3nica from institutional investors that consistently incorporate ESG criteria into their investment strategies continued to increase.\n\nThis is a useful indicator that confirms the growing importance of ESG factors in investment processes and the alignment of our sustainability strategy and performance with the expectations of these investors.\n\nPercentage of shares incorporating ESG criteria over the total number of Telef\u00f3nica shares managed by institutional investors 7\n\n<!-- image -->",

This increase of 0.8 percentage points on the 36.4% recorded the previous year is to be welcomed, especially in the context of a generally slower ESG market.\n\nIn particular, it is interesting to note that within Telef\u00f3nica's ESG equity investments, investments managed by ESG thematic funds , including those promoting environmental and social characteristics (Art. 8 SFDR) and those pursuing sustainability targets (Art. 9 SFDR), continued to grow. In 2023 the percentage of Telef\u00f3nica shares managed through ESG investment funds reached 5.8% of institutional shares in the Company, compared to 4.8% the previous year.\n\nThis steady growth in sustainable investment fund ownership serves to reaffirm our focus on continuing to communicate our ESG strategy and performance to the financial markets. We believe this long-term vision underpins Telef\u00f3nica's differentiation against its peers as we continue to enhance the ESG market's positive perceptions of Telef\u00f3nica based on our progress and sustainability reporting.\n\nOver the long term, we expect that the sustainable investment market will continue to grow, and that European regulation will sustain this growth, albeit indirectly.\n\n<!-- image -->",

European Taxonomy for sustainable activities\n\nKey points\n\n## New activities\n\nIn 2023, Telef\u00f3nica is reporting new eligible-activities related to the transition to a circular economy objective.\n\n## ICT in the Taxonomy\n\nThe potential of the telecommunication networks with regard to climate change mitigation is not currently addressed by the Regulation.\n\n## 1.8.1. Regulatory background\n\nTaxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment provides the regulatory basis for defining both a classification system and the requirements an economic activity must fulfil to be classified as sustainable. This Regulation was developed in the context of the Action Plan: Financing Sustainable Growth and the European Green Deal to promote the investment needed to achieve a competitive, circular and climateneutral economy by 2050. The European Taxonomy aims to establish a common language for identifying sustainable activities consistently throughout the European Union.\n\nThe regulatory framework is complemented by delegated regulations and annexes that implement the provisions of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation (as well as Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 and\n\n## Sector progress\n\nThe sector has submitted a proposal for the development of a new activity covering telecommunications networks, using the EU mechanisms.\n\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 , which set out additional activities and criteria).\n\n- \u00b7 Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 specifying the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by undertakings.\n- \u00b7 Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 establishing the technical screening criteria for four additional environmental objectives: sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; the transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe latter Regulation completes the legislative framework that sets out the requirements for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as being sustainable in relation to environmental objectives.\n\nFor the financial year covered by this Report, and as set out in this Regulation, only eligible activities related to these new objectives should be disclosed. The reporting of alignment shall take place from the following year onwards.\n\nThe European Commission has also published additional notices concerning the aforementioned Delegated Regulations, with the intention of reducing the\n\n<!-- image -->",

Scope of the report\n\nThe Regulation applies to the activities carried out by Telef\u00f3nica across all its fully consolidated companies.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is part of the Company's strategy, as it is aligned with global targets to reverse climate change. To this end, the Company has a Climate Action Plan that aims to transform the organisation in order to reduce its impact and help its customers reduce their environmental footprint.\n\nDeploying\n\nstate-of-the-art fixed and mobile\n\ntelecommunications networks (such as fibre optics or 5G) that are much more efficient in terms of energy consumption, and based on renewable electricity, reduces and contributes to climate change mitigation.\n\nThe digital services (such as cloud, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data) offered by the Company are not only aimed at making technology easier for our customers to use on a day-to-day basis, but also at benefiting the environment by reducing emissions when these services are provided through the Group's infrastructure.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica also promotes the transition to a circular economy, based on environmental design criteria, reuse and recycling as part of its program to become a Zero Waste company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see chapter 2.2. Energy and climate change\n\nFor further information, see chapter 2.3. Circular economy\n\n## 1.8.3. Vision and scope of the Taxonomy\n\nSome of Telef\u00f3nica's digital solutions are covered by the Taxonomy because of their climate change mitigation potential . According to ETNO and BCG 1 , the sector has the potential to reduce global CO 2 emissions by up to 15% through the complete digitalisation of other sectors (e.g. transportation and energy, smart buildings and cities, and based on solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsuch as blockchain applications, etc.). Other studies , e.g. the Exponential Roadmap 2 , indicate that digital technologies can indirectly support a further reduction of up to 35% when criteria such as changing consumption habits over the coming years are considered.\n\nFollowing the approval of the four additional objectives, and specifically the one concerning the transition to a circular economy, the Company also intends to make a valuable contribution in this regard. Telef\u00f3nica is working on initiatives to promote circularity in collaboration with other sector stakeholders and is aligned with the GSMA-defined commitments for 2030 to reuse and recycle 100% of network equipment and mobile devices collected, as well as to take back 20% of used mobile devices from customers.\n\n## 1.8.4. Methodology and results\n\n## 1.8.4.1. Understanding the taxonomy requirements\n\nAccording to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, nonfinancial undertakings must disclose the following information for each of the environmental targets set out in the Regulation, and as provided for in Annex I of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178:\n\n- \u00b7 The proportion of their turnover derived from Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned activities.\n- \u00b7 The proportion of their capital expenditure (CapEx) derived from Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned activities.\n- \u00b7 The proportion of their operating expenditure (OpEx) derived from Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned activities.\n- \u00b7 Explanatory information accompanying the relevant KPIs:\n- - Accounting policy.\n- - Assessment of compliance with the Taxonomy Regulation.\n- - Contextual information.\n\nThe Regulation also specifies 3 that qualitative explanations and quantitative breakdowns must be provided in the event of any change in the approach and methodology used previously, along with comparative figures and sufficient information to be able to trace the trends of the data provided.",

Assessment of eligibility of the Company's activities. This is an analysis of the accounting items relating to the three KPIs based on the description of activities provided in Annexes I and II to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 and Annexes I to IV of Delegated Regulation 2023/2486.\n- 2. Assessment of the technical screening criteria for substantial contribution laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139. Not applicable until 2024 for the objectives in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486.\n- 3. Assessment of the 'do no significant harm' (DNSH) criteria regarding the other environmental targets provided in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139. Not applicable until 2024 for the objectives in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486.\n- 4. Assessment of compliance with social minimum safeguards according to:\n- - Platform report on Social Minimum Safeguards.\n- - OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n- - United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (including the principles and rights included in the International Labour Organization's eight core conventions as set out in the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and those expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights).\n- 5. Calculation of the percentages of each of the three KPIs of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities (i.e. that comply with points 2, 3 and 4).\n\nBelow is a description of the process for calculating the three KPIs. Also covered below are the key aspects related to accounting policy, compliance with the Taxonomy Regulation and contextual information to support an adequate understanding of the indicators.\n\n## 1.8.4.2. General considerations\n\nIn order to calculate the revenue, CapEx and OpEx indicators, Telef\u00f3nica uses the information from the local and/or global database for the different business units.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformation on the VMED O2 UK joint venture is excluded from the scope as the Company is not fully consolidated.\n\n## Transactions between Group companies were\n\nanalysed for identification and traceability purposes. However, they are not included in the calculation as they are excluded from full consolidation due to being intercompany transactions.\n\nDue care was taken to avoid double counting throughout the entire process:\n\n- a. Reconciliation with accounting information , which ensures appropriate consideration of eliminations and adjustments on consolidation.\n- b. Use of consistent information sources , which prevents the same item from being considered under two different KPIs or twice under the same KPI.\n- c.Verification of the completeness and accuracy of the data.\n\nAfter assessing each of the three indicators, the following were identified as the main Taxonomy-eligible economic activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Activities that can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (CCM according to the defined nomenclature of the Regulation):\n- -Activity 8.1. Data processing, hosting and related activities.\n- -Activity 8.2. Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions.\n- \u00b7 Activities that can make a substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy (EC according to the defined nomenclature of the Regulation):\n- -Activity 5.1. Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing.\n- -Activity 5.4. Sale of second-hand goods.\n- -Activity 5.5. Product-as-a-Service and other circular use- and result-oriented service models.\n\nThe analysis also assessed activities 4.1. Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions for leakage reduction (water) and 4.1. Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions (circular economy). However, these activities are not reported independently in the disclosure templates for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 Telef\u00f3nica's solutions are related to the description of the activities but are part of a broader group of solutions.",

These activities correspond to individual measures in the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThese activities are:\n\n- -Activity 6.5. Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.\n- -Activity 7.3. Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment.\n- -Activity 7.4. Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings.\n- -Activity 7.5. Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings.\n- -Activity 7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies.\n- -Activity 7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings.\n\nAmong the activities reported in the 2022 financial year as having the potential to make a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation were:\n\n- \u00b7 Activity 8.3. Programming and broadcasting activities.\n- \u00b7 Activity 13.3. Motion picture, video and television programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities.\n\nIn 2023, the conclusion reached after a more in-depth analysis of the audiovisual content identified in the 2022 Report was that content associated with the two activities is not eligible and therefore does not make a substantial contribution to the target of climate change adaptation. The content that could potentially be included in these activities does not primarily aim to increase the level of resilience to physical climate risks, contribute to adaptation efforts or substantially contribute to preventing or reducing the potential impacts of current and future climate risks regarding people, nature, cultural heritage, assets and other economic activities.\n\nFor this reason, no indicators associated with these two activities are reported for 2023, nor did we carry out the analysis of compliance with technical criteria or the DNSH principle.\n\nIn line with the above, and for comparability purposes, the 2022 figures have been restated considering additionally the inclusion of OI assets, the Incremental Group and the Be-Terna Group, and the update of Argentina's inflation adjustment.\n\n## 1.8.4.3. Proportion of turnover derived from Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned activities\n\nThis KPI shows the relative weight of turnover derived from products or services associated with economic activities covered by the Taxonomy over total turnover 4 . For the economic activities to be Taxonomyaligned, they must also meet the related technical screening criteria.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has analysed the various items included in its revenue model , enabling it to identify revenue items considered Taxonomy-eligible and then differentiate between those that comply with the technical screening criteria described in the previous section (Taxonomyaligned items) and those that are not covered by the Taxonomy.\n\nRevenues are classified, according to their nomenclature and codes in the tables, under the following headings:\n\n- \u00b7 A.1. Revenues from Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned activities (656 million euros): from digital services/solutions providing data and analysis that enable the reduction of GHG emissions associated with other activities (CCM 8.2.).\n- \u00b7 A.2. Revenues from Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomy-aligned activities (1,757 million euros): from cloud services made available to users via the Internet, facilitating the storage of user data in data centres (858 million euros) (CCM 8.1.); revenues from the maintenance and repair of customer equipment (21 million euros) (CE 5.1.), the sale of second-hand mobile handsets (32 million euros) (CE 5.4.), the rental of equipment necessary for the provision of services and the leasing of mobile handsets (829 million euros) (CE 5.5.); as well as the installation and maintenance of solar panels (17 million euros) (CCM 7.6.).\n- \u00b7 B. Revenues derived from Taxonomy non-eligible activities (38,239 million euros): from connectivity solutions provided through state-of-the-art 5 data transmission networks and other networks 6 and revenues from voice and television services, new handset sales and digital services/solutions that do not reduce GHG emissions associated with other activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the economic activities to be Taxonomyaligned, they must also meet the related technical screening criteria.\n\nThe denominator includes additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (equal to CapEx as defined in the financial information reported by the Group 8 ). The definition of CapEx associated with the Taxonomy also includes right-of-use additions recognised in accordance with IFRS 16, as well as additions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and right-of-use additions arising from business combinations.\n\nThe details are as follows:\n\nTable per environmental objective according to footnote (c)\n\n|                                                    | 2023   | 2022           |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|\n| Additions to tangible and  intangible fixed assets | 5,579  | 5,819          |\n| Additions of rights of use                         | 2,391  | 2,448          |\n| Additions due to business  combinations            | 12     | 795            |\n| Total CapEx associated with the  Taxonomy          |        | 7,982    9,062 |\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has analysed the various items in its CapEx model , enabling it to classify investments, in accordance with their nomenclature and codes in the tables, under the following headings:\n\n- \u00b7 A.1. Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned investments (44 million euros) : directly and exclusively related to digital services/solutions and some specific measures implemented to improve the energy efficiency of telecommunications networks (33 million euros) (CCM 8.2.), energy saving measures for equipment (8 million euros) (CCM 7.3.) and for buildings (3 million euros) (CCM 7.5.), as well as the installation of charging points for electric vehicles in buildings (0.04 million euros) (CCM 7.4.).\n\n- \u00b7 A.2. Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomy-aligned investments (739 million euros): associated with cloud services and storage of data in data centres (37 million euros) (CCM 8.1.), the maintenance and repair of customer equipment (1 million euros) (CE 5.1.), the purchase of equipment that is necessary for the provision of associated customer services (routers, settop boxes and B2B equipment) (633 million euros) (CE 5.5.), fleet management (6 million euros) (CCM 6.5.) and the acquisition and ownership of buildings (62 million euros) (CCM 7.7.).\n- \u00b7 B. Non-Taxonomy-eligible investments (7,200 million euros) : associated with next-generation data transmission networks 9 (access, infrastructure, transmission, core and capitalised expenditure related to labour) and other networks 10 , investments in TV content production, as well as other CapEx concepts (non-eligible right-of-use additions, systems, etc.).\n\nCapEx information is presented below, taking into account the templates per environmental objective (footnote c) and activity breakdown, in accordance with Annex V of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486.\n\n## Proportion of CapEx/Total CapEx\n\n|     | Taxonomy-aligned  per objective   | Taxonomy-eligible  per objective   |\n|-----|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| CCM | 0.5%                              | 1.9%                               |\n| CCA | 0.0%                              | 0.0%                               |\n| WTR | 0.0%                              | 0.0%                               |\n| CE  | 0.0%                              | 7.9%                               |\n| PPC | 0.0%                              | 0.0%                               |\n| BIO | 0.0%                              | 0.0%                               |",

Proportion of OpEx of Taxonomyeligible and Taxonomy-aligned activities\n\nThis indicator shows the proportion of operating expenditure (OpEx) corresponding to economic activities covered by the Taxonomy.\n\nThe denominator includes direct non-capitalised costs related to short-term leases, maintenance and repairs, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment assets that are necessary to ensure their continued and effective functioning.\n\nIn addition to the exercise carried out in 2022, with the entry into force of the new Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 in 2023, new accounting items have been identified as eligible, for both the numerator and the denominator, in relation to operational expenditure, corresponding to activity 5.1. of the circular economy target.\n\nExpenditure is classified, according to its nomenclature and codes in the tables, under the following headings:\n\n- \u00b7 A.1. Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned operational expenditure (0.2 million euros) : related to digital services/solutions aimed at providing data and analysis that reduce GHG emissions from other activities (CCM 8.2).\n- \u00b7 A.2. Taxonomy-eligible but non-Taxonomy-aligned operational expenditure (27 million euros): associated with the refurbishment, repair and maintenance of customer equipment (CE 5.1.).\n- \u00b7 B. Non-eligible operational expenditure (2,767 million euros).\n\nOpEx information is presented below, taking into account the templates per environmental objective (footnote c) and activity breakdown, in accordance with Annex V of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486.\n\nTable per environmental objective according to footnote (c)\n\n|     | Proportion of OpEx/Total OpEx   | Proportion of OpEx/Total OpEx    |\n|-----|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|     | Taxonomy-aligned  per objective | Taxonomy-eligible  per objective |\n| CCM | 0.01 %                          | 0.01 %                           |\n| CCA | 0 %                             | 0 %                              |\n| WTR | 0 %                             | 0 %                              |\n| CE  | 0 %                             | 1.0 %                            |\n| PPC | 0 %                             | 0 %                              |\n| BIO | 0 %                             | 0 %                              |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Compliance with the technical screening criteria\n\nFor each of the activities identified as eligible in relation to climate change mitigation targets, we have assessed the technical substantial contribution and 'do no significant harm' criteria. In addition, the Group's compliance with the social minimum safeguards has been verified.\n\nAs stated earlier, this analysis will not be applicable until 2024 for the four additional objectives contained in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486, as set out therein.\n\nThe main actions and measures taken by Telef\u00f3nica can be summarised as follows:\n\n## Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation of activity 8.1.\n\nFor data processing, hosting and related activities to qualify as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation, the following two main technical criteria must be fulfilled:\n\n- \u00b7 All relevant practices listed in the most recent version of the EU Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centres 11 are implemented and third-party assurance is given at least every three years.\n- \u00b7 Use of refrigerants in the data centre cooling systems of which global warming potential (GWP) do not exceed 675.\n\nIn 2023, after more than a year in development, the European Commission published the framework for assessing data centres in the context of activity 8.1. of the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Regulation. Once the audit criteria have been established, the Company will use that framework to explore how to carry out the alignment analysis for this activity.\n\n## Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation of activity 8.2.\n\nThe substantial contribution to climate change mitigation of data-driven solutions is associated with the fulfilment of the following technical screening criteria:\n\n- 1. ICT solutions are predominantly used for the provision of data and analytics enabling GHG emission reductions.\n- 2. Life cycle analysis demonstrates substantial GHG emission savings compared to the best performing alternative solution/technology, where an alternative solution/technology is already available on the market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe first technical criterion is demonstrated through a set of studies and methodologies that evaluate, identify and on occasion quantify the impacts on the climate of the digital solutions Telef\u00f3nica provides to its customers.\n\nNumerous industry studies have shown the emissions reductions that can be achieved by using digital solutions such as those mentioned above. Examples of studies include the GSMA's The Enablement Effect and the GeSI Mobile Carbon Impact, both of which provide information on the substantial contribution these ICT solutions make to avoided emissions.\n\nAnalysis carried out by Telef\u00f3nica included the following projects:\n\n## \u00b7 Avoided emissions methodology:\n\nTelef\u00f3nica analysed many of the connectivity and digital solutions it offers to both business and private customers that are associated with emissions reductions and quantified those reductions.\n\nIn order to address the technical screening criteria outlined in the Taxonomy, the solutions were grouped into the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Solutions for smart cities: Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to promote the efficient and sustainable management of cities in various areas, such as public transport, use of energy and water resources, public spaces and communication with residents.\n- \u00b7 Mobility solutions: IoT solutions designed for route planning and increasing the efficiency of different modes of transport. The connectivity Telef\u00f3nica provides to support the operation of these types of solution helps to increase the efficiency of fleet management, boost the speed of management and improve driver behaviour.\n- \u00b7 Industry 5.0 solutions: this category includes IoT connections that aim to quantify how using specific pieces of equipment within their operating limit affects their energy consumption and subsequently their emissions profile.\n- \u00b7 Smart working solutions: a set of services that enable people to work remotely and participate in audio/video conferencing and e-learning, etc., thereby reducing the amount of GHG emissions generated by travel.\n- \u00b7 Energy efficiency solutions: a set of services that include telemetry and remote management of energy consumption in offices, factories and corporate buildings with a wide geographical distribution, such as hotels, banks and supermarkets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustainable offering and innovation\n\nAlso in connection with the first technical screening criterion, we analysed and demonstrated the substantial contribution made by energy efficiency and virtualisation solutions that are applied to the telecommunications network.\n\n## \u00b7 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)\n\nThe second technical criterion , which is related to life cycle analysis, is not considered applicable to the categories of solutions described above, as there are no alternative solutions on the market. For example, the baseline scenario for all IoT solutions involves devices that are not connected, but no intermediate technology has been developed.\n\n## Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation of secondary activities\n\nAs mentioned previously, Telef\u00f3nica also undertakes a number of energy efficiency-related initiatives that contribute to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions generated by its own activity.\n\nThe following activities are considered Taxonomy-aligned:\n\n- - 7.3. Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment\n\nInitiatives mainly related to the modernisation of airconditioning and free-cooling systems in buildings. Telef\u00f3nica applies EER procurement criteria identifying minimum performance in line with its energy efficiency strategy. Equipment that meets the minimum criteria for high energy efficiency is considered Taxonomy-aligned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - 7.4. Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings\n\nThis activity is considered taxonomy-aligned according to the technical screening criteria for activity 7.4.\n\n- - 7.5. Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings\n\nImplementation of electronic devices to improve the energy management of buildings. this activity is considered to be aligned with the individual measures listed in activity 7.5.\n\n## Do No Significant Harm to climate change adaptation\n\nThis principle requires any physical climate risks associated with Telef\u00f3nica's operations to be identified and assessed under different climate scenarios. The aim is to identify and apply adaptation solutions that significantly reduce the material risks detected. Risk identification is carried out in accordance with the Group's risk management approach and tailored to the cause underlying the climate risk assessment. The probability of occurrence is estimated for each risk, along with the possible impact and economic value, to arrive at an expected level of exposure for each scenario analysed 12 .\n\nTo this end, Telef\u00f3nica assessed the physical climate change risks using climate projections covering both RCP 2.6 (a global temperature increase by the end of the century of no more than 2\u00baC) and RCP 8.5 (a global temperature increase by the end of the century of around 4\u00baC) climate scenarios and time horizons up to 2030, 2040 and 2050.\n\nIn addition, Telef\u00f3nica has developed an Adaptation Plan , which includes several lines of action aimed at protecting the Company's assets against any extreme weather event (e.g. extreme wind, fires or sea-level rises) to reduce its exposure to the material physical risks identified and to adapt to the consequences of climate change.\n\nThis analysis does not include Activity 7.6., as it is new to the exercise. In the coming years, Telef\u00f3nica will analyse the criteria corresponding to this principle and, if necessary, carry out its evaluation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2.

This consumption amounts to 2.8 million litres of water in 2023.\n\nThe Company has also adopted several measures in order to use water more efficiently, especially in areas of high water stress (717 megalitres in 2023).\n\nWater consumption at data centres occurs through a closed cooling system, so there are no discharges to freshwater streams or seawater that could cause harm or have a material adverse impact.\n\n## Do No Significant Harm to the transition to a circular economy\n\nNetwork infrastructure maintenance is the main source of waste for Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nWith regard to the management of waste at the end of the useful life of electrical and electronic equipment, Telef\u00f3nica maintains contractual agreements for the collection of waste and verifies that the waste manager is authorised and has adequate control over the waste. In addition, the appropriate documentation is in place to ensure compliance with the directives applicable to the equipment purchased and that are part of the Company's operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.3 Circular economy\n\nFor further information, see  2.4. Biodiversity, water and other environmental aspects\n\n## Do No Significant Harm to pollution prevention and control\n\nThe procurement of energy efficiency equipment is an activity that could potentially contain materials and components that could pose a risk of contamination.\n\nThis year, most of the purchases of this type of equipment have been related to air conditioning. For this reason, Telef\u00f3nica includes as a requirement, within the tender processes, that air conditioning equipment complies with the directives and regulations restricting the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, and those relating to the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemical substances and preparations, thus guaranteeing a high level of protection for the environment, the health and safety of employees and the Company.\n\nWith respect to the DNSH evaluation of the activity 7.3., Telef\u00f3nica has carried out a process in which it has evaluated the following aspects through confirmation by electrical and electronic equipment suppliers of the company environmental statements:\n\n- \u00b7 In line with the provisions of the REACH Regulation, the supplier declares that the products it supplies to Telef\u00f3nica do not exceed 0.1% by weight of any substance included in the list of substances of very high concern, as listed by the \"European Chemicals Agency\".\n- \u00b7 In line with the provisions of the RoHS directive, the supplier declares that the products it supplies to Telef\u00f3nica do not exceed the limits established in Annex II of the aforementioned directive.\n\nLikewise, for the specific case of the use of batteries and accumulators, and in line with the provisions of Directive 2006/66/EC and its update according to Directive 2013/56, the supplier declares that the products do not exceed the limits established by this Directive in terms of the following substances: mercury and cadmium.\n\nAlthough the DNSH criterion requires evaluating some additional aspects to those indicated above, Telef\u00f3nica considers that, with the evaluation of these aspects, it evaluates said DNSH criterion in a sufficiently significant manner.\n\n## Social minimum safeguards\n\nFor an economic activity to qualify as environmentally sustainable, it must be carried out in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Telef\u00f3nica's compliance was assessed in accordance with the Platform on Sustainable Finance's Report on Minimum Safeguards (the Platform Report) published in October 2022.\n\nIn addition, in 2023 and in line with the Commission Notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, progress has been made towards developing the Company's management approach to identifying, mitigating and remediating adverse human rights impacts.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Platform Report was prepared for the sole purpose of guiding the European Commission in its task of establishing formal criteria for assessing social issues. However, Telef\u00f3nica considered it good practice to anticipate potential future regulatory developments and analysed its alignment with social safeguards based on the four areas identified in the report: human rights, corruption, taxation and fair competition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also has competition, anti-corruption, responsible business, conflict of interest and fiscal responsibility policies and procedures in place, among others, to reinforce the Group's commitment to social rights and sustainable growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see chapter 2.14. Human rights\n\n- For further information, see chapter 2.16. Ethics and compliance\n\nFor further information, see chapter 2.17. Fiscal transparency\n\nBased on the issues addressed in the previous sections, Telef\u00f3nica is implementing everything necessary to comply with the three levels of technical screening criteria associated with the climate change mitigation and adaptation targets for activities reported by Telef\u00f3nica.\n\n## 1.8.6. The telecommunications networks in the Taxonomy\n\nThe application of the taxonomy regulatory framework has generated uncertainty and doubts of\n\ninterpretation in the market. This, despite the efforts of the European Commission to provide greater clarity on the application through complementary notices to the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn the ICT sector, the fundamental debate has focused around Activity 8.2 and whether or not telecommunications networks should be considered within its scope.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has been adapting its report in accordance with the evolution in interpretation. In December 2022, with the publication of the European Commission's draft of FAQ, the Company opted for an approach focused exclusively on the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation of some services that favour the reduction of GHG emissions such as digital solutions for energy efficiency, mobility or smart working, among others.\n\nPreviously, however, with the objective of showing what the impact of the Taxonomy report would have been\n\n15\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconsidering the telecommunications networks, the Company applied the technical criteria of activity 8.2. and carried out a life cycle analysis to measure the impact of connectivity services on both fixed and mobile networks 13 .\n\nThe study was carried out based on the ETSI ES 203 199 standard and its results were verified by an independent third party. The results of the analysis demonstrate the substantial contribution of next-generation connectivity solutions : fibre has an environmental impact 18 times less than copper and 4G/5G has an impact seven times less than 2G/3G (in terms of PB) .\n\n## Public positioning of the sector\n\nIn April 2023, ETNO published a sectoral positioning document 14 that reflects the difficulties of interpretation and implementation of the Taxonomy Regulation. The document also highlights the fundamental role of telecommunications networks in the decarbonization process of the global economy.\n\nIn December, ETNO and GSMA proposed a new taxonomic activity for telecommunications networks using the EU taxonomy stakeholder request mechanism created by the Sustainable Finance Platform. The objective is that the deployment and operations of the networks can be considered among the Taxonomy activities in the next delegated act.\n\nThe above would allow progress in achieving the targets of the 2030 Digital Decade . These objectives include, among others, Gigabit connectivity for all European homes, and that all populated areas are covered by high-speed wireless networks with performance, at less, equivalent to 5G technology.\n\nAchieving these targets will require substantial private and public sector investments . The European Commission estimates an investment gap of \u20ac174 billion in Europe's telecommunications infrastructure 15 .\n\nPromoting investment in sustainable networks and guaranteeing financial stability is crucial to foster competitive and innovative markets that offer broad coverage for all citizens.\n\nConsequently, the Taxonomy Regulation favours the interconnection between the green and the digital transition . It is a key tool to guide investment in telecommunications networks aligned with the EU's climate objectives, while increasing the attractiveness for capital markets to contribute to the achievement of the EU's digital goals by investing in secure and sustainable networks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The MSCI World index rose by +17.9% in euro terms. In the bond market, prices continued to fall for much of the year, with the ten-year US Treasury bond touching 5% yields, the highest since 2007, until the end of October when yields declined as the downward trend in inflation was confirmed, hence the pause in rate hikes.\n\nThe European telecommunications sector performed well in the first quarter of the year (+14.7% vs. Stoxx 600 +7.8%), but that advantage had ultimately faded relative to the market by year-end (+3.8% vs. Stoxx 600 +12.7%), despite continued positive statements from companies, which led to a 40% improvement in annual forecasts in the third quarter. This presents a positive scenario for the telecommunications sector for 2024, with an above-market outlook for cash flow growth, supported by sustainable revenue growth and a reduction in operating costs and CapEx, which has passed its peak, resulting in aboveinflation cash generation growth. Moreover, telcos have modest refinancing needs, with debt mostly at fixed rates, strengthening the sector's defensive qualities. There is also optimism surrounding consolidation movements in Europe and the opportunities for aspects such as artificial intelligence (AI) to improve returns.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica continued its transformation process in 2023, which allowed it to present a more ambitious Company plan for the next three years, based on growth, profitability and sustainability, alongside a strict capital allocation, to create significant value for shareholders. In 2023, results were solid, hitting all announced targets. This was enhanced by the results in the first half of the year, which saw growing revenues and OIBDA, and decreasing capital intensity compared to the previous year. Telef\u00f3nica ended the 2023 financial year with a market capitalisation of \u20ac20.3 billion, with a price per share of \u20ac3.53, up 4.4% in the year, and a total shareholder return of 13.0%, above the 8.9% average for the sector.\n\nRegarding the dividend payment, \u20ac0.30 per share was paid in 2023 (\u20ac0.15 per share in June and \u20ac0.15 per share in December, both in cash). The 2023 shareholder remuneration policy provides for a dividend of \u20ac0.30 per share in cash (\u20ac0.15 per share paid in December 2023 and \u20ac0.15 per share to be paid in June 2024). The 2023 dividend yield stood at 8.5%. In addition, in April 2023, 24.8 million treasury shares were redeemed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.9.4. Moving towards a more sustainable world GRI 2-6\n\nFor Telef\u00f3nica, sustainability means thinking about society and the planet and orienting the business to be part of the solution to the challenges facing humanity. We must go beyond our responsibility and be an exemplary company trusted by customers, employees, investors, suppliers, governments and society in general.\n\n## 1.9.4.1. Networks: our connectivity\n\nWe believe that it is our duty to take advantage of the capabilities of connectivity and digitalisation , not only to bring value to our customers, but also to help tackle major challenges such as climate change, inequality, employability and misinformation.\n\nThis is how we will achieve our purpose: to make our world more human by connecting lives and to be more competitive and impactful.\n\nThat is why we are expanding our telecommunications infrastructure and developing new technologies to bring connectivity and digital services to all:\n\n- \u00b7 We connect the unconnected or those with limited connectivity; we bring our services to all regions, including rural and hard-to-reach areas, via projects such as Internet for All and via innovative agreements and business models.\n\nWe have set a target of exceeding 90% rural mobile connectivity levels in our main markets by 2024. In 2023 we achieved 82% in Brazil, 95% in Spain and 99% in Germany.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 2.12. Digital inclusion\n\nWe improve and expand broadband coverage with the latest technologies to ensure that the whole of society can benefit from digitalisation.\n\nWe have 92% 4G coverage globally, and we have switched on 5G technology in our main markets: Spain, Brazil, Germany and the UK. 5G is a revolution because of its practical applications for all sectors and because it allows us to extend ultra-broadband coverage. In addition, 5G is more efficient, up to 90% more efficient than 4G per unit of traffic.",

Building a greener future\n\nWe want to take advantage of the power of digitalisation to curb climate change. We aim to minimise our footprint as much as possible and help maintain the fragile environmental balance, as we all depend on it. For this purpose, in network design, operation, maintenance and decommissioning:\n\n- \u00b7 We pay special attention to legislation in areas such as waste management , efficient use of resources, respect for the landscape and measurement of electromagnetic fields.\n\nIn 2023, we generated 45,756 tonnes of waste, of which we managed to recycle 97% of this. Of the total electronic equipment we collected, we reused over 46% and recycled around 54%. In addition, we refurbished over 4.5 million pieces of operational, office and customer equipment, thereby avoiding the emission of almost 366,000 tonnes of CO 2 associated with the manufacture of new products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 2.3. Circular economy\n\nWe share facilities with other operators or companies managing communications towers. This results in reduced visual impact, optimised land use and decreased energy consumption, as well as less waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 We promote energy efficiency and use renewable energy to reduce CO\u2082 emissions as part of our strategy to be part of the solution to climate change. Our target is to achieve net zero carbon emission by 2040, including our value chain.\n\nSome 84% of the total electricity consumption in own facilities across the Group comes from renewable sources, with 100% in our main markets and Chile and Peru. In addition, we have reduced our carbon emissions (Scopes 1+2+3) by 51% (Scope 1+2) compared to base year.\n\n- \u00b7 On the other hand, we develop connectivity and Eco Smart services that help our customers reduce their impact on the environment. By 2023, thanks to the use of these services, we helped customers avoid the emission of 86.1 million tonnes of CO 2 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2. Energy and climate change\n\n- \u00b7 We shut down old networks so that they no longer consume energy and we recycle all materials arising from decommissioning.\n\n|                                                     | Base year:  2015   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Energy consumption per traffic  unit (MWh/PB)       | 386                | 49     | 41     |\n| % Evolution of energy efficiency  (base year: 2015) | -                  | (87)%  | (89)%  |\n\n- \u00b7 We respect biodiversity, applying precautionary measures during construction, locating base stations outside protected areas whenever possible and implementing corrective measures when necessary.\n- \u00b7 We use water efficiently, adopting a range of measures to optimise consumption, especially in waterstressed regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.4. Biodiversity, water and other environmental aspects\n\nTo control our footprint, ensure compliance with environmental legislation and prevent risks, we have an Environmental Management System that allows us to ensure comprehensive standards in all countries, with standardised processes and indicators to ensure stringent monitoring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.1.

We seek to align internal behaviours, processes and targets with the Company's purpose and values. Our guiding principle is to ensure consistency between what we say and what we do, so that this shared vision extends from our employees to our customers and from our customers to society as a whole.\n\n## Our contribution and impact on communities\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the most ambitious program in history aimed at addressing the major social and environmental challenges facing humanity.\n\nThe Internet and digital solutions are key to achieving more than half of the SDG targets. At Telef\u00f3nica, we have picked up the baton and are committed to the 2030 Agenda.\n\nWe have been measuring our social and environmental contribution every year for years, and since 2019, we have been doing so following the guidelines of Harvard Business School (HBS), the Value Balancing Alliance (VBA), the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the Capitals Coalition, and have produced a Socioeconomic Contribution Report. We incorporate the results into our management and decision-making in order to continue improving. Our most recent study shows that we contribute over \u20ac100 billion to communities.\n\nIn addition, sustainable financing helps us to continue to support the SDGs through projects that have a social and environmental impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.13. Contribution and impact on communities\n\n## Value chain GRI 204-1\n\nOur Responsible Business Principles define our management model and apply to our entire value chain. In particular, they govern our relationship with suppliers, customers and employees in order to build lasting bonds based on trust.\n\nWe have a shared commitment to innovation and sustainability with our suppliers :\n\n- \u00b7 We identify ethics and corruption risks through Dow Jones Risk & Compliance. 100% of our suppliers are assessed.\n- \u00b7 We ask suppliers to assess themselves on the IntegrityNext platform (used by leading telecommunications companies). In 2023, 72% of our high-risk suppliers were assessed in terms of their sustainability.\n- \u00b7 We conduct audits at the facilities and/or factories of critical suppliers. In 2023 we conducted 18,324 administrative or on-site audits.\n- \u00b7 We help suppliers to improve through training and the monitoring of specific plans. 853 suppliers had improvement plans in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business overview\n\n## 1.10.1. Highlights\n\nIn 2023, Telef\u00f3nica delivered a good operational performance. Telef\u00f3nica maintained a strong market position, growing in high-value accesses such as fiber and mobile contract. We have grown in reported revenue y-oy with lower churn compared to 2022. Investments in next generation networks, like Fiber, 4G and 5G, have allowed Telef\u00f3nica to maintain and grow its customer base in terms of accesses, and decrease churn, by offering customers a better experience. In addition, Telef\u00f3nica has driven efficiencies to reduce OpEx by switching from copper to fiber broadband networks and switching off certain legacy technologies, network sharing, reducing energy costs through hedging agreements and rightsizing the organization.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's total accesses were 387.8 million as of December 31, 2023, increasing 1.2% year-on-year.

Organic variations should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to reported variations.\n\nFor purposes of this report, 2023/2022 organic variation is defined as the reported variation as adjusted to exclude the impacts detailed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange effects: we have excluded the impact of changes in exchange rates (except for countries with hyperinflationary economies: Argentina and Venezuela) by assuming constant average foreign exchange rates year-on-year (using average foreign exchange rates of 2022 for both years).\n\nForeign exchange rates had a minor positive impact on our reported 2023 results.\n\nForeign exchange effects increased revenue growth by 0.2 percentage points, without impact on OIBDA growth and operating income growth in 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 Gains or losses on the sale of companies : the gains obtained or losses incurred from the sale of companies have been excluded to calculate organic variations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In reported terms, in 2023 the revenues, OIBDA, operating income and OIBDACapEx of these companies decreased by 809, 193, 37 and 201 million euros, respectively, compared to 2022.\n- \u00b7 Impairment of goodwill and other assets: in 2023 the impairment of goodwill amounted to 58 million euros, in Telef\u00f3nica Ecuador. In 2022 the impairment of assets amounted to 77 million euros, in Telef\u00f3nica Argentina.\n- \u00b7 Spectrum acquisition: the organic variation of capital expenditures (\"CapEx\") excludes the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2023 and 2022.\n\nIn 2023, spectrum acquisitions amounted to 183 million euros of which 109 million euros corresponded to Telef\u00f3nica Argentina, 24 million euros to Telef\u00f3nica Uruguay, 20 million to Telef\u00f3nica Spain, 18 million to Telef\u00f3nica Ecuador and 12 million to Telef\u00f3nica Brasil.\n\nIn 2022, spectrum acquisitions amounted to 173 million euros of which 125 million euros corresponded to Telef\u00f3nica Colombia, 35 million euros to Telef\u00f3nica Brazil, 8 million euros to Telef\u00f3nica Argentina and 5 million euros to Telef\u00f3nica Uruguay.\n\n- \u00b7 Other adjustments: organic variations exclude the following:\n\nIn 2023: (i) the provisions recorded in Telef\u00f3nica Spain to optimize the distribution network (60 million euros in OIBDA); ii)  provisions related to regulatory contingencies (75 million euros in OIBDA).\n\nIn 2022: (i) the impact of the accelerated amortization related to the transformation of the operating model of Telef\u00f3nica M\u00e9xico (following the AT&T agreement entered into in 2019) amounting to 24 million euros in amortization and operating income amounting to 24 million euros; and other adjustments amounting to 6 million euros.\n\nThe table below shows 2023/2022 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in accordance with the adjustments referred to above) of certain line items of the consolidated income statement and CapEx and OIBDA-CapEx:\n\n|                               | YoY variation   | YoY variation   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| TELEF\u00d3NICA 2023               | % Reported      | % Organic       |\n| Revenues                      | 1.6%            | 3.7%            |\n| Other income                  | (25.4%)         | (16.0%)         |\n| Supplies                      | 2.8%            | 4.6%            |\n| Personnel expenses            | 30.5%           | 7.1%            |\n| Other expenses                | (4.1%)          | (1.9%)          |\n| OIBDA                         | (11.4%)         | 3.1%            |\n| Depreciation and amortization | 0.0%            | (0.3%)          |\n| Operating income              | (36.1%)         | 11.3%           |\n| CapEx                         | (4.1%)          | (2.9%)          |\n| OIBDA-CapEx                   | (17.4%)         | 8.0%            |\n\nThe table below shows the contribution to reported growth of each item considered to calculate the organic variations, as explained above. For each line item, the contribution to reported growth, expressed in percentage points, is the result of dividing the amount of the impact of each such item (on a net basis when the impact affects both years) by the consolidated reported figure for the previous year.",

Analysis of results\n\nRevenues in 2023 totaled 40,652 million euros, increasing 1.6% year-on-year in reported terms, despite the reported variation of the operators in countries with hyperinflationary economies (-2.0 p.p.). In organic terms, revenues grew by 3.7%, thanks to the positive growth in service revenues (+3.7%), and handset sales (+3.2%).\n\nOther income mainly includes capitalized costs on fixed assets, gains on disposals and other operating income. In 2023, other income totaled 1,541 million euros compared to 2,065 million euros recorded in 2022, a decrease of 25.4%. The higher amount in 2022 was impacted by the capital gains resulting from the sale of fiber optic assets in Colombia (162 million euros). In organic terms, other revenues fell by 16.0%.\n\nThe evolution of expenses is explained below:\n\n- \u00b7 Supplies amounted to 13,298 million euros in 2023, up 2.8% year-on-year in reported terms compared to 2022, as a result of the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates (+0.4 p.p.), in spite of the variation of the companies in countries with hyperinflationary economies (-1.5 p.p.). In organic terms, supplies increased by 4.6% year-on-year, mainly due to higher handset costs due to higher commercial activity with a higher number of gross adds and continued inflation rates.\n- \u00b7 Personnel expenses amounted to 7,207 million euros in 2023, up by 30.5% year-on-year in reported terms compared to 2022, mainly as a result of higher restructuring costs (+24.6 p.p.) which relate mainly to the Collective Redundancies Plan adopted by certain companies in Telef\u00f3nica Spain in 2023 resulting in a provision of 1,320 million euros, before taxes, partially offset by the variation of the companies in countries\n\nwith hyperinflationary economies (-2.8 p.p.).  In organic terms, personnel expenses grew 7.1% year-on- year due to higher costs in all segments.\n\nThe average headcount was 104,124 employees in 2023, up 1.5% compared to 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 Other expenses amounted to 10,298 million euros in 2023, down 4.1% year-on-year in reported terms. This decrease was mainly attributable to the variation of the companies in countries with hyperinflationary economies (-2.6 p.p.), negatively impacted by a provision related to regulatory contingencies (+0.7 p.p.). In organic terms, other expenses decreased by 1.9% year-on-year due to lower expenses in Telef\u00f3nica Spain, as a result of lower energy costs as well as savings associated with higher efficiencies, mainly related to network and system costs, and Telef\u00f3nica Brazil due to the acquisition price adjustment recorded in connection with Oi's assets and cost efficiencies due to digitalization.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, OIBDA totaled 11,390 million euros in 2023, compared to 12,852 million euros in 2022, decreasing by 11.4%. The year-on-year evolution was strongly impacted by the total restructuring expenses in 2023 of 1,538 million euros (-10,6 p.p.), which relate mainly to the Collective Redundancies Plan adopted by certain companies in Telef\u00f3nica Spain in 2023 (1,320 million euros, before taxes) and the variation of the companies in countries with hyperinflationary economies (-1.5 p.p.), the decrease in capital gains recorded in 'Other income' in 2022 (-1.4 p.p.). In organic terms, OIBDA grew 3.1% yearon-year due to higher revenues.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It remained stable compared to 2022. In organic terms, as explained above, considering 50% of the results of VMO2, amortizations would decrease by 0.3 year-on-year.\n\nOperating income for 2023 totaled 2,593 million euros compared to 4,056 million euros recorded in 2022, strongly impacted by the total restructuring expenses in 2023 (-33.5 p.p.), which relate mainly to the Collective Redundancies Plan adopted by certain companies in Telef\u00f3nica Spain in 2023 (resulting in a provision of 1,320 million euros, before taxes) and the decrease in capital gains on the sale of businesses compared to 2022 (-4.3 p.p.). In organic terms, operating income grew by 11.3% year-on-year due to the revenue growth in all segments.\n\nThe share of (loss) income of investments accounted for by the equity method in 2023 was a loss of 2,162 million euros, compared to an income of 217 million euros in 2022, mainly due to the results of VMO2, which were adversely affected by a goodwill impairment amounting to 3,572 million euros (1,786 million euros of which is reflected in the consolidated income statement of the Telef\u00f3nica Group), mainly due to the decrease in projected cash flows of VMO2 as a consequence of the effects of the macroeconomic conditions and competitive environment in the United Kingdom and the increase in the discount rate (WACC).\n\nNet financial expense amounted to 1,904 million euros in 2023, increasing 591 million euros compared to 2022. The lower amount in 2022 was mainly due to extraordinary income of 526 million euros related to payments by the Spanish administration to the Group of delayed interest in connection with tax litigation in Spain.\n\nCorporate income tax represents an income of 899 million euros in 2023 compared to an expense of 641 million euros in 2022, mainly due to the tax effect of the provision associated with the Collective Redundancies Plan and the recognition of deferred tax assets for the future use of tax credits, both in Spain.\n\nAs a result, losses for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent in 2023 was 892 million euros, compared to 2,011 million euros in 2022.\n\nProfit attributable to non-controlling interests was 318 million euros in 2023 (308 million euros in 2022). The variation is mainly due to an increase in profit attributable to non-controlling interests in Brazil, partially offset by a decrease in profit attributable to non-controlling interests in Colombia.\n\nCapEx totaled 5,579 million euros in 2023, down 4.1% year-on-year in reported terms, impacted by lower spectrum purchases in 2023 (-1.6 p.p.). In organic terms, Capex decreased  by 3.0% year-on-year.\n\nOIBDA-CapEx stood at 5,811 million euros in 2023, decreasing by 17.4% year-on-year in reported terms, strongly affected by  restructuring expenses (-19.3 p.p.), which relate mainly to the Collective Redundancies Plan adopted by certain companies in Telef\u00f3nica Spain in 2023 (resulting in a provision of 1,320 million euros before taxes), the variation of the companies in countries with hyperinflationary economies (-2.9 p.p.) and the decrease in capital gains on the sale of businesses compared to 2022 (-2.5 p.p.), partially offset by lower  spectrum purchase (+1.3 p.p.). In organic terms, OIBDA-CapEx grew by 8.0% year-on-year.",

In January 2023, Telef\u00f3nica Spain made all customers' data plans unlimited (except for prepaid plans), eliminating all out-of-bundle excess data charges, allowing users to continue to navigate the Internet (at reduced speeds) after crossing specified usage thresholds.\n\nIn addition to unlimited voice and data, Movistar now offers Movistar Cloud, an unlimited cloud storage service available to all mobile customers, allowing customers to save all files, photos, videos and documents in a single place or consult them from the application included in the Movistar Plus+ decoder. In addition, Movistar's offering also now includes an integrated Secure Connection service, allowing users to navigate securely on mobile devices and on the home Wi-Fi network.\n\nWith these new features, customers can choose the products and services they need, with the confidence of having best-in-class connectivity and unlimited mobile navigation, supported by best-in-class experience in quality navigation and by broad 5G coverage, which as of December 2023 reached 87.0% of the population in Spain.\n\nAdditionally, Movistar continues to expand its offering aimed at making the lives of its customers easier, aspiring to become a comprehensive provider of services for the home and people. In May 2023, the TeCuida smartwatch\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwas presented, a new telecare device and service for people over 60 years and people with a low degree of dependency that detects falls, inside and outside the home. It also assists users in emergency situations, anywhere, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, locating the person, notifying their contacts  and arranging for any needed assistance.\n\nIn August 2023, Movistar Plus+ was launched, a reinforced new OTT TV service that replaces Movistar Plus Lite. The streaming service is available regardless of the customer's TV or Internet provider.\n\nThe service includes: one movie premiere per day, the main sports events, original and international series, documentaries, and entertainment programs, as well as one game of \"LaLiga\" and of the Champions League per match day.\n\nIn addition, as part of its commitment to sustainability, Movistar has developed an online platform and tools to support the Ecomar Foundation in raising awareness among young people about caring for the seas and waste management problems.\n\nAdditionally, Movistar Prosegur Alarmas, the joint venture of Prosegur and Telef\u00f3nica Spain, reached 487 thousand customers as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 9.7% as compared to December 31, 2022.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica Spain had 41.0 million accesses as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 1.2% as compared to",

This trend was supported by the evolution of revenues excluding mobile handset sales, which grew 1.6% year-on-year and is described below. This growth was partially offset by the 5.4% y-o-y decline in mobile handset revenues driven by higher volumes achieved during 2022 as a result of including the possibility to add devices in the convergent portfolio (beginning in February 2022 for the total convergent customer base) that boosted these revenues at the beginning of the initiative.\n\n- \u00b7 Retail revenues totaled 9,872 million euros in 2023, increasing by 2.2% year-on-year, due in part to the recovery of the retail commercial activity and higher IT revenues as a result of higher demand for digitalization projects in the B2B segment.\n- \u00b7 Wholesale and other revenues totaled 2,264 million euros in 2023, decreasing by 1.0% year-on-year, due mainly to the decrease in fixed traffic revenues, mobile interconnection revenues due to lower mobile termination rates, and the impact of less \"LaLiga\" (Spanish football league) content available in the wholesale offer after mid-August 2022 (after a competitor obtained a portion of the broadcasting rights for the 2022/2023 season), partially offset by the growth of roaming-in revenues and the growth of revenues from MVNOs.\n\nThe evolution of expenses is explained below:\n\n- \u00b7 Supplies amounted to 5,027 million euros in 2023, up 0.4% year-on-year compared to 2022, mainly attributable to the increase in costs related to IT revenue growth.\n- \u00b7 Personnel expenses amounted to 3,194 million euros in 2023, up 81.0% year-on-year compared to 2022. The year-on-year evolution was mainly attributable to the\n\nCollective Redundancies Plan adopted by certain companies in Telef\u00f3nica Spain in 2023 (resulting in a provision of 1,320 million euros before taxes) In organic terms, personnel expenses increased by 9.7% due to the wage increase driven by inflation.\n\n- \u00b7 Other expenses amounted to 1,730 million euros in 2023, down 10.8% year-on-year compared to 2022. In organic terms, other expenses decreased by 13.9% due mainly to lower  energy costs as well as savings associated to higher efficiencies.\n\nOIBDA reached 3,229 million euros in 2023, a year-onyear decrease of 29.6%, (-0.8% year-on-year in organic terms).\n\nDepreciation and amortization amounted to 2,200 million euros in 2023, increasing by 2.1% year-on-year both in reported and organic terms, mainly explained by growth of the amortizable base of rights of use.\n\nOperating income amounted to 1,029 million euros in 2023, a year-on-year decrease of 57.7% in reported terms. The year-on-year increase was mainly driven by the Collective Redundancies Plan adopted by certain companies in Telef\u00f3nica Spain in 2023, resulting in a provision of 1,320 million euros, before taxes, in 2023 (-51.9 p.p.), as well as  the provisions recorded in Telef\u00f3nica Spain to optimize the distribution network (-2.5 p.p.). Excluding these impacts, the decrease is 3.2%. The organic variation was impacted by higher personnel and IT costs related to the IT revenue growth and the higher inflation rate in the period, partially offset by higher service revenues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, the VMO2 segment information included in this section is presented using management criteria and shows 100% of VMO2's results; Telef\u00f3nica's actual percentage ownership of VMO2 is 50%.\n\nIn 2023, VMO2 recorded an impairment of goodwill amounting to 3,572 million euros, with an impact of 1,786 million euros on the share of (loss) income of investments accounted for by the equity method in the consolidated income statement of the Telef\u00f3nica Group. The impairment is related to an increase in VMO2's weighted average cost of capital and the impacts of the macroeconomic conditions and the competitive environment in the United Kingdom on estimated future cash flows of VMO2.\n\nMore than two years after the formation of VMO2, the company continues to integrate and innovate while investing heavily to expand and upgrade its fiber and 5G networks to provide the highest quality connectivity to more regions of the country, all in a context of economic headwinds due to adverse macroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom.\n\nVMO2's gigabit fixed network footprint reached the milestone of 17 million premises at the end of 2023. The company rolled its fiber out faster than ever before, delivering 833,100 additional premises serviceable in the\n\nyear, with the majority of these premises forming part of the FTTH network of nexfibre, a joint venture among T. Infra, Liberty Global and InfraVia (for additional information on this joint venture, see \"Item 10. Additional Information-Material Contracts-Agreement reached by T. Infra, Liberty Global and InfraVia for the establishment of a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) joint venture in the United Kingdom\").\n\nAcross 2023, through a mix of the continued upgrade of VMO2's own network and expansion of the nexfibre network, the company expanded its fiber footprint by 1.7 million premises, bringing its total fiber reach to over 4 million homes.\n\nIn its mobile business, VMO2 reached the target of 50% UK outdoor 5G population coverage, and there is a commitment to meet the UK government's stated target of providing 5G standalone coverage in all populated areas of the United Kingdom by 2030. Additionally, the company improved network reliability by boosting 4G capacity in 465,000 postcodes during 2023 and delivered its one hundredth site as part of the Shared Rural Network program, a collaborative effort among the UK's major network operators and the government.\n\nCompany integration continued to advance with the migration of more than 3 million Virgin Mobile customers to O2 in November 2023 and further mobile backhaul integration utilizing the company's own fixed network.\n\nThe following table shows the evolution of accesses in VMO2 in 2023 compared to 2022:\n\n## ACCESSES\n\n| Thousands of accesses         | 2022     | 2023     | %Reported  YoY   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|------------------|\n| Fixed telephony accesses  (1) | 4,239.7  | 3,876.5  | (8.6%)           |\n| Broadband                     | 5,661.6  | 5,724.7  | 1.1%             |\n| UBB                           | 5,653.8  | 5,717.6  | 1.1%             |\n| Mobile accesses               | 33,831.3 | 35,216.3 | 4.1%             |\n| Prepay                        | 7,968.3  | 7,617.9  | (4.4%)           |\n| Contract                      | 16,087.6 | 16,122.3 | 0.2%             |\n| IoT                           | 9,775.5  | 11,476.1 | 17.4%            |\n| Pay TV                        | 3,194.1  | 3,146.9  | (1.5%)           |\n| Retail Accesses               | 46,926.8 | 47,964.4 | 2.2%             |\n| Wholesale Accesses            | 10,818.6 | 9,644.9  | (10.8%)          |\n| Total Accesses                | 57,745.4 | 57,609.3 | (0.2%)           |\n\nThe total accesses base decreased 0.2% year-on-year and stood at 57.6 million as of December 31, 2023, mainly driven by the decrease in wholesale caused by the migration of customers from one of the business's smaller MVNO partners to BT (completed in the second half of 2023), partially offset by the increase in the mobile\n\naccesses base, which grew 4.1% year-on-year and reached 35.2 million accesses supported by growth in contract and IoT accesses.",

In organic terms, revenues grew 5.2% year-on-year, mainly due to the nexfibre revenues contribution (where VMO2 is the anchor wholesale tenant) and the price increases implemented by VMO2, partially offset by the pound sterling depreciation (-2.1 p.p.) and the lower customer base.\n\n- \u00b7 Mobile business revenues amounted to 6,840 million euros in the year 2023, declining by 1.4% in reported terms due to due to the pound sterling depreciation (-2.0 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-on-year growth was 0.6%, as price increase was partially offset by the decrease in handset revenues (where there were deteriorating margins).\n- \u00b7 Fixed business revenues amounted to 4,453 million euros in the year 2023, decreasing by 4.0% in reported terms impacted by the pound sterling depreciation (-2.0 p.p.). In organic terms, decreasing by 2.3% yearon-year, mainly due to reduced customer spend (driven by the increased cost of living), partially offset by the price increases implemented by VMO2. Moreover, B2B fixed revenue decreased due to lower prices offered upon customer contract renewals and customer shifts to lower-cost products and services.\n\n- \u00b7 Other revenues amounted to 1,254 million euros in the year 2023, a 117.0% increase in reported terms in spite of the pound sterling depreciation (-4.4 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-on-year growth was 120.0% mainly from construction, network and other revenues services provided to nexfibre, the FTTH joint venture formed by Telef\u00f3nica Infra, Liberty Global and InfraVia.\n\nThe evolution of expenses is explained below:\n\n- \u00b7 Supplies amounted to 4,294 million euros in 2023, up 6.8% year-on-year in reported terms compared to 2022 due to the depreciation of the pound sterling (-2.2 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-on-year growth was 9.0% driven by nexfibre growth offset in part by synergies realization, cost efficiencies and lower handset sales purchases.\n- \u00b7 Personnel expenses amounted to 1,303 million euros in 2023, down 3.3% year-on-year in reported terms compared to 2022 due to the depreciation of the pound sterling  (-2.0 p.p.), negatively impacted by restructuring adjustments (+6.1 p.p.). In organic terms, the year-onyear decline was 7.9% positively impacted by the realization of synergies through the execution of restructuring plans aiming to deliver a single operating model and a leaner company.\n- \u00b7 Other expenses amounted to 3,035 million euros in 2023, up 3.3% year-on-year in reported terms compared to 2022 driven by higher integration costs",

The expansion of the roaming agreement followed the 1&1 Group's disclosure on August 2, 2023 that it will switch its host network operator in Germany from Telef\u00f3nica Germany to Vodafone in the second half of 2024, under a long-term, exclusive national roaming partnership with Vodafone Group. This exclusivity arrangement includes the non-discriminatory provision of national roaming services in areas not yet covered by the new 1&1 mobile network and in particular includes access to the 5G network of Vodafone Group, including mobile communication standards 2G and 4G and future mobile communication standards and technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe agreement between the 1&1 Group and Vodafone will limit future network sharing opportunities with 1&1.\n\nThe total access base increased 1.9% year-on-year and stood at 49.8 million on December 31, 2023, mainly driven by a 1.7% increase in the mobile accesses base, which reached 45.1 million.\n\nThe contract mobile customer base grew 5.1% yearon-year and reached 27.7 million accesses, increasing the share over the total mobile accesses base to 61.4%. Net adds reached 1.4 million accesses driven by own brand gross adds momentum in combination with low churn levels. Churn rates remained at low levels based on the high network and service quality combination.\n\nThe prepay mobile customer base decreased 4.6% year-on-year to 15.5 million accesses, reflecting the German market trend of prepaid to postpaid migration. There was a net loss of 0.7 million prepay customers in 2023.\n\nBroadband accesses reached 2.4 million accesses (up 3.9% y-o-y) with a net add of 90 thousand accesses in 2023, mainly driven by the good performance of 'O2 myHome' tariff, continued VDSL demand and a low level of churn.

This reflects the sustained mobile service revenue momentum on the back of the ongoing strong commercial traction of the O2 brand and a solid contribution from partner brands selling O2 services.\n- \u00b7 Handset revenues (which are included in mobile business revenues) amounted to 1,872 million euros, increasing 13.3% year-on-year in reported terms due to high demand for accessories and high value devices\n\nsupported by the 'O2 myHandy' (monthly-installment financing model).\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed business revenues were 827 million euros, increasing 2.7% y-o-y in reported terms due to the good performance of 'O2 myHome' tariff, and the increasing demand of fiber and cable technologies.\n\nMobile ARPU was 10.8 euros (+6.5% y-o-y) in reported terms due to the 15.3% year-on-year increase in prepay ARPU, offset in part by the 0.1% y-o-y decrease in contract ARPU. Data ARPU was 7.4 euros (+9.2% y-o-y), supported by the successful 'O2 Mobile' portfolio.\n\n| TELEF\u00d3NICA GERMANY   |   2022 |   2023 | % Reported YoY   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|------------------|\n| ARPU (EUR)           |   10.1 |   10.8 | 6.5%             |\n| Prepay               |    6.7 |    7.8 | 15.3%            |\n| Contract  (1)        |   13.3 |   13.2 | (0.1%)           |\n| Data ARPU (EUR)      |    6.7 |    7.4 | 9.2%             |\n\nThe evolution of expenses is explained below:\n\n- \u00b7 Supplies amounted to 2,677 million euros in 2023, increasing 6.1% year-on-year in reported and organic terms, mainly attributable to higher handset cost of sales partially offset by positive effects from cuts in the MTR (Mobile Termination Rate) fees paid to other operators.\n- \u00b7 Personnel expenses amounted to 669 million euros in 2023, increasing 7.6% year-on-year in reported terms, partially offset by lower restructuring costs in 2023 compared to 2022 (-0.6 p.p.). In organic terms, personnel expenses increased 8.2% year-on-year reflecting the staff and wage increases in 2023, which were intended to support Telef\u00f3nica Germany's transformation and growth plans.\n- \u00b7 Other expenses amounted to 2,788 million euros in 2023, increasing 4.3% year-on-year in reported terms compared to 2022, partially offset by lower restructuring costs in 2023 compared to 2022 (-0.1 p.p.). In organic terms, other expenses increased 4.4% year-on-year, reflecting commercial costs, higher energy costs and higher technology costs required for the digital transformation of the company.\n\nOIBDA totaled 2,640 million euros in 2023, increasing by 3.2% year-on-year in reported terms. In organic terms, OIBDA increased by 3.0% year-on-year, due to higher revenues.\n\nDepreciation and amortization amounted to 2,323 million euros in 2023, increasing by 1.2% year-on-year both in reported and organic terms mainly due to higher amortization of rights-of-use assets.\n\nOperating income totaled 317 million euros in 2023, increasing 20.8% year on year in reported terms. In organic terms, increase 17.6%, due good performance in both fixed and mobile businesses, own brand momentum, and further efficiency gains.",

Telef\u00f3nica Brazil's strategy remains focused on strengthening its high-value customer base, and it reached a contract market share (excluding IoT accesses) of 43.4%, as of December 31, 2023, according to ANATEL.\n\nIn the fixed business, Telef\u00f3nica Brazil continued with the implementation of strategic technologies, focusing on the deployment of fiber and IPTV, centering its commercial offer around Vivo Total and maintaining low churn rates.\n\nIn addition, Telef\u00f3nica Brazil continued to advance in the development of an ecosystem with relevant partners to promote its consolidation as a digital services hub. The value proposition it offers is strengthened with a broad portfolio of services, highlighting those described below:\n\n- -Vida V - Health & Wellness, in March 2023, Telef\u00f3nica Brazil announced the acquisition of Vale Sa\u00fade Semper, expanding its presence in digital health services. Vale Sa\u00fade Semper is a startup that acts as a health services marketplace, connecting more than 70 thousand customers with more than 5 thousand clinics and laboratories throughout Brazil. This service is obtained with a monthly subscription.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Viva E - Education: commercially launched in March 2023,  this platform provides digital courses focused on lifelong learning and employability. The platform is owned and operated by a joint venture created by Telef\u00f3nica Brazil and \u00c2nima Educa\u00e7\u00e3o offers more than 400 hours of content.\n- -Vivo Ventures (an investment fund that focuses on startups) made its first two investments in the financial platforms Klavi and Klubi. Continuing with its expansion strategy in the sector, in June 2023 Vivo Ventures announced its third investment, in Digibee, an iPaaS service integration platform. Moreover, Vivo Ventures has agreed to invest 25 million Brazilian reais in Conexa Health LLC, Latin America's largest independent telemedicine platform and digital health ecosystem.\n\nTotal accesses stood at 113.1 million as of December 31, 2023, increasing by 0.6% year-on-year mainly due to the growth in contract thanks to Telef\u00f3nica Brazil's totalization strategy (expanding the services we offer to provide customers with a complete experience) and the growth in FTTH, which offset the decrease in prepaid mobile accesses, the decline in the fixed voice business due to the continuous migration from fixed to mobile, the contraction of the lower-value fixed broadband customer base, and the loss of DTH customers as a result of the company's strategic decision to discontinue legacy technologies.",

The lower customer base has been mainly a consequence of the disconnection of inactive customers, mostly from Oi's customer base incorporated in 2022, as well as the strategy of migrating prepaid customers to control postpaid (postpaid accesses with usage limits, requiring customers to purchase 'topups' if they exceed these  limits).\n\nBroadband accesses grew by 4.0% year-on-year and reached 6.7 million accesses with net adds of 258\n\n## Millions of euros\n\n| TELEF\u00d3NICA BRAZIL                                                                 | 2022    | 2023    | % Reported YoY   | % Organic YoY  (1)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Revenues                                                                          | 8,870   | 9,650   | 8.8%             | 8.4%                 |\n| Mobile Business                                                                   | 6,106   | 6,792   | 11.2%            | 10.9%                |\n| Handset revenues                                                                  | 573     | 640     | 11.6%            | 11.2%                |\n| Fixed Business                                                                    | 2,764   | 2,858   | 3.4%             | 3.1%                 |\n| Other income                                                                      | 416     | 427     | 2.8%             | 2.5%                 |\n| Supplies                                                                          | (1,783) | (2,170) | 21.7%            | 21.3%                |\n| Personnel expenses                                                                | (1,097) | (1,220) | 11.2%            | 10.9%                |\n| Other expenses                                                                    | (2,674) | (2,559) | (4.3%)           | (4.6%)               |\n| OIBDA                                                                             | 3,732   | 4,128   | 10.6%            | 10.2%                |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                                     | (2,369) | (2,511) | 6.0%             | 5.6%                 |\n| Amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of  property, plant and equipment | (1,807) | (1,890) | 4.6%             | 4.3%                 |\n| Amortization of rights of use                                                     | (562)   | (621)   | 10.3%            | 10.0%                |\n| Operating income                                                                  | 1,363   | 1,617   | 18.6%            | 18.3%                |\n| CapEx                                                                             | 1,795   | 1,671   | (6.9%)           | (6.0%)               |\n| OIBDA-CapEx                                                                       | 1,937   | 2,457   | 26.8%            | 24.7%                |\n\nNotes:\n\n- (1 ) See adjustments made to calculate organic variations below.\n\nthousand new accesses in 2023.

In organic terms, revenues grew by 8.4% year-on-year. This evolution is mainly driven by the growth in service revenues (mobile business), businesses associated with new technologies like FTTH, IPTV and Digital Services and higher handset sales. To a lesser extend, revenues grew due to the price increases implemented by Telef\u00f3nica Brazil. These impacts offset the revenue erosion associated with voice and traditional accesses and to a lesser extent due to lower Pay TV revenues.\n\n- \u00b7 Mobile business revenues totaled 6,792 million euros in 2023, increasing by 11.2% in reported terms, mainly due to the appreciation of the Brazilian real (+0.4 p.p.). In organic terms, mobile business revenues increased by 10.9%, mainly as a result of the larger contract customer base and the price increases implemented by Telef\u00f3nica Brazil.\n- \u00b7 Fixed business revenues amounted to 2,858 million euros in 2023, growing 3.4% in reported terms mainly due to the appreciation of the Brazilian real (+0.3 p.p.). In organic terms, revenues grew 3.1%, mainly explained by higher FTTH revenues in line with the strategic focus on such services, as well as higher IT service revenues.\n\nMobile ARPU grew 7.2% year-on-year in reported terms mainly due to the appreciation of the Brazilian real. In local currency, mobile ARPU grew 6.8% year-on-year supported by the good evolution of the contract business, helped by the totalization strategy (expanding the services we offer to provide customers with a complete experience), mobile shelf plans with new hybrid bundles (packaged offers including, e.g., health insurance and entertainment services as Vale Sa\u00fade and VIVOplay), and to a lesser extent the price increases implemented by Telef\u00f3nica Brazil.\n\n| TELEF\u00d3NICA BRAZIL   |   2022 |   2023 | % Reported YoY   | %Local Currency  YoY   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|------------------|------------------------|\n| ARPU (EUR)          |    4.7 |    5   | 7.2%             | 6.8%                   |\n| Prepay              |    2.3 |    2.4 | 4.0%             | 3.7%                   |\n| Contract  (1)       |    8.3 |    8.8 | 6.3%             | 5.9%                   |\n| Data ARPU (EUR)     |    3.7 |    4.1 | 8.6%             | 8.3%                   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

In organic terms, other expenses decreased by 4.6% year-on-year due mainly to the acquisition price adjustment recorded in connection with Oi's assets and cost efficiencies due to digitalization.\n\nOIBDA stood at 4,128 million euros in 2023, growing by 10.6% year-on-year in reported terms. In organic terms, OIBDA grew by 10.2%.\n\nDepreciation and amortization amounted to 2,511 million euros in 2023, increasing 6.0% in reported terms. In organic terms, depreciation and amortization would increase by 5.6% year-on-year due to higher amortization of intangible assets.\n\nOperating income stood at 1,617 million euros in 2023, increasing by 18.6% year-on-year in reported terms, impacted positively by the appreciation of the Brazilian real (+0.4 p.p.). In organic terms, the operating income increased by 18.3%, as a result of the good performance of service revenues as result of higher commercial activity and the price increases implemented by Telef\u00f3nica Brazil, which together with good cost management more than offset the growth in expenses and depreciation and amortization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This evolution is mainly thanks to attractive commercial offers which result in a higher number of gross adds.\n- \u00b7 Prepay accesses increased by 2.0% year-on-year, with a net gain of 1.3 million accesses as of December 31, 2023. The year-on-year accesses evolution was greatly impacted by the gain of accesses in Colombia (+912 thousand accesses), Chile (+900 thousand accesses) and Venezuela (+673 thousand accesses) due to lower churn. The year-on-year increase was partially offset by an access decrease in Peru (-998 thousand accesses), and to a lesser extent Mexico (-151 thousand accesses) and Uruguay (-38 thousand accesses).\n\nFixed accesses stood at 5.7 million as of December 31, 2023 (-10.9% year-on-year) with a net loss of 0.7 million accesses due to the continued erosion of the traditional fixed business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFixed broadband accesses amounted to 6.0 million as of December 31, 2023 (stable year-on-year). The penetration of FBB accesses over fixed accesses stood at 106.2% (+11.6 p.p. y-o-y), as a result of the focus on Ultra Broadband (UBB) deployment in the region reaching 5.5 million connected accesses (+8.2% y-o-y) and 20.3 million premises. The penetration of UBB accesses over fixed broadband accesses stood at 91.7% (+6.2 p.p. y-o-y).\n\nPay TV accesses stood at 2.8 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 2.1% y-o-y or a net loss of 60 thousand customers, a consequence of the decrease in Direct-to-Home (DTH) technology accesses (-146.2 thousand accesses) due to the change in commercial strategy, as well as the decreasing cable access base (-211.2 thousand accesses). This evolution was partially offset by the increase in IPTV accesses (+298 thousand accesses), on which the Company is placing strategic focus.",

The exchange rate used to translate inflation-adjusted items denominated in Argentine pesos in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 was the closing exchange rate as of December 31, 2023 which was 893.45 Argentine pesos per euro (189.08 Argentine pesos per euro as of December 31, 2022). The annual inflation rate for 2023 was 211%. As a result, in 2023 Telef\u00f3nica Argentina contributed 1,237 million euros to the consolidated revenues of the Telef\u00f3nica Group and an operating loss of 199 million euros to the consolidated operating income of the Telef\u00f3nica Group (2,066 million euros and a loss of 270 million euros, respectively, in 2022).\n\nRevenues amounted to 8,381 million euros in 2023, decreasing 8.3% year-on-year in reported terms. This decrease was caused by the reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary countries (-8.9 p.p.), marginally compensated by exchange rate effects (+0.7 p.p.). In organic terms, revenues decreased by 0.1% yearon-year, mainly due to a decrease in handset sales revenues, lower prepaid B2C (Business to Customer) and TV revenues, partially offset by higher broadband and new services revenues.\n\nMobile business revenues amounted to 5,493 million euros in 2023, decreasing 8.5% year-on-year in reported terms. This decrease was caused by the reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary countries (-8.4 p.p.). partially offset by exchange rate effects (+1.3 p.p.), In organic terms, revenues decreased by 1.4% year-on-year, mainly due to revenue the decrease in handset sales, as a result of the slowdown in commercial activity with a lower number of gross adds and lower prepaid B2C (Business to Customer) revenues.\n\nThe performance by country was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 In Argentina, mobile revenues amounted to 862 million euros 2023, decreasing 37.5% year-on-year in reported terms. Excluding the exchange rate effects (-154.4 p.p.), given the depreciation of the Argentine peso, revenues increased 117.0% year-on-year explained by higher postpaid and prepaid B2C (Business to Customer) revenues due to the increase in accesses and higher handset sales.\n- \u00b7 In Chile, mobile revenues amounted to 988 million euros in 2023, increasing 2.0% year-on-year in reported terms. Excluding the impact of exchange rate effects (+1.1 p.p) revenues grew 0.9% explained by higher handset sales and mobile postpaid revenues.\n- \u00b7 In Peru, mobile revenues amounted to 840 million euros in 2023, decreasing 9.1% year-on-year in reported\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nterms, impacted by exchange rate effects (-0.4 p.p.). Excluding this impact revenues decreased 8.7% affected by an aggressive competitive environment in postpaid which has led to a lower ARPU, lower commercial activity with lower number of gross adds in prepaid and lower handset sales.\n\n- \u00b7 In Colombia, mobile revenues amounted to 774 million in 2023, decreasing 13.1% year-on-year in reported terms. Excluding the impact of exchange rate effects (-3.9 p.p.), revenues decreased 9.2% due to lower prepaid and handset revenues, as a result of the slowdown in commercial activity, with a lower number of gross adds, partially offset by higher postpaid revenues.\n- \u00b7 In Mexico, mobile revenues amounted to 1,318 million euros in 2023, increasing 12.5% year-on-year in reported terms. Excluding the impact of exchange rate effects (+10.5 p.p.), revenues grew 2.0%, leveraged on higher B2C (Business to Customer) postpaid revenues with a the good level of commercial activity resulting in a higher number of gross adds and higher handset sales revenues.\n\nFixed business revenues amounted to 2,888 million euros in 2023, decreasing 8.0% year-on-year in reported terms. This decrease was affected by the reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary countries (-10.0 p.p.) and exchange rate effects (-0.5 p.p.). Excluding these impacts, revenues increased by 2.4%, driven by higher broadband and new services revenues and the increase in voice accesses in Chile and Colombia, that partially offset the decrease in fixed business revenues in Peru, affected by an aggressive competitive environment.\n\nThe evolution of expenses is explained below:\n\n- \u00b7 Supplies amounted to 3,211 million euros in 2023, decreasing 5.1% year-on-year in reported terms compared to 2022. This decrease was mainly attributable to the reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary countries (-6.3 p.p.) partially offset by foreign exchange effects (+1.6 p.p.). In organic terms, supplies decreased by 0.5% driven by lower direct costs partially offset by higher commercial costs.\n- \u00b7 Personnel expenses amounted to 1,126 million euros in 2023, decreasing 6.3% year-on-year in reported terms compared to 2022. This decrease was mainly attributable to the reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary countries (-12.7 p.p.) partially offset by the year-on-year increase in restructuring costs in several operating businesses in the region (+2.6 p.p.). Excluding these impacts personnel expenses increased by 3.9% mainly due to higher wages.",

This year-on-year variation was mainly affected by the recording of capital gains in 2022 from the sale of fiber assets in Colombia (-103.0 p.p.), the higher restructuring expenses carried out in several operating businesses in the segment in 2023 compared to 2022 (-19.4 p.p.), partially offset by the lower depreciation and amortization base in Telef\u00f3nica Mexico in 2023 compared to 2022, related to the transformation of the operating model (as a result of the 2019 wholesale access services agreement with AT&T); (+15.4 p.p.), the difference in the impairment recorded in 2023 in Ecuador (amounting to 58 million euros) and the other assets impairment recorded in 2022 relating to Telef\u00f3nica Argentina (amounting to 77 million euros); (+12.1 p.p.). In organic terms, Operating Income decreased by 17.6% year-on-year, due to lower revenues in spite of the lower expenses.\n\nBelow is additional information by country:\n\n- \u00b7 In Argentina, operating loss was 199 million euros in 2023 compared to an operating loss of 270 million euros in 2022, a 26.5% year-on-year decrease mainly due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso and lower lower depreciation and amortizations expense in 2023.\n- \u00b7 In Chile operating income was 35 million euros in 2023 (-80.6% year-on-year in reported terms). Excluding foreign exchange effects operating income decreased 80.9% year-on-year, explained mainly by the capital gain recorded in 2022 from the sale of a data center in such year.\n- \u00b7 In Peru the operating loss was 33 million euros in 2023 compared to operating income of 60 million euros in 2022, not impacted by foreign exchange effects, mainly due to lower revenues.\n- \u00b7 In Colombia, operating income was 64 million euros in 2023 (-75.6% year-on-year in reported terms). Excluding foreign exchange effects, operating income decreased by 74.5% year-on-year, mainly due to the capital gains recorded in 2022 in connection with in fiber asset sales in such year.\n\n- \u00b7 In Mexico operating income was 3 million euros in 2023 compared to operating loss of 176 million euros in 2022. The better performance was due in part to the lower depreciation and amortization base in 2023 compared to 2022,  related to the transformation of the operating model of Telef\u00f3nica M\u00e9xico (as a result of the 2019 wholesale access services agreement with AT&T).",

Responsibility to the environment\n\n## Key points\n\n## Commitment\n\nto being a decarbonised, circular company and minimising our environmental impact on the planet.\n\n## 100%\n\nof our operators have implemented externally-certified environmental management systems.\n\n## 2.1.1. Vision\n\nCompanies play a key role in protecting the environment. By integrating sustainability strategically throughout their operations, they not only contribute to reducing their impacts, but also mitigate risks and increase their value as a company.\n\nCustomers, investors and employees are significantly more environmentally conscious, which is reflected in their need to carry out their activities in a more sustainable way and to seek partnerships with companies that have incorporated these values into their strategy.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we strive at all levels of the organisation to minimise our impact and decouple the growth of our business from our environmental footprint.\n\nFurthermore, we believe it is vital to enhance the synergies between the digital, green and energy transition in order to achieve a competitive, resilient and sustainable economy. This is why digitalisation becomes a crucial tool in facing environmental challenges: climate change, circular economy, water management and biodiversity.\n\nThis commitment forms part of the Company's general strategy for which the Board of Directors is ultimately responsible.\n\n## Digital-green\n\nenergy transition driven by fibre and 5G, increased use of renewables and energy efficiency.\n\nThe corresponding performance levels are regularly supervised by the Board's Sustainability and Regulation Committee. In addition, the heads of the sustainability management areas, in coordination with the Global Sustainability (ESG) Office , met periodically to monitor performance and progress.\n\nWe see the environment as a cross-cutting issue that involves operational and management areas as well as business and innovation areas. The Climate Action Plan is a good example of this. Not only does this Plan define actions for the operational model, but it also defines actions for the business and financial strategy, the commitment to customers, the supply chain and society as a whole.\n\nIn this regard, it is worth highlighting that carbon emissions reduction targets are part of the variable remuneration of all the Company's employees, including the Executive Committee.\n\nWe are committed to digitalisation as a key tool for tackling our environmental challenges.",

Targets\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group's main environmental targets are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Achieve net zero emissions by 2040 , including our value chain. To do this, we will reduce all our emissions by at least 90% and neutralise the remaining emissions through nature-based solutions.\n- \u00b7 Consume 100% renewable electricity in all our markets by 2030 .\n- \u00b7 Be a Zero-waste company in 2030 , through the design of equipment, reuse and recycling.\n\n## 2.1.3. Policies and management systems GRI 2-23, 3-3\n\nWe have several policies to bring the organisation into line with our environmental targets:\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental Policy.\n- \u00b7 Energy Management Policy.\n- \u00b7 Supply Chain Sustainability Policy.\n\nAs well as our policies, we have internal standards that serve as a common reference framework for all Group companies. These global standards guide the Company in improving its environmental performance and incorporate a life-cycle perspective .\n\nTo control the impact of our activities on the environment, we have chosen to implement an Environmental Management System (EMS) in accordance with the ISO 14001 standard. All our operators have an externally certified EMS. Operating under a certified EMS ensures adequate control and compliance with the applicable environmental legislation in each of our markets. It is therefore directly linked to the preventive\n\nenvironmental compliance model , which forms part of the Company's comprehensive compliance process.\n\nOur EMS(s) enable(s) us to manage our most critical environmental aspects, such as energy and waste, as well as others that are less relevant due to the nature of our operations (biodiversity, water, noise). It is worth mentioning that we were not subject to any significant environmental penalties in 2023.\n\nFurthermore, 652 employees with EMS-related responsibilities attended specific 4-hour training in 2023. This course enables them to enhance their competence, training and awareness, which contributes to the improvement of the organisation's environmental performance.\n\nWe maintain our Energy Management Systems (EnMS) certifications, based on the ISO 50001 standard, for our operations in Spain, Germany, Chile and Brazil. Brazil has two certified operational centres, including the Eco Berrini building.\n\n## 2.1.4. Impacts, risks and opportunities GRI 3-3\n\nThe Company's environmental and climate change risks are managed under the Telef\u00f3nica Group's global risk management framework.\n\nThe major risk focus regarding these issues lies in the wide geographical spread of our infrastructure. As a result, we carry out supervision and monitoring based on standardised procedures, under the scope of ISO 14001certified EMSs.\n\nWe take the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as a starting point for the analysis of climate change risks , which are specifically discussed in chapter 2.2. Energy and climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2. Energy and climate change\n\nIn 2023 the Telef\u00f3nica Group contracted, locally and globally, several insurance policies to mitigate the possible occurrence of any incident arising from the risks of environmental liability and/or natural disasters, so as to guarantee business continuity.\n\nWe have fully comprehensive monetary loss and lost profits cover in place to protect against material losses, damage to assets and loss of income and/or customers, among other things, due to acts of nature. We also have coverage for environmental liabilities as required by applicable laws and regulations. This coverage consists of limits, sublimits and hedges appropriate to the risks and exposures of Telef\u00f3nica and its group of companies.\n\nBy being proactive, establishing preventive measures and including environmental criteria in our decision making, we have been able to:\n\n- \u00b7 Increase the Company's sustainable financing.\n- \u00b7 Reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.\n- \u00b7 Reduce our CO\u2082 emissions, in absolute terms, despite the increase in network traffic.\n- \u00b7 Seize the opportunities offered by the circular economy.\n- \u00b7 Help minimise our customers' environmental footprint thanks to our Eco Smart products and services.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is built around three levels, which will be discussed throughout this report:\n\n- \u00b7 The first level is related to the responsibility we assume as a company that is committed to our environment, by ensuring compliance with environmental legislation, managing our risks and opportunities, implementing management systems, establishing strict environmental targets, and engaging in proactive advocacy for the environment.\n- \u00b7 The second level concerns the Company's decarbonisation and circularity , the protection of biodiversity and integral management of water . This is done through the use of renewable energy, energy efficiency projects, circular economy practices and biodiversity management. This second level of the strategy is detailed in chapters 2.2. Energy and climate change, 2.3. Circular economy and 2.4. Biodiversity, water and other environmental aspects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further information, see 2.2.

Monitoring allows us to offer a top quality service and to promote care for the environment. Therefore, in 2023, we invested around \u20ac17 million towards this goal (similar to the investment in 2022).\n\nWe foster the circular economy across all our assets to make our network as eco-efficient and environmentally responsible as possible. Thanks to our energy efficiency and renewable energy plans, we have managed to stabilise our electricity consumption, despite the rise in digitalisation. In addition, our circular economy strategy enabled us to reuse 313,805 pieces of network equipment and recycle 97% of our waste in 2023.\n\nIn order to both optimise land use and reduce visual impact, energy consumption and waste generation, we apply the best practices available. Among many other actions, we introduce soundproofing measures when necessary and prioritise locating our facilities in colocated sites with other operators, which allows us to reduce the impact caused by network deployment.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica's environmental performance, at a glance\n\n## Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                               |   2022 |   2023 | Trend        |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------|\n| Certified activity according to ISO 14001 (%) |    100 |    100 | l  No change |\n\n## Energy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                             | 2022      | 2023      | Trend          |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|\n| Energy consumption (MWh)                    | 6,106,255 | 6,011,861 | q  Improvement |\n| Renewable electricity in own facilities (%) | 82        | 84        | p  Improvement |\n| Energy consumption per traffic (MWh/PB)     | 49        | 41        | q  Improvement |\n\n## Emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                | 2022      | 2023      | Trend            |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions (tCO 2 e)                | 131,809   | 122,460   | q  Improvement   |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions - market based (tCO 2 e) | 221,537   | 214,659   | q  Improvement   |\n| Scope 3 GHG emissions (tCO 2 e)                | 1,930,051 | 1,970,583 | p  Deterioration |\n| Emissions offsets (tCO 2 e)                    | 35,537    | 33,711    | N/A              |\n\n## Avoided emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                           |   2022 |   2023 | Trend          |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Emissions avoided by customers (MtCO 2 e) |   81.7 |   86.1 | p  Improvement |\n\n## Planning and construction\n\n| Environmental licences and permits          | 1,492   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Visual impact reduction measures            | 64      |\n| Base stations with renewable energy         | 484     |\n| Operation and maintenance                   |         |\n| Energy efficiency and managements projects  | 170     |\n| Renewable electricity in own facilities (%) | 84      |\n| GHG emissions (Scopes 1+2) (tCO 2 eq)       | 337,119 |\n| Energy consumption per traffic (MWh/PB)     | 41      |\n| Dismantling                                 |         |\n| Network equipment reused (pieces)           | 313,805 |\n| Hazardous waste (t)                         | 3,576   |\n| Total waste recycled (%)                    | 97      |\n\nThe trend of our environmental performance is displayed in the following summary of indicators:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Energy and climate change\n\n## Key points\n\n## A in CDP\n\nFor the 10 th consecutive year, we are part of the CDP A List, which includes the leading climate management companies worldwide.\n\n## SBTi\n\nhas validated our targets to achieve net zero emissions throughout our value chain by 2040, thanks to our Climate Action Plan.\n\n## 2.2.1. Vision\n\nThe current economic model's intensive use of energy is one of the main causes of climate change, which is one of the most pressing challenges we are facing. In their latest report, the UN expert panel warned that the world must cut emissions by 45% before 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 on a global scale. Organisations like the World Economic Forum identify climate change as the major risk factor for the world's economy, and the investment world is increasingly aware of the need to focus on sustainable investments.\n\nIn line with scientist-led approaches to limit the global temperature increase to below 1.5\u00b0C, the main aspect we are working on in order to decarbonise our company is electricity, which is a vital resource for the development of our business: over 95% of our consumption comes from providing our services through the telecommunications network.\n\nIn addition, many of our products and services have the potential to help our customers do business more sustainably. In fact, organisations such as the World Economic Forum and the Exponential Roadmap initiative have indicated that digital technologies can help reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between now and 2030 by 15% when implemented in industrial sectors, and by up to 35% if we consider their ability to transform people's habits.\n\n## 51%\n\nreduction in our total carbon emissions (Scopes 1+2+3) in the last eight years.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we develop green digital solutions to help our customers transition towards more sustainable and competitive business models.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11. Sustainable offering and innovation\n\nTherefore, our vision is aligned with our strategy and our stakeholders' demands; it incorporates energy management, mitigation, adaptation and the opportunities arising from climate change.\n\nWe are working to ensure we remain leaders in this area and continue to be included as part of the CDP Climate Change 'A List', as we have been for the past ten years in a row.",

The Sustainability and Regulation Committee, which meets monthly, oversees the strategy implementation, reviews the risks and monitors its targets.\n\nOur Global Energy and Climate Change Office has been operational since 2007. Comprising the global areas of Operations (Global Chief Technology and Information Officer - GCTIO), Environment and other areas for which the issue at hand may be relevant (e.g. Procurement, Risks), the Office is in charge of executing the strategy and coordinating implementation of the Climate Action Plan. Furthermore, the Global Energy Centre, created in 2015, works to ensure we meet our targets as soon as possible and, alongside local officers, promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in each country.\n\nIn our Climate Action Plan we set out how we align our strategy and business model with the most ambitious scientific climate recommendations so that they are compatible with the transition to a low-carbon economy. This plan is approved by the Board of Directors, following analysis by the Sustainability and Regulation Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, a percentage of the variable remuneration of all our employees, including the Executive Committee, is linked to fulfilment of the annual and multi-annual CO 2 emissions reduction and neutralisation targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 5.1.

Policies GRI 2-23\n\nWe have a number of internal regulations that are designed to align the organisation with our energy and climate change targets:\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental Policy.\n- \u00b7 Energy Management Policy.\n- \u00b7 Supply Chain Sustainability Policy.\n\n## 2.2.5. Impacts, risks and opportunities GRI 201-2, 3-3\n\nClimate change is one of the risks included in Telef\u00f3nica's risk management framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 3.1. Risk management framework\n\nWe also analyse climate-related risks in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), covering both physical risks and transition risks in the medium and long term. To assess the physical risks, we use projections of climate variables for two different CO 2 concentration scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, or RCPs) defined by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) for the time horizons of 2030, 2040 and 2050.\n\nIn the RCP 2.6 scenario (which is aligned with the Paris Agreement), the temperature increase at the end of the century does not exceed 2\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels. The risks of this scenario relate mainly to transitioning to a decarbonised economy (regulatory, technological, market and reputational risks) - for\n\nexample, due to the tightening of the measures to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This transition would also entail considerable opportunities associated with cost reductions from energy efficiency and renewable energy and with business growth from digital solutions designed to help our customers decarbonise their activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see chapter 2.11. Sustainable offering and innovation\n\nIn the 'business as usual' scenario ( RCP 8.5 ), where the temperature increase at the end of the century is around 4\u00b0C, the major risks are physical risks associated with changes to specific climate variables, whether temporary (increase in extreme weather events) or chronic (increase in temperature, variation in rainfall). The risk associated with the increase in temperature would entail a major financial impact, as it could increase our consumption of electricity for cooling our network equipment. In addition, this could be aggravated by the possible increase in the cost of electricity, mainly in countries that are highly reliant on hydropower in the event of drought.\n\nFurthermore, transition scenarios, which provide the necessary parameters to test the impact of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, also provide key information to help us understand how the future might unfold if the temperature increase were limited to 1.5\u00b0C. For this assessment we use the International Energy Agency's IEA NZE 2050 scenario , which is aligned with the Paris Agreement and describes the efforts needed to reduce GHGs and reach net zero emissions globally by 2050.\n\nIn order to ensure the resilience of our assets, we have drawn up an Adaptation Plan , the main pillars of which are business continuity, energy efficiency and renewable energy plans that help us to reduce exposure to physical risks and adapt to the consequences of climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information on the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), see 2.20.8.

They come from two main sources: fuel consumption (fleet and operations) and fugitive emissions of fluorinated gases. The emissions factors used are stated in the GHG Protocol Cross Sector Tools (2017), the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2014) and the carbon footprint reporting tools provided by the ministries of the different countries.\n\nScope 2 emissions (indirect GHG emissions). There are two emission sources: electricity consumption and district heating. There are two methods for calculating these emissions, one that is location based and one that is market based. The emissions factors used are taken from the International Energy Agency's Statistics-Emissions Factors (2023) report and from local official sources (energy or environment ministries) in each country.\n\nScope 3 emissions (other indirect GHG emissions). The SBTi corporate Net-Zero standard establishes that longterm targets must cover at least 90% of an organisation's scope 3 emissions and that all material categories must be included in the inventory.\n\nIn order to define the most relevant categories (those for which there is more opportunity to reduce emissions), we screened all 15 categories in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Five categories are material and represent 91% of our scope 3 total. The other 10 categories are excluded from Telef\u00f3nica's GHG inventory, either because they are not applicable, because they are reported in other scopes, or because they account for less than 5% of the scope.\n\nThe methodology for quantifying scope 3 emissions is consistent with recommendations from the GHG Protocol (Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard) and from the ITU-T&GeSI&GSMA sectoral guidance (Guidance for assessment of Scope 3 emissions for operators).\n\nTo calculate the emissions of purchased goods and services and capital goods (cat. 1 and 2), we use the hybrid method defined by the GHG Protocol, in which the supplier's emissions intensity is multiplied by the amount spent on the supplier.\n\nIn the case of purchased mobile devices, we use the supplier-specific method, according to which the units of devices acquired are multiplied by the specific emissions of the production and transportation stages of each model's Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).\n\nThe emissions associated with energy-related activities (cat. 3) are those associated with extraction, production and transportation of the energy we consume. The calculation methodology is based on the activity data (amount of fuel, electricity and district heating consumed in the reporting year by the different business units) and the upstream emission factors and transmission & distribution losses, which are specific to each country and obtained from the International Energy Agency's Statistics-Emissions Factors (2023) report and UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)'s 2023 UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting report.\n\nFor calculating business travel emissions (cat. 6), we use both the distance-based method (for distances travelled by plane, train, bus, rental car and boat) and the spend-based method (for journeys in certain modes of transport where the mileage is not known). The sources of emission factors used are the 2023 UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting report from the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Air Emission Accounts by area of activity and economic aggregated data by area of activity ( Cuentas de emisiones a la atm\u00f3sfera por ramas de actividad y Agregados por ramas de actividad ) from Spain's INE (the National Statistics Institute).\n\nWe use two approaches to calculate emissions from the use of sold products (cat. 11):\n\n- \u00b7 Emissions from the use of mobile devices (smartphones or tablets) are calculated by multiplying the number of sold mobile devices by the use life stage specific LCA product emissions of each device. The emissions data are publicly available LCA studies from suppliers or data from the Eco Rating initiative.\n- \u00b7 Emissions from the use of customer premise equipment, such as routers and set-top boxes, are calculated by multiplying the number of devices installed by the annual energy consumption and the specific electricity emission factor for each country. The source of the electricity emissions factors is the same as the one used for the location-based method of calculating Scope 2 emissions.\n\nAlthough they are not included in our inventory, we also calculate and report other emissions that we consider strategic to our business such as 'Category 15. Investments'. This category includes emissions from the entities of the investess over which we do not have operational control. For example, VMED O2 UK, the joint venture created in the UK in 2021 is included. For this calculation, we use the investmentspecific method, multiplying the operational emissions of the investee company by Telef\u00f3nica's share of equity. If no public emissions data are available, the average-data method is used, multiplying the revenue of the investee company by an EEIO (Environmentally-Extended Input-Output) factor that is representative of the sector of economic activity of the investee company and by Telef\u00f3nica's share of equity in the investee company.",

The Autonomous Network Journey (ANJ) programme\n\nIn 2021 Telef\u00f3nica launched its ambitious network transformation program, the Autonomous Network Journey, which aims to harness the potential of our technology transition towards softwarisation and unbundled architectures. The program entails changes and improvements in all the technical areas of our Company, from network architecture and systems to the way we work and our processes, thereby boosting autonomy through data management, artificial intelligence (AI) and automatic learning, all while maintaining a customer-, sustainability- and security-bydesign-oriented approach.\n\nGuided by the drivers of agility, intelligence, quality, efficiency and sustainability, the program has over 100 initiatives and an organising framework comprising the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Network: our networks and systems.\n- \u00b7 Brain: automation platform from which we optimise data management and implement AI algorithms.\n- \u00b7 Heart: processes that govern the life cycle of our networks and systems and therefore improve our operational and business KPIs.\n- \u00b7 People: new ways of working enabled by technological transformation.\n\n## 2.2.6.3. Reducing our own emissions GRI 305-5\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, keeping our energy consumption stable is a priority, despite the considerable rise in digitalisation of society and therefore the amount of data traffic circulating through our networks.\n\nThat priority informs our Energy Efficiency Plan and the Sustainable Platform Design project, which is part of the ANJ program and includes technology initiatives such as modernising our network by replacing copper with fibre optics (85% more efficient); deploying 5G (which is up to 90% more efficient than 4G); virtualisation; cloud migration; implementing Power Saving Features (PSFs) and AI/machine learning (ML) platforms to optimise energy consumption while maintaining quality; shutting down legacy networks to minimise network co-existence; modernising infrastructure and renovating power plants and HVAC equipment; free cooling; immersion cooling; shutting down HVAC equipment; reducing fuel consumption by using hybrid stations with solar photovoltaic energy; delaying the ignition of generators using deep-cycle lithium batteries;\n\nand using more environmentally friendly fuels such as hydrogen/methanol.\n\nNot only do we need maximum efficiency in energy use if we are to become a decarbonised company, but we also need the energy to come from renewable sources.\n\nOur Renewable Energy Plan includes all types of solutions - self-generation, the purchase of renewable energy with a guarantee of origin and long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) - and prioritises nonconventional renewable energy sources. Our goal is to go beyond 100% renewable energy in our main markets. We want to contribute to increasing the renewable energy mix through self-generation and/or by facilitating the construction of new renewable power plants through our medium- and long-term consumption commitments (under PPA models).\n\nIn addition, we have set an internal carbon price to help us make better investment and equipment procurement decisions. We implement a shadow price when procuring equipment that uses energy (electricity or fuel) or that contains fluorinated gases, by calculating the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). This enables us to bear in mind not just the purchase price, but also the price of the energy consumed and the emissions generated during its useful life. As a result, we are able to make better investment decisions, and choose to buy more efficient equipment that will produce fewer operational emissions over its useful life.\n\n## The Climate Action Plan, available on our website, is our roadmap to achieve net zero emissions by 2040.\n\n## 2.2.6.4. Reducing value chain emissions GRI 305-5\n\nThe emissions generated by value chain (scope 3) are the largest in our carbon footprint.\n\nOf our total scope 3 emissions, nearly two thirds come from our supply chain (the 'purchased goods and services' and 'capital goods' categories, as defined in the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard) and the use of our products by our customers.\n\nIn order to reduce our value chain emissions, cooperation with our main suppliers and the rest of the sector is key, as we share the same challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For those who represent around 90% of our supply chain emissions (categories 1 and 2 of the GHG Protocol), we analyse their climate maturity and support them in their decarbonisation process at a company level through training sessions (Supplier Engagement Programme) and by asking them to make specific commitments, such as setting emissions reduction targets in line with the SBTi. There is a smaller group of suppliers for whom, due to the significance of their emissions, we run an individual, more specific collaboration program (Carbon Reduction Programme), which aims to reduce carbon emissions at product level.\n\nIn addition, we work closely with other operators in the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) and GSMA working groups, collaborating on methodological issues and specific actions to encourage emissions reductions in our common supply chain. We also participate in multisectoral initiatives, such as 1.5\u00b0C Supply Chain Leaders and the SME Climate Hub, to reach out to small and medium-sized enterprises as well.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.19. Responsible supply chain management\n\nThe other major scope 3 category that is important for our emissions is the one related to the use of sold products . To reduce the emissions from electronic devices, we foster design with environmental criteria in household connectivity equipment (CPE) and reuse of customer premise equipment and mobile phones.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.3. Circular economy\n\nWe also help our customers to make informed purchasing decisions. One of our initiatives is Eco Rating, which measures the environmental impact of mobile phones over their entire life cycle, rating their environmental sustainability. On the one hand the Eco Rating label enables customers to incorporate sustainability criteria when choosing mobile handsets and, on the other, it encourages manufacturers to reduce the environmental impact of these devices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11. Sustainable offering and innovation\n\n## We collaborate in sectoral initiatives to reduce our supply chain emissions.\n\n## 2.2.6.5. Neutralising unabated emissions\n\nWe will neutralise the emissions that cannot be reduced (a maximum of 10% in 2040) by permanently removing or sequestering an equivalent amount of CO 2 from the atmosphere through the purchase of carbon credits or by developing our own projects, which must meet the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Carbon sequestration initiatives should preferably be nature-based , such as reforestation, afforestation or ecosystem restoration initiatives using native plant species.\n- \u00b7 Projects should be able to demonstrate additionality and long-term impact.\n- \u00b7 Projects should provide environmental and social cobenefits, contribute as much as possible to the achievement of the SDGs and respect and consider the rights of local communities and indigenous peoples.\n- \u00b7 Projects should be certified to recognised national/ international standards and verified by an accredited third party.\n- \u00b7 Projects should preferably be located in countries where Telef\u00f3nica is present.\n\nFurthermore, in the short and medium term , we will invest in projects that yield high-quality emissions-reduction credits , thereby contributing to halting deforestation in certain regions where Telef\u00f3nica has operations and providing incentives to support indigenous peoples and local communities.\n\n## 2.2.6.6. Developing digital solutions for the green transition\n\nAnother of the priorities of our Climate Action Plan is to promote connectivity and digitalisation as key factors which enable the green transition and also improve our customers' competitiveness.\n\nWe develop connectivity, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, big data and 5G services that provide not only operational and cost-saving benefits, but also environmental benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11.

Calculating the avoided emissions of our customers\n\nWe annually measure the enablement effect of the products and services implemented by our customers, quantifying their avoided GHG emissions.\n\nIn order to carry out these calculations, we need to understand the efficiencies the use of our services brings to our customers' operations.\n\nMobile connectivity and broadband services for the B2C segment give our customers access to digital applications that allow them to adopt more sustainable habits such as teleworking, e-learning, audio/video calls, car sharing, satellite navigation apps, real-time access to public transport applications, shared accommodation, online shopping and online banking services.\n\nTo understand how these applications are used and what new, more sustainable habits are being adopted, we conduct surveys of our customers in the residential segment.\n\nTo understand how B2B customers are using Eco Smart solutions , we perform case studies, selecting representative customers for each sector who can give us an idea of the average efficiencies brought by our solutions. We are then able to extrapolate the results to other customers in the same sector who make similar use of the technologies we sell them.\n\nWith support from the Carbon Trust, since 2019 we have been using this information to develop and apply a calculation methodology that converts the efficiencies (energy, operational or material consumption) produced by our services (when used by a customer) into avoided CO 2 emissions.\n\nWe are continuously updating this methodology to include new digital services and the technological developments of our solutions and customers in a way that is consistent with industry guidelines and/or methodological recommendations.\n\nIn addition to our commitment to promoting green digital solutions and transparently communicating the environmental benefits they deliver, we have been a founding member of the European Green Digital Coalition (EGDC) since 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe EGDC is an initiative promoted by the European Commission and the leading European companies in the ICT sector. In order to make the EU's green transition possible, we, the participating companies, are committed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Investing in the development and deployment of green digital solutions with a strong focus on contributing to energy efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Collaborating with key organisations to develop standardised methodologies for assessing the net environmental impact of digital solutions.\n- \u00b7 Promoting cross-sectoral dialogue.\n- \u00b7 Contributing to the development of guidelines and recommendations for the deployment of these solutions.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is included in CDP's Climate A List for the 10 th consecutive year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Energy consumption performance GRI 302-1, 302-2, 302-3, 302-4\n\nIn 2023, we rolled out a series of projects aimed at boosting the efficiency and sustainability of our operations, in line with the Company's ANJ (Autonomous Network Journey) programme to build the network of the future. We prioritised the rollout of new, more efficient, technologies and the shutdown of legacy elements to foster the circular economy.\n\nDuring this period, we implemented 170 initiatives focussing on energy management and efficiency in our networks and offices, with savings of 281 GWh and \u20ac82 million. Our total energy consumption was 6,012 GWh (21,642,699 GJ), of which 95% was electricity and 5% was fuel.

We also continued our commitment to shut down legacy networks , including both mobile and network infrastructure. In Spain, in line with the 2024 copper shutdown plan, 1,914 plants were closed in 2023 (4,150 since 2014); this means we have shut down 49% of the total number of plants scheduled to close, generating savings of 41 GWh. In addition, in Hispanoamerica we made progress in shutting down the 2G network, totalling 50% in Uruguay. When we have completed the shutdown process entirely (100%), this will achieve estimated savings of 4.7 GWh per year, which represents 17% of total consumption of this operation.\n\nAs regards infrastructure , we defined a new multiannual plan based on a series of levers we have included in our Climate Action Plan , such as compaction of technical rooms, renewing of obsolete equipment, cold aisle containment and increasing the temperature of rooms and associated water circuits. In 2023, we improved the PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) of our main data centres by a tenth, to 1.69.\n\nWe broadened the Data Centre Consolidation project to include all critical sites. In Germany, we defined a consolidation plan to have less infrastructure (but better in terms of reliability and efficiency) and obtain a 15% reduction in energy consumption.\n\nIn addition to the projects carried out at our data centres, we undertook activities involving the rest of the critical infrastructure (core sites). In Spain, we continued to implement the Apagado Milles project, which consisted of matching the climate control equipment to the real status and shutting down almost 1,000 units, with savings of 20 GWh in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, our Smart Site Design project also pressed onward, aiming to improve the design of mobile sites thanks to the Smart Site model, which includes equipment modernisation, use of free cooling, more efficient rectifiers, bluetooth locking and renewable energy, among other best practices. Germany is a good example of this, where we continued to work on the NSD (New Site Design) project.\n\nIn Brazil, we signed the Energy Savings as a Service (ESaaS) framework agreement, while in Hispanoamerica we selected the Hycooloop model to move forward in modernising the infrastructure and improving the energy efficiency of the sites, all with third-party investment. In 2023, in Spain we implemented four ESaaS-based projects which represent savings of 5.2 MWh per year. The next step involves expanding it to 40 plants, with estimated average savings in consumption of 20% for each plant.\n\nWith the aim of managing network capacity efficiently, we intensified the use of power-saving features (PSF), especially during off-peak periods. We incorporated advanced AI, machine learning and automatic traffic prediction tools. In 2023, we implemented six new power-saving features (PSF) in our 4G and 5G networks in our main markets, enabling us to reduce energy consumption in off-peak hours by up to 30%, without compromising on quality of service. In Germany, AI/machine learning platforms were rolled out to obtain additional savings to those from the 4G/5G power-saving features already active at network level, with additional savings of up to 5%.\n\nLastly, we continued to improve the methodologies for obtaining fuel consumption data from operations and recharging of refrigerant gases. In Colombia and Venezuela, we implemented automatic fuel measurement systems at the main plants. We persevered with the digitalisation of the management process, achieving an increase in data reliability, which enabled us to reduce refrigerant gas recharges by 15% in Brazil. This also makes it possible to implement new projects to reduce scope 1 emissions.\n\nWith the aim of reducing emissions derived from the use of fossil fuels, we conducted an assessment for the use of hydrogen/methanol solutions at off-grid mobile sites. In 2023, the study demonstrated theoretically that fuel cells powered by methanol, as a complement to the solar panels and batteries already in use, would allow us (at a reasonable cost) to eliminate the use of generators and, therefore, reduce our emissions. In the coming year, we will roll out a number of pilots prior to large-scale implementation.\n\nIn line with this, for our power plants where use of generators is inevitable as they guarantee continuity of service, we performed an analysis based on use of biofuels (HVO) to replace traditional diesel. Thus, we ratified the viability of a change that reduces emissions. During 2024, we will launch a number of pilots in different operations.\n\nIn Colombia, 10 sites were implemented under the ESaaS model and eight sites with the Li-ion battery cycling project, representing a reduction of 125,582 litres of fuel per year. In this way, we eliminated 100% of the sites which ran 365 days with a generator.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Renewable energy\n\nIn 2023, 84% of our total electricity consumption in our own facilities came from renewable sources. In Europe, Brazil, Chile and Peru, 100% of the electricity we used came from renewable sources.\n\nWe continued the distributed generation (DG) project in Brazil. To date, we have installed 67 renewable energy plants out of a total of 85 planned. These plants will generate over 700 GWh per year for our operations, thereby reducing dependence on renewable energy certificates (iRECs).\n\nIn addition, thanks to extending guarantee of origin programmes , for the first time Telxius Cable certified 100% of the electricity it consumed as renewable at its own facilities in its main markets, through the purchase of iRECs. In Hispanoamerica, we awarded the first multicountry and multi-annual purchase (2024-2026) for iRECs for a volume of between 451 GWh (2024) and 981 GWh (2026). This is an increase in the percentage of renewable consumption of between 53% and 76% for 2024 and 2026, respectively. In 2023, Argentina, Ecuador and Colombia continued increasing their consumption of renewable electricity, achieving 10%, 41% and 89% respectively.\n\nRegarding the electricity we use at non-Company facilities, our operations in Germany, Spain, Brazil, Peru and Chile also certified 100% of electricity consumption at third-party sites as being renewable, enabling us to reach a figure of 87% globally.\n\nIn Europe, Brazil, Peru and Chile, 100% of the electricity we consume at our own facilities comes from renewable sources (84% at global level). Our goal, as part of the RE100 initiative, is for the electricity we consume in all our operations to come entirely from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nWith regard to self-generation of electricity , we have 484 systems installed (both in fixed network buildings and in mobile network base stations). These systems not only contribute to improving our electricity use through renewable sources but also allow us to avoid using fossil fuel-based generators in isolated (off-grid) base stations, achieving considerable reductions in consumption, which range between 70% and 100%. A noteworthy example of this initiative was the implementation of 11 self-generation projects in Ecuador, with estimated annual production of 34,000 kWh.",

In 2023, these emissions were 7% lower than the previous year, due to a 11% decrease in fugitive emissions of fluorinated gases and a 3% decrease in total fuel consumption.\n\nScope 2 emissions dropped by 3% compared to the previous year.

This means that, in 2023 alone, we avoided the emission of 837,520 and 45,289 tCO 2 e, respectively.\n\nCompared to the base year (2015), our Scope 1 emissions decreased by 57% (163,741 tCO 2 e) and our Scope 2 emissions by 86% (1,310,295 tCO 2 e). Combined, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions fell by 81.4%, resulting in 1,474,036 fewer tCO 2 e emitted to the atmosphere.\n\nIn this way we continued to progress towards meeting our target, updated in 2023, of reducing our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 90% by 2030.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

Purchased goods and services' and 'Category 2. Capital goods') and 29% from the use of products we sell to our customers ('Category 11. Use of sold products').\n\nOther relevant categories include 'Category 3. Energyrelated activities' and 'Category 6. Business travel', which together account for the remaining 7% of the value chain's emissions.\n\nWe also calculate and report other emissions that we consider strategic to our business such as 'Category 15. Investments', which in 2023 amounted to 35,060 tCO 2 e. This category includes emissions from VMO2, the joint venture created in the UK in 2021.\n\nIn 2023, our Scope 3 emissions decreased by -31% compared to 2016 (base year), which represents 884,961 tCO 2 fewer in seven years.\n\nDespite the reduction compared to the base year and the lower emissions ratios in the main categories, our Scope 3 emissions increased by 2% in absolute terms compared to the previous year.\n\nSpecifically, the emissions associated with procurement rose by 1%; however, this was linked to an increase of 7% in purchase volume. This means that the emission\n\nintensity ratios per unit of purchase have decreased, thanks to a heightened climate-related commitment from our suppliers, which has been fostered by our engagement initiatives.\n\nBusiness travel emissions increased due to the return to in-person meetings, although they remained 48% lower than the pre-pandemic level.\n\nLastly, emissions associated with use of sold products rose by 5% due to the sale of new products, such as televisions and games consoles. Excluding this new line of products, emissions of this category would have dropped by 9% compared to 2022.\n\n## Key actions to reduce emissions in the value chain\n\nWe are aware that Scope 3 emissions represent a major challenge since, as they are outside our direct control, the process of collecting activity data is more complex and the allocation of responsibilities is more vague.\n\nGiven the importance of supply chain emissions , working with our suppliers and with other companies in the sector is a necessity, so that together we can successfully reduce those emissions.",

Our approach was to categorise and group our suppliers based on their contribution to our carbon footprint. This has enabled us to carry out specific initiatives according to each group.\n\nThe suppliers in group 3 (i.e. all our suppliers) accepted the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy , which includes, among other aspects, emissions calculation and reduction requirements.\n\nFor suppliers in group 2, two different initiatives were carried out:\n\nFirst of all, we invited 178 suppliers (which represented 90% of our supply chain emissions) to participate in the CDP Supply Chain programme, where they provide information about climate strategy, targets and actions. Based on this information, we classified them according to their level of climate maturity and thanks to our Supplier Engagement Programme we undertook a number of different activities, such as identifying areas for improvement and providing training webinars.\n\nSecondly, the top 73 suppliers in terms of emissions were asked to commit to setting science-based emissions reduction targets validated by the Science Based Target initiative , a commitment which is regularly monitored.\n\nFinally, for suppliers in group 1 (our most strategic suppliers) we ran the Carbon Reduction Programme . This is a joint action in collaboration with other companies in the sector and consists of securing their engagement on an individual basis to promote emission reduction at product level. In other words, the suppliers identified the most carbon-intense common products and then, through a life-cycle assessment (LCA), the stages with the greatest potential for achieving emissions reductions were identified.\n\nWe also took part in other sector-based initiatives, such as the climate change working group (led by Telef\u00f3nica) within the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) to align criteria and join forces, with the commitment of decarbonising the sector. We were also part of the working group on climate change at GSMA, which together with GeSI (the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative) and the ITU (International Telecommunication Union ) published in",

Neutralising unabated emissions\n\nWe have been mitigating the impact of our emissions for several years through nature-based projects that generate high quality carbon credits. All of the projects (100%) used in 2023 are biogenic sinks.\n\nOne of our targets for 2025 is to neutralise 100% of the residual Scope 1 and 2 emissions of our key markets (Spain, Germany and Brazil) each year. In 2023, this value rose to 65% (10%at global level).\n\nWith regard to emissions associated with the use of our products, we have been working to reduce the electricity consumption of our customer premise equipment , consisting mainly of routers and set-top boxes, thanks to an enhanced design.\n\n## Details of climate mitigation projects financed through carbon credits\n\n| KPI                                    | T.

Thanks to these three projects, the operator offset 18% of its operational emissions (Scope 1 + 2) in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, in Brazil we continued to offset 100% of Scope 1+2 emissions through the purchase of carbon credits. The projects support local initiatives both for conserving ecosystems that contribute to halting deforestation and for reforesting the Amazon rainforest with native species. They also promote the socioeconomic development of local communities, by generating revenues and developing educational activities.\n\nIn Germany, we neutralised 60% of our operational emissions through a reforestation project in Colombia that promotes the sustainable management of forest resources to encourage natural regeneration.\n\nLastly, Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., mitigated 68% of the impact of the Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its corporate premises, by removing an equivalent amount of CO 2 from the atmosphere. This was achieved through a reforestation project based in Colombia and a restoration project involving hillside woodland containing chestnut, oak and pine trees in San Esteban de Budi\u00f1o, in Spain.",

Sustainable offering and innovation\n\nQuantitatively : we have been estimating the emissions that we help our customers avoid since 2018. Although it is true that we began with approximate methodologies, each year we have worked to improve the accuracy of our calculations and at the current time we are aligning them with the methodological requirements being defined at the EGDC (European Green Digital Coalition).\n\nTherefore, and with the goal of ascertaining how our customers from the residential segment use connectivity services to access services or apps that allow them to change to more sustainable habits, in 2022 and 2023 we polled over 4,400 customers in Spain, Brazil and Germany.\n\nThe main findings of these surveys were that the digital services with the highest use were audio/video calling, online shopping and online banking. They all make it possible to reduce or eliminate daily commutes or longer\n\ndistance journeys by facilitating teleworking, remote training and access to online services. This leads to a reduction in the fuel consumption of vehicles, which are no longer in use, and therefore in the related GHG emissions.\n\nOur customers also use car-sharing and accommodationsharing apps (which are less polluting than traditional ones), public transport apps that provide real-time information to boost their use and satellite navigation apps that provide information on the most efficient routes.\n\n## Digitalisation is vital to limit the average global temperature increase to below 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nIn the case of the Eco Smart services we offer B2B customer s, we conduct case studies that enable us to find out the energy savings or other efficiencies can be generated, to later transform them into savings in terms of CO 2 .\n\nCombining both, we estimate that our Eco Smart and connectivity services enabled our customers avoid 86.1 7 million tonnes of CO 2 during 2023.",

Targets\n\nOver exploitation of the planet is one of the main causes of environmental degradation and climate change. According to the World Resources Institute, we consume over 100 billion tonnes of mineral, biological, metal and fuel resources each year. That exceeds what the planet can regenerate in a year. Currently, 7.2% of those resources are recycled or given a second life, down from 9.1% in 2018.\n\nThe circular economy is part of the solution to this problem, as it could reduce resource use by 28% and global greenhouse gas emissions by 39%. In the EU alone, it could create around 700,000 jobs and increase GDP by 0.5% by 2030. All this is based on principles such as building impact-reduction into the design, extending the lifespan of products, recovering raw materials and fostering the dematerialisation of the economy through digitalisation.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we integrate this philosophy into our processes, aiming to optimise resource consumption and promote design with environmental criteria, reuse and recycling in order to minimise our impact and encourage materials to be kept in circulation.\n\n## Our main target is to become a Zero Waste company by 2030.\n\nTo achieve this, we set targets for the input and output of materials in order to facilitate the returning of resources that is the hallmark of the circular economy, and thereby ensuring that our waste does not end up incinerated or sent to landfill but is instead transformed into raw materials that are reintroduced into the value chain.\n\nMaterial inflows: these initiatives aim to reduce material extraction by increasing the circularity of products, incorporating durability, repairability and/or recyclability into the design and increasing equipment use cycles through reuse.\n\n- \u00b7 Customer premise equipment: refurbish and reuse 90% of routers and decoders collected from customers in 2024.\n- \u00b7 Introduce circularity criteria for purchases of customer electronic equipment in 2025.",

Policies GRI 2-23\n\nWe have several policies that lay down the basis for implementation of the circular economy throughout the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental Policy.\n- \u00b7 Energy Management Policy.\n- \u00b7 Supply Chain Sustainability Policy.\n\nDeriving from these policies are the following Principles for promoting the circular economy:\n\n- \u00b7 Advocating the development of an enabling regulatory framework for the circular economy.\n- \u00b7 Promoting together with manufacturers the integration of environmental criteria in the design and procurement of equipment.\n- \u00b7 Reducing waste generation and encouraging reuse and recycling.\n- \u00b7 Guaranteeing proper waste treatment through controls on our supply chain.\n- \u00b7 Offering our customers products and services that involve lower consumption of raw materials, environmental information that they can refer to during purchase and alternatives to waste disposal for their used devices.\n\n## 2.3.4. Impacts, risks and opportunities GRI 3-3, 306-1\n\nInadequate management of waste, especially electronic waste, could lead to pollution and therefore have a negative impact on the environment. The resulting environmental restoration could be expensive. Not only this, but the practice of not reusing equipment leads to the depletion of natural resources because non-reuse fails to take full advantage of a product's full lifespan.\n\nBy contrast, a circular economy model brings positive environmental impacts as reuse gives parts a second life, increases equipment use cycles and therefore avoids emissions associated with equipment manufacturing. Furthermore, recycling avoids the impacts associated with the extraction of virgin raw materials by enabling such materials to be recovered, transformed and reincorporated into the production model. These initiatives, together with circular procurement, make it possible to decouple economic growth from the extraction of non-renewable resources.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, the crisis affecting natural resources and their overexploitation poses supply risks that can affect the availability of products and services and can be reversed only through a more circular economy. One example is the pressure that supply chains face during geopolitical conflicts or pandemics. In addition, the demand for critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel is expected to increase further due to the continuing development of the technology industry.\n\nDesign with environmental criteria, reuse and recycling contribute to reducing the risk of resource depletion and ensuring the continuity of our supply chain. They also reduce the associated environmental impact, as 45% of global emissions derive from the manufacture and use of products, while 90% of the biodiversity loss and water stress is caused by the extraction and processing of natural resources.\n\nThe reuse and refurbishment of customer premises and network equipment is a clear opportunity for Telef\u00f3nica as such activities generate savings by avoiding the purchase of new equipment. In addition, the sale of refurbished network equipment or waste, such as cable from the copper-to-fibre transformation, provides us with additional revenues. Another revenue opportunity for the Company comes from the reuse of mobile handsets through buyback programs, the sale of refurbished handsets, repair services and handset leasing.\n\n## Digitalisation and connectivity also offer an\n\nopportunity linked to the circular economy. This is why we make use of technologies such as blockchain and big data to improve the efficiency of our reverse logistics processes, increase equipment traceability and avoid CO\u2082 emissions. VICKY, APOLLO, MARA and MAIA are some examples of how we harness digitalisation in our reverse logistics processes.\n\nFurthermore, the digitalisation of waste management through our GRETEL platform helps to provide greater traceability and information on the final disposal of equipment, reducing risks and impacts arising from inadequate treatment.\n\nIn addition, digital solutions represent a business opportunity for Telef\u00f3nica as they can promote the circularity of other economic sectors through our Eco Smart solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11.

Internal eco-efficiency\n\nWe reduce our environmental impact through efficiency measures such as preventive maintenance of infrastructure, replacement of equipment with energyefficient equipment and internal reuse. This enables us to optimise our consumption of water, paper and energy (for the latter, through an Energy Efficiency Programme).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2. Energy and climate change\n\nTo prevent waste generation in our operations and our value chain, we are committed to circular design, procurement based on circular criteria and reuse , mainly of electronic equipment, as the best waste is that which is not generated at all. This enables us to be more competitive, reduce our expenses and increase our revenue, all while reducing our environmental footprint and complying with applicable legal regulations.\n\n## Electronic equipment\n\nWe extend the lifespan of our equipment by reusing it whenever possible. If the equipment cannot be reused, the best option is to recycle it, as each piece of equipment contains precious metals such as gold, copper and nickel that can be used in a new product.\n\nWe have been reusing many pieces of equipment during our current network transformation, thereby promoting the circular economy in decommissioning processes. To encourage reuse, Telef\u00f3nica has rolled out the MAIA marketplace, which facilitates and promotes internal reuse with the aid of a digital platform. Each operator can access the platform to view available equipment and contact other operators in the Group to coordinate reuse. When internal reuse is not possible, the platform enables operators to connect with technological partners to facilitate the sale of the equipment and therefore extend its lifespan.\n\nIn terms of mobile devices reuse, Telef\u00f3nica has a global MARA initiative, an omnichannel model with an end-toend approach that allows our customers to assess their devices automatically and access trade-in programmes anywhere (home, retail and voice channels). This process optimizes device management times, reduces logistics movements while generating revenue from the reuse and resale of devices, preventing them from becoming waste.\n\nVICKY is an initiative that uses blockchain technology to achieve greater traceability throughout the value chain of modems, routers and TV set-top boxes. This significantly improves recovery rates, refurbishment processes and equipment lifespans. The solution has been recognized for its innovation (Gartner, Forbes) and for encouraging a more efficient, faster, simpler and more sustainable supply chain.\n\nAPOLLO , meanwhile, improves efficiency in reverse logistics processes by using big data and analytics to optimise collection routes for uninstalled or inactive equipment, both at the customer's premises and at collection points. Both initiatives are being rolled out across the organisation with the aim of reusing 90% of Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) by 2024 and becoming a Zero Waste company by 2030.\n\n## Waste\n\nThe waste we generate is managed outside our facilities by specialised waste management companies that apply the most appropriate treatment according to the best available techniques, the environmental regulations in force and the established contractual requirements.\n\nWhenever waste is collected, the staff responsible ensure that all the information is registered in Telef\u00f3nica's waste management platform (GReTel). This allows us to obtain and analyse real-time data on the origin and destination of waste produced by the Company.\n\nThis system enables staff to check how much waste is disposed of, draft reports, analyse information, keep all documentary evidence to ensure proper compliance with environmental regulations in each country and thus make better decisions in the interests of promoting circularity.\n\n## 2.3.5.2. Relationship with our customers\n\nWe raise awareness among our customers and help them lessen their environmental footprint by providing Eco Smart and Eco Rating labels, which encourage innovation and the reduction of environmental impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11. Sustainable offering and innovation\n\nWe also offer our customers repair services but also buyback and refurbishment options for mobile phones to extend their lifespan and give them a second use. In this way we reduce resource and energy consumption by avoiding the manufacture of new devices.",

Relationship with suppliers\n\nWe work together with our suppliers to introduce environmental criteria in product design, encourage the elimination of single-use plastics and choose new models based on digitalisation and dematerialisation, such as the acquisition of products as services.\n\nIn addition, we are progressively incorporating circularity requirements into our electronic equipment procurement processes, using as our benchmark the criteria set out in the ITU-T L.1023 recommendation on the assessment method for circularity performance scoring. This enables us to assess the repairability, recyclability, durability and upgradability of each electronic device acquired.\n\nTo further encourage eco-efficient procurement, our Global Supply Chain Sustainability Policy includes environmental and circular economy criteria to be taken into account by suppliers when providing products or services to Telef\u00f3nica.\n\n## 2.3.6. Progress in 2023 GRI 301-3, 306-1, 306-2, 306-3, 306-4, 306-5\n\n## 2.3.6.1. Circular design\n\n## Design of Telef\u00f3nica branded equipment\n\nIncorporating environmental criteria into the design of our equipment helps us to improve product quality and efficiency by taking into account concepts such as repairability and recyclability. This allows us to produce more durable and environmentally responsible equipment by reducing the consumption of raw materials, energy and emissions associated with manufacturing. One example of this is how, thanks to the reuse and/or repair of customer premise equipment, we avoided the purchase of 3.7 million of new equipment in 2023.\n\nWe cooperate with our suppliers to integrate environmental criteria into home connectivity equipment that is designed by Telef\u00f3nica and bears the logo of one of the Company's brands (Movistar, O2 or Vivo). Our ambition is for all new models of this equipment brought onto the market from 2025 onwards to integrate environmental criteria.\n\nIn line with this aim, in 2023 we launched a new Fibre to the Room (FTTR) device in Spain, which contains 70% recycled plastic in its casing. It also features packaging improvements such as the incorporation of lighter boxes made from FSC-certified recycled cardboard , the use of paper cable ties and a reduced number of commercial documents provided with the equipment.\n\nAt the current time, Company-developed equipment has an optimised design, thanks to integrated antennas and a reduced number and size of status lights, thereby avoiding the unnecessary use of materials.\n\nFor example, our new HGU WiFi 6 2nd generation model , launched in 2023, has reduced energy consumption by 27% compared to the HGU WiFi 5 model and by 56% compared to the HGU WiFi 6 1st generation model.\n\nIn Germany last year, we launched the HomeSpot 5G Router on which we conducted a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) according to the ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006 standards in collaboration with the Basque government's public environmental management company IHOBE. Alongside this, we conducted a reparability study according to the UNE-EN 45554:2020 standard and a recyclability study according to the UNEEN 45555:2020 standard in order to further integrate circular economy criteria into the design stage. Our research confirmed that the HomeSpot 5G Router is 63% repairable (76% for high-priority parts) and 89% recyclable and recoverable .\n\nWe are working on reducing our use of plastic in SIM cards through our Half SIM Card format, which has enabled us to halve the amount of plastic used to manufacture the cards. It also represents an improvement in the efficiency of the logistics process, because smaller containers are required to transport and store these SIM cards.\n\nAs a result, in 2023 we avoided the consumption of 185 tonnes of plastic. This format has already been implemented at nine of our operations consolidating its position as the Group's main format. We also replaced the plastics used in SIM card packaging in Spain with recycled paper and cardboard.\n\n## Procurement using circular criteria\n\nIn 2023, we updated the template for assessing circular economy criteria in electronic equipment based on the new version of the ITU L.1023 recommendation published in August.\n\nThis template is used to assess equipment offered as part of the B2B router and switch procurement process in Spain. Of the models assessed according to the template, 70% had a circularity score of over 60%, with 18% of the models scoring more than 70%.",

Energy and climate change\n\n## 2.3.6.2. Use and recovery\n\n## Reuse and recycling\n\nNetwork infrastructure maintenance is our main wastegenerating activity, above waste generated in our offices or e-waste collected from our customers.\n\nThe vast majority of the waste comes from our network transformation process whereby we migrate from copper cables to fibre optics. In 2023, the transformation process was accelerated thanks to the Granada Plan for closing stations in Spain and the Vivo Mar\u00eda do Carmo Project in Brazil.\n\nWe promote the circular economy in our network transformation by prioritising the reuse of electronic equipment and, where this is not possible, we can extract value from materials through recycling. Recovering this value allows us to generate revenues as the network's transformation advances. In fact, in 2023, we generated 45,756 tonnes of waste ( 16% less than the previous year) and managed to recycle 97% of this.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica's waste\n\n|

Biodiversity, water and other environmental aspects\n\n## Key points\n\n## 98%\n\nof Telef\u00f3nica's facilities are located in habitats with low or very low biodiversity value.\n\n## TNFD\n\n(Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures) is the framework we use to analyse our nature-related risks and opportunities.\n\n## 2.4.1. Vision\n\n## 12.8%\n\nreduction in water consumption in 2023, with a 6.3% decrease in countries classified as highly water-stressed areas.\n\n## 2.4.2. Targets\n\nWe are aware of the need to halt and reverse an unprecedented biodiversity loss, as demanded by the scientific community.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we understand the importance of biodiversity protection and efficient water management. Although these environmental aspects are not relevant to our operations, it is important for us to manage them responsibly and to continue working to minimise their impacts.\n\nWe seek to take a holistic approach that promotes a sustainable digitalisation. This being a process which is compatible with biodiversity preservation, water efficiency and protection of the environment as a whole.\n\nThe relationship between climate and biodiversity is key for maintaining climate stability and for protecting soil, air and water. In addition to achieving net zero emissions, we must also protect the health of the ecosystems.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we have externally certified Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001), which allow us to monitor all the environmental aspects associated with our activities, such as energy and waste, and others, such as biodiversity, water, paper consumption and noise.\n\nOur fundamental aim is to manage all natural resources efficiently , thereby contributing to the protection and conservation of biodiversity. This means optimising the consumption of energy, water and other resources used in our daily operations.\n\nWe set ourselves the following targets:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess nature-related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities , both in our direct operations and in our value chain.\n- \u00b7 Apply the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimise, restore and offset) for limiting the potential adverse impacts on biodiversity from network deployment projects and the operation of our infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Establish partnerships and share best practices with other companies in the telecommunications sector to maximise the positive impact on biodiversity conservation.\n- \u00b7 Improve employee awareness to encourage responsible and efficient use of resources.",

Policies GRI 2-23\n\nThe results show that there are greater dependencies and impacts across the supply chain than in Telef\u00f3nica's direct operations.\n\nWe have various internal regulations that guide the Company towards improving its environmental performance. They include commitments such as efficiency in water management and protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, which are key to improving Telef\u00f3nica's natural capital.\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental Policy.\n- \u00b7 Supply Chain Sustainability Policy.\n- \u00b7 Energy Management Policy.\n\nWe also involve our suppliers, who, by accepting Telef\u00f3nica's policies, undertake to comply with applicable environmental legislation, implement eco-efficiency criteria and protect biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.19. Responsible supply chain management\n\n## 2.4.4. Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's management of biodiversity risks and opportunities starts with identifying and assessing nature-related dependencies and impacts .\n\nAfter an initial assessment, which included analysing and quantifying the direct impacts of non-linear infrastructures (base stations, buildings, etc.) in the countries in which we operate, the main conclusion was that 98% of our facilities are located in habitats with low or very low biodiversity value, such as urban areas. Furthermore, we do not have facilities located in habitats with high value, which means that our direct impact on biodiversity is not very significant .\n\nWe have also analysed the impacts and dependencies on natural capital at a corporate level, both for our direct operations and those of our suppliers. Internationally recognised protocols, methodologies and tools, such as the Natural Capital Protocol (NCP), ENCORE (from UNEPWCMC) and the Sectoral Materiality Tool (SBTN) were used for this assessment.\n\nWe have examined the contribution of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's economic activities to the main drivers of biodiversity loss and the dependencies of these activities on the ecosystem services provided by nature, both for our direct operations and for our supply chain.\n\n## 98% of Telef\u00f3nica's facilities are located in habitats with low or very low biodiversity value.\n\nTo carry out its activities, the Company needs a number of services provided by nature, known as ecosystem services . Telef\u00f3nica mainly depends on regulating services , which are ecological processes that enhance or make life possible, such as flood and storm protection, climate regulation and erosion control. It is important to keep habitats and soil in good condition, as both of these environmental elements act as a protective buffer for the Company's facilities by mitigating the risks associated with adverse natural events or accidents.\n\nIn terms of impacts, Telef\u00f3nica's direct operations do not contribute significantly to the drivers of biodiversity and natural capital loss (resource exploitation, pollution, etc.). However, some medium-level impacts have been identified in relation to land- and sea-use changes, water consumption (especially in water-stressed areas) and climate change.\n\nBased on the information from the impact and dependencies assessment, we are working to identify nature-related risks and opportunities , using the reporting framework provided by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). The TNFD identifies three types of risks and opportunities: physical, transition and systemic.\n\nLastly, regarding water resource management, the most significant issue is water scarcity . This is even more acute in water-stressed areas, where a decrease in water availability could lead to a range of problems (e.g. a potential impact on business continuity or on our relationship with local communities).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Action plan and commitments GRI 2-23, 3-3\n\nIn line with the commitment to protect biodiversity and ecosystems as established in our Environmental Policy, we are developing a biodiversity strategy , which will set out our roadmap and define the mechanisms needed to achieve it.\n\n## 2.4.5.1. Interface with natural capital\n\nTNFD is a global initiative that provides a framework for factoring nature into financial and business decisions, enabling businesses to analyse their nature-related performance.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we are working to adopt the TNFD recommendations, focusing on identifying and assessing the nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities of our activities.\n\n## 2.4.5.2. Mitigation hierarchy\n\nThe deployment and maintenance processes that support the operation of our networks sometimes implies the ecosystems' land use change.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica applies the mitigation hierarchy , identifying and avoiding the potential impacts of the deployment, operation and dismantling of its telecommunications networks through prescriptive Environmental Impact Assessment processes.\n\nFurthermore, in order to minimise non-avoidable impacts on the environment, we adopt best practices such as noise insulation measures when necessary and colocation of our facilities with other operators. This enables us to optimise land occupation and reduce our visual impact, energy consumption and waste generation.\n\nWe also implement eco-efficiency measures, carry out preventive maintenance of infrastructure, promote the use of renewable energy and replace equipment with energy-efficient equipment or encourage its internal reuse. This allows us to optimise our water, paper and energy consumption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2. Energy and climate change\n\nFor further information, see 2.3. Circular economy\n\nLastly, and whenever necessary, we implement corrective and compensatory measures for affected resources.\n\n## 2.4.5.3. Partnerships and initiatives\n\nWe believe that sharing opinions and experiences concerning natural capital is essential to making all our stakeholders aware of the value of biodiversity.\n\nThat is why Telef\u00f3nica participates in related working groups, such as the Natural Capital Working Group of the Spanish Green Growth Group (GECV), the Biodiversity Group of the GSMA and the Nature Focus Area of Nokia's Customer Advisory Council.\n\nWe have also joined the World Economic Forum's 1 trillion trees initiative, under which we have committed to grow and conserve 1.5 million trees between 2020 and 2030. This action will not only avoid and absorb 700,000 tonnes of CO 2 from the atmosphere in ten years, but will also help to conserve forest ecosystems, reducing biodiversity loss.\n\nIn Brazil, we participate in initiatives organised by the Water Thematic Chamber of the Brazilian Business Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS) and the UN Global Compact Platform for Action on Water and Oceans. Its aim is to promote efficient water use and to propose possible reduction measures. Telef\u00f3nica Brazil is also a member of the TNFD Early Adopters initiative.\n\nMoreover, we are committed to driving innovation in digital services and products that contribute to solving environmental problems such as water scarcity and improve our competitiveness and that of our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11. Sustainable supply and innovation\n\n## 2.4.6. Progress in 2023 GRI 3-3\n\n## 2.4.6.1. Interface with natural capital\n\nThe European Central Bank published a paper in late 2023 which found out that in the euro area around three million companies (72% of non-financial corporations) are highly dependent on at least one ecosystem service. In the telecommunications sector, we also need services provided by nature.\n\nIn order to analyse Telef\u00f3nica's interaction with natural capital and biodiversity, in terms of dependencies and impacts , we conducted a natural capital materiality assessment at corporate level during 2023. This study, which considered both direct operations and those of the upstream value chain, will allow us to prioritise which actions should be implemented. For each of Telef\u00f3nica's economic activities, it identified the degree of dependence on ecosystem services and elements of the natural environment, as well as their contribution to the main impact drivers and the specific pressures that generate them.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is the case, for example, with erosion control delivered through vegetation cover or climate regulation provided through the long-term storage of carbon dioxide in soils, vegetable biomass and the oceans.\n\nWe also depend to a lesser extent on production process enablers, such as soil quality, which is provided through weathering, decomposition and fixing processes.\n\nThe table below shows how Telef\u00f3nica's direct operations depend on ecosystem services. Only major dependencies (classified in ENCORE as medium, high or very high) are listed.\n\n## Main dependencies on ecosystem services for direct operations of Telef\u00f3nica\n\ns of\n\n| Ecosystem

Telef\u00f3nica's supply chain depends on ecosystem services such as flood and storm protection, erosion control, water availability (input into the production process) and mitigation of direct impacts associated with a production process.\n\nIn relation to impacts , we used SBTN Sectoral Materiality Tool, which provides an indication of the degree to which different economic activities contribute to the main drivers of natural capital and biodiversity loss. The five drivers of biodiversity loss , identified by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) in its latest report, are detailed in the table below:\n\n## High

This ensures that all environmental impacts are identified and mitigation measures are developed. Measures are also taken to avoid impacts.\n\nEmergency plans are regularly updated for all our facilities. In addition, there are always preventive containment measures in place to minimise soil and water pollution in the event of a potential accident, as well as the possible impact on the vegetation and fauna in the surrounding area. Special attention is given to areas of high biodiversity value.\n\nIn this regard, Telef\u00f3nica Brazil designs base station installation projects, always prioritising locations outside protected natural areas. They also have working instructions that set out guidelines for optimal environmental monitoring, aiming to mitigate the impact of construction activities in their initial stage.\n\nIn order to minimise the impact on ecosystems, preventive/corrective actions are also undertaken. For example, at Distrito Telef\u00f3nica, the corporate headquarters located in Spain, we undertook a study in collaboration with SEO BirdLife on bird collisions with the windows of our buildings. As a result, priority areas were identified and 'bird-saving' patterns have been installed to help birds see that glass is there and prevent collisions.\n\nIn Colombia, ecological and geomorphological restoration plans were carried out during 2023 in areas affected by the dismantling of telecommunications stations located in protected areas, such as the Galeras Fauna and Flora Sanctuary. These initiatives followed the guidelines established by the state agency Parques Nacionales Naturales de Colombia. Activities included recovering the geomorphology and vegetation cover prior to the installation of the telecommunications structure, revegetating with species typically found in the 'superparamo' ecosystem. All restoration projects are followed up and monitored in order to ensure their sustainability over time.\n\nFurthermore, under Telef\u00f3nica's offsetting strategy, our unabated carbon emissions will be removed from the atmosphere preferably through nature-based solutions, such as afforestation, reforestation or sustainable forest management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2. Energy and climate change\n\nWe believe that these regenerative actions have co-benefit for ecosystems that go beyond carbon, such as biodiversity enhancement, deforestation reduction or water quality improvement, while reducing the risk of natural disasters.\n\nThat is why we are part of the \"1 trillion trees\" initiative, a World Economic Forum platform. By joining it, we have pledged to conserve and plant 1.5 million trees. So far, the conservation and reforestation projects in which Telef\u00f3nica has invested, together with corporate volunteering initiatives related to reforestation projects, led to the restoration of 579 hectares, the conservation or planting of over 300,000 trees and the sequestration of 167,000 tonnes of CO 2 e.\n\n## Water\n\n## GRI 303-5\n\nIn 2023, our overall water consumption was 2,785 ML (2.8 Hm\u00b3), of which 717 ML was in high water-stress areas and represents 26% of the total. This consumption was mainly due to sanitary use and to a lesser extent due to its use in air conditioning. For this reason, in each country where we operate we establish specific measures to improve efficiency in water use and reduce consumption , especially in highly water-stressed areas, as is the case in Spain, Chile and Mexico.\n\nOver 1,700 buildings currently have a Sustainable Water Management Plan, which includes measures such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Employee awareness campaigns, including World Day of Water and Conscious Consumption.\n- \u00b7 Clauses being included in building maintenance and cleaning contracts to encourage efficient and responsible water use by our suppliers.\n- \u00b7 Preventive maintenance to avoid leaks in taps, cisterns and water heaters.\n- \u00b7 Water-saving systems and pressure monitors.\n\nIn terms of the measures carried out in areas with high water stress, the following stand out:\n\n- \u00b7 Treatment systems in cooling towers at Telef\u00f3nica Chile.\n- \u00b7 The maintenance of the grey water treatment plant for the reuse and collection of rainwater and the installation of energy-saving devices and sanitary supply valves with sensors that limit consumption in the Torre Telef\u00f3nica building in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The sustainable water use plan implemented at our headquarters in Madrid (Spain), which reduces consumption by collecting rainwater and other watersaving systems in sanitation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Vision\n\nOur employees are crucial in bringing to fruition our new strategic plan: Growth, Profitability and Sustainability (GPS). This program raises our level of ambition and calls for a shift in culture at all levels.\n\nThe need for renewal is heightened by the fact that we are on the verge of celebrating our centenary, with our sights set on building the Telef\u00f3nica of the next 100 years. Furthermore, from the talent perspective, we are experiencing disruptions that require the development of new capabilities and ways of working.\n\nWe have redesigned our culture around four aspects which are going to be our GPS, our navigation system:\n\n- \u00b7 Impact : execution continues to be essential for the sustainability of our business.\n- \u00b7 Collaboration : working together as a team employees, customers and partners - maximises our impact.\n- \u00b7 Transformation : in a digital and dynamic world, we must ensure that our processes and the way we work evolve constantly to become more agile.\n- \u00b7 Growth : the new context requires us to update our skills in a very dynamic way through lifelong learning.\n\n## 95%\n\nof our professionals reported that their work has purpose and meaning in the employee survey.\n\nIn order to implant this updated culture model, we are going to boost our talent management model, designed around managing skills . We empower our people to take the reins in defining their own learning roadmap by using the training and development tools available to them.\n\nWe are enhancing this talent model with a new performance appraisal method to be implemented from 2024 with the goal of helping each of our employees maximise their potential and create the best version of themselves. It is based on ongoing, honest conversations , geared towards supporting development and maximising the impact of each of our employees. It will measure all aspects of our culture: impact, collaboration, transformation and growth.\n\nAnother element we have incorporated is our strong commitment to internal mobility , in order to accelerate professional growth and the acquisition of new skills. We are keen for mobility to be something that occurs at all levels of the organisation, starting at the executive level, encouraging changes in roles on at least a five-yearly basis (although this period may be shorter in the early stages of an employee's career and longer in the latter stages). We understand internal mobility to mean a switch from one business area to another, a different country (while performing the same role), or a significant change of role. There will be initiatives to recognise mobility and it will be taken into account regarding promotions to executive positions.",

This involves adapting the skills of our workforce to the Company's needs and having a simpler operating model. Digitalisation helps us to improve both our network operation processes and those of our customers and internal processes.\n\n## 2.5.2. Targets\n\n- \u00b7 Achieve 37% of our executive positions filled by women by 2027. Reaching this target is linked to the variable remuneration of our employees and is one of our sustainable financing indicators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 1.7. Finance for the transition to a sustainable economy\n\n- \u00b7 Maintain an adjusted gender pay gap of +/-1% by 2024. This was achieved in 2022. This is the basis for progression towards a zero gross pay gap.\n- \u00b7 Achieve gender parity in the Company's highest governance bodies by 2030 (parity is defined as no more than 60% and no less than 40% representation of each gender).\n- \u00b7 Continue to be included in the Bloomberg GenderEquality Index.\n- \u00b7 Maintain a score of at least 70% in the employee motivation survey with regard to work-life balance.\n- \u00b7 Double the number of employees with disabilities within the workforce by 2024, in line with the commitments made to The Valuable 500.\n- \u00b7 Attain an Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) of at least 70.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an internal mobility rate among our executives of 15% per year by 2026 (10% in 2024).\n\n## 2.5.3. Governance\n\nThe strategic lines of action for global talent management and the applicable targets are defined by the Global Human Resources Committee. Meeting on a monthly basis, this committee is made up of the heads of the People department at Telef\u00f3nica's main businesses and operations.\n\nIn addition, the Executive Committee analyses and monitors key aspects of global employee management, from skills and critical talent for the future to Telef\u00f3nica's remuneration and organisational strategy.\n\nPeople-related issues are also regularly reported to three Board committees:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainability and Regulation Committee: key performance indicators linked to company targets, as well as global and local progress on talent management and diversity, in line with the Group's ESG strategy, are presented to the committee once a year.\n- \u00b7 Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee : among other roles, this committee provides reports on appointment proposals for the role of Chairman of the Board, the executive directors and senior executives of the Company. This committee also reviews and supervises the remuneration for these positions.\n- \u00b7 Audit and Control Committee : among other responsibilities, this committee supervises the financial and non-financial risk management and control systems at the Company (including operational, technological, legal, social, environmental, political and reputational risks, as well as corruption-related risks).\n\nWe also have specific bodies and roles for managing our diversity strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.7. Diversity and inclusion\n\nWe have set ourselves an annual target of 10% for internal mobility among our executives in 2024, which will increase to 15% by 2026.\n\n## 2.5.4. Policies\n\nMany of our internal rules and policies are related to the human capital. The following are the most important:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulation of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee.\n- \u00b7 Regulation covering the Hiring of Former Executives and Former Employees of the Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nThe impact of managing human capital affects all areas of the Company and is essential to our business, affecting productivity, employee satisfaction, performance and Telef\u00f3nica's reputation.\n\nThe main risks are related to the constantly evolving needs for new skills within the workforce, which stem from continual technical innovation and the shortage of technological talent in the market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 3. Risks\n\nIn order to ensure that we have the capabilities needed to execute our strategy, we regularly conduct a strategic skill-related planning process (Skills Workforce Planning). We also work to establish a diverse, inclusive and accessible work environment, which allows us to empathise better with our customers, innovate and reflect their diversity in our commercial value proposition. Our hybrid and agile working models represent an opportunity for professional development and for attracting digital talent. Our commitment to health, well-being and work-life balance helps to increase the motivation of our employees and thereby improve our business results.\n\n## 2.5.6. Action plan and commitments\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's people strategy aims to transform and adapt our teams to the context of permanent change in which we operate.\n\nIn this regard, our main lines of action (further explained in the following chapters) are focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 Attraction, retention and skill development : we are shifting towards a model that can guarantee business sustainability and allow our people to thrive and grow. To that end, we foster lifelong learning with largescale reskilling and upskilling programs , and talent management that is based on skills, including leadership skills.\n- \u00b7 Diversity, equality and inclusion by fostering an inclusive work culture and leadership style, including accessible workplaces , to ensure a working environment in which all our people can give their best and progress on an equal footing.\n- \u00b7 Flexible ways of working and agile highperformance ecosystems capable of improving team effectiveness; boosting motivation, talent attraction and a sense of belonging; and fostering innovation and corporate transformation.\n- \u00b7 Occupational health, safety and well-being from a comprehensive vision of the individual that considers mental, emotional and physical factors as the pillars of well-being while encouraging autonomy and responsibility.\n\n## 2.5.6.1. Recognition\n\nWe have received acknowledgement for our efforts both globally and locally from a number of different institutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.6.

Attraction, retention and talent development\n\n## Key points\n\n## 63%\n\nof the new employees joining our team in 2023 were under 35 years old.\n\n## 4.1%\n\nvoluntary turnover rate, decreasing by 1.6 p.p. since 2022.\n\n## 2.6.1. Vision\n\nAttracting, developing and retaining talent is key for the success of our Company. To achieve this, we foster dynamic, inclusive and innovative workplaces in which people feel valued, well-prepared and supported in their professional growth and personal well-being. We aim to be a catalyst in developing talent, by providing opportunities for lifelong learning, upskilling and through the creation and promotion of a community of motivated and high-performance individuals to drive the future of our Company.\n\n## 2.6.2. Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nThe ability of Telef\u00f3nica to adapt to the changes in the work environment is vital for the attraction and retention of talent.\n\nAlso essential is the competitive approach we take to remuneration, which is designed to motivate our professionals. This approach helps us fulfil our strategic goals while promoting the well-being of our workers and generating a positive impact on economic development in the regions in which we operate.\n\n## 81%\n\nof our employees reported in the employee survey that learning forms part of their day-to-day working lives.\n\nOn the other hand, our main challenge is to acquire and evolve the skills necessary to execute the Company's new plan in an environment of technological disruption and critical skills shortages in the market.\n\nIn this respect, growing competition for talent, together with the need to offer increasingly flexible working conditions in order to meet expectations for career development, may pose a risk that could lead to critical employees (particularly those in technical roles and ITrelated positions) to leave the Company.\n\nThis may cause economic losses and have a negative impact on the Company.\n\nHowever, both the efficient management of the factors that enable the attraction and retention of talent and a firm focus on new skills development (through our training plans), represent an opportunity to capture the additional revenues that are particularly associated with digital services.",

Action plan and commitments GRI 404-2\n\nAttracting, developing and retaining talent are fully interconnected aspects of an effective human capital management strategy. By attracting the right talent, retaining valuable employees and continually developing their skills, we can position ourselves for sustainable growth in a constantly changing environment.\n\nThe starting point to organise our talent management strategies is our Skills Workforce Planning . This plan seeks to ensure alignment between the skills we have within the organisation and those we need in order to allow for the growth of our businesses. The process enables us to make the right decisions to close the skills gap, by combining internal skill development with the incorporation of external talent.\n\n- \u00b7 For internal skill development, we promote largescale reskilling and upskilling programs that can develop critical skills for our business while improving the employability of our professionals. We have updated the learning model to personalise and adapt the range of training we offer to the preferences and skills pool of each professional through the SkillsBank platform and artificial intelligence (AI) engines (learning on demand).\n- \u00b7 Attracting the best talent begins by developing an employer brand, communicating our values, vision and commitment, and looking for alignment with these values and our corporate culture in potential candidates. We use digital platforms, social media and networking events, including trade fairs and events at universities specialising in technology, to boost our visibility. The competitive remuneration packages offered, flexible working and an inclusive and diverse corporate culture contribute to creating an attractive and appealing environment for potential new talents.\n\nWe also strengthen our pool of young talent through various programs, such as Talentum (in Spain), the Telef\u00f3nica Digital Transformation (in Germany) and Generaci\u00f3n Movistar (in Hispanoamerica).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.7. Diversity and inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Main initiatives for talent retention\n\n- \u2192 A purpose-driven company (for example, we connect people; remuneration tied to ESG).\n- \u2192 A complete remuneration package (for example, a salary well above the minimum, with benefits in every country).\n- \u2192 Flexible working hours (for example, a hybrid work model for all eligible employees).\n- \u2192 Work-life balance (for example, agreement on the right to disconnect).\n- \u2192 Lifelong training program, under which 70% of employees are on skill development programs (for example, Universitas, free programming courses at Campus 42).\n- \u2192 Involvement in innovative and transformative programs tied to new technologies (for example, metaverse, Web 3.0, NaaS).\n- \u2192 Well-being (for example, 81% of employees believe that Telef\u00f3nica promotes well-being, according to our motivation survey).\n- \u2192 Social implication (for example, the largest corporate volunteering program of any company worldwide).\n- \u2192 Diverse and inclusive environment where difference is valued and empowered (for example, a commitment to double the number of employees with disabilities).\n- \u2192 Team building with international festivals, activities and events (for example, Sondersland).\n\nWe have moved on from a traditional learning model to one focusing on developing skills and abilities through our SkillsBank tool.\n\n- \u00b7 On one hand, we are evolving the profiles and skills of our professionals to meet specific business-related challenges. We offer profile specialisation so our people can remain at the cutting edge (robotisation, cloud, IT sales, data, web developer, 5G, etc.).\n- \u00b7 On the other hand, we provide an open choice of training options so that each employee can play a leading role in their own development. The formats (videos, podcasts, video games, interviews, role play sessions, articles, etc.) are tailored to the needs of each person in hybrid and collaborative environments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This model not only makes more appropriate recommendations based on what similar employees have said about themselves but also learns from the actions taken by employees after those suggestions. This enables us to obtain a better and greater understanding of the skill pool inside Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nThis approach also helps us to improve the career prospects of our employees in an environment of transitioning towards a climate-neutral economy. We are working to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 and, as part of this ambition, we are replacing our networks with more efficient ones. This may mean that some jobs are affected. However, our reskilling programs help by retraining and preparing our workforce in line with how our business is evolving.\n\nIn line with the commitment of the company, in 2022, the Chairman of Telef\u00f3nica was elected as Chair of the Jobs, Skills and Impact Working Group of the European Business Round Table (ERT), an organisation made up by 60 of the largest companies in Europe. Reskilling for Employment (R4E) is one of the most important projects being undertaken by this committee. It is aimed at helping to professionally reskill one million Europeans by 2025.\n\n## 2.6.3.1. Internal mobility\n\nIn our new corporate strategic plan, known as GPS, internal mobility has become one of the most important tools to accelerate professional growth, capture new skills and retain talent. Internal mobility can be understood as a switch from one business area to another, a different country (while performing the same role) or a significant change of role.\n\nAll these initiatives are aimed at fostering the development and promotion of our employees within the Company.\n\n## If we all grow, Telef\u00f3nica grows: our range of development options for employees combines technical and human skills.\n\n## 2.6.3.2. Universitas Telef\u00f3nica GRI 3-3\n\nThis is the exclusive platform on which all our professionals can find a carefully curated range of training experience options designed to accelerate the transformation and achievement of strategic targets for the Company. It is aimed at encouraging uptake of new working and leadership methods, and at fostering a unique culture that defines us and makes us stronger by aligning priorities and empowering employees.\n\nOne year after the inauguration of our Universitas campus based at the Company's headquarters in Madrid (Distrito Telef\u00f3nica), Universitas has become a place where leadership, growth and connection merge, through intensive and interactive residential programs.\n\nWe have created a favourable environment to enable at least two out of every three employees to regularly take part in training and skill development activities.\n\n## 2.6.3.3. Employee satisfaction and commitment\n\nThe commitment of our professionals has always been high on Telef\u00f3nica's agenda and it forms part of our active listening strategy. For several years now, we have been measuring this through the Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS), which indicates the degree to which the Company's employees recommend the organisation by answering the question:",

We now aspire to ensure an eNPS score of at least 70 each year.\n\nTo enable qualitative responses, the survey includes open text fields for comments. These are analysed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and generative AI, while maintaining the anonymous and confidential nature of the data.\n\nThe survey includes questions about workplace environment, leadership, work-life balance, diversity and inclusion, non-discrimination, and environmental and social commitment.\n\nIn addition to the annual measurement, we conduct various internal listening exercises in each of our operations (such as opinion surveys) and regular engagement pulse surveys to gauge the engagement and satisfaction levels of our employees. Our assessment of these exercises takes into account socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, years of service at the Company, professional category and business unit, transforming them into important sources of knowledge in fostering equality and diversity.\n\nThis is all complemented by professional performance appraisals, exit interviews, incident tracking and the availability of a Responsible Business Channel that employees can always use to report conflict situations.\n\n## Formula for calculating the eNPS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.6.3.4. Culture of recognition: Valuable People\n\nThis program aims to promote a culture of meritocracy through personal recognition by leaders towards employees and among employees themselves, giving visibility to those individuals and teams that excel through both their outstanding contribution and their day-to-day behaviour.\n\nIt also recognises \"social volunteers or volunteer teams\" for their extraordinary contribution to a social cause or in an emergency or humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn total, we recorded 243,066 incidents of recognition for colleagues and teams, showing that recognition remains part of Telef\u00f3nica's DNA. We will continue to promote it to connect with our talent. The number of recognitions continues to grow above the number of employees because each employee can receive several of them.",

How to assess effort GRI 2-19, 2-20, 201-3\n\n## By way of example, the social benefits offered by the\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's remuneration strategy is characterised by its competitiveness. Our main focus is to attract, retain and motivate the Company's professionals so that we can meet our strategic objectives within the globalised framework in which we operate and foster the generation of long-term value in a sustainable manner for our shareholders.\n\nIn this regard, the variable remuneration of our employees encourages growth by increasing operating income and return on investment for shareholders, as well as efficiency through improving our OIBDA margin and generating free cash flow. Similarly, Telef\u00f3nica is a company that is fully committed to sustainability . Factors such as customer trust, the trust of society at large, diversity or the contribution of our company to the fight against climate change have therefore influenced the calculation of the variable remuneration of our workforce since 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.15. Governance and culture of sustainability\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is a company that fosters meritocracy and equal opportunities . We therefore offer a competitive and fair remuneration package that can comprise fixed amounts and both short- and long-term variable amounts (tied to the achievement of financial, business, value creation and sustainability targets, which should be specific, quantifiable and aligned with the Company's strategic plan). Additionally, we offer remuneration in kind and other social benefits adapted to local practices in the markets where we operate, allowing for customisation and tax efficiency through flexible compensation plans.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's professionals are consistently remunerated according to their level of responsibility, leadership and performance within the organisation. To maintain this premise, we ensure that we do not discriminate based on gender, age, origin, sexual orientation and identity, religion, disability or race when applying remuneration practices and policies.\n\nSimilarly, Telef\u00f3nica is committed to ensuring that the salaries paid to all its employees are decent and always exceed what is considered to be the \"living wage\" . This not only allows basic needs to be met but also guarantees good quality of life in each of the countries where the Group operates. Thanks to these actions, Telef\u00f3nica has received no reports of disputes related to this issue.\n\nCompany include universal health insurance for employees at every operation, which covers the needs of people with disabilities and the costs associated with issues relating to mental and reproductive health, among others. We also offer life insurance, a pension fund, share purchase program, discount programs, childcare assistance (including assistance at infant and school level and encompassing the period from birth to 24 years old, depending on the Group company), nursery services and food assistance, among other things. All these benefits increase job quality.\n\nThe Company offers leave options that are in compliance with the minimum levels established by law, and in many cases exceed them. For example, Telef\u00f3nica provides a number of personal days which, depending on the Group company, ranges between two and four days, as well as alternatives for adapting our employees' working days to achieve work-life balance in situations that require family care services. These take into account blood relatives of the employee up to the second degree of kinship. Also, the Company offers maternity and paternity leave that exceeds the minimal legal requirements.\n\nOur social benefits are especially focused on improving well-being for our employees. They help to maintain physical and mental health while supporting families and adapting healthcare coverage to new circumstances and needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.9. Safety, health and wellbeing at work\n\nThe emotional salary is another relevant factor with which to foster the retention and motivation of our professionals and to attract the best talent. This is expressed through new ways of working, work-life balance, psychological well-being, a strong commitment to learning and professional development, and a culture of commitment and recognition of our employees.\n\nFurthermore, in 2022 Telef\u00f3nica launched an incentivised global share purchase plan - 'Plan 100' aimed at all employees of the Group, without exception. For every share bought under this plan, until it ends in 2024, Telef\u00f3nica rewards the buyer with another share. In addition, as part of our Company's centenary celebrations, each employee who takes part in the plan will receive 100 additional shares for free.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica also has different social welfare systems in each geographic region where we operate. In Spain, most of the companies in the Telef\u00f3nica Group have a",

Empleados de Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a, FP, is a uni-plan while Fonditel B, FP, is a multi-plan.\n\nBoth pension funds have been set up as private and voluntary Social Welfare Institutions that complement and are independent from the Public Social Security system.\n\nThe Pension Plans belong to the employment system and are based on defined contributions, with compulsory contributions from the fund sponsors and the participants.\n\nGenerally speaking, the ordinary compulsory contributions from the sponsor of Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a, FP, consist of 6.87% of the participant's base salary provided that the participant joined Telef\u00f3nica Spain before 1 July 1992, and 4.51% of the participant's base salary if they joined the Company after 30 June 1992. In turn, the participant must contribute 2.2% of their base salary.\n\nIn the case of Fonditel B, FP, each pension plan has its own contribution scheme which, generally speaking, requires the sponsor to contribute 4.51% of the participant's base salary while the participant must contribute 2.2% of their base salary.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023., the number of participants and beneficiaries stood at 24,337 and 10,930 under employees of Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a, and 18,540 and 234 under Fonditel B.\n\nThe annual contributions from the sponsor in 2023 amounted to \u20ac41.1 million under Empleados de Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a, and \u20ac28.9 million under Fonditel B.\n\nWith regard to our Board of Directors, we have a Remuneration Policy of the Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., which ensures compliance with best practices in the area of good governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 5.1. Annual Report on Remuneration\n\n## 2.6.3.6. Performance reviews GRI 404-3\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has a worldwide performance review process for all employees of the Group. The same timetable, guidelines and tools are shared everywhere. The review model measures different factors, ranging from achieving pre-set targets to developing new skills and teamwork. The appraisal process is based around agile feedback conversations, which take place at least twice a year. Although the process is coordinated globally, it is managed locally so as to better adapt to the needs of our\n\nbusiness. The outcome of the reviews affects our employees' compensation and their opportunities for development and promotion.\n\n## Percentage of employees subject to performance reviews\n\n|                           |                          | 2022   | 2023   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                           | Men                      | 48%    | 49%    |\n|                           | Women                    | 50%    | 51%    |\n| By professional  category | Senior  Management       | 50%    | 49%    |\n| By professional  category | Middle  Management Other | 53%    | 53%    |\n| By professional  category | Professionals            | 48%    | 49%    |\n\n## 2.6.4. Progress in 2023\n\n## 2.6.4.1. eNPS\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's eNPS has been consistently high for years: a score of over 40 is considered to be exceptional and there are few companies that score above 60. In 2023, our score rose by 7 to reach 76, thereby consolidating Telef\u00f3nica as the IBEX company with the highest published eNPS. Our employee participation level was 81%, which is also considered very high among motivation survey benchmarks.\n\nIn 2023, the number of our employees who we can consider to be promoters went up by 4,000 people compared to 2022. Promoters are employees who, when asked the question \"How likely would you be to recommend your company to people close to you as a good place to work?\", give an answer of nine or ten out of 10. Moreover, the segments of passives (ratings of seven and eight out of 10) and detractors (six out of 10 or under) decreased.\n\nThe eNPS improved consistently across all our operations. A noteworthy case is that of Germany, which achieved the highest growth in the Group (up 12 points compared to 2022).\n\nThere are many reasons that explain the overall improvement in the Company's eNPS. These include our focus on measures that foster work-life balance and wellbeing, updating our employees' salaries against a backdrop of inflation, the working environment and team, and the growing range of training available for all our employees.\n\nThanks to the use of generative AI, we were able to analyse the responses to free-text questions and the 62,277 comments made by our employees. This allowed us to ascertain that well-being and achieving a good balance between their working and personal lives",

In addition, new employees (those who have been at the Company for less than two years) rated us with an eNPS of over 80 points, more than four points higher than the previous year.\n\n## 2.6.4.2. Training and development GRI 3-3, 404-1, 404-2\n\nAccording to the annual motivation survey, 81% of our employees feel that learning has been incorporated into their day-to-day work.\n\nOur SkillsBank development platform is available to almost 92,000 employees, more than 55,000 of whom (50,000 in 2022) have already uploaded their profiles.\n\nThe increase of these figures is partly due to our inclusion of machine learning algorithms in the learning suggestions. The platform has offered 5,256,331 suggestions, and 97.9% of the suggestions considered by employees have been accepted.\n\nIn 2023, we performed a proof of concept (PoC) and analysed additional AI tools to spur us towards our goal of being a skill-based organisation.\n\nOur professionals completed in excess of 1.7 million courses , with an average of 16 courses and 30 hours of training per employee. The decrease in average hours of training compared to 2022, when each employee completed an average of 35 hours of training, was a result of the impact of the Power of Connections programme that ran in 2022, as well as the updating of our Responsible Business Principles course that same year.\n\nUniversitas ran over 70 programmes, with an impact of around 11,000 people . Drawing on a joint team, including the heads of training in the different regions, in 2023 the range of programmes offered by Universitas was smaller but the programmes were taught more frequently, in three languages and in various formats (virtual, hybrid and in-person). They had the goal of enabling the professionals to learn key skills necessary to executing the business plan. It achieved an eNPS of 83 (seven points above 2022) which is far above the average reflected by various training benchmarks in Spain.\n\nWe also had new programs that focused on the skills identified as critical, such as growth mentality, digital thinking, effective communication and resultsoriented approach , so as to meet the needs expressed by the local operations and to complement local upskilling and reskilling initiatives.\n\nThe digital thinking program was particularly interesting, as it featured AI combined with the human touch that characterises Universitas. It also involved our business (with the AI Ethics team participating in the teaching).\n\nNow that the health emergency situation is over, we have restarted our face-to-face programs (which are longer and go into greater depth) for our leadership teams, with an Advanced Leadership Programme that covers not only skills-related content but also strategic vision and networking.\n\nIn 2023, 70% of our employees invested in learning and developing new skills needed for the future through various skill acquisition (reskilling/upskilling) programs. This percentage dropped by eight points compared to the previous year, due to the large-scale implementation in 2022 of the Power of Connections programme for all the Company's employees.\n\nThe programmes run in 2023 included:\n\n- \u00b7 In Spain, for B2B, the Manual for the Unstoppable , a course designed to build on the progress in the commercial transformation of the team. It is intended to promote work organisation on a project-by-project basis, thus fostering collaboration and customer impact. Over 4,000 professionals from the various business lines and segments took part in the training.\n- \u00b7 In Brazil, Lean Six Sigma training was completed by 3,076 workers. In addition, to enhance skill improvement and career advancement, the digital training was divided into four key pillars - Yo+ Creativo, Yo+ Digital, Yo+ Humano, Yo+ Protagonista - and involved a total of 1,500 participants.\n- \u00b7 In Germany, digital skills development programs for non-technological roles were conducted, in which over 1,200 people took part. The Agile Learning Journey programme was also run for over 150 workers. Through a specialised course entitled \"Data and Artificial Intelligence\", 500 employees were successfully retrained and now perform data analysis and programming tasks.\n- \u00b7 In Hispanoamerica, critical skills training, which was given to more than 14,000 employees in 2023, while over 5,900 individuals completed specific courses on business intelligence and big data, digital linking, IT and agility through our schools.

Attracting new talent\n\nIn 2023, we continued to boost our young talent, while investing in new skills through selective recruitment processes, by means of various programmes such as Talentum in Spain, 42 and the 'Estagio' apprenticeship programme in Brazil, where 829 placements were taken up, 10% more than in 2022. 54% of the places were taken by Black candidates. In 2023, 63% of our new hires globally were aged under 35, up 3% compared to 2022.\n\nIn Germany, the number of new employees hired doubled in 2023. We also achieved an intern retention rate of 65.4%.\n\nIn 2023, Talentum (Telef\u00f3nica Spain's platform for boosting young talent and facilitating access to the job market) offered 156 grants, of which 38% were given to women. In Spain, we also conducted a study to assess how young Spaniards perceive Telef\u00f3nica as an employer brand, with the ultimate goal of attracting that talent. The study consisted of two parts - a qualitative analysis involving six focus groups made up of young people in Madrid and Barcelona and a quantitative analysis based on over 500 interviews.\n\n## 2.6.4.4. Performance review model GRI 404-3\n\nThe results of our motivation survey were positive and serve as an indicator to confirm that the Company is ready to take one step further in its performance review model.\n\n- \u00b7 Of all our employees, 84% stated they feel comfortable giving feedback to their manager.\n\n- \u00b7 Additionally, 78% stated that their manager frequently talks about their contribution level and skill development.\n\nA total of 51,586 employees were assessed in the last performance review (for 2022), which was conducted between March 2022 and March 2023\n\n## At Telef\u00f3nica, we are changing our performance review model to bring it into line with the flexible work model and new professional skills.\n\nLooking forward (to 2024), we are going to introduce a new performance appraisal method based on ongoing, honest conversations , geared not towards assessing but towards supporting development and maximising the impact of each of our employees. This new method will measure all the aspects of our culture: impact, collaboration, transformation and growth.\n\nIn addition, through local recognition programmes (such as Brazil's \"Eu+Vivo\", which resulted in more than 169,000 positive acknowledgements being awarded in its two editions) and alongside our global programme \"Valuable People' we have more than doubled the number of positive acknowledgements compared to 2022.\n\n## 2.6.4.5. Remuneration strategy\n\n34% of Telef\u00f3nica's employees are also shareholders in the Company (that is, one in every three employees). In 2022, we launched the 5th edition of an incentivised global share purchase plan -'Plan 100' - which was offered to all employees of the Group on the same terms. The plan will end on 19 April 2024, coinciding with the Company's centenary.\n\n## 2.6.4.6. Employee turnover\n\nIn 2023, we updated the mechanism for calculating employee turnover in order to facilitate our analysis and interpretation of the results.\n\nTotal turnover includes all people leaving the Company, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, due to an incentivised Company redundancy scheme, or due to retirement or death. The percentage of total turnover is calculated by dividing the total number of leavers by the average workforce for the period under analysis. In 2023, the total turnover rate was 12.4%, which was more than 10 p.p. below turnover in 2022. The main reason for this reduction was the deconsolidation from the scope of\n\n<!-- image -->",

An additional reason is the reduction in the number of leaves due to incentivised Company redundancy schemes, from 3.217 in 2022 to 518 in 2023.\n\nExcluding the impact of Tempotel in this indicator, the turnover rate would have fallen 5 p.p. in 2023, from 17% to 12%..\n\nThe voluntary turnover figure includes all people leaving as a result of employee resignations. The percentage of voluntary turnover is calculated by dividing the number of this type of leaver by the average workforce for the period under analysis. In 2023, voluntary turnover amounted to 4.1%, which was a reduction of 1.7 p.p. compared to 2022. The reduction in voluntary turnover was particularly marked in the segment of employees aged under 35, falling from 11.9% in 2022 to 8.3%, thanks to our efforts to retain critical profiles in businesses such as Brazil and TTech.\n\nAdjusted turnover consists of voluntary leavers, dismissals and people leaving due to redundancy plans. The adjusted turnover rate is calculated by dividing the number of these types of leavers by the average workforce.\n\nThe breakdown of the turnover by different groups (gender and age) is calculated by dividing the total number of leavers by the average workforce for the corresponding group. For example, the voluntary turnover rate of employees aged under 35 in Germany is calculated by taking the total number of leavers aged under 35 and dividing it by the average workforce aged under 35 in Germany.\n\n## 2.6.4.7. Recognition\n\n- \u00b7 Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI), which aims to improve the transparency and accountability of companies in terms of their workforce and supply chain, awards Telef\u00f3nica with an average score of 90% - more than 20 points above the sector average - and 28 above the average for all participating companies.\n- \u00b7 For a further year, we were included in the list of the 25 Top Companies on LinkedIn. This list recognises the Spanish companies that foster the long-term professional success of their employees.\n- \u00b7 In the 14th edition of the Randstad Awards, Telef\u00f3nica achieved the distinction of being the favourite company for working in the telecommunications sector in Spain.\n- \u00b7 For the third consecutive year, Vivo was included among the top 10 companies to work for in Brazil, according to Great Place To Work.\n\n## Milestones\n\n- \u008c The participation rate for our eNPS survey was 81%.\n- \u008d In 2023, 91,900 professionals were active on SkillsBank, our skill development platform.\n- \u008e In 2023, 16,459 employees found new career opportunities inside the Group.",

This type of leave has a maximum term of 3 years calculated from the date of birth (adoption or foster placement). During this period of leave, state financial aid can be applied for, which serves as compensation if after the birth of the child the employee works less or does not work at all for a while.\n\n## Parental leave\n\n## GRI 401-3\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                    | 2022   | 2022   | 2022   | 2023   | 2023   | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                    | Men    | Women  | Total  | Men    | Women  | Total  |\n| Total number of employees who were entitled to parental leave                                                                                                      | 17,531 | 9,880  | 27,411 | 17,803 | 9,974  | 27,777 |\n| Total number of employees who took parental leave                                                                                                                  | 524    | 227    | 751    | 544    | 291    | 835    |\n| Total number of employees who returned to work during the  period subject to this report after concluding their parental leave                                     | 521    | 244    | 765    | 514    | 256    | 770    |\n| Total number of employees who returned to work after concluding  their parental leave and who were still employed by Telef\u00f3nica 12  months after returning to work | 468    | 209    | 677    | 499    | 271    | 770    |\n| Rate of return to work by employees who take parental leave                                                                                                        | 99%    | 98%    | 99%    | 99%    | 99%    | 99%    |\n| Rate of retention for employees who took parental leave in the last  12 months                                                                                     | 92%    | 90%    | 91%    | 94%    | 94%    | 94%    |\n\nThe data for this indicator are based on the number of employees included within the scope for Spain.

We are already monitoring the number of employees availing themselves of maternity and paternity leave through our internal systems.\n\nRate of return to work by employees who take parental leave: the number of employees who return to work after taking maternity or paternity leave / the number of employees who should return to work after taking such leave.\n\nRetention rate: the number of employees who remain in their post 12 months after returning to work following maternity or paternity leave / the number of employees who return to work after concluding such leave in the previous year.",

Governance\n\nWe have internal bodies and roles in place that track our progress in these areas. They also monitor compliance with performance indicators and alignment with strategic targets and ensure the involvement of senior management.\n\n- \u00b7 Global Diversity Council: made up of top-level executives, its purpose is to promote the Company's diversity strategy. This body also monitors and keeps track of the Company's main indicators and targets in this regard.\n- \u00b7 Transparency Committee: made up of the Chairman and four executives, it ensures the presence of both genders in the shortlists for internal and external selection processes for management positions.\n\n## +1,090\n\nemployees with disabilities in Telef\u00f3nica's workforce than last year.\n\n- \u00b7 Chief Diversity Officer: this role supports the Diversity Council and the People department. Since 2017, the position has been filled by Laura Abasolo, the current Chief Financial and Control Officer, Head of Telef\u00f3nica Hispam and member of the Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7 Diversity Champions: team leaders who act as internal agents of change in all areas of the Company.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring Committees for local Equality Plans.\n\n## 2.7.3. Policies\n\nThey govern the Company's commitment to diversity and inclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 The Global Diversity and Inclusion Policy: guarantees equal opportunities and non-discriminatory, fair and impartial treatment of people in all areas of our Company, without prejudice related to nationality, ethnic origin, skin colour, marital status, family responsibility, religion, age, disability, social status, political opinion, HIV or health status, gender, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.\n- \u00b7 The Diversity Policy in relation to the Board of Directors and the Selection of Directors: ensures that proposals to appoint or re-elect Directors are based on a prior analysis of the competencies required by the Board of Directors, favouring diversity in terms of knowledge, experience, age and gender.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nAs a company that operates in various different environments, we are aware of the impact we can have on society. Managing diversity and inclusion fosters equity: it reduces the pay gap and prevents discrimination arising out of weak regulatory frameworks. It also improves people's employability, regardless of their circumstances.\n\nThe main risk we face is the potential loss of talent caused by a non-inclusive work environment. That is why our commitment to diversity and inclusion is so important, as it strengthens our appeal as an employer brand. It also promotes a good workplace climate and reinforces our employees' sense of belonging, positively impacting their productivity and results.\n\nIn addition to being an ethical and business imperative, managing diversity helps to ensure compliance with legislation on harassment and discrimination and accessibility in the workplace, and to mitigate the associated risks.\n\nIt also represents an opportunity for us to be a more innovative company, aligned with the demands of an increasingly diverse market which prizes companies commitment to inclusion. Also, a firm commitment to diversity improves the Company's prospects in tenders involving large customers. Additionally, it helps to attract investment and financing linked to sustainability criteria.\n\n## 2.7.5. Action plan and commitments GRI 3-3\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's strategic lines for diversity and inclusion are established globally by the Global Diversity Council and are in line with the Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IROs) mentioned earlier. They are adapted and developed locally, taking into account the business priorities and the socio-cultural context of each country.\n\nIn order to move forward, the Company has marked out plans of action with specific deadlines linked to public and quantitative targets in the short, medium and long term.\n\n## Our target is for 37% of our executive positions to be held by women by 2027.\n\n- \u00b7 In the short term, in addition to working to increase the proportion of women in our workforce, we set a target of achieving a situation in which 37% of our executive positions are filled by women by 2027 1 and of an adjusted gender pay gap of +/-1% by 2024 (we achieved the latter target in 2022). In addition, we want to double the number of employees with disabilities by 2024.\n- \u00b7 In the medium term, we aim to achieve gender parity in the Company's highest governing bodies by 2030 2 . With regard to the Board of Directors, this target was accomplished in 2023, when women made up 40% of the Board's members. Meanwhile, in the long term we aspire to close the gross gender pay gap (which according to international estimates will not be achieved globally until 2154 3 ).\n\nCompliance with the target for women in executive positions (37% by 2027) tripled its weight in the calculation of our employees' variable compensation, from 1% in 2021 to 3% in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.15.

At a local level, protocols for action in cases of workplace harassment or bullying, sexual harassment and discrimination are put in place in accordance with applicable legislation and, where appropriate, with worker representatives. In addition, in Telef\u00f3nica Hispam, we use a tool leveraging artificial intelligence that allows us to easily recognize possible cases of harassment.\n\nFurthermore, the whistleblowing channel allows all employees and stakeholders to report, anonymously or personally, any form of harassment or discrimination they have experienced.\n\nAt a global level, we have a Procedure for the Management of the Internal Reporting System that applies to cases of workplace and sexual harassment and violence. This sets out the remediation process: receipt and acceptance for processing of all reports and complaints, procedure for the investigation and designation of an inspector, decision, corrective measures, and the reporting and storing of this information. In order to adapt and improve its response, the Company compiles and analyses data broken down by gender on the conclusions reached regarding complaints of violence and harassment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.16. Ethics and compliance\n\n## 2.7.5.2. Committed to equal pay: closing the pay gap\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we apply the principle of equal pay for the same work or for work of equal value. That means equal pay for equal work regardless of the employee's gender.\n\nWe conduct detailed analyses of gender pay data within the Group in order to identify possible inequalities and establish measures to rectify them. We do this by taking into consideration all items related to salary, benefits and other short- and long-term incentives.\n\nThe external audit performed on this report includes the auditing of our gender pay gap data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see Auditor's report\n\nGender pay inequalities or gaps are based on a comparison between the average total pay of men versus the average total pay of women in the workforce.\n\nIn making this comparison, it is important to understand the way the comparison is made, what items are included and how the difference between the average total pay of men and women is measured.\n\nIf we only compare average total pay, without taking into account factors other than gender, we are talking about the gross pay gap, which is calculated in the following way for each of the countries:\n\nHowever, if we wanted to perform the same calculation at a global level, we would be mixing up the socioeconomic circumstances of each of the countries where the Company is present. Therefore, the calculation of the gross pay gap for the Group (which was reduced to 16.1% in 2023, 0.66 p.p. reduction) has been weighted based on the number of employees present in each of the countries:\n\nThat being said, if we include factors that objectively define the salary of our employees, such as country, legal entity, professional category, functional area in which each employee works, seniority, working time pattern (full-time or part-time) and market reference code, then we are talking about the adjusted pay gap (0.71% in 2023). We calculate this by using a machine learning technique known as a linear regression model. It allows us to detect the impact of gender when other factors have been taken into consideration.",

As a starting point, we must ensure that men and women earn the same pay for the same job.\n- \u00b7 Increasing the proportion of women in the Company and focusing particularly on executive positions ( 32.8% in 2023) and income generation positions ( 49% in 2023).\n- \u00b7 Promoting gender parity in the Company's highest governing bodies. In 2023, women made up 40%% of the members of the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Strengthening our commitment to work-life balance and co-responsibility. Raising awareness and new flexible working models are key elements in achieving this.\n- \u00b7 Increasing the weight and prominence of women in digital and STEM environments.

In addition, we develop career acceleration and visibility enhancement programs for female employees, which aim to train them in leadership skills and enrich their network of contacts.\n\nFurthermore, we implement measures to facilitate worklife balance and promote a cultural change with the aim of encouraging co-responsibility for care among our male and female employees, after identifying that a lack of coresponsibility hinders women's professional development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.8. New ways of working\n\n## We increased the number of our employees with disabilities to 2,572, bringing us closer to our target of over 2,700 people by 2024.\n\nWith regard to people with disabilities , in line with our target of doubling the number of employees with disabilities by 2024, we promote their integration through agreements with external entities, prioritising the search for professional profiles that meet the Company's technological and digital needs. We also provide the tools and assistance necessary throughout their employee journey to enable successful integration and performance of their duties. In addition, we offer courses and guides to ensure \"attitudinal accessibility\" on our teams.\n\nAt the same time, we are committed to the accessibility of our workplace facilities and services for employees, as well as that of our digital resources by adapting computer systems, channels and equipment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.12. Digital inclusion\n\nIn terms of generational diversity , we have programs for talent development and empowerment of young professionals. We are positive that attracting the best young talent is key to driving digital transformation. In addition, we promote internal mobility and the inclusion of all age groups in our development programs. Also, we have initiatives to promote the employability of those aged over 50 and to promote intergenerational diversity.\n\nRegarding racial diversity , in those locations where legislation allows for it, we monitor the number of employees by ethnicity and have initiatives to attract and promote leadership among professionals from the \"global majority\". Ultimately, we are working to close the ethnicity pay gap and we foster the careers of people with a migrant background in the technology sector.\n\nWe are also committed to ensuring that our LGBT+ employees work in environments where they can give their best. In this regard, in addition to raising awareness and visibility and to supporting employee resource groups, we have specific initiatives to attract and promote the development and well-being of transgender people. Furthermore through the guide to the gender transitioning process at work, we aim to guide both the transitioning employee and their manager through the whole process. In several countries we have trained our human resources teams in the inclusion of trans and nonbinary talent and, in particular, in the United Kingdom we have a specific health policy for these groups.\n\nWe have also implemented measures that have an impact on our employees' families:\n\n- \u00b7 We offer specific benefits for LGBT+ couples and parents that go beyond the legal requirements.\n- \u00b7 Telef\u00f3nica has been linked in Spain since 1973 with ATAM, a private social protection system for the families of employees with disabilities and dependency. The association offers comprehensive and expert advice, as well as direct financial support.\n\nFurthermore, in relation to our supply chain , we include diversity criteria in the assessment of our high-risk suppliers through an external tool.

Over 1,070 women are working as technicians in Peru and Colombia. The program has been recognised by the UN Global Compact for its good practices in sustainable development.\n\nSimilarly to the Mujeres en Red program in Hispanoam\u00e9rica, in Brazil, Mulheres de Fibra has enabled 408 women to successfully integrate into the telecommunications labor market through our partner companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.7.5.6.

Progress in 2023\n\nThe percentage of Telef\u00f3nica employees who stated they worked in a company where they felt included , and where equal opportunities were promoted, held at 91% in 2023 , according to the annual climate survey.\n\nIn addition, 84% (two p.p. above the 2022 results) said they believed that everyone's ideas were listened to and properly taken into consideration, regardless of who expressed them, their position, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation or identity, ethnicity, origin, disability or personal background.\n\nThe Company is fully committed to inclusion and requires both its Management and the Board of Directors to share this commitment. Prompted by this, in 2023 we organised training sessions for the directors in which we addressed all the pertinent strategic issues for the Company.\n\n## 2.7.6.1. Gender equality\n\nIn 2023 we achieved gender parity on our Board of Directors (understood as when each gender makes up between 40% and 60% of its members), upon increasing the percentage of women on the Board to 40%. In addition, the percentage of women executives increased by 1.8 p.p., reaching 32.8% in 2023. This figure leaves us, one year ahead of schedule, 0.2 p.p. short of the target\n\nwe have been pursuing for the past few years: 33% women executives in 2024. Looking ahead to the future, we raise our ambitions for 2027 in this field: increasing this figure to 37% in 2027, in line with our sustainable financing criteria.\n\nIn relation to the pay gap , we reduced the adjusted pay gap to 0.7%, remaining in line with the Group-wide target of 1% by 2024.\n\nIn addition to having diverse teams, an inclusive leadership style is essential to achieving our targets in all areas of diversity. Along these lines, in 2023, over 3,000 people attended sessions (linked to the 'AllyUp' programme) on inclusive leadership, gender dynamics and the management of high-performing, flexible teams.\n\nWith the aim of promoting equality at all hierarchical levels and closing the gender pay gap, in 2023 we implemented a number of initiatives to accelerate the careers of our female employees, develop the pipeline of pre-executive talent and attract female talent. Some examples below:\n\n- \u00b7 Empowering Women, which is aimed at promoting female leadership among all the women at the Company. This initiative addresses the key issues and barriers faced by women who want to lead. Approximately 250 women participated in 2023.\n- \u00b7 In Spain, we launched the Female Talent Boost Programme, with 180 participants. This initiative seeks to prepare participants for positions with more responsibility by fostering a broader outlook, selfconfidence and leadership skills.\n- \u00b7 The Futura leadership programme in Hispanoamerica, which in 2023 had over 200 participants and resulted in 139 women being certified. We also provided leadership training for women at all levels of the organisation, including the Women and Leaders workshop, which was attended by 332 participants in 2023. In addition, the New Masculinities workshop had 103 male participants during the year.\n\nAmong our operations, we launched specific vacancies and scholarship programmes for women. In Brazil, in 2023, 320 women-only positions were opened in over 20 cities. Furthermore, in the same country 52% of the scholarships were occupied by women, reaching figures of over 40% in business areas and technical areas such as engineering.\n\nWe are also working to promote the presence of women and young people in STEM careers and the field of entrepreneurship outside the confines of the Company through a total of 44 initiatives worldwide 4 .

Moreover, of all the employees who were promoted to executive positions during the year, 46% were women.\n\nIn Spain, with regard to work-life balance, in addition to being part of the 'Yo No Renuncio por la conciliaci\u00f3n' network of companies, in 2023 we worked with the Club de Malasmadres on a thorough internal assessment that enabled us to understand the barriers our employees face when trying to achieve a suitable work-life balance and their perceptions of the situation. The results of the assessment were shared internally and will be used to make further improvements.\n\n## 2.7.6.2. Disabilities\n\nGRI 405-1\n\nIn terms of disabilities , and in line with the target of doubling the number of people with disabilities in the workforce by the end of 2024, in 2023 we worked with specialist partners that helped us to find candidates, prioritising digital skills for technical or technological roles, in line with our digital transformation. We also put emphasis on attracting professionals with different types of disabilities.\n\nOur approach includes improving accessibility and inclusion in the selection and integration processes for people with disabilities, ensuring that we provide the necessary tools and adjustments to enable them to integrate successfully into their job, team and workplace and to carry out their duties well.\n\nFor example, in Brazil we offer reading software, adapted headsets, tactile floors and Braille signs. In addition, we provide a real-time sign language translation service for events and meetings, as well as adapted telephones with captions for people who are deaf.\n\nWe enhanced our disability awareness programme for all employees by adding information on the different types of disabilities and the tools that promote equal treatment. In Spain alone, we trained over 1,300 employees in 2023 who work directly or indirectly with people with disabilities on our staff.\n\nAll these efforts allowed us to increase the number of employees with disabilities globally by 73.5% compared to 2022, reaching 2,572 people by the end of 2023.\n\n'For Telef\u00f3nica, contributing to providing opportunities for people with disabilities is not only an ethical imperative, but also a question of talent and business. In the current context, no company can afford to do without any valuable professional'.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete, Chairman of Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nIn Brazil, over 900 people with disabilities were hired in 2023. In addition, as part of the Explore+ programme, 100% of the study costs for our employees with disabilities on undergraduate and short-term postgraduate courses was subsidised.\n\nIn Spain, the Include Programme, developed in partnership with Fundaci\u00f3n GoodJob, has enabled us to incorporate 124 people with disabilities who have received training in cybersecurity, the cloud, automation and robotisation.\n\nIn relation to our supply chain, in 2023 we continued to increase the range of Special Employment Centres we work with (suppliers whose workforce is made up of at least 70% of employees with disabilities).",

Through our Foundation, we served almost 70,000 people with disabilities.\n\nIn addition, with the aim of promoting the digital employability of people with intellectual disabilities, Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica and Fundaci\u00f3n Prodis prepared a study centring on a digital model for including people with intellectual disabilities in the job market, highlighting tools to enable them to face the challenges posed by the digital society on an equal footing.\n\nMore information on social action in the area of diversity, disability and universal accessibility is available in the Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica Annual Report which can be found at Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica website /get-to-know-us/ annual-report/.\n\n## 2.7.6.3. Generational diversity\n\nIn terms of young talent, 63% of the new recruits to our team in 2023 were under 35 years of age.\n\nIn Spain, 123 young people from Talentum completed a Power Skills training programme, enhancing their skills in the areas of communication, creativity, diversity and inclusion, teamwork, flexibility and adaptability and constructive feedback. 38.1% of the participants in the Talentum scholarships in Spain were women. In the same country, in 2023, 370 young people completed the Learn2Grow programme, which accelerates the professional and personal growth of people under 35.\n\nAt global unit level, 2023 was the year we launched our talent community, in which more than half of our employees under 35 are enrolled. Members receive information from the Company on matters relating to their training, well-being, leisure and social benefits from the Company.\n\nIn Germany, Telef\u00f3nica Digital Transformation offers a tailored and individual plan for young people, while in Hispanoamerica, Movistar Generation has invited young people from the region to participate in a project to boost their careers, enabling 61 of them to join the workforce. In the UK, we promote the development of young talent through the Future Careers initiative. In more specific terms, in 2023 over 200 students were offered a STEM job opportunity, these offer aims to promote the presence of women (49%) and young people from the so-called 'global majority' (76%). In Brazil, we recruited 415 interns in 2023. During the year, Telef\u00f3nica also supported the Sondersland youth employability and empowerment event.\n\nAlso in Brazil, we enhanced the 50+ project, which promotes the hiring of people over 50 years of age, which we have expanded to business areas beyond shops.\n\n## 2.7.6.4. Ethnic diversity\n\nWith regard to diversity by origin or ethnicity , in Brazil we stepped up our efforts to promote Black talent. In 2023 we launched a professional development programme for Black employees in collaboration with the Modo Parit\u00e9s Institute. We also have specific programmes for Black women, such as Women in Leadership.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has passed the 50% mark for the number of internship grants awarded to Black people, reaching 58%. We continue to raise awareness among our leaders and invite them to mentor Black employees through the Ra\u00e7a em Foco programme. All these initiatives have resulted in us having a workforce with 41.7% of employees who identify themselves as Black. In terms of our leadership positions in 2023, 32.8% of them were held by Black managers .\n\nSimilarly, in the UK we set ourselves targets for 2027: 25% ethnic minority employees and at least 15% in leadership positions. In 2023, over 75% of our employees voluntarily disclosed their ethnicity. Furthermore, in the same year, we published the ethnic pay gap at VMO2, which stood at 42.3%.\n\nIn order to close the pay gap and promote talent development, we have supported agreements, training and mentoring programmes to empower young people from ethnic minorities and boost their careers. One example of this is the Switch programme, which fosters leadership skills among Black professionals.\n\nAlso in the UK, we launched a pilot programme of zero tolerance towards racism and xenophobia in all customer service environments, improving training and reporting tools in the event of possible cases of discrimination.\n\nIn Germany, we work to integrate talent with a migrant background. Since 2023, Telef\u00f3nica has been collaborating with 2hearts, a community of people with a migrant background who work or want to work in the technology industry. In addition, we have put in place mechanisms for the automatic and high quality translation of our intranet texts into the languages spoken in the main migrant communities in the country.\n\n## 2.7.6.5. LGBT+\n\nWith regard to LGBT+ diversity, in 2023 we continued to strengthen our employee resource groups. In Hispanoamerica, through our Sostener network, we implemented six awareness-raising initiatives throughout the year. In Spain, our employee resource group was set up on an independent basis and, together with REDI, organised the largest meeting of LGBT+ employee resource groups in Spain, REDI to Connect Employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Spain, in addition to participating in FELGTB's YesWeTrans project, we organised employability workshops for transgender people and specific awareness-raising sessions on this topic.\n\nIn Brazil, 8% of our employees have voluntarily declared themselves as LGBT+. We also exceeded our target of 100 transgender employees by 2023, reaching 111. We aim to increase this to 125 people in 2024. Along these lines, we signpost all our toilets to ensure that they are used in accordance with the gender with which the person identifies. We also finance 100% of the training for our transgender employees.\n\n## 2.7.6.6.

These concepts are:\n\n- \u00b7 Total annual base salary.\n- \u00b7 Short-term variable remuneration: bonuses, commissions, sales incentives and other variable remuneration items paid.\n- \u00b7 Benefits in kind, including social benefits, accumulated in one year.\n- \u00b7 Long-term variable remuneration: incentives paid (shares).\n\nThe scope of this analysis includes all active employees in Telefonica Group as at 31 December of the analysed year.\n\nIn the case of the global gross pay gap, a weighted average of the gross pay gaps of each country according to the total number of employees in each country has been applied.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatement of Non-Financial Information \u00b7 Helping society thrive",

New ways of working\n\n## Key points\n\n## 65%\n\nof our total workforce has adopted our hybrid work model.\n\n## 81%\n\nof our employees feel they have a good work-life balance.\n\n## 2.8.1. Vision\n\nTechnology is the essential enabler to drive the culture of working from anywhere. It also promotes a shift in the approach to searching for and retaining human talent. This is why, at Telef\u00f3nica, we remain committed to a hybrid working model (on-site and remote) across the Group, which combines the best of both worlds. In general, we set a minimum percentage for on-site working and a maximum percentage for remote working , adjusted to the different labour laws in the countries in which we operate and, whenever possible, depending on the nature of the position.\n\nOur hybrid, flexible and digital work model seeks to boost team commitment and satisfaction while preserving our corporate culture and maintaining professional ties.\n\nOur model is based on universality (it applies to all employees unless their role cannot be performed while working from home) and safeguards the health and safety of our workforce. It fully complies with local legislation and has been agreed with the main trade union organisations in the countries where we operate.\n\n## 94%\n\nof our employees consider that the hybrid-flexible working system enables them to be more productive.\n\nThere is a growing social demand for work-life balance. At Telef\u00f3nica, we strive to make it a reality. These efforts are clearly reflected in the results from our annual motivation survey, according to which 81% of our employees feel they have a good work-life balance. Thanks to our digital disconnection awareness initiatives, plus the new ways of working we had put in place prior to the pandemic, this percentage has risen by 13 points since 2019.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is improving the compatibility of different lifestyles with professional demands, thereby fostering inclusion. We harness the potential of all employees in this way, regardless of their personal characteristics or circumstances.\n\nThe redefinition of our workspaces to make them more digital, flexible and collaborative, in addition to a commitment to digital disconnection (Telef\u00f3nica was a pioneer in this regard following an agreement signed in 2019 with trade union organisations) and the physical and emotional well-being of our people, a part of this new work model.\n\nThe leadership style and our culture also play a key role in this transformation.\n\n## 2.8.2. Targets\n\nThe key target for this new way of working is to boost employee commitment and loyalty while evolving towards a simpler and more flexible organisation. We therefore promote skills based on a culture of flexibility, trust and\n\n<!-- image -->",

The move to adopt this hybrid working model was also prompted by our goal of reducing our environmental footprint (in line with the target of achieving net zero emissions by 2040).\n\n## 2.8.3. Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nTechnological development and globalisation are redefining the way people work and creating a rapidly changing environment that requires rapid responses.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we are aware of the negative impact that these new ways of working can have on the health and safety of our employees. Difficulties achieving digital disconnection or a potential lack of equipment or training are the main reasons behind this. However, we believe that new technological tools provide an opportunity to develop hybrid, flexible and collaborative working models that promote a healthy work-life balance with measures that encourage learning, disconnection and productivity are needed.\n\n## 2.8.4. Action plan and commitments\n\nThe new agile ways of working are much more than a methodology for Telef\u00f3nica; they are a means of boosting cultural transformation. They are underpinned by the various local Agile offices. These offices are made up of Business, Transformation and People teams working together to align work frameworks to the specific characteristics and strategic priorities of each business unit.\n\nWe continue to work on the implementation of more liquid and flexible organisational models that foster the empowerment of teams and support business activity, within a context of process simplification based on an end to end and project-based work approach.\n\n## 2.8.4.1. How we lead\n\nThis new hybrid and flexible context has led to farreaching changes in our leadership and our culture which are highly necessary for achieving the best results. We are therefore undertaking an unprecedented cultural transformation to help us obtain an effective and sustainable employment experience that can evolve the relationship model between managers and their teams.\n\nWe are fully aware that we need new ways of leading to help us adapt to these new paradigms. As a result, in the various countries where we operate, we are working to reorganise the skills of our leaders so they can be a source of inspiration and transformation within this new hybrid context. We also want them to promote a culture of confidence, conversation and productivity.\n\n## At Telef\u00f3nica, we inclusively lead teams of a diverse nature.\n\n## 2.8.4.2. Digitalised environment\n\nWith a hybrid work model, the office becomes less of a place to perform a task and more of a space for inspiration, co-creation and networking between colleagues. Telef\u00f3nica's workspaces are therefore open and shared, and technologically equipped to serve the hybrid model.\n\nOne clear example of these adapted spaces is the Campus Universitas located at Distrito Telef\u00f3nica (Madrid), within the Innovation and Talent Hub. It boasts 2,000 square metres and the latest technology for inperson and remote training, including live-streaming services, multi-purpose spaces and recording studios.\n\nFurthermore, we strive to enrich the vending machine corners and relaxation spaces at our offices to provide a cosy atmosphere that allows us to network within our work environment while enjoying a nice break.\n\n## Collaborative technology, such as Microsoft Teams and the Workplace corporate social network, encourages interaction between employees and helps them stay on top of the latest news and share inspiring\n\nideas and content.\n\nDepending on the geographical area where we operate, we provide our professionals with ergonomic chairs, mobile telephones with unlimited data tariffs and the",

Additionally, we have created spaces to promote emotional well-being and virtual caf\u00e9s where we encourage networking.\n\nFurthermore in Spain, we also provide our employees with various tools so that they can record the start and end of their working day from any location, as required by current local labour legislation.\n\n## 2.8.4.3. Work-life balance\n\n## GRI 3-3\n\nWe developed the hybrid model by focusing on the employee and his or her family and by looking out for their digital health.\n\nIn order to reinforce the digital disconnection agreement that the Company signed in 2019, we deliver courses including new routines and tips on how to maintain a healthy balance between work and free time, and organise teamwork in the best possible way.\n\nIn the same vein, in Spain the Company is a member of the Yo No Renuncio association, a network of companies committed to work-life balance and co-responsibility.\n\nWe encourage co-responsibility for care among our male and female employees through awareness initiatives, It has been proved that cultures in which the weight of family and domestic responsibilities falls mainly on women are detrimental to their development and prevent the gender pay gap from being closed.\n\nWe foster measures that guarantee digital disconnection based on a commitment to 'disconnect to reconnect' . A combination of company, team and individual agreements is essential to achieving this goal. Such agreements regulate times at which communications should not be sent and those at which replies are not expected (except under exceptional circumstances), as well as guidelines on planning and organising meetings.\n\nWe complement all this with training resources on disconnecting and relaxing, reasonable use of technology and awareness about respecting personal relaxation time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.9. Safety, health and wellbeing at work\n\nWe have measures and initiatives in place that help our employees to achieve work-life balance and ensure their well-being: flexible working hours, part-time work, reduced working hours, the subsidised flexible working week, paid and unpaid leave, extended leave for personal reasons and hybrid working.\n\nThe food subsidy for employees with children, benefits pertaining to nursery fees, personal days and maternity and paternity leave, which often exceed the minimum levels required by law, are factors which help our employees attain a good work-life balance.\n\nWithin this hybrid model, our employees can decide where they work (remote working, working from home or working from their second home), provided the employee is located in the same country where they signed the employment contract.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.6. Attraction, retention and talent development\n\n## 2.8.4.4. Labour relations. Social dialogue GRI 3-3, 402-1\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we are committed to the core standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in every country where we operate, particularly with regard to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.\n\nWe ensure that worker representatives receive fair and discrimination-free treatment and that all the tools they need to be able to perform their duties of representation are available to them.\n\n100% of Telef\u00f3nica's employees are protected by labour frameworks and, as the case may be, by their employment contracts, which govern working conditions under current local legislation. The collective bargaining agreements include occupational health and safety clauses adapted to local legislation. Additionally, Telef\u00f3nica has an annual prevention plan in place, as well as mechanisms and procedures to promote employee involvement in the management of the Company, particularly in terms of information, consultation and participation.\n\nIn the event of any significant organisational changes , Telef\u00f3nica respects the period of prior notice set by the legislation of the countries where we operate, as well as those prior notice periods included in collective bargaining agreements or policies.\n\n## Trade union activity\n\nWe reaffirm the important role played by trade unions in defending the interests of workers and we recognise the UNI (Global Union) and the European Works Council as key partners in worldwide labour management.\n\nAt a local level, we also understand that works council management is steered through policies and rules established by the legal entity. Therefore, the procedures on reporting, consultation and negotiation have different meanings but are always in line with Telef\u00f3nica's guiding principles.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If workers wish to become members of a trade union, Telef\u00f3nica will recognise trade unions that meet the terms and conditions set by ILO Convention 87, and always in accordance with local legislation.\n\n## Voluntary redundancy program\n\nWith the aim of tailoring our workforce to the needs of the business, in 2023 we defined a number of different procedures that would enable us to conduct streamlining processes in 2024, if necessary, within the organisations where they might be required. These procedures are discussed with worker representatives with the goal of reconciling the interests of the Company and the individuals who may be affected.\n\nIn Hispanoamerica, 421 workers participated in a voluntary redundancy plan (the Plan de Desvinculaci\u00f3n Voluntaria, or PDV), 81% of whom corresponded to our operation in Argentina.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica Spain, negotiations took place with the main trade unions regarding a redundancy plan (in the form of an expediente de regulaci\u00f3n de empleo , or ERE), in order to adapt the size and skills of the workforce to the Company's needs. The plan will be executed in 2024.\n\n## 2.8.4.5. Outplacement programs GRI 404-2\n\nSince the beginning of 2016, we have been running an outplacement service to help relocate employees who leave the Company as a result of redundancy or voluntary redundancy plans.\n\nFor six months, we offer:\n\n- \u00b7 Individual work sessions.\n- \u00b7 Group sessions and workshops.\n- \u00b7 A technology platform to find new opportunities.\n\nThe main purpose of all these actions is to help employees find new opportunities at other companies or in their own businesses.\n\n## 2.8.5. Progress en 2023\n\n## 2.8.5.1. New work model\n\nIn 2023, 65% of our employees took advantage of our hybrid work model, which is flexible and adapts to the needs of both the individuals involved and the Company. It also makes it possible for them to work from anywhere in the country, and even from their second homes. This option can be revoked by either party.\n\n- \u00b7 Some 94% of our employees consider that this hybridflexible working system enables them to be more productive.\n- \u00b7 Among our employees, 81% (up seven percentage points compared to 2021) believe that our Company promotes a good work-life balance.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, agile work methods were used in all Group units: 52% of employees claim that they use some kind of agile framework (scrum, kanban, design thinking, lean thinking, etc.).This is an increase of eight percentage points since 2022.\n- \u00b7 Each country has its own program for lifelong learning of digital and business skills.\n\nBrazil Vivo Explore - provides training on technology, digital services, creativity, innovation, well-being, self-care and personal leadership to all Vivo employees.\n\nSpain - Digital Reskilling - a programme to develop digital skills such as O365, data modelling and visualisation, and process automation. This open program is voluntary and has welcomed over 3,600 employees, earning an average satisfaction rating of 8.7.\n\nGermany - Digital Basics Programme - imparts basic knowledge about new technologies and the major trends in digitalisation. The core topics in 2023 were the metaverse, automation and artificial intelligence (AI). Since its launch, more than 3,800 employees have taken part in the programme.\n\nHispam - the 'Soy y Pienso Digital' training path, in which over 9,000 workers participate through the Experiencia Digital Udemy, Digital Transformation Week, CX Week and our Devops Days.",

To this end, we encouraged the practice of blocking off particular periods in their schedules, such as bank holidays and rest times (e.g. lunch).

The agreement will remain in force until 2024.\n\nThe agreement pursues three very clear objectives:\n\n- a. Achieving progress in building a common employment framework for all the entities that make up the Global Units.\n- b.Fostering simpler and more agile mobility within the Global Units.\n- c. Reaching the best agreement on pay reviews.\n\nIn Brazil, 76 agreements were reached with trade unions in 2023.",

Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nIn the current climate of uncertainty, the various social, political and economic crises can affect people's mental and physical health. Changes to the way we work - via virtual communication and hybrid models, among others can give rise to psycho-social risks (isolation, information overload, hyperconnectivity, stress and anxiety) that affect our employees' performance This in turn may have an economic impact on the organisation.\n\nTherefore, our commitment to the safety, health and wellbeing of our employees is essential for them to feel supported and protected. Also, it is key to enabling them to do their jobs in satisfactory working conditions. For these reasons, Telef\u00f3nica regards health and safety as a priority human rights issue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.14. Human Rights\n\nWe endeavour to ensure a healthy and safe environment by providing training on health and safety and actively promoting the physical and emotional well-being of our employees. Doing so also represents an opportunity to reduce costs by preventing workplace accidents and occupational diseases.\n\nIn addition, Telef\u00f3nica's presence in different countries and settings generates local impacts, opportunities and risks. That is why health, safety and well-being issues are managed in a predominantly local manner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.9.5. Action plan and commitments\n\n## 2.9.5.1. Management systems: prevention of work-related accidents and occupational diseases GRI 403-1, 403-2\n\nWe establish procedures to identify hazards and assess risks in order to prevent work-related accidents and occupational diseases, ensuring compliance with the legal requirements in force in each country. On a complementary basis and in accordance with the principle of prevention, we also adopt other requirements based on local regulations or international standards.\n\nEach one of our operators has occupational health and safety guidelines in place for the management of risks faced by engineers and office staff.\n\nThe processes for identifying hazards and assessing risks to prevent occupational incidents and diseases are set out in the Global Health and Safety Policy, as well as in the various local health and safety policies. These processes vary from country to country but are all aimed at eliminating hazards and minimising risks.\n\nIn Spain, risk identification is performed in various ways: specific reports are produced to analyse a given situation; risk assessments are conducted in workplaces; and accidents are investigated. The results of this technical activity are included in a \"Prevention Plan\", which is sent to the corresponding management units so they can plan and develop the necessary corrective actions.",

In Germany, we have an accident-reporting process: accidents are registered in the accident database and analysed by occupational safety specialists using a checklist.\n\n## We also have processes in place to investigate workrelated accidents at each operator.\n\nIn Spain, once the accident has been investigated by the occupational doctor, the result is reported to the Prevention Service and a prevention officer is assigned to determine the causes of the accident. The investigation report includes a series of conclusions and recommendations of which the employee and his or her immediate superior is informed. If any additional action is required, this is also communicated to the management unit so that the identified incident can be remedied or adaptations can be made.\n\nIn Brazil, we have a Technical Instruction Manual for the Management of Workplace Incidents and Accidents, and a standard form for the recording and investigation of accidents at work. In Germany, the key problems that are identified via this process are discussed by occupational safety committees and measures are proposed.\n\n## 2.9.5.2. Occupational health services GRI 403-3\n\nWe have health services with essentially preventive and health-promoting functions in every country.\n\nIn some countries, they are provided by in-house staff:\n\n- \u00b7 In Spain, via the Joint Service for Occupational Risk Prevention.\n- \u00b7 In Brazil, via specialised providers that we contract for acupuncture programs, mental health (psychologists), nutrition, physiotherapy, meditation, primary healthcare (Einstein Clinic), pregnancy programs, exercise in the workplace, chronic disease management, telemedicine, executive health check-ups, etc.\n\nMost of our workplaces have an on-site medical service; wherever this is not available, employees have access to medical services under the various health plans that are in place.\n\nAll our operations also have an Emergency Plan in place under which teams of people who have received first aid training can take action in the event of an emergency or natural disaster. In addition, we have early warning systems and specially trained teams (through drills) prepared to deal with such events.\n\n## 2.9.5.3. Training and worker representation GRI 403-4, 403-5\n\n## Training and awareness-raising\n\nAll employees have online courses available to them on occupational health, safety and well-being. Ongoing and specific training is also undertaken with the local teams in the various countries on the implementation of health, safety and well-being management systems, as well as numerous health and awareness-raising campaigns.\n\nWith regard to people with HIV and AIDS, in addition to our explicit commitment to non-discrimination in the Global Diversity and Inclusion Policy, we conduct training and awareness-raising activities on the subject locally.\n\n## Worker representation and participation GRI 3-3\n\nWe promote information, consultation and participation for workers and other stakeholders to ensure safe and healthy workplaces. Worker representation on joint health and safety committees is the established model in the countries where we operate; 88% of our employees are represented on these committees.\n\nIn Spain, we have a central Health and Safety Committee that meets on a monthly basis, and we support that committee with provincial committees that meet every three months. In Germany, our occupational safety committee meets every quarter.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we encourage and promote the physical and mental health of our employees, both in the workplace and in their personal and family environments.\n\n## 2.9.5.4. Promotion of employees' health GRI 403-6\n\nIn line with our goal to be a benchmark for corporate well-being with a positive impact on our employees, partners, the environment and the organisation, we implement initiatives that promote a culture of well-being at all levels of the organisation. Furthermore, we offer digital disconnection measures and seek to guarantee work-life balance for our employees.",

These are accompanied by meetings with contractors and the development of improvement schemes.\n\n## The Telef\u00f3nica Integrated Prevention and\n\nSustainability Plan , drawn up to develop an exceptional benchmark standard in our sector and industry as a whole, has three key pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 The Responsible Business Principles, which not only contain our code of ethics but also our responsibility policy with regard to stakeholders and society in general.\n- \u00b7 The importance of sustainability for progress by society and reducing the impact from our activity and from that of our customers and suppliers.\n- \u00b7 Our commitment to Occupational Risk Prevention, tied to well-being and the protection of our employees, joint companies and supply chain.\n\n## Supplier management\n\n| Our suppliers must accept and sign our minimum  standards on occupational health and safety.   | Step  1   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Risk analysis and identification of high-risk  suppliers.                                      | Step  2   |\n| Audits (administrative or on-site) of high-risk  suppliers.                                    | Step  3   |\n| Engagement with suppliers to improve the health  and safety of those who work with us in our   | Step  4   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.19. Responsible supply chain management\n\n## 2.9.6. Progress in 2023\n\n## 2.9.6.1. Management system GRI 403-8\n\n97% of our employees are currently covered by a health, safety and well-being management system. Of those, 73% are covered by a certified system (based on ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 standards). This percentage has risen significantly compared to 2022 due to the scaling up of certifications in Brazil.\n\nIn 2023, in Brazil, we expanded the ISO 45001 certification to the southern provinces (Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul), bringing the proportion of workers covered to 70%. In the same year Spain renewed its ISO 45001 certification.\n\nOver 2023, we focused on digitalising workforce management and integrating employee occupational health information into a single tool, setting a standard for reporting and consolidating employee occupational health data. This allows the entire company to report information through a single, centralised and auditable tool, applying automatic quality rules and consolidating indicators according to common criteria, enabling overall monitoring.\n\n## 2.9.6.2. Awareness and prevention\n\nWe once again organised Well-Being Week in several countries in 2023, during which we shared content on emotional health, physical activity, healthy eating, selfknowledge and happiness. We also organised a month dedicated to mental health.\n\n- \u00b7 On a global level, the Telef\u00f3nica Group's annual health and safety day was held in June 2023. This space allowed us to share health and well-being experiences and to make progress together towards a culture of prevention.\n- \u00b7 Each local market delivers training courses on occupational risk prevention (ORP) for its employees. Only in Spain, more than 40,000 employees completed a total of 83,219 hours of training in this area.\n- \u00b7 In Spain, our health and well-being channel (which offers numerous activities and talks on well-being and emotional, physical and nutritional health) had over 2,500 members in 2023. Life purpose, cancer prevention, allergies, improving sleep and many other topics were discussed in order to support self-care. As a new development, we launched a podcast specifically aimed at mental health called 'Entiende Tu Mente' (Understand Your Mind). Over 13,000 people participated in the various health campaigns, an increase of 62.5% compared to 2022, with the initiatives maintaining the previous year's average rating of 4.87 out of 5. Those most highly rated by our",

Furthermore, among our prevention initiatives, we organised a flu vaccination campaign that covered over 25,000 employees and we launched programs for quick massages at work and workplace exercises. We also used the Einstein Conecta app to roll out an online physiotherapy scheme, which allows employees to look after their musculoskeletal health. Another successful venture was our Well-Being Festival, which highlighted practices that help us feel good and attracted over 33,000 people.\n- \u00b7 In Germany, the O 2 Telef\u00f3nica Feel Good health app was expanded to include preventive health proposals and access to the Feel Good programme. In addition, as part of a health campaign, the Company again offered executives innovative training to boost their mental health.The training addressed how managers can recognise and deal with mental health problems among their employees, including in situations where the manager and employee are working in different locations.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, we provided awareness-raising and prevention activities on various health issues (menopause, prostate and testicular diseases and thyroid and cardiovascular diseases) to all our operators. We also provided hearing health programmes, skincare programmes to prevent melanoma, ophthalmology campaigns and flu vaccinations.\n- \u00b7 We also approached the issue of addictive behaviours under the various prevention programmes we have in place in most countries. We did this through information campaigns, talks, conferences and workshops given by specialists on the topic. For example, the Priority programme in Chile helps to combat addictive behaviours and promotes healthy habits. Colombia has a policy related to discouraging the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and psychoactive substances.\n\n## 2.9.6.3. Work-life balance\n\nIn 2023 we continued to work on initiatives related to promoting a healthy work-life balance:\n\n- \u00b7 In Germany, the famPlus programme expanded the scope of health promotion services through digital solutions that support employees in all areas, especially with regard to balancing time spent at work with time with their families. Virtual children's workshops were held to provide a variety of activities such as painting, yoga and quiz games aimed at children between six and 12 years of age. The programme also included a baby\n\nsleep seminar, as well as sessions on the psychosocial development of children and adolescents in order to help participants recognise possible disorders and provide advice on the use of social media. Other new features consisted of virtual counselling services for personal development, as well as care for older people. All the live events were recorded and made available through a media library to be accessed anytime and anywhere.\n\n- \u00b7 We offer our employees in Germany a wide range of digital programmes to help them exercise, eat healthily, reduce stress and foster burnout prevention, and strengthen their resilience. In June 2023 we launched the Feel Good app, which has been used by 2,288 employees.\n- \u00b7 Brazil offered Vivo mais familia, a support programme for the arrival of a new family member, which provides a boost to emotional balance and well-being, as well as physical and mental health advice for all employees and their dependents. It also offers clinical, psychological and nutritional care for mothers, as well as informative pregnancy-related content. The programme includes support for parents during adoption procedures too. There are currently 1,185 registered members and 834 active participants, and it has earned an NPS of 98 . In addition, over 6,000 family members participated in Family Day, which was held as part of the Well-being Festival initiative.\n- \u00b7 Colombia has a programme called Quality of Life, which is aimed at all workers, including students and interns. The goal of the programme is to offer benefits in line with the interests, tastes and needs of employees. It is made up of two initiatives. First, there is ONE Benefits , a credits program that allows employees to schedule their Company benefits at a time convenient to them, so that they can disconnect and enjoy their free time away from the office. 78% of workers have scheduled at least one benefit. There is also Movistar Moments , a credits programme that allows users to obtain experiences and/or products that they can enjoy with colleagues, family and friends. It also includes talks, workshops, competitions and sports tournaments for employees and for children, fathers, mothers and friends. 70% of employees have enjoyed at least one product/experience.\n- \u00b7 In Spain, we joined forces with the Yo No Renuncio Association on an in-depth internal diagnosis to understand employee views on what makes a good work-life balance and the barriers to achieving it in the Company. The results will be used to make further progress towards excellence in this field.\n\nWe also work with various suppliers that offer solutions aimed at improving work-life integration for our employees, making their day-to-day life easier by providing advice on legal, financial and tax matters, and",

Each country has its own workplace well-being community that is gaining more followers and participants every year. One example is the health and well-being channel in Spain, whose membership expanded by 32% during the year.\n\n## 2.9.6.4. Healthy spaces\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we are committed to a hybrid work model. For that commitment to be successful, it is essential for the work spaces both in the workplace and in the home to meet certain minimum health criteria in terms of ergonomics, well-being and environmental quality. Although each country manages this issue on a separate basis, all of them establish recommendations and offer support on ergonomic aspects and occupational health and safety. In Germany, there is a risk assessment procedure for teleworking situations, training on health and safety in remote working environments and the Feel Good programme's online options, as well as the family service. In Spain, we provided training courses on occupational risk prevention (ORP) to the entire teleworking workforce, as well as recommendations on working from home safely (physically and mentally). Ergonomics kits were issued.\n\nWe also promote the creation of cardio-protected spaces. We have installed defibrillators in the workplaces of our main operators. In Spain alone, there are currently a total of 33 defibrillators located in the main workplaces.\n\n## 2.9.6.5. Recognition\n\n- \u00b7 Spain. At the Health and Business awards, RRHH Digital placed Telef\u00f3nica among the top 10 companies that promote well-being in the workplace. As a result, the Company received an Accesit award.\n- \u00b7 Brazil won first prize at the Vittude Awards in the best mental health project category.\n- \u00b7 Germany. Corporate Health Management presented Telef\u00f3nica with a Special Award for Health Communication and included the Company in the Excellence category at the 2023 Corporate Health Awards.\n- \u00b7 Chile won first place in the Large Corporations category as the leading corporation in terms of work-life balance, awarded by the Chile Unido Foundation.\n\n## Milestones\n\n- \u008c We completed the psycho-social risk assessment process at all our operators.\n- \u008d We digitalised the process for providing workers with occupational health information and incorporated it into our global tool.\n- \u008e We strengthened and expanded our initiatives to promote work-life balance for employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

That is to say, we use it to offer customised recommendations and a personalised experience. We also make use of it in our networks to improve the quality of the service to our customers.\n\nAll Telef\u00f3nica Group, operators conduct monthly satisfaction surveys among our customers to learn about the way in which they perceive our services. In these surveys we ask about the quality of the network, the commercial offering, the customer service we provide through various channels, bills, mobile top-ups, and prices, among other things.\n\nOne of the indicators we obtain from these surveys is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). This information provides us with customers' satisfaction levels with our products and services and whether they would recommend us.\n\nWe have been monitoring and reporting our NPS as a recommendation indicator with regard to our products and services since 2017, and we calculate the Group's global NPS based on the results obtained from each of our operations.\n\nThis indicator has also been set as a target linked to Customer Trust for the short term variable remuneration of all employees and is included in Telef\u00f3nica's strategic plan.\n\n## 2.10.5.1. Quality and reliability of our network and services\n\nThe network is one of our main assets.\n\nToday's changing environment and its accelerating digitalisation have underlined how important it is to have a robust, stable and reliable network.\n\nConnectivity is at the heart of our customers' day-to-day lives and our strategy is to offer the best network experience.\n\nFor this reason, Telef\u00f3nica sets customer satisfaction with the functioning of the network as one of the targets for measuring our importance to customers.\n\nAs an example of our commitment in this regard, we have launched the Customer Experience Maturity Model transformation project in our main markets.\n\nThe main aim of this project is to elevate our networks and operations to an advanced level of Customer Experience Management (CEM) maturity.\n\nThe maximum level in this regard would make the following approach possible in the future:\n\n- \u00b7 Actions to improve the customer experience to be taken based on the results of the data analysis and use of a digital twin (an exact digital replica of the network which uses artificial intelligence algorithms and high processing capacity, and which serves, among other things, to make strategic decisions and run through what-if scenarios practically in real time - in our case taking into account the quality enjoyed by our customers).\n- \u00b7 Technology investments to be based on customer experience data.\n- \u00b7 Using AI and machine learning algorithms to accelerate automation and thereby anticipate customer quality issues before they occur.\n\nTo this end, a CEM Maturity framework has been defined, with six areas (strategy, customer experience, culture, operations, technology and data) and five levels of maturity. These areas and levels together form a Maturity Index, which is the main KPI to measure our progress in this transformation.\n\nTo move forward, we have a roadmap of improvement initiatives covering these aspects, including, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Launching customer experience (CX) communication, recognition and training plans.\n- \u00b7 Creating a cross-cutting customer experience unit.\n- \u00b7 Defining customer experience models based on persona models (customer experience models created around a persona).\n- \u00b7 Implementing a Service Operation Centre (SOC) in order to evolve towards automation and proactive resolution of service faults.\n\n## Network quality and availability\n\nIt is imperative for all of us at Telef\u00f3nica to comply with national and international regulations to guarantee the quality of our products.\n\nIn this context, as a telecommunications and technology company, we have an obligation to ensure the highest quality in both our communications networks and in the new digital products and services we develop, market and deliver to our customers.\n\nOur responsibility is to guarantee the maximum access speed and information transmission capacity stated in the customer's contract, 24 hours per day, from any device and location and in any situation.",

This way, more and more households have the opportunity to access the digital world.\n\nWe are transparent and regularly publish information on the quality of our service. In this manner, we enable online checks of mobile network status in real time via our Internet portals.\n\nBelow, two examples of tools that enable customers to check network status:\n\nTo guarantee quality and the service we offer, we are constantly evaluating and monitoring fixed and mobile communications . This allows us to guarantee the availability of our service and respond immediately to any incidents that may arise at any time.\n\n0YLSVO\n\n## Example of Movistar's network status in Spain by type of technology (5G, 4G...).\n\nExample of Vivo's network status in Brazil by type of technology (5G, 4G...).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This provides users with access to quality information and enables them to enjoy greater efficiency in the use of connectivity, as well as the swift identification of potential incidents.\n\n## Movistar Speed Test\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy relating the various functions of an electronic communications service - contracting, maintenance, connection, billing - to the various criteria that users may apply when assessing their service quality ( speed, accuracy, availability, reliability , etc.), a set of observable and measurable parameters can be defined to provide an objective and comparable representation of service quality to the user.\n\nOf course, we are aware that natural phenomena, external factors, power cuts, etc. can cause occasional and localised service interruptions. To minimise the duration of any incident as far as possible, we work continuously on building greater resilience.\n\n## Health and safety in our products\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we optimise the smooth operation and accessibility of our products.\n\nThat is why we apply the appropriate protocols to ensure that 100% of the devices we market comply with local legislation in each of the markets where we operate.\n\nIn one way or another, these standards and laws affect customers' safety, quality and user experience; in many cases, we go beyond the legal requirements.\n\nSpecifically, at Telef\u00f3nica we request the RoHS certificate (Restriction of Hazardous Substances, European Directive 2015/863, or version 3) - which restricts the use of certain hazardous substances (lead, mercury, cadmium, chrome VI, PBB and PBDE, etc.) in electrical and electronic equipment - and the SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) of devices - which ensures that none represent a health hazard for our customers from all suppliers of mobile terminals. We also ask for the devices we sell to have the GCF (Global Certification Forum) certificate. This guarantees that the connection with the mobile network works correctly, including emergency calls.\n\nAs for the rest of the equipment deployed in a residential setting and associated with access to the fixed network (routers-HGUs, WiFi amplifiers-repeaters, Movistar Home, etc.), we comply with all the common international standards that also apply to these types of devices, such as CE marking and the RoHS certificate.\n\nIt must also be highlighted that verifications of versions of the firmware implemented, the packaging, and the housing of the devices are carried out in the logistics areas of each of our countries.\n\n## Electromagnetic fields\n\nIn all countries where we operate, we comply with the exposure limits for electromagnetic emissions established by independent scientific organisations, such as the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), based on scientific evidence.\n\nCompliance with these standards, which have been established by the ICNIRP, ensures that we deploy a secure network, including 5G, as these guidelines are endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we verify that all the mobile devices we market comply with the SAR values.\n\nWe also have a Manual of Good Practices that acts as a guide for our teams and lists all initiatives taken within the Group in the different countries in which we operate. All these practices have a common interest in establishing a proper relationship with those communities we intend to serve. In this context, we work in coordination with institutions and operators to maintain a communication and dialogue strategy that helps the general public to detect fake news about 5G technology.",

They all conclude that there is no evidence linking exposure below the guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection to known health risks for adults or children.\n\n## 2.10.5.2. Adaptation to customer needs\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we create a portfolio of products and services adapted to the needs of our customers, improving and extending the offering to strengthen the relationship we have with them. In addition, this is consistent with the Company's sustainability requirements in terms of accessibility, ethics and positive social impact regarding both the environment and the customer's health.\n\nAs a result, traditional connectivity and communications services have been joined by digital TV and content services, cloud services, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc., as well as professional security, big data and IT services, among others.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica continues to improve its offering in the residential segment , seeking to set itself apart from its competitors by expanding its portfolio of services through the launch of digital security, health and energy ecosystems, among others.\n\nIn the corporate segment , we provide an integrated offering that speeds up the implementation of technology through our cybersecurity, cloud, IoT, big data, artificial intelligence and blockchain services, technology solutions and digital transformation support for businesses.\n\nIn order to help our customers incorporate sustainability criteria into their purchasing decisions , so that they can contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable society, Telef\u00f3nica has created the Eco Smart seal; this identifies the environmental benefits provided by our products and services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11. Sustainable offering and innovation\n\nIn line with the above, in Spain we continue to improve through our new model to pursue excellence in the products and services we provide to customers, from the initial development stage right through to maintenance once they are on the market. Through the Customer Health Index, we aim to tailor services to customer needs. This interlinks with Responsibility by Design with regard to our products and services, aiming to develop services with a customeroriented focus to achieve the lowest possible number of incidents throughout their life cycles.\n\nThe voice of our customers, collected through surveys and mainly the NPS for our products and services, feeds back into this index.\n\n## 2.10.5.3. Managing the customer experience\n\nThe way in which we interact with our customers through our touchpoints is undoubtedly one of the main areas in which we can offer a unique experience.\n\nThis relationship must be based on accessibility, an omnichannel approach, transparency and convenience.\n\nIn this regard, we use the Customer Effort Score (CES), a metric that measures the ease with which our customers resolve their issues through our customer service channels, in order to also evaluate the digital transformation process of our points of contact. We set annual country and Company-wide targets.\n\nFurthermore, the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) resulting from the question regarding satisfaction asked in the transactional surveys (conducted at the end of each contact) is used for the management/remuneration of our customer support providers.\n\n## Complaints\n\nAll our operators have teams that focus exclusively on reducing both the number complaints and the number of dissatisfied customers, regardless of the channel through which they reach us. The measures we implement for this purpose include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We provide channels through which our customers can exercise their right to complain at any time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The main channels are our call centres, online channels, physical stores, social media and postal mail.\n- \u00b7 We report the trends in the number of complaints and resolution times to the competent authority, as well as other information required about the quality of the service we provide, in accordance with the guidelines and parameters set by the regulatory body in each country.",

Voice of the Customer Program\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's digital transformation has contributed to the expansion and automation of actively listening to customers as a management tool.\n\nAll our businesses have introduced tools to listen to our customers at key points of contact. This has made it possible:\n\n- \u00b7 To survey the most sensitive processes and 'pain points' where immediate action can be taken to improve these processes and the customer experience.\n- \u00b7 To transmit the voice of the customer to the entire organisation, from senior management to all the people who interact with customers through the different channels and processes, with a dual focus on quantitative and qualitative assessment. This information helps us to change and improve but not just internally, as it is also made available to suppliers that are involved in providing services.\n\n- \u00b7 To integrate all the information into a single platform with different capacities for quantitative analysis through multiple variables that make it possible to take a deeper look at root causes.\n- \u00b7 To conduct an automatic analysis of the literal opinions of our customers in order to gain a better understanding of our strong points as well as opportunities for improvement, so as to use this information to guide our projects.\n\nIn closing the loop we seek not only to provide an immediate and personalised response to an incident raised by a customer after their interaction with one of our contact channels, but also to use their input as feedback to prioritise structural improvements in the Company's processes, thereby preventing this incident from affecting other customers in the future.\n\nFurther down the line, it will also allow us to move from a reactive approach to customer experience to becoming proactive, allowing us to anticipate the customer's needs.",

Privacy and security\n\n## 2.10.5.6. Responsible communication\n\nOur internal regulation on Responsible Communication provides general guidelines on how to address customers and other stakeholders. We promote freedom of expression, pluralism and diversity and we are committed to truthful information, education and inclusion.\n\nIn our communication with customers , we ensure that the information is complete, sufficient and detailed, while avoiding the use of jargon and small print, and we provide the information needed for the terms and conditions of our offers to be understood. We respect and promote the values contained in our Responsible Business Principles and our Diversity and Inclusion Policy.\n\nOur advertising messages and our sponsorships:\n\n- \u00b7 Must not take advantage of the good faith of the consumer.\n- \u00b7 Must not infringe upon people's dignity.\n- \u00b7 Must not include messages or images promoting alcohol consumption, smoking, drug-taking, eating disorders or terrorism.\n- \u00b7 Must never incite hatred, violence or discrimination based on racial, national, religious, gender or sexual orientation; we promote the use of neutral and nonsexist language.\n- \u00b7 Must not encourage illegal behaviour or behaviour that harms the environment.\n\n- \u00b7 Must not take advantage of the naivety of minors.\n\nWe do our upmost to avoid broadcasting advertising messages during programs or on channels that are not in alignment with our values and our Responsible Business Principles. These guidelines are reflected in our contracts with the advertising agencies or media outlets we work with.\n\nWe have rules and policies in place to guide employees, contractors and third parties with regards to the proper use of social media (e.g. on the publishing of facts, information or opinions about the Company). The Global Communication area is responsible for driving and fostering the implementation and compliance of our rules and policies.\n\nWith regard to raising awareness and training our employees about the importance of responsible communication, we address this issue in our Responsible Business Principles course.\n\nIn view of the substantial impact we can have through our television platform, we have a specific Responsible Communication Code for Movistar Plus+ , approved by the Executive Committee of Telef\u00f3nica Spain. This code is aligned with our Responsible Business Principles and our internal regulation on Responsible Communication. We have ethical editorial criteria for all productions (in-house, purchased or outsourced), as well as pre-broadcast controls, anti-piracy mechanisms and a Content or Production Officer to oversee each production.\n\nAll Movistar Plus+ stakeholders have been informed about the code to ensure that it is accepted and respected on a daily basis by employees, suppliers and external collaborators, analysts, customers and society in general.\n\nPossible complaints/enquiries are channelled through the Whistleblowing and Queries Channel.\n\nOur internal regulation on Responsible Communication provides guidelines on how to address customers and other stakeholders.",

In 2023 we achieved an NPS of 31, increasing Telef\u00f3nica's recommendation rating by one point above the 2022 year-end figure and by more than 10 points above that of 2017, when we first started tracking this metric.",

Reputation\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, reputation is key to ensuring consistency with our long-term vision. Measuring reputation allows us to see how society (customers and non-customers) perceive our overall performance and helps us to understand their expectations. To do this, we focus on four crucial features, namely admiration, esteem, confidence and good impression (the RepTrak Pulse\u00ae model).\n\nWe include factors that allow us to determine how the Company is perceived with regards to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, as adequate management of these issues is becoming increasingly important for both companies and their various stakeholders when it comes to building reputation.\n\n## Customer satisfaction has been part of our variable remuneration system since 2008.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see chapter 2.15. Governance and culture of sustainability\n\nIn 2023 the combined RepTrak Pulse\u00ae score was made up of the results for Germany, Brazil and Spain, to give a score of 62.43 points out of 100. While there are many variables that affect reputation, an erosion of trust and the increased uncertainty generated by the global macroeconomic situation have had a significant impact.\n\nWe strive to be recognised as a company that acts sustainably, promotes diversity and inclusion and takes into account the needs of society. Our long-term ambition is not just to outpace our competition but to reach reputational levels of other more favoured sectors, such as retail, automotive and food and beverage sectors achieving a RepTrak Pulse\u00ae of 70 or more. Players in these industries have been able to understand societies' expectations and provide them with a higher level of satisfaction than others, gaining trust and admiration from the public.\n\nIn 2023 we implemented various lines of action:\n\n## In Brazil , we focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 Environment and inclusion: mass media coverage of our commitment to the environment, discussing the importance of recycling electronic material (Vivo Recycle) and the inclusion of women in technical services (Women in Fibre).\n- \u00b7 Supporting diversity through art and culture: the LGBTQIA+ float at the Carnival of S\u00e3o Paulo and sponsorship of Black music festivals.\n- \u00b7 Sporting sponsorships with the intention of publicly emphasising the importance of well-being, conscious use of technology and connection with nature.\n\n## In Spain , the emphasis was on:\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting technology and digitalisation as a driving force for social progress and our commitment to the environment. By expanding the rollout of the 5G network in both urban and rural areas and switching off copper to move to a 100% fibre network, we facilitate society's access to connectivity and contribute to our net zero emissions pledge. We also launched a circular economy program to promote responsible and sustainable consumption.\n- \u00b7 Raising awareness and training people in the proper use of technology through various projects, such as #MalamadreEnModoAvi\u00f3n to promote digital disconnection amongst families, demonstrating the need to continually educate people on the healthy and positive use of technology.

Similarly, the research program of the European Union includes a number of projects in this area that aim to address the possible health effects of electromagnetic fields.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica follows these initiatives closely. In particular, Telef\u00f3nica Spain is collaborating with the Emerge-5G research project, Electromagnetic Field Methodologies for 5G Use Cases. Its main aim is to develop new methods and guidelines for the assessment of exposure to the different innovative use cases intended for 5G communication networks.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has provided technical data on the necessary base stations to carry out exposure measurements. These preliminary measurements, carried out as part of the EMERGE-5G project using frequency and code selective measurement methodology, have shown that the actual instantaneous measured exposure is lower than the maximum measured possible exposure, either in the absence of 5G traffic (environmental measurement) or in the presence of active 5G traffic generated with a high volume of data. These results were presented at the BioEM (Bioelectromagnetic) conference held last spring in Oxford.\n\n## 2.10.6.4. Adaptation to customer needs\n\nOne of the lessons learned from our Voice of the Customer programs is that there is demand for products and services tailored to the needs of our customers.\n\nIn Spain , miMovistar allows customers to subscribe to, configure and manage what they need at any given moment and what they are actually going to use. In this way, customers are able to configure their bundles, choosing from a range of options designed to make their lives better. They decide what is best for them.\n\nGermany's O2 Grow, the first tariff in the country that automatically increases annually the offering to the customer every year without price increases (i.e. each year customers get 10 GB added to their monthly data allowance for free). This meets the customer's need to have more and more data on a wider range of devices, without having to pay more.\n\nIn addition, with Testkarte, customers can test our network (voice and data coverage) for 30 days free of charge before having to decide whether they want to sign up with us. This gives customers an excellent opportunity to test whether the product meets their expectations and needs, thereby avoiding a bad post-purchase experience. Furthermore, with the Flex for Free option, customers have a flexible contract with no minimum length and at no additional cost.\n\n## Customer Health Index\n\nOur goal in Telef\u00f3nica Spain, is for all our products and services to achieve a score above 90%, with corrective initiatives being established prior to market launch for those that do not.\n\nWe hit our 2023 target for our main products, in that they all registered a rate of over 90%. For value-added services, the average and weighted score exceeded the target of 92%.\n\n## 2.10.6.5. Customer service management\n\n## Complaints\n\nAchieving satisfactory solutions to complaints is vital for Telef\u00f3nica. Listening to customers and resolving complaints has a decisive influence on both customer satisfaction rates and on whether customers recommend services. For this reason, Telef\u00f3nica has teams dedicated exclusively to dealing with all complaints, be they by telephone, email or post.\n\nIn Spain and Brazil, in addition to the usual channels, we also have offices to deal with escalated complaints.\n\n## Customer Defence Service (Spain)\n\nIn 2023 the Customer Defence Service (CDS) continued its efforts. This is a pioneering customer initiative among telecommunications operators, which was launched by Telef\u00f3nica voluntarily in 2006. It is an independent area of the business that Telef\u00f3nica provides to its customers as a higher authority for escalating complaints if they have not received a satisfactory response from the first line of customer service. CDS resolutions are based on fair and independent criteria and are binding for the Company.",

Of these cases, 88% were resolved in favour of the customer. In terms of the channels used, virtually all requests (98%) were made using the online form once the postal method was withdrawn (the postal method remains only for exceptional cases affecting individuals that should not be left behind, such as older people or those without access to digital resources, etc.).\n\nThe second function of the CDS is to identify and report to committees and management opportunities to improve internal processes and practices with regard to the end customer. In this regard, in 2023 the CDS continued to report on the device-leasing offer, both in terms of the offer itself and concerning logistics and maintenance matters. Reports have also been submitted on procurement using the new customer authentication and express acceptance method, which involves a onetime password (OTP).\n\n## Ouvidoria (Brazil)\n\nVivo has a channel for dealing with customer complaints in the second instance, to assist those who have already used other service channels and have not had their problems resolved. The channel aims to transform every complaint into a story, which feeds back to the whole organisation in pursuit of the best customer experience through our services. Its mission is to represent the interests of customers within the Company, acting impartially in the analysis and handling of complaints received, as well as in the review of internal processes.\n\nOuvidoria is open to all of the operator's customers who have, or have had, Vivo services.\n\nIn 2023 Ouvidoria handled 138,000 calls per month, contributing to a 16% reduction in complaints to the Brazilian Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (Anatel). In a pioneering move, it extended its opening hours to 19:00 and also achieved 100% compliance with the new Service Quality Regulation (RQUAL) inspections, demonstrating total alignment with regulatory requirements and a broad commitment to improving the experience of customers who use the channel.\n\n## 2.10.6.6. Voice of the Customer Programs\n\nOur main operations use the same methodology, which is beneficial when it comes to sharing best practices.\n\nAnonymised data is used in all cases. It is updated after every interaction and is available online and from any device for any area of the organisation.\n\n## Spain\n\nIn 2023, 16 million customer surveys were conducted with nearly three million responses received.\n\nThese surveys provide information on various relevant KPIs, such as satisfaction with the process, with the channel and with the technician, operation, performance, devices, etc., and include open questions where the customer can freely express his or her opinion of the service. Customer responses are analysed and classified using AI techniques to inform decision-making and continuously improve customer care.\n\nHandling dissatisfied customers through the closethe-loop approach has resulted in almost 70% of customers ending up satisfied.\n\nAll levels of Telef\u00f3nica's internal organisation, from the areas that work with the customer service channels to the Management Committee and our suppliers, have access to the Voice of the Customer tool, which allows them to take action to improve the satisfaction of Movistar's customers.\n\n## Germany\n\nGermany has its own Voice of the Customer tool that it uses as a yardstick for 25 customer journeys and touchpoints, as well as ad hoc studies to measure, for example, user experience or how a product launch or campaign is received. The tool records around 1.2 million results per year in total.\n\nIn addition to collecting customer recommendation information (NPS) and the reasons why customers would recommend the service or not, in order to analyse the root cause, other indicators such as customer effort, the percentage of unfriendly interactions, and perception of the network, the brand and the price are also measured.\n\nAround 5,000 calls are made per month to detracting customers, mainly to close the loop, which is reflected in a significant increase in the NPS score.",

We receive more than 50 million responses from our customers each year . They are the main driving force for the transformation of the Company's customer journeys, processes and channels, through the satisfaction teams.\n\nThese multi-disciplinary and multi-hierarchical teams are trained to identify and address structural opportunities that affect many areas of the Company, impacting millions of customers in recent years.\n\nAnother of the most significant initiatives is DNA Resolve, another close-the-loop program that aims to convert dissatisfied customers. Some 67% of customers say that their problem was resolved after a follow-up survey.\n\nThe initiative allows for the incorporation of continuous improvement models as, in addition to solving each customer's specific problem, the information obtained is categorised and turned into input for prioritising structural improvements to customer journeys and business procedures, thereby preventing other customers from experiencing the same problems.\n\nThis joint endeavour is reflected in the improvement in overall customer satisfaction, the Net Promoter Score (which has grown steadily in recent years), and the decreasing number of complaints made by our customers to consumer protection agencies in Brazil: over 40% fewer complaints to Anatel in the last two years (ref: 1H23).\n\n## 2.10.6.7. Responsible communication\n\nWe have updated the Movistar Plus+ Responsible Communication Code. The aim of this code is to convey the measures through which we implement the principles and commitments of the Responsible Communication Regulations on the television platform.\n\n## Planet Pledge\n\nIn 2023 we delivered training to around 450 marketing, communications, events and sponsorship staff to enable them to identify the environmental impact of their projects and help them reduce it. We also provided guidelines and recommendations on how to avoid and detect greenwashing.\n\n## Milestones\n\n- \u008c We remain committed to incorporating the voice of the customer in our processes and adapting our value proposition to what they really need.\n- \u008d We incorporated AI into our customer service channels to offer a personalised experience.\n- \u008e Our customer recommendation levels continued to rise.\n- \u008f We complied with the emissions levels established by the ICNIRP, even in countries without their own regulations.",

Sustainable offering\n\n## 2.11.1.1. Vision\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we are committed to achieving a world where t echnology helps protect the planet and connects people's lives, leaving no one behind. That is why we promote the digital and green transitions as twin transitions while at the same time being committed to accessibility and developing solutions that help improve people's lives.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly urgent to accelerate the green transformation of the economy and society in order to achieve the required level of decarbonisation and limit the global temperature increase to below 1.5\u00b0C. The digital transition is key to achieving this, , while improving the competitiveness of the economy at the same time.\n\nOrganisations such as the World Economic Forum and the Exponential Roadmap initiative state that digital technologies can help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 20230 when implemented in industrial sectors, and by up to 35% if we consider their ability to transform people's habits.\n\n## Launching\n\nthe first three services focused on digital security and anti-fraud as part of the GSMA Open Gateway initiative.\n\n## We develop green digital solutions to help our customers transition towards more sustainable and competitive business models.\n\nWe are also work to reduce the environmental impact of our products, and we provide transparent information on the environmental benefits they offer. This enables customers to integrate sustainability criteria into their purchasing decisions and consume technology in a more responsible way.\n\nWe work not only with the environment in mind but society as well, as it is people who give meaning to technology not the other way around. We therefore ensure that our offering is ethical, inclusive and respectful of human rights.",

Energy and climate change\n\nAccordingly, to this end, we have set the goal of further deploying the Eco Smart seal in all our operations by 2024 .\n\nIn addition, we use our internal assessment framework Responsibility by Design to promote the adoption of ethical, environmental and accessibility criteria into new products and services (P&S) from the development phase through to final delivery to the customer.\n\nIn that regard, we have set the target of assessing 100% of our new products and services against the Responsibility by Design framework by 2025.\n\n## 2.11.2 Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nWhile it is true that connectivity and digital solutions reduce CO 2 emissions from other sectors and improve people's lives, they are also resource intensive , consuming large volumes of resources such as minerals, water and energy. According to the European Commission, digital technologies consume 8-10% of the world's energy and generate 2-4% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTo minimise these negative effects, we are reducing the environmental footprint of our network, which is the base of all the digital solutions we offer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2. Energy and climate change\n\nThe UN expert panel has warned that the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 globally.\n\nAs a result, we foresee an increased customer demand for technological solutions that will make their operations and processes more sustainable by reducing their Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and also a greater demand for products with a lower environmental impact and more circular that help reduce their scope 3 emissions.\n\nThis will deliver new business opportunities for our connectivity and Eco Smart solutions, as well as for the new services based on innovative technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) that we plan to develop in the coming years to help our customers decarbonise. We also hope to meet the growing demand for products with a low environmental impact through projects such as the Eco Rating label and circular economy-based products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.3.

This will ensure inclusive services for all people, set us apart from the competition and enhance our reputation.\n\nAt the same time, we have observed a considerable rise in the size and relative weight of the market of people with disabilities and older people. Betting on accessibility therefore represents an opportunity to boost our market share.\n\nThese business opportunities inherently carry risks associated with the greater costs of investing in the development of products with a lower environmental impact. However, the Company will continue to focus on innovation to mitigate these risks as much as possible and meet the current or future demands of our stakeholders in terms of ethics, privacy, human rights, accessibility and the environment.\n\nWe develop these solutions in tandem with a number of technology partners in order to ensure a positive impact on the entrepreneurial ecosystem that contributes to the development of companies and startups.\n\n## 2.11.1.3. Action plan and commitments\n\nTo ensure that we keep the negative impacts of our products and services to a minimum while enhancing the positive, we work to incorporate different environmental, accessibility and ethical principles therein.

It is a core service that we offer directly to our customers, and it is also included in the majority of the most advanced digital solutions. Telecommunications networks are therefore the main and most powerful platform for making progress towards the green transition.\n\nOur sustainability strategy focuses on optimising these networks through energy efficiency, renewable energy and advanced technologies, including fibre as a replacement for copper (85% more energy efficient) and 5G (up to 90% more efficient than 4G in terms of energy consumption per unit of traffic).\n\nAs a result, we can respond to the growing demand for data with a robust, secure, stable and increasingly sustainable network that supports the adoption of actions that contribute to the reduction of CO 2 emissions , such as teleworking, migration of services and servers to the cloud , and remote training and medical care, etc.\n\n## 5G connectivity-based solutions\n\nOver the next decade 5G is expected to bring about unprecedented technological disruption in several sectors of the economy and in society. At Telef\u00f3nica we are already offering 5G solutions for large companies and administrations . The first use cases we offer include the incorporation of robots into industry to improve processes and operations; remote assistance with supervision, assembly and operation of assets provided remotely by expert staff; and the use of drones for inspections of critical and remote assets, stock control, supervision and control of spaces, swift assistance, etc.\n\nThese use cases remove the need for travel, improve predictive maintenance, increase the efficiency of productive processes and therefore generate significant environmental benefits for our customers.\n\nProductivity and collaboration solutions enable people inside and outside the organisation to connect and work remotely and flexibly. They deliver considerable environmental benefits by reducing travel, fuel consumption and office HVAC. All this translates into lower CO 2 emissions and less air pollution in cities.\n\n## Cloud\n\nCompanies are increasingly relying on the cloud to carry out an endless number of processes that make them more agile, flexible and efficient. The cloud offers them a place to integrate all their networks and services safely, provides instant access to critical information, delivers greater control of their business and increases engagement among their employees.\n\nWe have made a commitment to offer companies solutions that best suit their needs. That's why we have a comprehensive portfolio of global services, which has been enhanced by worldwide agreements with leading hyperscalers, including AWS, Google and Microsoft Azure.",

The average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of our main data centres in 2023 was 1.69.\n\nConsequently, the migration of companies to the cloud leads to reduced energy consumption and therefore reduced emissions.\n\n## IoT, big data, AI and blockchain\n\nTechnologies such as IoT, big data, AI and blockchain are key to economic recovery and sustainability.\n\nAll connected objects and equipment generate data in real time. When we combine the data from these objects with those of our customers and other external sources, we get processed and analysed information that enables us to increase the efficiency of production processes, reduce consumption of raw materials, decrease wastage and even extend the life span of equipment. This can all be seen in services such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Smart meters for our customers in Spain and the United Kingdom, where Telef\u00f3nica manages millions of connected electricity, water and gas meters.\n- \u00b7 Solutions for smart cities based on the optimisation of lighting, parking space use, waste management and collection, and on high precision prediction and analysis of air pollution in cities.\n- \u00b7 Energy efficiency solutions , telemetry and remote management of energy consumption at the offices, factories or buildings of companies with a large geographical spread, such as hotels, banks and supermarkets.\n- \u00b7 Agricultural management solutions, such as precision farming, which enables more efficient decision-making and maximises yields, and smart irrigation management, which combines information sources with AI-based telemetry and telecontrol systems at all stages of irrigation, thereby saving water by optimising consumption and minimising leaks and breakages in storage and distribution systems.\n- \u00b7 Solutions for the transport sector that optimise the planning of transport systems and infrastructure through a greater understanding of passengers, timetables and routes, thereby adapting plans to the real needs of passengers with maximum budgetary control and minimal environmental impact.\n\n- \u00b7 Mobility solutions , such as our fleet management and asset tracking solutions, which make all kinds of processes more efficient, including route optimisation, resulting in reduced consumption of energy and associated CO 2 emissions, and vehicle condition monitoring, helping to extend vehicles' useful life.\n- \u00b7 Solutions for Industry 5.0, which see private networks (5G or LTE) and associated solutions (for example, AGVs, predictive maintenance, asset control and operator safety) taking the manufacturing and mining industries and the port and airport management sector to new levels of operation, flexibility, productivity and efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Drones , which make it possible to monitor and optimise operations and guarantee the life cycle of industrial plants, supervision of works, safety and emergency management, etc. With this solution, Telef\u00f3nica offers an end-to-end service including drones with cameras and sensors, connectivity, a fleet management platform and piloting and maintenance of the solution.\n\nIn addition, the inclusion of the technological capacities of blockchain in many of the use cases mentioned above improves traceability, transparency and security, delivering faster and more efficient ways of doing things. Examples of this are our implementation of document management (which eliminates the use of paper in the management of delivery notes, official certificates, contracts, etc.) and the traceability of foodstuffs and medicines to optimise logistics and promote the circular economy.\n\n## B2C - Connected Living\n\nOur mobile and fibre connectivity services are key to people leading more digital lives. Thanks to these services, customers in the residential segment can use online applications or services to work and learn remotely, share cars, access real-time information on the public transport in their cities and, consequently, are able to make many of their day-to-day activities more environmentally friendly.\n\n## Emissions avoided by our customers\n\nEach year we quantify Telef\u00f3nica's contribution to the twin transitions and calculate the greenhouse gas emissions we help our customers avoid by using our connectivity and Eco Smart solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2.

Circular economy\n\n## Accessible mobiles\n\nWe are steadfastly committed to putting technology to work for people, leaving no one behind.\n\nThat is why we require our suppliers to assess the accessibility of their handsets as part of the homologation process for the mobile devices we purchase. We make this information available to our customers so that they can purchase the handset that best suits their needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n en el apartado 2.12. Inclusi\u00f3n Digital\n\nThis is a internal assessment framework that we have developed with the aim of promoting the inclusion of ethical, environmental sustainability and accessibility principles into products, services and channels and their various upgrades from development all the way through to final delivery to the customer.\n\nThe Responsibility by Design framework encompasses two main pillars :\n\n- \u00b7 Design ethics linked to our commitment to our customers to ensure transparency, simplicity and integrity in all communications and interactions we have with them. This also means that we follow ethical and responsible principles in the use of AI and data management, harnessing their full potential safely and securely and avoiding unintended consequences.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability applied to design , ensuring respect for human rights in order to promote positive impacts and avoid negative impacts that could pose a risk to the Company. For example, we promote accessibility as a cross-cutting principle right from the outset, so that everyone can use our products and services in a satisfactory, safe and independent manner. We also minimise the impact of our activity on the environment while helping our customers to reduce theirs by using our solutions.",

In short, to become a more responsible company, we need to be able to put ourselves in our customers' shoes from the outset and anticipate their needs.\n\n## Accessible channels\n\nWith the aim of achieving an equal and barrier-free user experience for all our customers, we are working to improve the accessibility of our shops and our procurement, communication, customer service and support channels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.12. Digital inclusion\n\n## 2.11.1.4. Progress in 2023\n\n## > Eco Smart\n\nLast year we continued developing green digital solutions and rolling out the Eco Smart seal in new markets. Currently, AENOR has assessed the solutions catalogues for T. Tech, Spain, Germany, T. Tech UK&I, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Telef\u00f3nica Global Solutions ( TGS ). Its results have verified 52% of the services we offer the B2B segment as being Eco Smart because of their potential to deliver environmental benefits and contribute to mitigating our customers' impact on the planet.\n\nWe also continued evaluating newly launched products and services. Once evaluated, these are added to the catalogue for the Group's companies already verified under the Eco Smart framework in previous years.\n\n## > Avoided emissions\n\nThanks to the efficiencies generated by our connectivity and Eco Smart services, we helped our customers avoid the emission of 86.1 million tonnes of CO 2 in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see chapter 2.2. Energy and climate change\n\n## > Eco Rating\n\nParticipation in the Eco Rating project expanded further in 2023, to reach a new total of 11 telecommunications companies and over 20 mobile device manufacturers.\n\nBy 2023 the project had been available in all of Telef\u00f3nica's markets in Europe and Latin America (with the exception of Venezuela as we do not sell handsets there). In the time between updating and launching the new Eco Rating label system in 2021 to the end of 2023, we in Telef\u00f3nica assessed more than 200 devices.\n\n## > Responsibility by Design\n\nWe have evaluated more than 80 products under the Responsibility by Design project since its inception. Its principles have been introduced into the development process for new products and services at Telef\u00f3nica Spain, and over the course of 2023 we began introducing them at Telef\u00f3nica Brazil.\n\nIn 2023 we also started reviewing the environmental, accessibility and AI requirements relevant to Responsibility by Design. Our purpose was, on the one hand, to improve the level of excellence of our products and services in terms of ethics and sustainability from 2024 onwards and, on the other, to align ourselves with the European Accessibility Act, which will come into force from 2025.\n\nWith regard to the ethical aspects of AI, last year we published our Artificial Intelligence Governance Model Regulations . These internal rules define the roles and processes involved in the responsible management of AI, among other things. The document is our frame of reference for all matters relating to the design, development, use, acquisition and marketing of AI systems at Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nWe have also created an app to document the AI systems that are developed, used and/or marketed at the Company, in order to identify associated risks.\n\n## Milestones\n\n- \u008c 52% of Telef\u00f3nica's services have been verified as Eco Smart.\n- \u008d We implemented the Eco Rating in 100% of our markets.\n- \u008e We published the Artificial Intelligence Governance Model Regulations, which define the roles and processes involved in the responsible management of AI, among other matters.",

Vision\n\nFor Telef\u00f3nica, putting in place measures to encourage innovation and product development has been an integral part of our business throughout our 100-year history.\n\nWe view innovation as the ability to anticipate the future and to understand the needs and challenges our customers and society as a whole are dealing with.\n\nFor Telef\u00f3nica, being a pioneering company means anticipating market needs and tackling social and environmental challenges with an inclusive, ethical and human approach.\n\nOur strategy is built on two pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Incremental innovation, which is about pursuing the continuous improvement of existing technologies to adapt them to new societal demands, thus allowing us to develop more efficient and sustainable solutions.\n- \u00b7 Disruptive innovation, which enables us to identify new business models capable of transforming the market and contributing to social development.\n\nThis innovation strategy is underpinned by a two-pronged approach:\n\n- \u00b7 First, seeking to boost internal and cross-cutting activity throughout the Company, especially from the units of networks and IT systems and the digital service development..\n- \u00b7 Secondly, and based on open innovation, seeking to promote the entrepreneurial ecosystem through the support and financing of startups. In addition, we encourage collaboration with technology partners with the aim of attracting the best external innovation available on the market.\n\n## 2.11.2.2. Governance and policies\n\nOur Responsible Business Principles, the Company's ethical code, are the main framework that set our commitment to innovation. Section five of our Principles describes our commitment to innovation, development and the responsible use of technology.\n\nAs innovation is a cross-cutting process that is present throughout the organisation, there is no centralised management. We do, however, have a number of organisational structures that spearhead each of the different key aspects.\n\nThe main areas involved in innovation management are:",

Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nTechnological disruption, the relevance of connectivity, digitalisation processes and customer experience bring both risks and opportunities.\n\nInnovation itself is essential to ensure a transformation that secures efficiency, business growth and user confidence. In addition, R&D investments are fundamental to our Company's long-term growth, as they foster our productivity and competitiveness.\n\nOf the different potential risks of not tackling sustainable innovation, we must highlight the loss of income due to a portfolio of obsolete products and services that are not adapted to the evolution of market demands. Precisely, a consumer who is increasingly aware of sustainability issues pushes us to improve the quality of our products and incorporate ESG criteria in the design and marketing processes.\n\nOn the other hand, there is also a risk associated with misuse of what is being developed, or inadequate technical development. To avoid these cases, we try to carry out a detailed analysis of each objective we want to cover and to evaluate each of the problems we are trying to solve during the whole process of creating new solutions.\n\n## Innovation is becoming our main asset for contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWhen talking about the opportunities generated by innovation, we should mention the new knowledge, technologies and digital solutions that enable us to tackle existing social and environmental challenges and guarantee the future sustainability of our organisation.",

By promoting startups , we are fostering social change and economic recovery. Our projects create jobs, improve business competitiveness and contribute positively to the communities in which they are implemented.\n\n## 2.11.2.4. Action plan, commitments and progress\n\nWe are going to analyse the progress of each of the activities developed by the main areas that manage innovation.\n\n## > Core innovation\n\nOur priority in this area is to develop new digital services that improve people's lives, and we leverage the Company's main assets, such as its telecommunications networks, digital platforms and information systems to do so. Our current business units - which include IoT, big data and video - have their roots in projects that were developed years ago by the core innovation teams.\n\nSome of the projects that were developed as part of core innovation projects in previous years and began to be marketed in 2023 are:\n\n- \u00b7 Web3, which provides a financial layer on top of the traditional web and facilitates frictionless economic transactions online, creating opportunities for innovative business models.\n- \u00b7 NFT marketplace , a platform for the creation and sale of digital art on which we collaborated with Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica and other social organisations.\n- \u00b7 Digital identity , a project aligned with the proposed European digital wallet, which seeks to introduce a single Digital Identity system in the EU. With this project, we are creating the necessary capacity to facilitate management of the future digital identity scheme.\n- \u00b7 New Living Apps , apps available through our television platform that enable innovative marketing schemes such as live shopping, which offers the possibility of incorporating commercial streaming content and providing incentives for shopping as part of the consumer experience. We also moved ahead with including payment capabilities in the Living Apps environment.\n- \u00b7 Cognitive digital marketing , applying AI algorithms to data. The aim is to achieve better marketing results while ensuring consumer privacy, complying with our ethical commitments in the development of algorithms\n\nand AI, and covering our customers' needs. This initiative has led to the creation of UTIQ, a joint venture involving a number of telcos, through which we are fostering an advertising ID solution that enables customers to retain control over when, how and with whom they share their data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see chapter 2.18. Privacy and security.\n\nLastly, in addition to our role as pioneers in the technological world, we devote a certain amount of our innovation efforts to improving existing technologies. We also work with private and public organisations and with the world of academia on projects that we develop in conjunction with universities at a national and international level.\n\n## > Open Gateway\n\nThe new technologies incorporated into networks in recent years have opened the door to innovative services being developed and new business models being built around them.\n\nCombining cloud computing with the softwarisation of network elements and functions allows for the development of new business models based on Network as a Service (NaaS). At the same time, telecommunications companies have been upgrading the information systems and software platforms that operate the networks.\n\nAll this allows us to make certain functions securely available through standardised interfaces (Application Programmable Interfaces, or APIs) so that other companies can develop end services that are far more optimised and better adapted to the demands of the current market.\n\nThe driving force behind this strategic project is the GSMA. By November 2023, 39 mobile operator groups had signed up to the project, representing more than 200 mobile networks and over 60% of global mobile connections.\n\nGSMA Open Gateway was introduced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in 2023. In November, in cooperation with two other leading operators in Brazil, we launched the first three APIs: Number Verify, SIM Swap and Device Location.",

This entails significant changes and improvements, from updating the network architecture itself to adapting processes and ways of working. All this takes place while fostering autonomy through data management, AI and machine learning, at the same time as we continue to maintain a customer-, sustainabilityand security-oriented approach.\n\nThe program is led by the Autonomous Network Department in collaboration with the Technological Innovation and Ecosystems Department, and is implemented through local projects in each of the Telef\u00f3nica Group operators.\n\nThe three pillars of this program are:\n\n- 1.

We did this through a use case of augmented reality at sporting events, which demonstrated that the networks can be deployed within minutes.\n\nWe alternate performance of tests like these with the exploration of new technologies as part of both European (Hexa-X-II, Trialsnet) and national (6GDatadriven, 6G-Chronos, 6G-Integration) projects.\n\n## We contribute to the development of new mobile communication networks to make them more sustainable and secure.\n\n- \u00b7 Communications at home: we are working on the development of a high-performance Wi-Fi solution that will allow us to control and program the home network at a competitive cost. These capabilities will encourage the development and deployment of new services with real-time requirements, such as virtual and augmented reality, video services and 8K gaming.\n- \u00b7 Open and disaggregated networks : these networks will enable us to increase our flexibility in deploying new architectures, prepare 6G deployment models, programme new use cases and facilitate innovation. Costs will also improve as the supplier ecosystem expands and the sources of supply diversify.\n\nIn the area of open networks (Open RAN) we are developing pilots and limited rollouts in the UK, Germany and Brazil. We work with both traditional suppliers, evolving towards Open/Cloud RAN architectures, and new manufacturers to expand the supplier ecosystem in the area of radio infrastructure (Radio Access Network - RAN). These activities are complemented by collaborations with O-RAN Alliance and other European operators through Open RAN MoU.\n\nWe are also working on Open Broadband, a new open multi-vendor fixed access solution that enables speeds of 10 Gbps. It is expected to be certified to be ready for deployment in 2024. At the same time, we are innovating in relation to a future move towards 50GPON technology and are lab-testing the preliminary prototypes.\n\nLastly, research work on high-capacity technologies in the access network deserves a special mention. In 2023 we demonstrated that coherent optics could be used to provide point-to-point channels with up to 200 Gbps symmetric speeds over a fibre optic access network. Our work included the specification, laboratory testing and validation work on disaggregated solutions for optical transport and IP, which made it possible to deploy the technology in markets such as Germany.\n\nIn addition, alongside other operators, we use the technical specifications of the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) in our procurement processes, and the first solutions are already being certified.\n\n- \u00b7 Quantum communications : we are working on new technologies that are still in development, such as quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC).\n\nWe have deployed a quantum communications ring in Madrid, where we have verified the integration of QKD technology in a real-world environment and incorporated it into the European Quantum Communication Infrastructure (Euro-QCI).\n\nWe also launched two projects in 2023 to study the convergence of quantum-safe solutions (PQC and QKD) and demonstrate their use via use cases related to software-based network environments.\n\nWe participated in two of the European Commission's flagship quantum projects: QIA, which focuses on the architecture of the new quantum Internet; and QSNP, which focuses on quantum-safe networks.\n\nWe successfully completed our demonstration of QKD network interconnection using PQC technologies, which we began under the OpenQKD project; we also put forward benchmark architecture for the quantum internet of the future at the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).",

We also helped to prepare a technology and investment roadmap for the new generation of cloud and edge computing in Europe as part of the European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge and Cloud. In addition, we obtained approval from the European and Spanish authorities to start a project of this type in Spain. This initiative falls under a European project, IPCEI-CIS, which incorporates major innovations in the areas of sustainability and security, among other topics.\n\nThe work we have done helps us to meet EU requirements in relation to privacy, security and energy efficiency, and to contribute to the EU's digital targets for 2030 (the Digital Decade).\n\n## Data- and AI-driven operations\n\nWe are exploring solutions that make it easier for our technical teams to make decisions more efficiently and quickly, taking advantage of the benefits of AI and machine learning , as well as the large volume of data in our network . We are preparing for future use cases that represent a true revolution and place AI at the heart of new autonomous networks.\n\nIn 2023 progress was made in all of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's operations in terms of automation and autonomy in the planning, testing, deployment, operations, and network domains (fixed and mobile access, transport and core) and cloud infrastructure optimisation processes.\n\nWe explored new technologies such as digital twins in the 'Customer Experience (CX) and Automation' project within the TMForum. As part of this initiative, we took the customer experience index and AI techniques, and tested the use of generative AI in customer service assistants.\n\nLastly, we continued to support our Telef\u00f3nica Technology & Automation LAB . This is an open innovation laboratory for cutting-edge technologies and next-generation network automation; it is an essential node of knowledge inside the Innovation and Talent Hub at Distrito Telef\u00f3nica.\n\n## > Open innovation\n\nFor the past 15 years, Telef\u00f3nica Open Innovation has been supporting the Group as it searches for and invests in innovative startup solutions that will enable us to meet our challenges as a company, as a sector and as a key player in social progress.\n\nOur open innovation strategy pursues three objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 To internally transform Telef\u00f3nica by incorporating startup-developed technology and products (digitalisation, automation and cultural change).\n- \u00b7 To identify disruptive trends and opportunities for growth (game changers).\n- \u00b7 To generate new revenue streams and financial returns from investments.\n\nToday, of the more than 1,100 enterprises we have invested in, over 370 startups have ended up working with Telef\u00f3nica, generating an approximate value of over \u20ac800 million for the Company. Most importantly, we have taken their innovative solutions to our customers as well, to help them with their digital transformations and to enable them to generate efficiencies internally.\n\nWe firmly believe in the transformative potential of innovation and technology to forge a sustainable future. W e are signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), which entails integrating ESG targets and factors into all our investment decisions. Our vision is to lead the way to responsible, inclusive and sustainable digitalisation, while also boosting responsible investment in the venture capital community.",

Present in nine countries in Latin America and Europe, Wayra is a complete and unique interface between entrepreneurs and our network of partners (large companies, governments and other major stakeholders). We have innovation hubs, which are spaces that allow us to showcase the most innovative startup technologies to our customers and partners. In total, over \u20ac70 million has been invested in more than 850 startups. The portfolio currently holds more than 400 startups.\n\nWayra includes a corporate venture capital fund and always invests alongside other leading venture capital firms in late seed startups and sectors such as entertainment (gaming and video), IoT, big data, AI, eHealth, fintech, energy, the metaverse and Web3. Furthermore, since 2022, Wayra has also been managing the capital of Telef\u00f3nica Group companies that has been earmarked for investing in startups through Vivo Ventures in Brazil and \u00cdope Ventures with Telef\u00f3nica Seguros.\n\nThis is our corporate venture capital vehicle for more strategic investments. The intention is to address the main challenges facing the telecommunications industry and create new businesses by leveraging cuttingedge technologies.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica Ventures invests directly in startups during the growth stage, with investment tickets ranging from \u20ac350,000 to \u20ac5 million, and it invests indirectly through a network of the leading venture capital funds in key markets. Among the most significant funds is Leadwind, in which we are an anchor investor. This fund invests in deep tech scale-ups in southern Europe and Brazil.\n\nSince its launch in 2006, Telef\u00f3nica Ventures has invested a total of \u20ac160 million; it has a current portfolio of 19 startups it has invested in directly, plus over 120 startups it has invested in through its network of 14 venture capital funds.\n\nAfter 15 years of encouraging and investing in startups, we have achieved a degree of experience that we share within Telef\u00f3nica and with the other corporations we help to implement their own open innovation initiatives.\n\nWe have created a network of over 140 partners, consisting of large companies, governments and other players. Through the network we are able to work collaboratively with our partners and obtain mutual benefits. Two major alliances are particularly noteworthy: Alaian, the mission of which is to reinvent the telco industry by identifying disruptive startups and providing them with access to a network of one billion customers; and the Open Future accelerator network in Spain and Hispanoamerica, which fosters the creation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem outside of cities.\n\nWe develop programs with third parties in strategic verticals with a view to securing our position as the main partners of future game changers. Some examples are the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) in Brazil; the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) (to boost corporate venture capital in Latin America); and Hotelbeds, Desigual and Opentop in Spain.",

Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nThe aim of digital inclusion is to ensure that all people have access to ICTs (information and communication technologies) and know how to use them effectively to improve their quality of life and economic well-being.\n\nAs a telecommunications company, Telef\u00f3nica, plays an key role in this regard, as its business activities can have an impact on digital inclusion,\n\nWith regards to the impacts of digital inclusion, these can be both positive and negative. The most significant of its potential positive impacts on society are:\n\n- \u00b7 enabling individuals and society as a whole to benefit from digitalisation,\n- \u00b7 contributing to the economic development of local communities by providing a reliable, robust and efficient network,\n- \u00b7 promoting digital connectivity and services in rural communities to ensure an equal distribution of economic benefits in the digital age.\n\nOn the contrary, it is crucial to minimise the potential impacts of a widening digital divide, such as issues related to the accessibility or affordability of the solutions offered and the potential effects that the installation of network infrastructure may have on property rights. Furthermore, it is essential to ensure that we protect vulnerable groups from potentially inappropriate content.\n\nThat is why we work to offer products and services that are tailored to the needs of society, making sure no one is left behind regardless of race, physical ability, gender, age or socioeconomic level.\n\nFinally, we should stress that digital inclusion poses a major risk, it being the so-called digital divide, which is caused by a lack of accessibility, affordability problems, digital skills, infrastructure or relevant services for users.\n\nAccording to studies conducted by the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), the international association of mobile operators, there are five main barriers to digital inclusion:\n\n- 1. Availability of high-speed networks enabling access to broadband services, mainly in remote or rural environments.\n- 2. Lack of digital knowledge and skills among the population.\n- 3. Affordability of prices for basic services preventing people on limited incomes from accessing new digital services.\n- 4. Relevance and usefulness of new services that make them attractive to use.\n- 5. Concerns about the security and privacy of technology solutions, and the risks associated with the use of online services.\n\nIn addition to these barriers, we should also consider the risks associated with the regulations that shape the context in which we operate.\n\nDespite the complex nature of some of these challenges, the opportunities offered by digitalisation are key to economic and social development.\n\nIn this regard, companies in the telecommunications sector have come to function as society's 'nervous system' by keeping enterprises and communities active and connected and by delivering solutions capable of addressing the major challenges contained in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nTherefore, not only can we make a positive contribution to social development by promoting the safe and responsible use of technology and the digital capabilities of society, but doing so also offers an opportunity for our business to grow. Connecting new population segments or regions and developing new accessible digital services that are easier to use will enable us to guarantee a promising future for the Company.",

Action plan, commitments and progress\n\nWe explain below our work in the pillars of digital inclusion: inclusive access, digital skills training, innovation and relevant services, and the safe and responsible use of technology.\n\n## 2.12.4.1. Inclusive access\n\nWe are working on several lines of action to ensure that everyone has access to digitalisation:\n\n## Connectivity rollout\n\nThe deployment of telecommunications infrastructure and the supply of digital services are essential for the economic and social development of any given region.\n\nThe following initiatives help us achieve this:\n\n## We connect the unconnected\n\nDespite the large-scale deployment of networks around the world, millions of people still do not have access to the Internet, or the connectivity they do have is very limited, especially in rural or remote regions.\n\nWe therefore promote the rollout of new communications networks in all regions, with a particular focus on rural areas.\n\nIn such countries as Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Spain and Germany, we have announced plans to extend coverage and infrastructure under agreements with third parties that will enable us to provide mobile broadband and fibre services in rural areas.\n\n## We evolve and upgrade communications networks to provide the capacity needed for an increasingly digitalised economy.\n\nNew digital services require new advanced infrastructure capable of ensuring sufficient capacity to use them. That is why we are upgrading and expanding our networks to next-gen technologies that offer ultra-broadband services (5G and fibre optics).\n\n## Connectivity targets\n\nWe have set the following targets to ensure we continue rolling out the best and most efficient connectivity:\n\n- \u00b7 Achieve mobile broadband coverage for 90-97% of the rural population in our main markets by 2024, strengthening our commitment to the development of rural areas.\n- \u00b7 Exceed 100 million premises reached by fibre to the home (FTTH) by 2026 globally (74 million at the end of 2023), including 30 million premises reached by Telef\u00f3nica Infra (21 million at the end of 2023).\n\nAt country level:\n\n- \u00b7 Spain : achieve 100% fibre optic coverage by 2024. A further goal is to extend coverage until reaching five million fibre optic accesses in rural areas by the end of 2024 through Bluev\u00eda, the company set up between Telef\u00f3nica and a consortium comprising Vauban Venture and Credit Agricole Assurances.\n- \u00b7 Germany : promote the rollout of fibre optics in rural municipalities in collaboration with other partners. Our joint venture with Allianz aims to provide service to 2.2 million people over the coming years (approximately one million by 2026) by investing \u20ac5 billion, predominantly in rural areas. This will take us to 50,000 km of fibre optic installed over the six years since its creation in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Colombia : bring FTTH to four million locations in around 90 cities through the company set up by Telef\u00f3nica and KKR within three years of its creation in 2021. This will help the Government of Colombia reach its target of connecting 70% of all homes and, above all, will help to improve connectivity speed in the country which, in turn, will advance progress towards the goal of eliminating inequality in the digital transformation.\n- \u00b7 Brazil : bring fibre infrastructure to five million homes and businesses through FiBrasil, the joint venture set up between the Telef\u00f3nica Group and CDPQ, in the four years following its launch in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Peru : uphold our commitment to democratising Internet access by rolling out coverage in remote regions of the country through the Internet for All project. It was launched in 2018 and jointly developed with Facebook, IDB Invest and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF).\n- \u00b7 United Kingdom : reach 70% of the population with 5G by 2026. A further goal is to expand coverage of the fibre optic network to five million additional homes by 2026 through the new company set up between Telef\u00f3nica, Liberty Global and Infrav\u00eda.",

More than half of fibre networks belong to our company. We also own the largest UBB coverage outside China.\n\nIn turn, our 5G network already covers the majority of the population in Germany and Spain, as well as half of the population of Brazil and UK. We continued to expand our coverage in other operations too. We also launched 5G+ (5G SA) in Spain, Brazil and Germany, while UK launch is expected in the coming months. This technology enhances the user experience and enables companies to deploy advanced mobile connectivity services. Full 5G SA mass commercial deployment in our main markets is expected between 2023 and 2025, depending on the availability of the technology, devices and the spectrum, as well as specific market conditions.\n\n## Our 4G/LTE coverage reaches over 96% of the population in the four main markets in which we operate.\n\nMeanwhile, and in line with the target set for mobile broadband deployment in rural areas , we achieved the following coverage percentages in rural areas by yearend 2023: 95% in Spain, 99% in Germany, 99% in UK and 82% in Brazil.\n\nIt is worth noting that part of our sustainable bond funds, totalling \u20ac2.75 billion through to 2023, have been allocated to bringing connectivity to unconnected regions and improving Internet access in rural areas as a way to help narrow the digital divide.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 1.7. Finance for the transition to a sustainable economy\n\nBridging the digital divide in Latin America means defining new solutions that meet the specific needs of its rural areas. Telef\u00f3nica's proposed model is based on innovation, cooperation and sustainability. In 2023 we participated in the first meeting to promote digital inclusion in Latin America, a space in which the main actors in the sector met to exchange ideas, thoughts and good practices that will help with the challenge of reducing the digital divide in the region.\n\nAlso in 2023, we reaffirmed our partnership with CAF, Development Bank of Latin America, through a new Framework Cooperation Agreement that will further accelerate digitalisation in the region and contribute to SDG 9 of the 2030 Agenda.\n\nWe also work with the OneWeb high-performance satellite service to support connectivity expansion in Europe and Latin America. Together we will complement the current offering and reach new regions.\n\n## Accessibility and technologies at the service of people with disabilities\n\nPeople-centred digitalisation should take place from an inclusive perspective to ensure that no one is left behind, regardless of their personal, economic or social situation. For this reason, we are committed to the inclusion of people with disabilities and strive for universal accessibility on all four levels of the Telef\u00f3nica Accessible strategy: People, Processes, Facilities, and Products and Services.\n\nWith that in mind, in 2020 we became a signatory to the GSMA's Principles for Driving the Digital Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities, which provide a specific action framework for telecommunications operators. This commitment is reflected in the development of products and services adapted to the needs of people with disabilities. Also, it translates into actions aimed at improving the accessibility of our customer service and communication channels.",

Within this framework, we incorporate accessibility as a requirement for our online developments in line with the guidelines defined by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n\nWe also strive to develop innovative solutions to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Movistar Plus+, the world's first private television service that enables triple accessibility (audio description, subtitles and sign language) access to an extensive catalogue of content via the 5S feature.\n- \u00b7 Accessible points of sale (PoS) for ONCE Foundation vendors that include text-to-voice conversion systems and a Braille screen, among other accessibility features.\n- \u00b7 ViveLibre, a telecare and support service providing personal autonomy and healthcare for people with disabilities, led by ATAM.\n\nIn addition, through Wayra, we support startups that facilitate access to digital content and tools for the elderly and people with disabilities.\n\nTo generate support for achieving our targets, we raise awareness and train the departments and business units responsible for developing solutions. We also have a catalogue of accessibility handbooks and training courses that we make available to the entire workforce in order to guarantee accessibility on the main platforms and channels that we use to engage with our stakeholders.\n\nWe work with benchmark associations to gain a better understanding of the needs and demands of this segment. In Spain, we work with the ONCE Foundation, Iluni\u00f3n, CNSE and the DKV Integralia Foundation, among others. In addition, Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica is part of the Technology Alliance for Inclusion. On a global level, we take inspiration from such significant initiatives as The Valuable 500.\n\nAt the same time, we endeavour to ensure an equal user experience for all our customers by improving the accessibility of our customer service and communication channels, both online and offline, and striving to eliminate potential barriers throughout the customer journey.\n\nIn this regard, our websites comply with Level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 2.1) established by the W3C. We also offer a videointerpretation service for hearing-impaired customers in countries such as Spain, Brazil, Germany and Colombia as an alternative to telephone customer service.\n\nWith reference to our stores , we offer priority in-store customer support and video-interpreting services in countries such as Chile, Colombia and Brazil. Additionally, audio induction loop services for those with hearing loss is available in markets such as Spain and the United Kingdom. In Argentina we have developed and implemented an inclusive customer service API tool, which reduces barriers in face-to-face communication through an app. In the same country, we have implemented an intermediary service for people with hearing loss on our website. Meanwhile, in Mexico we offer our service contracts in audio format and video format with sign language.\n\nWe also train our sales staff on how to specifically serve customers with disabilities and we offer them priority service in our customer service centres. In this regard, in countries such as Colombia we have a Special Care Protocol for People with Disabilities.\n\nAs for our handsets, we provide information on the accessibility features of the mobile devices in our catalogue and work with mobile device manufacturers to develop new features that make them more accessible and easier to use for people with different abilities.\n\n## Targets for technologies at the service of people with disabilities\n\nAs part of the Responsibility by Design project, we are committed to making 100% of new products and services accessible by design by 2025.\n\n## Progress on technologies working for people with disabilities\n\nIn 2023, under the Responsibility by Design internal assessment framework, we evaluated 26 products against accessibility criteria.\n\nWe also continued to enhance our flagship solutions so as to address the needs of older people and people with disabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Movistar Plus+ 5S, the feature that allows customers with hearing or visual difficulties to access content on the Movistar Plus+ television platform, continued to increase its offer to more than 1,200 pieces of content with triple accessibility in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Mapcesible, the collaborative platform that facilitates mobility and identifies how accessible buildings, venues, and tourist sites are, has increased the number of mapped locations by almost 5,000 in 2023, surpassing 41,000 places.",

This platform is geared towards the experimental implementation of the technologies developed by ViveLibre in more than 400 homes. In this regard, it has deployed an industrial production process for home sensor devices, entrusting a special employment centre (a business that creates job opportunities for people with disabilities) with the component assembly process. The data analysis teams continue to improve the algorithm for producing predictive indicators aimed at preventing possible incidents, and they do so in a non-intrusive way, guided by the user's preferences.\n\nThroughout the year, we continued to establish partnerships and form part of associations of organisations committed to bridging the digital divide for people with disabilities. One example is Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica's adhesion to the Technology Alliance for Inclusion, an initiative financed by the European Union (EU). In Spain, we renewed the INSERTA Agreement with Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE and expanded the pool of expert entities with which we collaborate, adding organisations such as Fundaci\u00f3n DKV Integralia and Applause, among others. In Germany, we participated in the D21 Digital Future Challenge university competition, in which students were able to reflect on how to improve the accessibility of our artificial intelligence (AI) solution, Aura.\n\nIn UK, the role of Accessibility & Inclusive Design Lead became particularly significant. This role plays a key part in supporting our business areas to ensure our products, services and programs are accessible from the conceptualisation and design phase. Meanwhile, in Brazil, we created an interdepartmental accessibility team to ensure a barrier-free experience for customers and employees.\n\nLastly, it is worth highlighting that in 2023 we continued to expand the range of accessibility training on offer, and we did so through new resources designed for the entire workforce. For example, we created video clips on the specific needs of people with physical, audiovisual, organic, intellectual and mental disabilities. We also continued to offer training to employees in those areas that have particular responsibility for promoting accessibility across the business, such as Branding and Product Development.\n\n## Affordability\n\nRolling out connectivity always entails a cost that has an impact on the prices of the services offered.\n\nAlthough the uptake costs of fixed broadband and especially mobile broadband have declined over the past decade, we are continuing to work on new business models that will allow us to offer increasingly affordable tariffs so that we can ensure universal access to communications services.\n\nThe pay-as-you-go mobile service, specific broadband packages and services for small businesses and entrepreneurs are just some of the key tools we use at Telef\u00f3nica to facilitate access to telecommunications services.\n\n## Affordability targets\n\nOur goal is to guarantee that all segments of the population enjoy access to basic communications services. We analyse and seek business models that facilitate this access in each of the countries in which we operate.\n\nIn some of these countries we specifically contribute towards achieving this goal via the Universal Service Fund or we collaborate with the public authorities to offer subsidised or regulated services.\n\nThe Universal Service Fund is a public investment fund that is designed to guarantee service provision to all users regardless of their geographical location, while also meeting quality standards and maintaining an affordable price. The investment is controlled by the public bodies designated for this purpose in each country.\n\n## Progress on affordability\n\nIn Spain, as a result of our designation as the operator responsible for providing the Universal Service for 2023 and 2024, we expanded our social tariff options. The main change compared to the previous year was the incorporation of Internet browsing, unlimited calls to Spanish landlines and a monthly plan offering 50 minutes for calls from landlines to Spanish mobiles.\n\nThese rate reductions are a benefit that Movistar offers to retirees and pensioners when they sign up for a fixed telephone line or a fixed line plus Internet connection, provided that they meet certain requirements:",

The following programs can be highlighted:\n\n- \u00b7 Digital mobil im Alter (Digital Mobile for Seniors) in Germany: a training program to teach the elderly how to use smartphones and tablets, as well as to inspire and encourage them to explore the digital world.\n- \u00b7 Gurus: specialised sales staff at major stores (our flagship store on Gran V\u00eda in Madrid and the Movistar Centre in Barcelona) help answer questions about technology and services and give recommendations and advice on better use of mobile devices.\n- \u00b7 Reconectados (Spain) and Renacer Digital (Hispanoamerica, Germany and UK): a free and comprehensive digital skills training program for older people and those around them. It trains both family members and professionals from the social entities working with these people so that they can support the elderly in their learning process.\n- \u00b7 ProFuturo: program launched in 2016 with the aim of contributing to the improvement of educational quality in the world. It offers training to teachers, as well as access to digital resources to children living in vulnerable environments in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia.\n\n## Intermediate digital skills training\n\nAs we are aware that digital skills are essential for gaining access to the modern labour market, it is worth mentioning Conecta Empleo , one of the most renowned employability programs run by Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica. The program offers free online courses and digital tools so that people can train for the most in-demand jobs.\n\nThrough Conecta Empleo we have launched Profesionales 4.0 , an initiative developed in partnership with the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations (CEOE) to encourage the digitalisation of productive sectors in Spain based on cross-cutting and sectorspecific training programs. This initiative has run four times since 2020.\n\nIn addition, the Conecta Empleo program also has an employment map, which helps people choose courses according to the most in-demand digital jobs, and a virtual career coach , a chatbot based on AI and big data that advises participants on the most suitable career path for them.\n\nEmpleo, comprising Lanzadera Conecta Empleo , Sat\u00e9lites de Empleo and Alfabetizaci\u00f3n Digital . The goal of this initiative is to adapt career guidance to the challenges of the digital age and the ever-changing labour market.\n\nOther initiatives are aimed at promoting the responsible, ethical and healthy use of technology among 11-16year-olds. Through these initiatives, this demographic can learn about digital skills and the risks arising from the misuse of technology.\n\nProvided by Telef\u00f3nica Volunteers, the initiatives include training for teachers and family members. They are:\n\n- \u00b7 L\u00edderes Digitales: support workshops for teachers, students and families to work on digital skills and promote the good use of technology in schools selected by the government institutions.\n- \u00b7 Aura Cibersegura : an initiative promoted by Telef\u00f3nica Tech and Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica that provides workshops to children and young people in educational centres in order to raise awareness of the risks of misusing the Internet and social media as well as good practices\n\nLastly, we also have techno-educational activities within this training framework, which are aimed at promoting the development of scientific and technological skills and STEAM careers from an early age.\n\n## Employability and advanced digital skills training\n\nFundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica is promoting 42 : Campus de Programaci\u00f3n (Programming Campus), under an agreement with the international organisation l'\u00c9cole 42. This initiative aims to make digital training an attractive and accessible option for many young people.\n\n\"42\" offers free and open training in four locations throughout Spain. Its educational model is based on peerto-peer, participatory and gamified learning.\n\nSpecifically, \"42\" develops exclusive editions adapted to the training needs and labor context of specific groups, such as women or people over 45 years of age, thus promoting their employability.\n\nAnother area of training focuses on technicians and volunteers working with the most vulnerable people in our society. The Transforma Plan seeks to improve the digital skills of third sector professionals in Spain . It aims to empower those organisations that work with people who may be left behind by the digital divide or who could improve their lives through technology.",

The publication of this book has helped to promote the dissemination and knowledge of the sector and digital trends among social organizations and the general public.\n\nThrough the Include Programme, developed alongside the GoodJob Foundation, we trained in cybersecurity, the cloud, automation and robotisation 124 people with disabilities that afterwards joined our teams.\n\n## Digital skills training targets\n\nOur main target is to ensure that everyone has the necessary knowledge to be able to access and harness the advantages offered by the digital world.\n\nWith that objective in mind, each one of our initiatives defines specific plans and targets for each year, often together with our partners.\n\n## Progress on digital skills development\n\nOver the course of 2023, 1,251,354 people received digital skills training, 4% less than the previous year. The decrease is linked to a significantly lower number of teacher training sessions being conducted due to a noticeable fall in demand from some of our partners, which had an indirect impact on the number of students who accessed training.\n\nThe ProFuturo program, which trains teachers and children from vulnerable environments, received \u20ac32.8 million in funding in 2023, taking into account contributions from the founders, other private contributions and reserves. The program comprises 44 professionals, 70% of whom are women.\n\n## Over the course of 2023, ProFuturo directly benefited over one million children worldwide and trained some 335,000 teachers.\n\nSince its inception, more than 7,000 teachers from all over the world have used the Digital Competencies SelfAssessment Tool provided by ProFuturo.\n\nProFuturo works alongside global public and private partners such as OAS, OEI, UNESCO-OREALC, UNHCR, World Vision, Save the Children, International Rescue Committee and Teach for All.\n\nIn 2023 the program was honoured with a GLOMO award by the GSMA in the 'Best Digital Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals' category.\n\nConecta Empleo launched new nanodegrees in Gastronomy, Hospitality and Tourism, which are aimed at training and improving the skills of people in these sectors. In addition, it kicked off a joint pilot program with Telef\u00f3nica Tech to certify courses through blockchain. The network of public and private partnerships that facilitates the scalability of the program was enhanced. On the FUNDAE-SEPE Training Platform, we are the organisation with the highest number of people accessing training courses, ahead of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.\n\nBy 2023, 93 Lanzaderas Conecta Empleo projects from the Conecta Empleo program had tailored career guidance to the digital era and the continuous market changes.\n\nAs part of the process of leaving no-one behind in digitalisation, Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica launched the\n\n'Reconectados' project, which is aimed at digital inclusion, especially among older people. The goal is to train specialised technicians and older people in the use of new technologies. Young university students were recruited as volunteers to promote intergenerational bonding. The project was very well received, reaching 32,000 beneficiaries in Spain.",

In addition, AI training experiences were created for students and teachers of vocational courses and the baccalaureate stage. Besides, we held the second edition of the Cybersecurity bootcamp and launched the Quantum Computing bootcamp with IBM. We also entered into a partnership with NASA to host the world's largest hackathon on the 42 program campuses.\n\nOur employability programs have been publicly recognised for their impact. For example, in 2023, 42 received the SERES Award (Fundaci\u00f3n Sociedad y Empresa Responsable), the Innosocial Malaga Award and the ARGIBI Award in the Innovation category.\n\nIn 2023, the Transforma Plan benefited over 370 social entities and trained more than 3,000 technicians and volunteers.\n\nThe Digital Leaders project continued to raise awareness about the safe use of technology in cooperation with the regional Departments of Education in Madrid, Valencia and Castilla y Le\u00f3n. The project reached 5,000 people in Spain.\n\nFundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica retained its focus on the digital transformation of the third sector by training more than 2,700 technicians from over 350 social entities. The Social Innovation Hackathon was launched as part of this project. The White Paper on the Digital Transformation of the Third Sector was also published in Latin America.\n\n## 2.12.4.3. Innovation and relevant services\n\nHaving access to networks or ensuring that people have the necessary skills and knowledge is fundamental but not enough to enable them to use and implement their new digital skills. We also need solutions, services and content that bring added value to their daily lives.\n\nThe development of such solutions and content allows us to respond to social challenges tied to health, education, rural economic development and security, among other challenges.\n\nTherefore, we both innovate in new ranges of products and services and promote technology as a key tool in the development of a more inclusive society.\n\nWith regards to artificial intelligence, we firmly believe in its potential to positively impact humanity. For that reason, we encourage innovation and its adoption. Currently, it is a key tool to improve the personalization of the service offered to our clients and its quality. Despite its advantages, we promote its use being aware of the challenges: mitigating risks, fostering citizens' trust and guaranteeing their health, safety and rights.\n\nIn this sense, Telef\u00f3nica is one of the first companies to publish its AI Principles and, since 2023, we have had a Regulation for Telef\u00f3nica's Artificial Intelligence Governance Model.\n\n## Sustainable innovation: new services with a social impact\n\nWe work to develop new products and services that help us close the digital divide. We also promote and encourage the positive impact of our products and services on people and society.\n\nOur services encompass a range of different types of business solutions that drive digital inclusion, as well as technological development in rural regions.\n\nGiven the strategic relevance of these issues, these products and services will be discussed in more detail in a separate chapter of this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11. Sustainable offering and innovation\n\n## 2.12.4.4. Secure and responsible use of technology\n\nGenerating trust is key to closing the digital divide: concerns and hesitancy over security and privacy risks must be minimised.\n\nWe adopt a holistic approach to this problem in order to offer a response to these risks and foster responsible use of new technologies, mainly by such vulnerable groups in society as children.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thus, specific policies and commitments have been put in place.\n\nWe encourage everyone in society to use technology responsibly and do so through digital skills training and awareness initiatives. We are also aware of the need to have access to the necessary information and tools that enable users to know how to properly respond to any attempted fraud or breach of the privacy and security of the products or services they use.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 2.18. Privacy and security\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is particularly concerned about the privacy and security of children and adolescents. This is why we include a section on the responsible use of technology and child protection in the Company's Global\n\nTransparency Centre , as well as in all our local transparency centres. Telef\u00f3nica is also stepping up its commitment to the privacy and security of children's data by carrying out training and awareness-raising campaigns.\n\n## Responsible use of technology\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we are convinced that it is people who give meaning to technology, not the other way around. For that reason, we are firmly committed to promoting the responsible use of technology and the protection of children on the Internet. These efforts can be summarised into three lines of action:\n\n## Safe products and services\n\nAlthough we believe that nothing can replace the role of an adult when it comes to educating children and young people on the healthy and safe use of devices , we offer our customers various products and services that can help them for whenever this is impossible:\n\n## Parental tools and security solutions\n\n- \u00b7 Parental controls: Qustodio (Chile), Control Parental Movistar TV (Colombia and Peru), Control Parental Movistar Internet (Colombia) and Ambiente Kids en Movistar TV with specific content for children (Ecuador).\n- \u00b7 Security solutions with a parental control functionality: Smart WiFi (Spain), Vivo Play TV and Vivo Play App (Brazil).\n- \u00b7 Other services (anti-virus, personalised packs): Conexi\u00f3n Segura (Spain), O2 Protect (Germany), Localizador Familiar (Argentina), Seguridad Dispositivo\n\n(Spain), Seguridad Total and Premium McAfee (Chile), Seguridad Total (Colombia), Seguridad Total and Conexi\u00f3n Privada M\u00f3vil (Argentina), McAfee Seguridad Digital and Safe Connect (Brazil), McAfee Mobile Security Plus and Virgin Media Internet Security (UK) and Protecci\u00f3n McAfee (Mexico).\n\n## Television\n\nThe way we consume television has changed. However, children and teenagers are making increasingly intensive use of audiovisual content. Screens also constitute a fundamental part of their personal, social and civic development, which is why, in our audiovisual environment , we believe it is vital to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure our programming protects children from potentially inappropriate content.\n- \u00b7 Create the tools needed to make good use of television, ensuring that parents have the effective technical means to exercise responsibility over the television content watched by their children.\n- \u00b7 Promote digital literacy among minors and their families in order to leverage the potential of audiovisual media, making them aware of the need for responsible and intelligent use of screens.\n\nIt is for these reasons that we have included the following initiatives in our operations:\n\n- \u00b7 Labelling and cataloguing of content by age and type.\n- \u00b7 Parental controls , parental PINs and purchase PINs on the device so customers can block access by children to certain channels and on-demand content.\n- \u00b7 Adult content is presented in a section that is separate from other content, and a special PIN must be entered to access it.\n- \u00b7 Awareness-raising activities related to digital literacy.\n- \u00b7 The M+ mobile app for smartphones and tablets.\n- \u00b7 Profiles on devices for each member of the household so they can access their favourite content.\n- \u00b7 Child profiles on devices so that the youngest members of the household can browse content for \"up to 12s\" in a safe environment (available on tablets and smartphones running Android 8 or above and iOS 12 or above).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Vision\n\nIn 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) introduced a disruptive change compared to their predecessors; for the first time they recognised innovation and technology (through SDG 9) as being essential to achieving sustainability in our society.\n\nAt a regulatory level, the European Green Deal sets out a roadmap for making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The Deal is designed to stimulate the economy to promote solutions that improve quality of life and provide greater protection for the environment.\n\nThe European Union (EU) has also developed a program called Digital Compass , the goal of which is to ensure that all households have access to a high-capacity network by 2030.\n\nThrough these initiatives, the EU is seeking to prepare businesses and people for a sustainable, more prosperous and human-centred digital future. This is a digital transformation aimed at increasing innovation and productivity in the economy and offering new opportunities for all.\n\n## SDG 8 & 9\n\nare the two United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to which Telef\u00f3nica's activity contributes most.\n\nBoth the digital and the green revolutions foster competitive, sustainable and fair economic growth.\n\nOur sector has a crucial role in the delivery of the 2030 Agenda and digital transformation processes. Communication networks have been recognised to be key to achieving sustainable development.\n\nTelecommunications have a key role to play socially, as they facilitate and transform the way in which we interact with each other. Economically speaking, telecommunications help drive the development of new working models, improve employability and production sites, and increase efficiency and better use of natural resources.\n\nThe telecommunications sector has a crucial role to play in achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda.",

Context\n\n## 2.13.3. Impact assessment:\n\nThe practice of measuring the environmental, social and economic impact of a company's activities has taken on paramount importance in the past decade.\n\nWhat is more, regulatory pressure is growing. Two EU regulations, the Taxonomy Regulation for the classification of sustainable activities and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), underscore how important it is for companies to demonstrate what they're doing in the fight against climate change and social inequalities.\n\nIn addition to the modification of the MiFID II regulation (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and amending Directive), the following are considered in assessments of an organisation's social and environmental contributions:\n\n- \u00b7 Funds that promote environmental and social characteristics (Article 8, SFDR).\n- \u00b7 Funds that, besides complying with the definition provided in Article 8, incorporate criteria aligned with the taxonomy or consider Principal Adverse Impacts (PAIs) (Article 8 plus).\n- \u00b7 Funds that pursue specific sustainability objectives (Article 9, SFDR).\n\nIn line with these criteria, at Telef\u00f3nica we provide all the relevant information about our targets and the roadmap of how we plan to achieve them. Measuring and reporting our impacts allows us to break down each contribution and identify where we can further our positive impacts, mitigate negative impacts and identify new funding opportunities that will contribute to the decarbonisation of the economy or boost digital inclusion and transformation.\n\nIn this context, our alignment with the SDGs and European frameworks demonstrates how we integrate sustainability into the organisation and, beyond this alignment, how we measure the value of our impacts and quantify them.\n\n## frameworks and methodologies GRI 2-12, 3-3\n\nThe Company promotes access to information and knowledge, mainly through the deployment of broadband and continuous innovation of the technologies and infrastructures we make available to society.\n\nThanks to the service we offer our customers and the importance of connectivity in today's global society, our Company has positioned itself as a driving force for economic growth in the regions in which we operate.\n\nMeasuring and quantifying impacts has become a key tool for improving management, promoting sustainability, strengthening the relationship with all stakeholders and developing competitive edges.\n\nSince 2019 we have been measuring our impact and our contribution to the main SDGs in order to better integrate this into the organisation's decision-making models.\n\nWe have therefore been working to optimise our assessment model by incorporating new methodologies and adapting them to our sector's specific characteristics and needs. To measure and monetise our impacts, we have followed the guidelines provided by organisations such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Harvard Business School (HBS)\n- \u00b7 The Value Balancing Alliance (VBA)\n- \u00b7 The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)\n- \u00b7 The Capitals Coalition\n\nThe Capitals Coalition, in collaboration with the VBA and the WBCSD, has published a report called General Guidance on Applying the Natural Capital Management Accounting Methodology, which outlines the impact measurement process.",

This category also includes the social return on investment from research and development (R&D) and our Wayra and Venture Capital open innovation programs, which are aimed at supporting a startup and entrepreneurship ecosystem.\n\n## \u00b7 Social contribution - Human capital\n\nImpacts that affect the economic and social well-being of our employees, and the promotion of diversity and equality in all areas of the organisation.\n\n## \u00b7 Environmental contribution\n\nOf the impact, in monetary terms, on the environment, caused directly or indirectly by the activity carried out by our Company.\n\nIn this way it is possible to assess the contribution of digital services to the decarbonisation of the economy and the protection of biodiversity in the regions in which we operate. It also values Telef\u00f3nica's commitment to promoting a circular economy and responsible management of electronic equipment and devices, an aspect that we hope will become more important in the future.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we promote sustainable development, mainly through our contribution to SDG 9 'Industry, innovation and infrastructure' and SDG 8 'Decent work and economic growth'.\n\nThe following graph shows the distribution of the impacts analysed, their relative quantification, their relationship with the strategic pillars and the SDGs associated with these indicators.",

Human Rights\n\n## Key points\n\n## Governance\n\nat the highest level at Telef\u00f3nica with a view to respecting and promoting human rights.\n\n## 100%\n\nof our operations have conducted human rights risk assessments to identify, prevent, mitigate and remedy any potential adverse impacts.\n\n## 2.14.1. Vision\n\nHuman rights are a key pillar for the functioning of business and society at large. Guaranteeing people's rights not only represents a set of ethical principles but is also a key component in ensuring the long-term sustainability and wellbeing of companies.\n\nWe are currently facing countless challenges related to human rights with global and increasingly profound effects on all of us. The climate crisis, digital divide, social inequality and the violation of people's rights are just a few examples. For this reason, by incorporating human rights into our corporate strategy, we are paving the way for managing the risks and harnessing the opportunities. As a multinational company, we contribute actively to resolving these worldwide challenges through a responsible business conduct, by developing sustainable solutions and by contributing to a fair transition.\n\nIn this regard, we are committed to the United Nations (UN) Declaration of Human Rights (1948), as well as subsequent standards such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights of 2011 and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nFurthermore, we go beyond our internal ecosystem in this regard and aspire to work closely with our stakeholders to ensure respect for human rights throughout our entire value chain. To this end, we have implemented various initiatives and measures to guarantee the respect for human rights among our suppliers in the supply chain and that of our customers through the responsible development of products and services.\n\n## Pioneers\n\nin publishing a report on the Due Diligence process taking into account the new regulatory requirements.\n\n## 2.14.2. Targets\n\n- \u00b7 100% of our operations assessed on human rights twice a year.\n- \u00b7 100% of potential high-risk suppliers assessed on sustainability matters (including human rights) via an external platform by the end of 2026.\n- \u00b7 100% of new products and services developed at Group level assessed under the internal framework for Responsibility by Design by 2025.\n- \u00b7 Maintain leading position in the Ranking Digital Rights and the Digital Inclusion Benchmark.\n\n## 2.14.3. Governance GRI 2-12, 2-13\n\nWe have established a sound governance model at the highest level, led by a Board of Directors that involves all relevant hierarchies and areas of the Company globally and locally to ensure that our commitment to human rights permeates our day-to-day business at all levels (more information in the box below: Human rights governance).",

We must ensure these rights are respected, both internally (among our employees) and externally (among suppliers and customers).\n\nWe perform impact assessments - a key element of the Due Diligence process - to identify and evaluate potential and actual impacts and to conduct materiality analyses based on severity and likelihood.\n\nFor each of the material issues discussed in this Report, we have included the information about these impacts in the respective 'Impacts, risks and opportunities' sections.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 1.4. Materiality\n\nHowever, certain human rights risks may emerge in the normal course of our day-to-day business, and these must be managed. In most cases, risks are of a direct nature, but they may also arise indirectly, through our commercial relationships with our partners. Both types of risk must be managed to ensure the sustainability of our business. In our case, human rights risks are managed through the Enterprise Risk Management process, which includes the ad hoc risk analysis - the Basic Human Rights Risk - as part of the Company's risk map.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 3. Risks\n\nNonetheless, we cannot ignore the fact that connectivity is a crucial tool in facilitating and promoting people's rights and driving economic and social development. This fact enables the Company to leverage business opportunities that are based on connectivity and aimed at meeting people's needs.\n\n## 2.14.6. Action plan and commitments GRI 2-23, 2-24, 2-25, 3-3\n\nOur commitment to respect and foster human rights is embodied in the policies and processes that make up our Due Diligence process and permeates Telef\u00f3nica's entire value chain.\n\nThe Due Diligence process we have developed around sustainability allows us to identify, prevent, mitigate and/ or remedy (potential and actual) human rights impacts linked to our operations. It also serves as a reliable tool with which to manage the impacts, risks and opportunities faced by the Company.\n\nThis process is based on the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which have inspired the requirements of the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, currently in the process of being finalized, as well as other,\n\nexisting regulations such as the Due Diligence Supply Chain Act in Germany.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.14.6.1. Phases of due diligence GRI 3-3, 408-1, 409-1\n\n## 1. Policy\n\nThe starting point of our due diligence is our Global Human Rights Policy (phase 1); the latter has been approved by the Board of Directors and applies to all the Group's companies. The aim of this policy is to ratify our responsibility to respect and promote human rights and establish general guiding principles that form the basis of our relationship with suppliers, employees, customers and society. Deriving from this are other internal policies and procedures that serve as instruments to ensure respect for these rights in more specific areas such as privacy, diversity and non-discrimination.\n\n## 2. Impact assessments\n\nFrom an internal management perspective, all starts with impact assessments (phase 2) , of which there are two types.\n\nFirstly, there are the global impact assessments , which we conduct on a regular basis (every three or four years) with the participation of different areas of the Company whose responsibilities are related to human rights, independent external experts and external rightsholders/ stakeholders. The purpose of this process is to understand both the real and/or potential ramifications of our products, services and business activities on human rights and, in this way, identify possible impacts we need to manage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The same commitment to privacy, freedom of expression and cybersecurity applies to requests we receive from competent authorities regarding interceptions of communications, access to metadata, blocking and restriction of content, and geographical suspensions and/or service restrictions.\n- \u00b7 Responsible use of new technologies (artificial intelligence and big data): the relationship between people and machines is becoming ever closer and more binding. This is why it is essential to ensure and monitor the ethical development and use of new technologies to ensure that technological breakthroughs do not undermine people's rights but contribute to sustainable development.\n- \u00b7 Digital inclusion: the core of our business is the provision of connectivity to people through the development and distribution of products and services. It is thus essential to ensure that our products and services are developed responsibly and we leave no one behind, regardless of their gender, age, education, income level or geographical location.\n- \u00b7 Protection of children: the digital world offers many opportunities. Children need digital skills and specific tools to enable them to access and benefit from these opportunities. In doing so, we must protect their online privacy and reputation on the Web, as well as address any potential impacts such as inappropriate content.\n\nSocial and environmental standards in the supply chain\n\n- \u00b7 Social and environmental standards in the supply chain: it is essential that we pay particular attention to supply chain management, given our commitment, its scope and relevance. The goal is to join forces to ensure that our suppliers have a proper human rights and environmental performance.\n\n## 3. Integration in processes\n\nBased on the results obtained from the various impact assessments, we adapt our internal policies and processes (phase 3) to prevent, mitigate and/or remedy potential human rights impacts.\n\nTwo processes should be highlighted: Responsibility by Design, focusing on the integration of ethical and sustainable criteria (including respect for human rights), from the initial development phases of any product or service; and the mandatory human rights training for all employees and strategic areas of the Company.\n\n## 4. Assessment and reporting\n\nWe carry out monitoring and reporting activities (phase 4) on an ongoing basis. To this end, we monitor and assess possible risks related to human rights on a regular basis. We also assess the degree to which the improvements arising out of the impact assessment work plans have been implemented. Furthermore, we generate public reports about our due diligence process and our general management of human rights.",

The report publicly states how we manage human rights issues and includes the main conclusions drawn from the most recent Global Impact Assessment and some examples of best practices.\n\nThe table below reflects our progress in recent years for each of the five phases of our Due Diligence and shows that it is a continuous and cross-cutting process for the entire Company.\n\nWe continued to work in 2023 on each of the five steps of our due diligence process. In general terms, the essential progress in two areas should be highlighted:\n\n| Due diligence  step   | Activities                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.Policy              | What is it?                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                       | Telef\u00f3nica's public commitment to human rights                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                       | What have we done?                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                       | \u00b7 Publishing of the Human Rights Policy approved by the Board of Directors.                                                                                                                    |\n|                       | \u00b7 The policy:                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                       | \u00b7 Defines our Due Diligence process.                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                       | \u00b7 Defines a governance model with clear responsibilities.                                                                                                                                      |\n|                       | \u00b7 Conforms to international human rights norms and standards.                                                                                                                                  |\n|                       | \u00b7 Covers the entire value chain.                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                       | \u00b7 Is publicly available in several languages.

Cross-cutting initiatives to manage the potential impacts identified through the Impact Assessment\n\nIn addition, based on the lessons learned year after year, we continued reinforcing three cross-cutting initiatives that help us make our commitments in terms of human rights a reality:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Training in human rights\n\nAs in previous years, we provided general training for all employees through the Responsible Business Principles and Human Rights Course and more specific training for certain professionals whose work might have a greater impact on human rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.15. Governance and culture of sustainability\n\n## Human rights by design\n\nIn 2023, the 'human rights by design' approach continued to be implemented. For this purpose, the product managers conduct a self-assessment of new products and services using an online tool. This is done during the design phase to identify and address potential human rights impacts such as the right privacy, freedom of expression, non- discrimination, AI and the impact on vulnerable groups such as children. If risks are identified, the product or service is subjected to more detailed analysis with the help of the Company's human rights experts in order to avoid adverse effects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11. Sustainable offering and innovation\n\n## Responsible network deployment\n\nIn 2023, we continued to implement our guidelines for responsible network deployment in all the countries where we are present. These guidelines were developed in close collaboration with our local teams and outline a set of recommendations to be followed to respect the human rights of the stakeholders involved (employees, suppliers, local communities, etc.) in the following phases of network deployment: deployment justification, deployment planning, field operations, network operations, and network maintenance and removal.\n\nFor example, in Colombia, there is a specific protocol for the relationship with indigenous communities. The protocol contains the basic guidelines on conduct to facilitate the relationship with communities in order to:(i) prevent potential conflicts of interest with communities and (ii) determine the action for handling social crisis situations and reduce their impacts.\n\nAlso in Colombia, we have collaborated in developing a number of different guides on issues such as decent working conditions, the supply chain, relationships with local communities, strengthening the institution, and complaint and claim mechanisms; we have participated in trade union-related working groups regarding consultations with local communities and we have continued to promote and raise awareness of corporate policies regarding human rights, as well as the Responsible Business Principles, etc.",

Progress in the five priority areas\n\nRegarding the five priority issues for Telef\u00f3nica concerning human rights and environmental issues, referred to in the Action Plan and Commitments section, we would highlight the following developments:\n\n## 1. Digital inclusion\n\nTelef\u00f3nica maintained its position as the world leader in digital inclusion in the Digital Inclusion Benchmark (DIB) for 2023 conducted by the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA).This benchmark analyses how the 200 most influential tech companies improve access to technology and reliable use of technology in order to foster a more inclusive digital economy and society.\n\nAs an essential part of our commitment to digital inclusion, and in order to ensure our new products and services are developed in a responsible way, we continue applying inclusive criteria in our Responsibility by Design initiative.\n\nSimultaneously, we continue to allocate proceeds from sustainable bonds to finance the deployment of mobile broadband connectivity with the aim of reducing the digital divide in areas with limited access like in rural areas. This has enabled us to narrow the digital divide by offering mobile broadband connectivity to more than 7.200 municipalities .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 1.7. Finance for the transition to a sustainable economy\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is a participant in the Bluevia consortium. This is a network operator which provides fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) services with the goal of improving connectivity by access to fibre in Spanish towns with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants and, by doing so, contributes to the social and economic development of these rural areas.\n\n## 2. Digital rights (privacy, freedom of expression and information and cybersecurity)\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we have assumed our responsibility with regard to digital rights such as data privacy, freedom of expression and cybersecurity. As a demonstration of our commitment and ongoing progress, we have been recognised as the leading telco in this respect among all the global telecommunications companies assessed by Ranking Digital Rights (RDR) , in the last three editions of the RDR's index. For further information about our privacy and security policies, please see the Transparency Report on the Telef\u00f3nica website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.18 Privacy and security\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of our commitment to digital rights, we created a new Global Transparency Centre, a public and accessible space which offers access to all the information about our policies and management in relation to the privacy, data security and freedom of expression of our customers. From this space, you can also access the existing local transparency centres.\n\nIn 2023, we continued participating in B-Tech, a UN initiative . B-Tech seeks to foster dialogue about human rights in the digital sector among different stakeholders and offer a platform for participation to generate shared knowledge about human and digital rights.\n\n## 3. Responsible use of new technologies (AI and big data)\n\nIn order to ensure that new technologies such as AI and big data are developed and used responsibly, we have continued to introduce our AI principles throughout all our operations. Therefore, in 2023 we approved new internal regulations on the AI Governance Model which embodies our commitment to ethical and responsible progress in new technologies. These regulations set out the roles and processes necessary to ensure respect for human rights in new technologies and responsible management of AI through a specific governance model.\n\nIn this context, we offer a course to all our employees on how to apply and respect human rights right from the initial design stage, which includes considerations about responsible use of AI.\n\nFurthermore, as part of our participation in B-Tech , we have joined a specific working group on responsible management of AI in collaboration with other companies in the sector and other stakeholders. Its aim is to share and apply best practices, taking into account the constant evolution of AI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11. Sustainable offering and innovation",

Protection of children\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we focus on making the Internet a safer place for children , thereby reaffirming out commitment to children's rights through specific measures. Our processes and initiatives are based on the Children's Rights and Business Principles developed by Unicef and use its MO-CRIA (Mobile Operator Child Rights Impact) self-assessment tool.\n\nChildren (including boys, girls and teenagers) are one of the vulnerable groups highlighted in the internal policies of our Responsible Business Principles, our Responsible Communication Regulations and the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy.\n\nIn addition, in 2023 we continued to make progress with the following initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Products and services : the Responsibility by Design initiative includes explicit criteria centring on protecting children as a potentially vulnerable group during the development of our new products and services. We also offer products such as SmartWifi, which enables parents to control their children's access to online content.\n- \u00b7 Audiovisual environment : creation of a Movistar Plus+ child profile to be used by children up to 12 years of age to ensure a secure technological environment within the Movistar + application.\n- \u00b7 Secure Internet environment: collaboration with the Internet Watch Foundation, to identify and block online images of child sexual abuse.\n- \u00b7 Responsible communication: our Responsible Communication Regulations provide explicit guidelines to protect children in our communications with customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.12. Digital inclusion\n\n## 5. Social and environmental standards in the supply chain\n\nWhile our supply chain management is explained in more detail in the chapter 2.20., it is important to highlight our abiding commitment to ensuring that our suppliers operate in a way that respects human rights.\n\nTo achieve this, in 2023, as in previous years, we required all our suppliers to sign and accept the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy , which sets out contractually binding human rights requirements. We also conducted a risk analysis to identify any suppliers which may constitute a potentially high risk in terms of sustainability, in general, and human rights in particular, based on their business activities, among other criteria. Once we have identified any potential high-risk suppliers, we invite them to conduct an assessment of their sustainability performance. This assessment of potential high-risk suppliers is performed through Integrity Next, an external platform that enables us to assess our suppliers' performance on a number of different sustainability issues such as labour conditions, health and safety.\n\nIn addition, we verify the compliance of the most important suppliers through on-site audits. In a similar way, we also conduct on-site audits through our internal Allies Programme (for suppliers of services) and the sectoral-based Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) initiative (for product manufacturers) in conjunction with other ICT sector companies. These audits address specific issues such as forced labour, child labour and/or conflict minerals, and include follow-up monitoring to ensure corrective actions are taken for any nonconformities detected.",

In the case of suppliers (upstream), we make sure that they meet their obligations in that respect, among other things, through audits. Some of the issues that are reviewed in these audits are health and safety, freedom of association, working conditions and wages, discrimination, forced labour and child labour.\n\nAudits help us to identify potential non-compliance with human rights by our direct and indirect suppliers (Tier 2 and above). A case in point from 2023 was the discovery that one of the factories audited was retaining part of its employees' wages to cover the cost of the personal protective equipment (PPE) required to do the work. As a corrective measure, it was agreed that the company would be responsible for covering the cost of the work overalls and for offering the PPE free of charge for all employees.

Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nWe are committed to a strong, efficient and comprehensive ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) governance model and an ethical corporate culture in which respect and inclusion are paramount. We believe that this can have a positive impact on the satisfaction of our employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers and other stakeholders.\n\nFurthermore, we identify risks related to governance and accountability so that we can manage and mitigate them. For example, we encourage transparency through regular sustainability reporting and disclosures as we believe a potential risk is the loss of engagement with stakeholders due to ineffective communication with them.\n\nWe also analyse sustainability governance opportunities and seek to leverage them throughout the Group. For example, we believe that linking a percentage of variable remuneration to ESG criteria will help to ensure our longterm future while having a positive impact on society and the environment.\n\n## 2.15.4. A culture aligned with ethical and sustainable management\n\nBeyond ensuring ethical behaviour and responsible business management, our goal is to make sustainability a cornerstone of our culture. Therefore, we seek to align behaviours, processes and targets with the Company's purpose and values.\n\nWe are guided by our Responsible Business Principles (RBPs), which are spread across 10 areas:\n\n- 1. Ethical and responsible management.\n- 2. Corporate governance and internal control.\n- 3. Respect for and promotion of human and digital rights.\n- 4. Our commitment to the environment.\n- 5. Innovation, development and responsible use of technology.\n- 6. Responsible communication.\n- 7. Our commitment to our customers.\n- 8. Our commitment to our employees.\n- 9. Our commitment to the societies in which we operate.\n- 10. Responsible supply chain management.\n\nTo align our internal culture with ESG (environmental, social and governance) factors, we clearly communicate their long-term business value. In fact, we ensure that every internal process or activity is in line with this vision. Developing organizational culture and enhancing commitment to sustainability is a continuous work that requires a shared vision and commitment at every level of the organisation.\n\nWe would like to highlight several lines of work that provide tangible examples of how the Group's management is 100% aligned with sustainability criteria:\n\nTraining and awareness raising: we provide Responsible Business Principles and Human Rights training to our entire workforce (part-time and full-time employees) on an ongoing basis. The course is mandatory. Completion of the course implies the employee's acceptance of the Principles. In addition to receiving the Principles in their welcome pack, new employees are required to take the specific RBP course within three months of joining the Company. Both the course and the RBPs have been translated into the main languages of the Telef\u00f3nica Group: English, German and Portuguese.\n\nIn addition, specific strategic training in key issues such as privacy, digital security, ethics and artificial intelligence (AI), environmental management, accessibility and diversity is delivered on an annual basis. We also train employees in specific ethical and sustainability issues related to the design of our products and services, such as the impact on human rights, ecodesign, accessible products and services, social impact and data ethics.\n\nTraining is reinforced by internal awareness-raising campaigns on conflicts of interest, gifts and invitations, responsible purchasing, our customer promise, the environment, privacy, diversity and inclusion, accessibility, etc.",

One example is the incorporation of ethical, social and environmental aspects into product and service development processes.\n- \u00b7 Alignment with business priorities: we quantify benefits and include them in our business use cases. Examples include Eco Smart services, digital solutions that help our customers reduce their impact on the environment and the value that our sustainability strategy provides our customers as a distinguishing feature in procurement processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.11 Sustainable offering and innovation\n\n- \u00b7 Control processes: we promote the robustness and efficiency of our internal control processes by closely monitoring and managing sustainability indicators.

Annual Report on Remuneration\n\nIn early 2024, following the Board of Directors' approval of the proposal put forward by the Nominating,\n\nCompensation and Corporate Governance Committee, the remuneration scheme was modified to align it with our GPS strategic plan. The new model focuses on three essential sustainability indicators:\n\nIn the short term:\n\n- \u00b7 NPS : this key lever to strengthen our relationship with our customers now represents 10% of the short-term variable remuneration system, compared to 9% under the previous scheme.\n- \u00b7 Women executives : this indicator will now represent 5% (compared to 3% up until the end of 2023) in the short term. We are thereby awarding more importance to gender equality through an indicator which we have also linked to sustainable financing.\n- \u00b7 Carbon emissions : emissions reductions continue to be part of our employees' variable remuneration, at 5%.\n\nIn the long term:\n\nA proposal is expected to be put forward at the forthcoming 2024 General Shareholders' Meeting for a 2024-2028 Long-Term Incentive Plan that, with similar characteristics to previous plans, contains certain adaptations, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Women executives: due to its importance, this will represent 5%.\n- \u00b7 Carbon emissions: instead of 10%, this will change to represent 5%.\n\nThe following graph shows how the scheme will be structured:\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over a sixmonth period, we managed to train 91,347 employees, representing 89% of the average workforce1 (102,483 employees).\n- \u00b7 As the workforce is constantly experiencing turnover, in 2023 we continued to press ahead in instructing the highest possible number of employees, adding a further 13,581 trained employees. Taking into account employee exits and new hires, the net increase amounted to 1,054 employees since its launch.\n- \u00b7 The cumulative total since the 2022 launch is 92,401 trained employees, which represents 89% of the average workforce 1 and a total of 183,489 hours. It is important to bear in mind the difficulties involved in calculating the total workforce, as this includes employees on paid leave during the training period, recently acquired companies undergoing the integration process and recently hired employees (where the deadline for training of the latter two has not yet ended).\n- \u00b7 The course is mandatory and compliance was closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team made up of the Compliance, People and ESG Departments.",

Training content was based on the basic ESG's pillars of our business and\n\nhow we approach them as for example: environment, digital inclusion, privacy or security. Through this method, we trained 1,054 employees in Spain, Hispanoam\u00e9rica and Brazil.\n\n## Other ESG training\n\nWe conducted various internal training sessions related to ESG issues:\n\n## Environment (E):\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental management: internal training aimed at employees holding responsibilities in the operation of the Environmental Management System, in order to improve the Company's performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.1.

Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nOne of our main challenges in ensuring the Company's future and sustainability and having a positive impact on society is to consolidate a culture of ethics and compliance. This will allow us to contribute to the economic and social development of the local communities in which we operate and ensure the trust of all our stakeholders.\n\nThe nature of our business, compliance with various national and extraterritorial regulations and the progressive demand for specific compliance programs represent a challenge to implementing this culture. Therefore, we constantly adapt our compliance activity to the prevailing needs of each company or business unit to the applied legislation. Compliance risk is part of the Group's risk map, thus allowing us to achieve our objectives and contribute to the of value creation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 3. Risks\n\nIn addition, we promote training and awareness-raising initiatives as key elements of our compliance program. This allows us to consolidate our culture so that our employees can make ethical and responsible decisions when faced with dilemmas and conflicts in their day-today work.\n\n## 2.16.5. Action plan and commitments GRI 2-23, 2-25\n\nOur Compliance Program is made up of several lines of action designed to ensure ethical behaviour throughout our Company: identification of non-compliance risks, policies and procedures, due diligence controls, training and awareness raising, consultation, internal reporting mechanisms for potential infringements, discipline and recognition, and possible remediation plans.\n\nAll of this is included in the 2023 Compliance Function Annual Report, which sets out the Compliance area's main lines of action for the year. This information is complemented by the Action Plan for the following year, both documents are presented to the Audit and Control Committee.\n\n## Objectives\n\n- \u00b7 Develop and implement new training in 2024 to refresh anti-corruption knowledge.\n- \u00b7 Reinforce the control environment of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's procurement model through the definitive implementation of new compliance protocols and/or the adaptation of existing ones.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Compliance\n\n## GRI 205-2\n\nThe Compliance Function Policy, approved by the Board of Directors in 2016 and last updated in July 2023, defines the main lines of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's Compliance Program, how it interacts with the Company's business processes and other areas, and the most relevant issues. The starting point for compliance management is risk assessment and the protection of integrity.\n\nIn accordance with the current Compliance Function Policy, the Compliance Function is deployed on two levels:\n\n- \u00b7 Preventive control to generate a culture of compliance. This is implemented through the following functions:\n- \u00b7 Compliance area: responsible for coordinating the Group's regulatory framework. Plays a key role in establishing regulations and protocols aimed at preventing unlawful and unregulated conduct, with different levels depending on the sensitivity of the situation.\n- \u00b7 Knowledge management: involves training and awareness-raising activities on issues such as anticorruption, crime prevention and sanctions, in addition to supporting other Company training initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing assessment of compliance risk and effectiveness of controls.\n- \u00b7 Consultative activities conducted via the channels available to employees for raising queries about compliance issues (mainly concerning the application of the Anti-Corruption Policy and other related internal regulations).\n\nAnother line of action is geared towards coordinating all initiatives related to third-party involvement in regulation enforcement. In this regard, Telef\u00f3nica believes it is of the utmost importance that the third parties with whom it interacts in the context of certain relationships comply with the corresponding standards of business ethics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatement of Non-Financial Information \u00b7 Leading by example\n\nTherefore, in addition to implementing measures such as responsible declarations and contractual safeguards, we have developed protocols for assessing suppliers and business partners from a compliance point of view . The protocols assess anti-corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing risks and are applied as part of an ethos of continual improvement. Telef\u00f3nica's procurement and payment controls are particularly important in this context, hence the involvement of Compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.19. Responsible supply chain management\n\n## \u00b7 Reaction and response\n\n- \u00b7 Reaction refers to existing action protocols for situations where there are signs of non-compliance. Telef\u00f3nica has an Internal Information System designed in accordance with Law 2/2023 to promote compliance with the Responsible Business Principles, the law and other internal regulations. The System has mechanisms in place to ensure the confidentiality of the communications and complaints it processes.\n\nBy appointment of the Board of Directors, the Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for the Internal Information System, carrying out his functions autonomously and having the necessary personal and material resources\n\n- \u00b7 Response encompasses the remediation of consequences by mitigating the consequences of all kinds associated with a potential violation or a violation already evidenced, and ensuring uniformity in the application of consequences for such violations, as well as promoting the recognition of employees with outstanding behaviour in terms of their commitment to compliance.\n\nIn a dynamic prioritisation exercise, we have identified the areas in which to deploy compliance controls that go beyond the protection of integrity and international sanction systems.",

This includes, among others, initiatives that implement our fight against corruption and bribery.\n\nAmong the policies and procedures implemented in the Telef\u00f3nica Group, we have specific internal regulations aimed at combatting corruption and bribery. The most significant of these is the Anti-Corruption Policy, which is aligned with the provisions of the 2004 United Nations Convention against Corruption.\n\nAmong other aspects, the Anti-corruption Policy sets out guidelines for the conduct to be followed at Telef\u00f3nica with regard to accepting or offering gifts or invitations and prohibits any type of bribery. In the case of offering gifts or invitations to employees and public officials, this aspect is specifically developed by the Regulations on the Relationship with Public Entities.\n\nThe regulatory framework is complemented by the Conflict of Interest Regulation and the Corporate Policy on the Comprehensive Disciplinary Programme, among others .\n\nThe Conflict of Interest Regulation require us to act at all times, and especially in the event of a conflict of interest, in accordance with the corporate principles of loyalty, confidentiality and integrity. It also regulates those situations in which an employee's direct or indirect personal interest influences, could influence or generates the perception of being able to influence the professional decisions to be adopted by that employee, and this interest or professional benefit may collide with the interests of a company of the Telefonica Group.\n\nThe Company's directors and executives as the parties responsible for establishing the controls and procedures needed to ensure compliance with the Anti-Corruption Policy, certify their knowledge and commitment to the Policy, the Responsible Business Principles and associated policies, practices and regulations on an annual basis. In 2023, 100% 2 of the executives in active employment signed the anti-corruption certificate.\n\nCorruption risk analysis is another focus area of Telef\u00f3nica's Compliance Program.\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Model, which is based on the guidelines of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and has been implemented uniformly across the Group's main operations, the Company's senior management perform timely identification, assessment, response and monitoring of compliance risks within their scope of action.

All of these companies renewed their certifications in 2023.\n\nColombia Telecomunicaciones and Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa S.A. also renewed their ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems certification in 2023. In addition, Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U., Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U. and the companies within its scope (Telef\u00f3nica Soluciones de Inform\u00e1tica y Comunicaciones de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U. and Teleinform\u00e1tica y Comunicaciones, S.A.U.), and Telef\u00f3nica Cybersecurity & Cloud Tech Per\u00fa SAC obtained this certification for the first time last year.\n\n## Compliance - sanctions\n\nAt present, international sanction regimes - understood to be the commercial and/or financial and economic restrictions and/or prohibitions imposed by governments, regulators and/or other international organisations against governments, countries, individuals, entities and/ or business sectors - constitute a highly complex and increasingly relevant situation.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is committed to conducting its business in compliance with the international sanctions regimes that may apply to it at any given time. The Regulation on Sanctions defines the Company's main controls in this area and reinforces Telef\u00f3nica's commitment to compliance with the sanction regimes.\n\n## Compliance - competition\n\n## GRI 206-1\n\nFair competition is one of our Responsible Business Principles and it is integrated across the entire Company via various internal policies and processes.\n\nIn 2022, in order to strengthen our Compliance Programme in this area, the Board of Directors approved the first Policy on Competition Law of the Telefonica Group. This formalised our commitment to the principle of fair competition enshrined in the Responsible Business Principles, in a standard that facilitates compliance with fair competition practices in all markets and reflects our belief in free markets and fair competitive conditions.\n\nFollowing approval of the Policy on Competition Law, the course on competition law, which is included in the Training Framework and is aimed at all Telef\u00f3nica Group employees, was reviewed and updated. Additionally, training sessions are also to previously identified specific areas.\n\nIn addition, specific training sessions have been delivered to different areas of the Company in relation to the new Regulation 2022/2560 of the European Parliament and of the Council on foreign subsidies distorting the internal market to make sure that employees are aware of the new obligations and can comply with them.\n\nThe Group also has guidelines in place for participation in industry organisations and meetings with competitors to ensure compliance with competition law regarding the exchange of sensitive information. This is complemented in some countries by specific competition compliance programs in accordance with local legislation (e.g. Chile).\n\nIn 2023, no material judicial proceedings 3 were in progress for violation of competition law and no fines were paid for anticompetitive practices.\n\n|                                                                                                                           |   2022 |   2023 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of material legal proceedings  in progress in relation to anti- competitive practices during the last  fiscal year |      0 |      0 |\n| Total amount of material fines paid for  anti-competitive practices in the last  fiscal year (\u20acM)                         |     67 |      0 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see the Consolidated Financial Statements",

These controls are complemented by activities specifically aimed at fulfilling the legislative requirements in each country and/ or certain regulations on this topic applicable to the type of company or entity in question (when it is considered to be subject to the requirements in this area under local legislation).\n\nIn this regard, in accordance with the Telef\u00f3nica Group's internal regulations on payment control, the Company monitors the definition of controls on payments to prevent the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing, both at Group level and by jurisdiction and/or type of entity or activity.\n\n## 2.16.5.2. Training\n\nGRI 205-2\n\nAnti-Corruption training is a key element of promoting a culture of ethics within the Company. Our training in this area includes the following courses:\n\n- \u00b7 The Business Principles and Human Rights course, which covers issues relating to anti-corruption and bribery in the section entitled 'Ethical and Responsible Management'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.15. Governance and culture of sustainability\n\n- \u00b7 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA ) course, which is aimed at certain areas of the Company that present a higher potential risk due to their greater exposure to the risk of public corruption.\n- \u00b7 Other local courses on anti-corruption and crime prevention. Other specific training courses (that include content related to crime prevention) are given in most of the countries in which the Telef\u00f3nica Group operates. In some cases they are taught on an inperson basis and/or targeted at certain groups of employees whose activity may present a higher potential risk. It is worth mentioning the training in criminal liability in Peru, Argentina, Chile and Ecuador, and at Telef\u00f3nica Spain and its perimeter companies.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatement of Non-Financial Information \u00b7 Leading by example\n\n- \u00b7 Courses relating to the sanctions program. Throughout 2023 we continued to deliver sessions to target areas of the Company.\n\nThe Responsible Business Principles, Competition Law, FCPA and Crime Prevention at Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. courses were integrated into the Training Framework that was launched in June 2022 on a Group-wide basis. As of 31 December 2023, 32,432 employees had received anticorruption training, which represents 31% of the general workforce.\n\nWith regard to the Board of Directors, all members have received anti-corruption training, with the exception of the two new members who joined in December 2023. They will receive training at the beginning of 2024.\n\n- \u00b7 Information on integrity for third parties . A project was launched in 2023 to share our main integrity regulations and the consequences of non-compliance with our value chain. Under the project, every six months this information is sent to all suppliers selected in the immediately preceding six-month period. At the close of this report, a total of 5.823 suppliers have received this information.\n\n## Anti-corruption training since Training Framework launch\n\n|                                                                               | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of employees trained in anti- corruption matters since its launch.     | 94,840 | 94,990 |\n| Percentage of employees trained in anti- corruption matters since its launch. | 93%    | 91%    |\n\n## Awareness raising\n\nAnother crucial element of the Compliance Programme is awareness raising. In addition to the publication of news and updates on the Group's internal channels, we have a number of global and local initiatives aimed at fostering a culture of compliance among employees. Of the initiatives carried out in 2023, the following are particularly noteworthy:\n\n- a.

Complaint and remedy mechanisms: Whistleblowing and Queries Channel\n\nGRI 2-16, 2-26\n\n## Complaints\n\nGRI 3-3, 406-1\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, Telef\u00f3nica adapted its Whistleblowing Channel to the new regulatory requirements . In June 2023, the Board of Directors approved Telef\u00f3nica's Internal Information System Management Policy and Procedure, aligning them with Spanish Law 2/2023 of 20 February, which regulates the protection of individuals who report regulatory violations and the fight against corruption. In addition, the Board also appointed the Chief Compliance Officer, responsible for the Internal Information System (hereinafter referred to as 'the System'). The Policy sets out the general principles governing the System, whistleblower protections, the prohibition of retaliation and the complaints handling procedure.\n\nThe Whistleblowing Channel forms part of the System and is the main tool that Telef\u00f3nica makes available to all employees, managers and directors of its companies, as well as associated third parties, for anonymously or personally reporting any information about the Telef\u00f3nica\n\nGroup that may involve any alleged irregularity or act in breach of the law or internal regulations.\n\nAll communications can be made in writing or verbally. The Whistleblowing Channel is accessible 24/7 via the Company's website and intranet, f numbers and dedicated email accounts. The channel also allows users to check the status of a complaint, add information and contact the team responsible for the analysis.\n\nThe Compliance area investigates the received complaints carefully and promptly, ensuring that are verified and boosts measures to resolve or mitigate them in accordance with the internal regulations and procedures in place.\n\nComplaints can fall into different categories. The main ones are:\n\n- \u00b7 Labour disputes (harassment at work, sexual harassment and discrimination)\n- \u00b7 Labour conditions\n- \u00b7 Information security/privacy\n- \u00b7 Acts contrary to the integrity of the Company (public and private corruption)\n- \u00b7 Asset fraud",

The internal regulation on Queries Channel Management was also updated to bring it in line with this new development.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group has an internal control model defined in line with the provisions of the Internal Control Integrated Framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The use of this Framework by the Group facilitates the recognition and validity of the company's internal control system before third parties, such as external auditors or supervisory bodies. Thus, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expressly recognises the COSO integrated framework as a valid internal control model. In accordance with the applicable Corporate Governance frameworks, Internal Control considers both financial and sustainability aspects, including operational, technological, legal, social, environmental, reputational and regulatory compliance aspects.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's Board of Directors is the Company's highest supervisory and control body, with the support of the Audit and Control Committee in its supervisory functions. The Internal Audit Department, in turn, supports the Audit and Control Committee in its competencies regarding the assurance of the internal control system, through different channels of action. For further details on the activities of the Internal Audit function, see section 4.7 Internal Control and Risk Management Systems in relation to the Financial Information Issuance Process (SCIIF).\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the US SarbanesOxley Act (the SOX Act), the Telef\u00f3nica Group is subject to various requirements, pursuant to which it performs relevant and mandatory oversight of the internal control environment for financial reporting and fraud and corruption prevention actions, as well as other, broader aspects of internal control within the Company that may ultimately affect the information to be published. Among other aspects, these oversight procedures aim to:\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthen corporate governance by establishing stricter oversight requirements for Management and the Board of Directors, thereby helping to prevent fraud.\n- \u00b7 Increase the accountability of Management at the Company at all levels to ensure the accuracy and completeness of financial reporting by imposing severe penalties for fraudulent activities.\n- \u00b7 Protect whistleblowers by encouraging the reporting of corporate fraud and preventing possible retaliation.\n- \u00b7 Identify the need to establish and regularly assess an internal control framework over financial reporting to reduce the risk of financial fraud.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They complement other Company fraud prevention and detection procedures, identifying control deficiencies and recommending improvements in relation to aspects related to these potential practices.\n\nIn addition, the Internal Audit area carries out different types of activities and review procedures on aspects of fraud to evaluate their impact on the design or operation of internal control. Some of the lines of action of Internal Audit in this area are indicated below:\n\n- \u00b7 Targeted reviews of security settings of network elements and IT systems.\n- \u00b7 Technology reviews of key IT processes and applications, as well as cybersecurity and data privacy aspects.\n- \u00b7 Regular regulatory compliance reviews in areas such as the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n- \u00b7 GDPR and data privacy compliance reviews.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of controls over the reporting and breakdown of related-party transactions, as well as compliance with the control measures of the crime prevention model.\n- \u00b7 Reviews of certain compliance program controls, including specific anti-corruption controls.\n\nIn order to carry out its procedures for supervising internal control over financial reporting, the Telef\u00f3nica Group carries out review activities through the Internal Audit area, allocating over 15,000 working days each year for this on a recurring basis. The Statutory Auditor also publicly issues their own independent conclusions on the internal control environment. These review efforts are designed to provide the necessary coverage for the processes of preparing and reporting the Telef\u00f3nica Group's consolidated financial information in order to be able to achieve a level of reasonable assurance on the system of internal control over financial reporting (SCIIF).\n\nOn the other hand, Internal Audit supervision activities, complementary to the above and corresponding to other technological reviews, audits of reporting and business processes, as well as other Internal Audit activities not included in other sections of this Report, involve recurring efforts of more than 29,500 working days per year.\n\nOur Whistleblowing and Queries Channel is accessible online to all our stakeholders, including suppliers, and is available in different languages.\n\n## Milestones\n\n- \u008c Our Internal Information System has been adapted to Law 2/203 of 20 February, which regulates the protection of individuals who report regulatory infringements and the fight against corruption.\n- \u008d We have shared our main integrity regulations and the consequences of noncompliance with our suppliers.\n- \u008e Almost 95% of the queries received through the Queries Channel were resolved during the reporting year.",

Assessment of compliance with the fiscal governance and control framework\n\nThe Group's Tax Department and the Regional Tax Divisions perform the analyses and verifications deemed appropriate to verify the correct application of the criteria contained in the regulations, tax strategy and tax control policy, and to guarantee control targets set by the Group.\n\nIn addition, as indicated in the Annual Corporate Governance Report, every year Telef\u00f3nica validates compliance with the content and commitments of the Code of Good Tax Practices and, therefore, validates that it is complying with its governance framework.\n\n## 2.17.2.2. Integration of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's fiscal approach\n\nTelef\u00f3nica will ensure that the departments involved in tax issues have the necessary means to guarantee compliance with tax obligations in all the countries in which the Company operates.\n\nThose responsible for tax at each company participate in analysing all transactions that may have tax implications. When doing this:\n\n- \u00b7 They are provided with the necessary financial, human and material resources.\n- \u00b7 They can and should, where necessary, establish permanent computer links with the information systems of Group companies.\n- \u00b7 They receive maximum support and assistance from the Group companies.\n- \u00b7 They may require the participation and collaboration of Group company employees.\n\nFor further information about this, see the core principles of the fiscal control function that Telef\u00f3nica has developed as part of its Fiscal Control Policy (available on the corporate website in the section sustainabilityinnovation/how-we-work/sustainability-strategy).\n\n## 2.17.3. Policies GRI 207-1\n\nThe Fiscal Control Policy , which is approved by the Board of Directors and available on the Telef\u00f3nica website, has the following targets:\n\n- \u00b7 Correct fulfilment of tax obligations in due time and form.\n- \u00b7 Effectiveness and efficiency of operations from a tax perspective.\n- \u00b7 Duly supported and documented position-taking or tax strategy.\n- \u00b7 Reliability of tax information.\n- \u00b7 Transparency vis-\u00e0-vis third parties, especially the tax authorities.\n- \u00b7 Tax risk management.\n\n## 2.17.4. Impacts, risks and opportunities GRI 207-2\n\nWe are aware of the impact we have on society and of our contribution to economic development through taxes and other specific contributions. For this reason, transparency is key to communicating tax information in a visible, understandable and complete manner. This allows us to build trust with all our stakeholders.\n\nWith regard to tax risks, and as generally defined for the Company, the Group has a level of risk tolerance or acceptable risk established at corporate level, meaning the willingness to assume a certain level of risk, to the extent that it allows the creation of value and the development of the business, achieving an appropriate balance between growth, return and risk.\n\nIn assessing tax risk tolerance, the Company takes into consideration the various circumstances that may affect this type of risk, such as the legal, political and regulatory environment of the country in question. Consequently, this sensitivity threshold is analysed annually on the basis of the aforementioned criteria, both for the Group as a whole and for its main component companies. In any case, the Group always assesses its tax risk tolerance on the basis of correct and strict compliance with tax regulations in each of the countries in which we operate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this respect, the latter category includes tax risks.\n\nTax risk typology and associated controls\n\nIn relation to their origin, risks of a tax nature are classified as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance risk: relating to the fulfilment of obligations in the tax field (submission of declarations, information requirements, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Interpretative risk: the possibility of interpreting tax laws differently from the Administration's criteria.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory risk: associated with legislative activity and regulatory volatility and complexity.\n- \u00b7 Reputational risk: related to the current context of demands and public scrutiny in terms of transparency and the perception by different stakeholders of companies' fair compliance with their tax obligations.\n\nAlthough risk identification is a continuous process and requires the involvement of the entire organisation, in the case of tax risks, the Corporate Tax Department promotes and coordinates their identification and regular updating.\n\nThe policy of control, evaluation and management of tax risks is developed in the Tax Control Policy, available on the corporate website, section SustainabilityInnovation/How we work/ Strategy-Sustainability.\n\n## 2.17.4.1. Reporting obligations\n\nEvery quarter those responsible for tax control at each of the Group's companies inform the Tax Department through the Regional Tax Divisions - of the main conclusions of the tax risk identification and assessment process, including those related to:\n\n- \u00b7 Litigation in court/arbitration.\n- \u00b7 Litigation in administrative proceedings prior to judicial proceedings.\n- \u00b7 Transactions with implicit risk that may be examined by the tax authorities.\n\nThey also report on external tax audits and inspection processes by the tax authorities.\n\nFurthermore, as a consequence of the entry into force of DAC 6, we have developed a procedure for detecting and reporting notifiable mechanisms.\n\n## 2.17.5. Action plan and commitments GRI 207-2, 207-3\n\nPursuant to Section 529 Ter of the Spanish Corporations Act, on 14 December 2016 the Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica approved the Group's tax strategy as published on our corporate website.",

Regulatory compliance\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we are committed to complying with all national and international tax legislation, regulations and obligations, respecting both their letter and their spirit.\n\nIn fact, we devote all necessary resources and take all appropriate measures to make a reasonable interpretation of the rules, taking into account the legislator's intention pursuant to the interpretative criteria established by the competent tax authorities and the legislative background. We also adopt the necessary control mechanisms to ensure compliance with these regulations as part of good business management.\n\n## Relationship between taxation, sustainable development and business\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we pledge that any position we may take on tax shall serve our commercial and business interests, that we shall pay taxes according to their true legal nature and economic substance, and that we shall avoid abusive tax planning schemes or practices. Consequently, the tax component of any transaction cannot be justified separately from the commercial and business reasons for the transaction in question.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica also applies the arm's length principle when engaging in transactions with related entities; the tax we pay in each country and territory is relative to the business we do there and the generation of value, as laid down in local tax legislation and the international taxation standards established by the OECD.\n\n## 2.17.5.2. Stakeholder engagement and management of tax concerns\n\n## Relationship with tax authorities\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we are committed to fostering a cooperative relationship with the tax authorities that is inspired by the principles of collaboration, trust, good faith, loyalty, professionalism, mutual respect and dialogue.\n\nIn order to apply the highest standards of tax transparency, since 2010 Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. has adhered by resolution of the Board of Directors - to the Code of Good Tax Practices drawn up by Foro de Grandes Empresas (Forum for Large Enterprises) in conjunction with the Spanish Tax Administration.\n\nBased on the principles of transparency and mutual trust, we have voluntarily filed Transparency Reports with the Spanish tax authorities since the 2016 financial year, as authorised by the Audit and Control Committee within the functions delegated by the Board of Directors. More information about this can be found on our corporate website, in the section sustainability-innovation/how-wework/sustainability-strategy/fiscal transparency.\n\nOur approach to matters relating to the Spanish tax authorities also applies internationally. In this regard, Telef\u00f3nica participates in various international forums to promote and develop the OECD's good practice recommendations.\n\nWe also participate in the cooperative compliance program in UK.\n\n## Contribution to legislative initiatives on tax matters\n\nTelef\u00f3nica actively participates in the Foro de Grandes Empresas . This allows us to intervene in tax legislation initiatives, highlight current problems that may arise during application of the tax system and propose new tax measures to increase legal certainty.\n\nWe contribute to the committees of telecommunications industry organisations such as the European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association (ETNO) and GSMA.\n\nWe are active collaborators in various industries and economic forums, such as DigitalES (Spanish Association for Digitalisation) and Adigital (Spanish Association of the Digital Economy).\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group is also actively involved in tax policy through the respective committees of the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations (CEOE) and the DET3 (Digital Economy Taxation Think Tank).\n\n## Stakeholder dialogue\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's stakeholder engagement strategy is based on increasing transparency and effective dialogue in order to build relationships of trust in the countries in which we operate.\n\nWe maintain constructive dialogue and collaborate with various key stakeholders, such as non-governmental organisations - for example, Intermon Oxfam, the Haz Foundation and the Tax and Competitiveness Foundation - and government agencies through the Foro de Grandes Empresas , which was created in 2009 as a body for cooperation between Spain's largest companies and the Spanish tax authorities. We also document all stakeholders' views on their expectations and perceptions of fiscal transparency as part of the consultation process that we perform for our materiality analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 1.4.

Contribution to the development of local economies and local finances GRI 201-4\n\nIn 2023, our total tax contribution (CTT) amounted to EUR 7,580 million (EUR 2,464 million to taxes borne and EUR 5,116 million to taxes collected), representing 50% of our distributed value 1 (distributed value as taxes borne and collected over total distributed value, the latter being the sum of the following items: shareholder value - profit after tax, wages and salaries net of taxes collected, net interest and taxes borne and collected).\n\nThe total grants received by Telef\u00f3nica in 2023 were EUR 28 million (EUR 17 million in 2022), which includes the receipt of capital grants and grants for other income.\n\nThe Group has not used any tax deductions in the last corporate income tax return filed in Spain.\n\n## For every 100 euros of turnover, we spend 19 euros in taxes (6 on taxes borne and 13 on taxes collected).\n\nIt is important to note that our economic and social contribution is not only quantifiable through income from corporate tax, but also through other comparable contributions with an impact on the profit and loss account, taxes, local taxes and social security payments.\n\nIn addition to these directly borne taxes, we generate revenue for the public coffers, as a result of our activity and on behalf of other taxpayers, other amounts that must be taken into account in the total tax contribution made by the Company, such as indirect taxes, employee withholding taxes and other withholdings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.13.

Those other jurisdictions where the Group is present and whose activity is not its core business have been included under 'Other'.

Reasons for the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate\n\nThe Group closely monitors the differences between the nominal tax expense and the effective tax expense on a monthly basis.\n\nAt year-end 2022, the differences correspond to the permanent differences inherent to the mechanics of corporate income tax preparation. In other words, they comprise all those expenses or income recorded in the income statement that will not be deductible or will not be taxed for tax purposes and will therefore never be reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nThe most relevant are: the deductibility of the amortisation of goodwill in Spain and the deductibility in Brazil of the distribution of Juros on capital. There is also a significant difference due to the non-activation of tax credits in countries with negative results.\n\nIn addition, during 2022, there were extraordinary accounting entries in the income tax expense account that justify a significant part of the differences between the statutory rate and the effective rate.\n\nIn this regard, mainly recorded in Spain were the effects derived from the agreement to enforce the National Court ruling of October 24, 2022 with its corresponding impact on the company's tax credits, the reversal of a tax provision in Germany as a result of the closure of the tax audit of Group 3G UMTS Holding GmbH and the recording of a provision for tax contingencies by Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa.\n\nThe verification of the taxation content has been completed as part of the external verification process which has been carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L.\n\n## Tax contribution in each country\n\n| Million euros   | Contribution by  country to consolidated  Group profit before tax  2023 5   | Contribution by  country to consolidated  Group profit before tax  2022 5   | Taxes borne 2023   | Taxes collected  2023   | Total 2023   |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|\n| Germany         | 624                                                                         | 697                                                                         | 343                | 905                     | 1,248        |\n| Argentina       | (167)                                                                       | (166)                                                                       | 169                | 241                     | 410          |\n| Brazil          | 1,063                                                                       | 919                                                                         | 679                | 1,526                   | 2,205        |\n| Chile           | (122)                                                                       | 64                                                                          | 6                  | 78                      | 84           |\n| Colombia        | (100)                                                                       | 118                                                                         | 140                | 123                     | 263          |\n| Ecuador         | (20)                                                                        | 23                                                                          | 51                 | 18                      | 70           |\n| Spain           | (1,264)                                                                     | 795                                                                         | 950                | 1,938                   | 2,887        |\n| Mexico          | (19)                                                                        | (228)                                                                       | 21                 | 59                      | 81           |\n| Peru            | (157)                                                                       | (103)                                                                       | 30                 | 126                     | 156          |\n| Uruguay         | 148                                                                         | 152                                                                         | 24                 | 35                      | 59           |\n| Venezuela       | 101                                                                         | 95                                                                          | 16                 | 18                      | 34           |\n| Other           | (1,899)                                                                     | 316                                                                         | 34                 | 48                      | 83           |\n| Total           | (1,812)                                                                     | 2,682                                                                       | 2,464              | 5,116                   | 7,580        |",

In doing so, we focus on the following pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Protection : data must be secure and individuals' privacy must be preserved. This is the foundation of our business and our primary consideration when designing our services and collaborating with third parties.\n- \u00b7 Design : we apply privacy and security by design, that is, privacy and security are incorporated into the initial concept of our products and services and subsequently throughout the development process.\n- \u00b7 Empowerment : individuals must be able to manage and control their personal data. This enables access to their data and to additional information about the risks and benefits associated with management thereof.\n\n## 75,821\n\nHours of training for our employees in data protection and cybersecurity with over 94,642 attendees.\n\n- \u00b7 Transparency : the principle of transparency is about both providing people with straightforward tools that allow them to control their data and having the technological development needed to generate maximum respect for privacy and information security.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.12.4.4. Secure and responsible use of technology\n\nWe also recognise the importance of raising awareness among our employees and relevant third parties and training them on this issue. To this end, we provide specific courses on privacy to employees within the sphere of Telef\u00f3nica and we also send educational content about the issue to the suppliers we consider most important from a privacy perspective.\n\nIn addition, Telef\u00f3nica is a global leader in the development and marketing of cybersecurity and managed security products and services.\n\nThis chapter describes the different aspects of our internal privacy and security operations that are applicable to our processes, products and infrastructures.",

The Responsible Business Principles, the Group's code of ethics, recognise the need to preserve this fundamental right and accordingly establish common behavioural guidelines for all the companies in the Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n\n## 2.18.2.2. Targets\n\nTo reduce exposure to risk and raise digital trust, we are constantly working to update our processes and policies. Our targets are:\n\n- \u00b7 Approve and introduce Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) in 2024. BCRs are data protection policies adhered to by companies established in the EU to guarantee transfers of personal data outside the EU. These rules include all general data protection principles so as to ensure appropriate safeguards for data transfers. They are legally binding and approved by the competent national authority.\n- \u00b7 Update the Group's Privacy Policy to bring it in line with the BCRs in 2024.\n- \u00b7 Update the Global Privacy Centre, which is part of the Global Transparency Centre, in 2024.\n- \u00b7 Implement the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Governance Model in accordance with internal regulations. To help us achieve this target, we have developed an app to record the AI systems that are developed, used or marketed at the Telef\u00f3nica Group, and to identify associated risks and applicable requirements in order to both reduce risk and comply with regulations in force.\n- \u00b7 Annually update and extend the reach of our training for both employees and third parties.\n- \u00b7 Continue to promote annual privacy audit plans across the Telef\u00f3nica Group, incorporating the BCRs so as to identify best practices.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we have a Personal Data Protection Governance Model that is designed to ensure effective and efficient privacy management in alignment with the Group's strategy.\n\nOur global privacy management activities seek to deliver highly transparent data protection in all the Group's companies.\n\nImplementing our BCRs (which are in the process of being approved by the European authorities) will permit us to increase our level of commitment to privacy even further.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.18.2.7 Progress in 2023 > Binding Corporate Rules\n\nThe person in charge of personal data protection for the Group is the global Data Protection Officer (DPO).

In accordance with the specific legislation for each jurisdiction, Telef\u00f3nica stores the data only as long as needed for the purposes of processing and legal obligations.\n\nOur various operators incorporate specific and detailed information about data retention in their respective Transparency Centres. For further information about storage periods, see the relevant Transparency Centres.\n\nIn order to ensure effective implementation of the data protection policies, processes and procedures, the following practices have been put in place:\n\n- \u00b7 Privacy audits : conducted annually to assess compliance with the data protection policies and procedures. These audits are included in the Company's annual audit plan. They fall under the management of Internal Audit, which can in turn engage privacy experts to perform them. The audits identify gaps and areas for improvement.\n\nAction plans are established by the areas responsible for implementation. Internal Audit monitors the entire process and conducts the final audit of proper implementation. Other work is done in the area of technology and cybersecurity that covers aspects of privacy from a security perspective. The working process, publication of reports and monitoring of action plans in that area is equivalent to the specific privacy audits.\n\n- \u00b7 Training and awareness raising: conducted on a regular basis to ensure employees and stakeholders know about the privacy policies and procedures. This includes raising awareness about the importance of data privacy and how to comply with the policies.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of suppliers and third parties with access to personal data: performed to ensure they meet the organisation's privacy and compliance standards.\n\nIn the interests of access and transparency, our policies have been translated into the languages of the countries in which we operate.\n\n## 2.18.2.5. Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nRapid technological progress and regulatory pressure in the field of data protection pose significant challenges to adapt and respond to regulatory demands.\n\nIn this respect, we understand the importance of data privacy and its management. Therefore, with the aim of avoiding or mitigating adverse impacts and enhancing positive impacts , we establish protocols and controls to protect personal data. This enables us to achieve a more secure and reliable digital environment.\n\nIn addition, the challenges associated with complying with the current privacy and data protection legislation are intensifying. At the same time, our stakeholders' expectations are increasing. In this context, privacy risk management has a prominent position in the risk map and in Telef\u00f3nica's strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 3. Risks\n\nWe integrate the protection of personal data as a key element in the development of products and services. Our motivation is not limited to regulatory compliance, but we aim to make privacy a sign of trust for our users, thus highlighting the importance of privacy as a core value of our company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Action plan and commitments\n\nThe privacy strategy is based on three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Protection : protect our customers' personal data through robust policies and processes.\n- \u00b7 Transparency : be transparent about how and why we collect, use, store and delete our customers' personal data, as well as when complying with the principle of \"data minimisation\".\n- \u00b7 Empowerment : equip our customers with simple and secure tools that enable them to control the use of their personal data.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica complies with the \"Data minimisation' principle of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the goal of which is to obtain, process and store only the personal data that is necessary and to do so only for a specified time.\n\nOur main lines of action are:\n\n- \u00b7 Privacy by Design\n- \u00b7 Digital privacy\n- \u00b7 Transparency initiatives\n- \u00b7 Customer empowerment\n- \u00b7 Consultation and complaint mechanisms\n- \u00b7 Binding Corporate Rules\n\n## Privacy by Design\n\nThe principle of Privacy by Design is one of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's key strategic pillars and is defined in our mandatory internal regulations.\n\nThis concept represents the organisation-wide obligation to establish procedures that primarily take into account two aspects when designing products and services: first, the implementation of privacy protection measures from a legal and security perspective in the early stages of any project; and, secondly, that all business processes and practices involved in each activity or processing operation that may affect personal data are covered.\n\nWe have our own Privacy by Design guidelines to define the set of rules, standards, and legal and security processes that must be taken into account to comply with our Global Privacy Policy . All of this is to ensure that the rights and freedoms of individuals' personal data are guaranteed from the get-go of any processing project or activity.\n\nThese practical guidelines stand as reference documents for the Group professionals in charge of developing and implementing products and services, as well as for internal use cases that directly or indirectly involve the processing of personal data.\n\nIn addition, product managers are supported by the privacy and security experts in each of the Group's companies and/or business units, in order to ensure that all the necessary privacy-related legal and security requirements are taken into account from the design stage of relevant projects.\n\nWe use an approach based on risk management and proactive responsibility (critical and continuous selfanalysis of compliance with the obligations laid down by the regulations) to establish strategies that incorporate privacy throughout the entire data life cycle of each product or service: collection and obtaining, processing, exercise of rights, and storage and erasure of data.\n\nIn general, Telef\u00f3nica does not market or sell its customers' personal data. Telef\u00f3nica may share aggregate analytical data that have been rendered anonymous, as described in the Movistar Privacy Policy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustainable offering and innovation\n\n## Digitalisation of Privacy by Design (Digital Privacy Framework- DPF)\n\nThe DPF is the framework for Telefonica's global legal and privacy strategy with respect to the GDPR and the ePrivacy regulation on data processing platform products and systems.\n\nThe DPF adapts the guidelines on legal privacy compliance to a technological reality in order to standardise and conceptualise the functional and technical requirements governing the dynamics of privacy systems, and apply them automatically and digitally to the processing of personal data.\n\nDigitalisation is implemented from the design stage and naturally enables us to build a dynamic and automatic privacy process between the customer and the systems that process personal data, and to comply with the GDPR.\n\nWe are implementing this digitalisation framework in the systems and platforms via which we process data, such as Kernel, Telef\u00f3nica's big data platform. We made significant progress with the Digital Privacy Framework in Spain in 2022, and continued to do so in 2023 among our operators in jurisdictions that are more demanding when it comes to certain data protection requirements, for example, anonymisation requirements.",

In this regard, we are committed to putting transparency into practice by including it as one of the principles of the Global Privacy Policy and developing a number of different initiatives to implement it:\n\n## Global Privacy Centre\n\nThe Global Privacy Centre is a public benchmark for our privacy and security policies and processes. Our stakeholders can easily find all the information they need in the Global Transparency Centre, where it is presented in a simple format by means of visual and graphic resources. Our objective for 2024 is to continue improving this centralised channel, among other things by linking all of our operators' Transparency Centres so that all relevant information is in one place.\n\n## Operators' Privacy and Security Centres\n\nThe purpose of these centres is to enable both our customers and stakeholders to obtain information about the processing of their personal data in a simple, digital and understandable way. This includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Information about the channels and avenues for exercising their rights.\n- \u00b7 Security and confidentiality measures adopted for data processing.\n- \u00b7 The privacy terms and conditions applicable to our products and services.\n- \u00b7 Communication transparency reports.\n- \u00b7 Our ethical principles regarding AI.\n- \u00b7 Child security and protection matters specific to digital environments.\n\nThe Privacy and Security Centres are currently available on our operators' websites. They are updated regularly in accordance with regulations and stakeholder analysis.\n\n## Telecommunications Transparency Report\n\nWe publish an annual report on the requests we receive from the competent authorities in the countries in which we operate. This report includes information on the number of requests for lawful interception, access to communications metadata, content blocking and restriction, and geographical and temporary suspensions of service.\n\nFor each request we follow a strict procedure, which is laid down in the Regulation on Requests by Competent Authorities. Doing so guarantees both the fulfilment of our obligations in terms of collaborating with these authorities and the protection of the fundamental rights of the people affected, in accordance with our human rights commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.14. Human rights\n\n## Customer empowerment\n\nAs part of the principle of transparency, Telef\u00f3nica provides customers with access to the data they generate when using our products and services. These data are collected in the Kernel 'Personal Data Space' and are accessible through various channels.\n\nThe Transparency Centre allows all customers to set their data privacy and management preferences via their Personal Data Space. This feature is currently available to most users through the Mi Movistar app (in the Security and Privacy section of the User Profile) and has been available through the television channel in Spain since 2022.\n\nIn the Transparency Centre, customers can manage the legitimate grounds for use of their data for certain purposes via the Privacy Permissions section. In addition, the Access and Download section provides practical examples of different types of data. These examples are presented in a user-friendly manner and in compliance with privacy criteria; customers also have the option of downloading a more detailed document.\n\nThe Transparency Centre experience has been designed to instil confidence among users by explaining in clear language the purpose for which their data is processed and its nature within Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nWe also prioritise data minimisation, ensuring that we obtain only the information necessary for our legitimate purposes. Furthermore, we have established policies and incorporated guidelines on the storage and deletion of data in the Transparency Centres of the Group's operators. Thus, we ensure that the data are stored only for the minimum periods necessary for the intended purposes and are deleted safely when they are no longer necessary (as soon as possible).\n\nThe Transparency Centres represent our first steps towards fulfilling our promise to give our customers tools with which to control and ensure the transparency of their data in accordance with applicable privacy regulations. For example, in Europe our data processing will be fully aligned with the GDPR.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Throughout 2023, 10 communications on privacy and 2 on freedom of expression were processed, received a reply or, where applicable, received a solution.\n\n## Voluntary mediation system with AUTOCONTROL\n\nOn the one hand, customers have at their disposal a mediation system that has been operational since January 2018, and is designed to provide a swift response to complaints related to identity theft and the receipt of unsolicited advertising. The procedure was developed by the Asociaci\u00f3n para la Autorregulaci\u00f3n de la Comunicaci\u00f3n Comercial (AUTOCONTROL) in collaboration with the Spanish Supervisi\u00f3n Authority (AEPD). It also involves the participation of Orange, Telef\u00f3nica and Vodafone, and is open to other entities. This information can be found in the Movistar Privacy Centre. In 2023, 30 requests for mediation were processed.\n\nOn the other hand, in 2023 the AEPD approved the Code of Conduct on Data Processing in Advertising Activity, under which 45 complaints have been dealt with or submitted to mediation.\n\n## 2.18.2.7. Progress in 2023\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has developed an internal tool to facilitate compliance with the data protection regulations and, in particular, to help each area to perform the following tasks, among others: creating the Records of Processing Activities (ROPA) and keeping it updated; managing and recording security breaches; recording requests to exercise GDPR data subject rights; managing electronic signatures of data protection agreements (DPAs); and managing privacy indicators.\n\nAs a demonstration of our commitment and ongoing progress, we have been recognised as the leading telco in this respect among all the global telecommunications companies assessed by Ranking Digital Rights (RDR), in the last three editions of the RDR's index. This ranking\n\nassesses corporate commitments, policies and practices that affect freedom of expression and customer privacy, including governance and oversight mechanisms.\n\n## Binding Corporate Rules\n\nOur Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) are in the process of being formally approved by the relevant supervisory authorities. They are designed to permit the movement of data from inside the Telef\u00f3nica Group in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA in accordance with article 47 of the GDPR.\n\nThe implementation of the BCRs will foster greater compliance with the European regulations throughout the Telef\u00f3nica Group, enabling us to transfer personal data swiftly, regardless of where the recipient Telef\u00f3nica subsidiary is located.\n\nIn addition, the BCRs will contribute greater legal security by facilitating alignment with the Group's organisational model.\n\nIn 2022 Telef\u00f3nica began the process of approving its BCRs and during this period we took the following steps:\n\n- \u00b7 Analysis of international intra-group transfers.\n- \u00b7 Drafting of our BCRs.\n- \u00b7 Designation of the AEPD as the lead supervisory authority, which shall be responsible for leading the process, as well as the supervisory authorities concerned, which shall co-review the approval procedure, following a proposal by Telef\u00f3nica.\n- \u00b7 Sending of the BCRs and complementary documentation to the lead authority and co-reviewer authorities for approval.\n- \u00b7 Launch of the cooperation phase upon forwarding the BCRs to all the respective European supervisory authorities for approval.\n\n## Management of our supply chain\n\nOne of Telef\u00f3nica's priorities in ensuring privacy is successful management of the supply chain in relation to the processing of personal data by third-party contractors. We have therefore incorporated data protection agreements across the whole Telef\u00f3nica Group and included specific supplier commitments pertaining to international transfers.\n\nIn 2023 a number of supplier monitoring procedures were introduced and educational materials were made available via tools created by Telef\u00f3nica. Specifically, automated control measures were implemented to ensure successful processing of personal data before, during and after the provision of the service by the supplier. Additionally, to ensure protection of the personal data managed by third parties, automated mechanisms were developed to optimise training initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Vision\n\nSecurity as a concept seeks to protect against potential damage to people and property and to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a company's information assets. Ensuring network and data security is a major issue for Telef\u00f3nica due to its significant impact on both our stakeholders and on the value of the Company. (See chapter 1.4. Materiality).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 1.4. Materiality\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, security is treated as a broad concept that includes physical and operational security (of people and goods), digital security (encompassing information security and cybersecurity), business continuity, prevention of fraud in the commercial portfolio of products and services, and supply chain security.\n\nOur approach to security, including the list of certifications obtained by the companies of the Telef\u00f3nica Group, is published in the Security section of Telef\u00f3nica's Global Transparency Centre.\n\n## 2.18.3.2. Targets\n\nThe short- and long-term targets we have set ourselves are:\n\n- \u00b7 Continue our review of the global regulatory framework on security in order to simplify it and align it with new versions of international standards, such as ISO 27001.\n- \u00b7 Move forward with deploying the Zero Trust 1 model to control IT system access and with implementing tools to govern the security of cloud environments.\n- \u00b7 Increase the percentage of contracts/RFPs that contain security requirements for the supply chain, with the goal of reaching at least 95% of suppliers by 2025.\n\n## 2.18.3.3. Governance\n\nThe Global Security and Intelligence area is supported by the Company's management and reports to the Board of Directors through the Sustainability and Regulation Committee and the Audit and Control Committee. It also coordinates with the local security departments, as shown in the following diagram:\n\nThe increased number, complexity and types of threats make it necessary to apply security measures and review them in a cycle of continuous improvement . Our strategy is based on a number of security activities that reinforce both the Company's processes and its transformation initiatives, and in doing so deliver a security management system that is aligned with international reference frameworks and standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Global CSO nominates a local security manager at each Telef\u00f3nica Group company, which is then approved (or rejected) by the corresponding company's management bodies.\n\nThe Global Security Committee coordinates and governs security activities. The Committee is chaired by the Global CSO, while the local Chief Security Officers (local CSOs) and the corporate heads of several Company areas (Compliance, Audit, Legal, Technology and Operations, People, Sustainability, etc.) are Committee members.\n\nThere are also local security sub-committees, which are chaired by the local CSOs. They help to define strategic initiatives and global guidelines and implement them in each Telef\u00f3nica Group company.\n\nThe Global Security and Intelligence area also promotes and drives the Global Digital Security Committee, in which several members of the Company's Executive Committee and the Global Business Continuity Committee participate.\n\nThe Global Security and Intelligence area reports to the Board of Directors through the Sustainability and Regulation Committee and the Audit and Control Committee.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica also has a Security Advisory Board made up of leading security and intelligence figures from outside the Company. The Board has the aim of contributing best practices, increasing the efficiency of capabilities and procedures, and enhancing the quality of our strategy in this area.\n\n## 2.18.3.4.

The decision to obtain certification is based on legal compliance, business requirements and/or customer demand. In turn, depending on the service provided, we require third-party certification or reports from our suppliers (for example, ISAE 3402 or similar).\n\n## 2.18.3.5.Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nTelecommunications companies around the world are facing a continuous increase in cybersecurity threats as businesses become increasingly digital and dependent on telecommunications, computer systems/networks and adopt cloud technology. At Telef\u00f3nica we have an important role to play in mitigating and avoiding the impacts of these challenges, to ensure the security of the services we provide, as well as the privacy and confidentiality of our customers' data. In this way, we contribute to creating a climate of digital trust, beneficial for both society and businesses.\n\nConversely, information technology is a relevant element of our business, and we must minimise or avoid the adverse effects of potential cyber threats on the Company's assets. For these reasons, cybersecurity risk is included in Telef\u00f3nica's risk map, which defines guidelines that facilitate uniform reporting, alignment with business objectives, and corporate risk tolerance criteria.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 3. Risks\n\nAdditionally, through cybersecurity solutions, we combine the capabilities of cybersecurity and cloud technologies to build robust solutions that are tailored to the needs of businesses or organizations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 1.6.2. Global businesses\n\n## 2.18.3.6. Action plan and commitments\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we understand security as a broad concept, the goal of which is to protect our assets, interests and strategic objectives, ensure their integrity and protect them from potential threats that could damage their value, affect their confidentiality, reduce their effectiveness and/or alter their operability and availability.\n\n## Comprehensive security encompasses:\n\n- \u00b7 Physical and operational security (of people and assets)\n- \u00b7 Digital security\n- \u00b7 Business continuity\n- \u00b7 Fraud prevention\n- \u00b7 Security in the supply chain\n- \u00b7 Any other relevant area or function aimed at protecting the Company from potential damage or loss.\n\nIn turn, digital security includes aspects related to information security and cybersecurity, and is applied to the media, systems, technologies and other elements that make up the network.\n\nOur security provisions apply to all our supply chain partners, but focus especially on companies that manage the Telef\u00f3nica Group's or its customers' data.\n\nSecurity activities are governed by the principles of legality, efficiency, co-responsibility, cooperation and coordination.\n\nThe most recent version of the Company's Global Strategic Security Plan, approved by the Global Security Committee on 27 September 2023, sets the goal of implementing the basic principles laid down in the Security Policy and identifies and prioritises the main lines of action.\n\n## Digital security. Cybersecurity\n\nDigital security is a key part of our business. Its ultimate goal is to ensure our resilience, in other words, our ability to withstand and contain attacks so that our business is not affected or is affected to a degree that is tolerable.",

The aim is to guarantee internal control over access to the Company's information and that of our customers, and respect privacy legislation.\n\nOur technical and organisational measures for employees and third parties seek to ensure internal control over access to Company information and that of our customers.\n\nThe global area defines the strategy, while activities are coordinated by the various digital security units of the Group's companies. We align activities and share experiences at our annual meetings.\n\nParticular emphasis is placed on the following aspects:\n\n## Cyber intelligence and incident management\n\nWe have tools and capabilities to cover the entire cycle of potential incidents:\n\n- \u00b7 Anticipation of any incidents that may affect us through cyber-intelligence measures. Our approach to cyber intelligence is proactive; we apply knowledge gained from external sources and technology to determine trends, progress, and potential adversaries and lines of attack against Telef\u00f3nica.\n- \u00b7 Prevention to ensure the protection of both facilities and assets, as well as our and our customers' data. We have internal expert teams (Red Teams) dedicated to searching for any digital security vulnerabilities.\n\nThese teams are coordinated by the global area and analyse the Company's networks and systems, scanning for weaknesses, performing manual testing (ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing) and requesting those responsible for the systems and networks to correct the security problems detected. We also have an open-access public mailbox for reporting any bugs or threats that could affect Telef\u00f3nica's technological infrastructure. This mailbox can be found in the Global Privacy Centre/Security sections of Telef\u00f3nica's global website and the websites of its operators. We also have a bug-bounty reward program managed by recognised industry leaders, through which we receive input from cybersecurity experts (ethical hackers) worldwide.\n\n## We have a public mailbox for reporting weaknesses and threats, and a bug-bounty program for finding them.\n\n- \u00b7 Detection and response via a network of 17 Incident Response Centres (Cybersecurity Incident Response Teams, CSIRTs). We also have the technical and human capabilities needed to respond effectively and quickly to any breach or incident in order to minimise attacks and their consequences.\n\nThe CSIRTs work in a coordinated manner to understand and analyse the risks of potential cyber threats, monitor serious bugs in the most critical technological assets and establish relationships with other national and international CSIRTs/Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in the public and private sectors. Cyber exercises are performed once a year to train the CSIRTs in all countries to handle potential incidents.",

Moreover, there were no incidents with sufficient material impact to be reported to the financial market supervisory authorities.\n\nLessons learned from incidents help us to improve the security of our processes and technological capabilities and platforms. One of the lessons learned was the need to reinforce anticipation through cyber-intelligence activities and continue to conduct cyber exercises, as described earlier, while reviewing the action protocols in order to become swifter in detecting and responding to them. Our analysis and learning have enabled us to customise awareness efforts, reinforcing particular aspects where they are dependent on the actions performed by the user and conducting simulations of phishing campaigns that are similar to the detected attack attempts or incidents (see section 2.19.4.2. Training and awareness raising). We also take into account the analysis of past incidents when establishing the strategic digital security projects in each cycle.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.19. Responsible supply chain management\n\nWe follow transparency protocols, notifying the affected users and, where appropriate, the data protection agencies of the incidents. Incident management protocols are also followed in terms of detection, analysis and response, and the appropriate mitigation measures are established.\n\nThe Company has various insurance programs and policies in place that could mitigate the impact on the income statement and balance sheet of the materialisation of a large number of risks. In particular, there is cover for cyber risks that could cause, inter alia, a loss of revenue, loss of customers, extra costs or recovery costs for digital assets, and cover for Technological Errors and Omissions in the event of customer and third-party claims for damages in general. The current global insurance limits range in value from \u20ac100 million to \u20ac500 million.\n\n## Network security\n\nOur approach to networks and communications is based on a good understanding of our assets and sites, as well as their characteristics and their importance to the business. The aim is for the networks to be properly planned and deployed in accordance with applicable security requirements that minimise the risk of downtime, unauthorised access or destruction.\n\nWe also perform security controls on associated service platforms, such as video and the Internet of Things (IoT), to manage the risks associated with attacks and the exploitation of bugs and weaknesses in networks and protocols. To this end, we work with technological partners and international organisations (e.g. GSMA). Examples include the work done on 4G/LTE, SS7, BGP and other critical enabling technologies.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we want to contribute to making 5G networks safe. The Company's technological developments in this area, such as the development of our network virtualisation platform (UNICA NEXT), network splitting and new radio access technologies, incorporate Security by Design.\n\n## Physical and operational security\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we make a continuous effort to improve our ability to physically protect infrastructure and assets. The following programs stand out in this regard:\n\n- \u00b7 The interconnection of control centres to create a resilient network that increases the availability of infrastructure for surveillance and protection services.\n- \u00b7 The management of travel security for Telef\u00f3nica personnel, which substantially improves response time and the mechanisms for action in the event of any incident.\n- \u00b7 The implementation of consistent digital procedures and tools for global security monitoring.\n\n## Security by Design\n\nSecurity is considered from the earliest stages in all areas of activity to ensure that it is an integral part of the entire technology life cycle .

The result is systems and applications that are more resistant to malicious attacks.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we impose security requirements on our suppliers and identify any risks associated with the provision of a service/product. We continue to develop 3PS+ , our tool for digitalising the security process in the supply chain. The security requirements are reviewed annually according to international regulatory updates and technology developments (5G, AI). The main features of 3PS+ are:\n\n## Supply chain security process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Prior to contracting , the tool can be used to generate the security requirements for new procurement processes. It collates supplier responses and objectively assesses compliance levels and access to their proposed mitigation measures.\n- \u00b7 During service provision , the tool can be used to monitor the security requirements. To this end, the system generates alerts based on the start date of the service and the selected monitoring period. This allows the user to record relevant information that may pose a risk to Telef\u00f3nica's processes.\n- \u00b7 On completion of service provision , the tool can be used to oversee the supplier's offboarding and mitigate or even prevent the most common security risks at service termination, such as failure to block physical and logical access, failure to check VPNs/ports/systems used for services, etc.\n\nAll Telef\u00f3nica Group employees have access to this tool.\n\n## Business continuity and crisis management\n\nThe business continuity function integrates various activities and processes aimed at improving our resilience, while Crisis Management allows us to successfully tackle any serious incident that affects the organisation.\n\nIn the event of a crisis, our priorities are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Protect people , ensuring the well-being of employees and collaborators.\n- \u00b7 Provide the agreed services to our customers, at the agreed availability and quality.\n- \u00b7 Protect and look after the interests of our shareholders and institutional investors.\n- \u00b7 Comply with our regulatory and legal obligations .\n- \u00b7 Protect and secure our business from a sustainability perspective.",

Having a strategic vision of business continuity leads to global decision-making that results in greater resilience.\n- \u00b7 Effectiveness in crisis management: we have a proven crisis management model, the definitions and procedures of which are common to the entire Company.\n- \u00b7 Coordination and collaboration: the organisational model guarantees, aligns and promotes the development of business continuity equally across all business units.\n- \u00b7 Measurement standards: these allow us to objectively and consistently measure various indicators to determine the Company's maturity from a business continuity perspective, as well as its level of resilience. This gives us the necessary information to be able to establish medium- and long-term goals.\n\nAll of the above is based on international standards such as ISO 22301 for business continuity management, ISO 22320 for emergency management and ISO 22361 for crisis management.\n\nWe also conduct several global and local exercises each year to check our business continuity mechanisms, simulate crisis scenarios and identify opportunities for improvement in the face of real incidents.\n\n## Governance model\n\nThe Global Business Continuity Committee , the highest governance body, defines the global strategy from the design stage, and prioritises and allocates the necessary resources.\n\nThe local business continuity committees , the bodies responsible for ensuring business continuity in each business unit, guarantee implementation of the strategic decisions made at a global level and report on the needs, achievements and maturity indicators that provide a comprehensive view of business continuity in the Company.\n\nUnder the Crisis Management Plan, each area's processes are identified, scenarios that could interrupt them are detected, potential treatment plans are set out, the business continuity strategies to be applied are determined and, if necessary, business continuity plans listing the appropriate actions to be taken are generated.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Implementation and operation : includes deliverables aimed at establishing and documenting the business continuity mechanisms such as a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), which identifies major processes and services, risk analyses, continuity plans, return to normality plans, etc.\n\n- 3. Monitoring and evaluation: involves assessing the effectiveness of the business continuity arrangements in place by testing them in realistic and bounded scenarios. Indicators are used to assess the performance, maturity level and implementation of the overall business continuity project.\n- 4. Maintenance and improvement : encompasses lessons learned and opportunities for improvement identified as a result of business continuity testing and crisis simulation, the business continuity management continuous improvement process, training and awareness raising.\n\n## The Global Business Continuity Program seeks to strengthen our resilience; in other words, our ability to contain attacks and withstand them.\n\nThe LBCOs are responsible for ensuring and driving proper implementation of the business continuity management process, which starts with the identification of processes/services.

We consolidated and evolved the 3PS + tool, which makes it possible to digitalise the entire security risk management process in our purchasing.\n\n## 2.18.4. Cross-cutting privacy and security issues\n\n## 2.18.4.1. Internal control\n\nIn order to address and comply with the legal provisions related to local data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the different countries, the 2023 Annual Plan allocated a total of 420 specific Internal Audit days to verifying certain aspects and identifying best practices in terms of data protection. In 2023 the work focused on reviewing the successful design and execution of controls over personal data processing in a sample of specific products and services, covering the control framework from the perspective of both the data controller and the data processor.\n\nIn addition, we continued with the review of certain aspects of the internal control structures at our European operators. The review took in data processing and the design and operation of the data deletion procedures in the systems that support data processing, in accordance with the specific scope under consideration.\n\nIn the rest of the countries affected by local data protection laws, the major aspects reviewed were the following: the application of security measures in the systems that process personal data; the control structures in place to ensure the quality of the personal data (pursuant to the definition of quality in current data protection legislation); the control activities covering management of user consent to the processing of their personal data; the legitimate basis for the data processing; handling the data subjects exercise of their rights; and management of international transfers.",

Responsible supply chain management\n\n## Key points\n\n## 100%\n\nof suppliers are required to operate with stringent sustainability standards similar to our own .\n\n## Proactive\n\nengagement with key suppliers on specific issues, such as decent working conditions and reducing emissions in the supply chain.\n\n## 2.19.1. Vision\n\nA very important part of the social and environmental impact of companies is directly related to their supply chain. This situation is even more significant for large companies working across different sectors. At Telef\u00f3nica, we are aware of this and we assume accept our responsibility, making sustainability a key part of how we do business. In this way, collaborating with suppliers is of strategic value, as it facilitates alignment with our commitments to customers and to the rest of society.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has set ambitious sustainability targets in relation to reducing CO 2 emissions, promoting decent working conditions and designing sustainable digital solutions. In order to meet them, we cooperate closely with our suppliers on these issues. That is why we see them as partners on our common journey towards a more sustainable economy.\n\nIn order to build trusting relationships with our suppliers, we have developed robust policies and processes with a triple purpose:\n\n- \u00b7 Firstly, to manage the potential impacts of Telef\u00f3nica on society and the environment, through its commercial relationships.\n- \u00b7 Secondly, to jointly identify potential sustainability risks common to our supply chain in order to address them effectively.\n\n## SBTi\n\nIn 2023 we requested our key suppliers to align and validate science-based decarbonisation targets by SBTi.\n\n- \u00b7 Thirdly, to collaborate proactively on key issues (e.g. CO 2 emissions), harnessing the opportunities, in order to turn the ICT supply chain into a driver for sustainability.\n\nThis triple approach ensures that we are delivering to our customers the supply of products and services which not only have a positive impact on society and the planet, but which have also been developed in a responsible manner.\n\n## 2.19.2. Governance GRI 2-12\n\nThe sustainable management of our supply chain is part of the Responsible Business Plan , which is led by the Board of Directors. The Sustainability and Regulation Committee of the Board of Directors supervises its implementation and monitors its goals.\n\nThe governance of this subject is complemented by:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and coordination of the Responsible Business Plan by the Global Sustainability (ESG) Office .\n- \u00b7 The management of our Due Diligence process in the supply chain , by the managing areas such as Global Sustainability (ESG) Office , Procurement, Human Resources, Compliance and General Counsel, among others.",

Policies\n\n## 2.19.4. Impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nOur key policies and standards related to responsible supply chain management are:\n\n- \u00b7 Supply Chain Sustainability Policy, which includes the code of conduct for all our suppliers . In it, we outline the minimum standards for sustainable business that any company aiming to be a supplier of the Telef\u00f3nica Group must adhere to. Their compliance has a positive impact on the different workers in our supply chain. This policy was drawn up in accordance with international standards such as the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the criteria of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n- \u00b7 General conditions for the supply of goods and services, which apply to all supplies from our suppliers.\n- \u00b7 Low Carbon Procurement Instruction: This is an internal regulation which promotes the application of energy efficiency principles on the main purchases of products that require energy consumption (electricity and fuel). With this, we incorporate criteria to internalise the cost of energy and carbon through the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) in our procurement processes favouring suppliers that offer equipment with a lower impact throughout its useful life.\n\nThe rest of the Company's policies reflect our supply chain commitment with regards to our relationships with commercial partners:\n\n- \u00b7 Human Rights Policy.\n- \u00b7 Global Privacy Policy.\n- \u00b7 Global Security Policy.\n- \u00b7 Occupational Health, Safety and Well-being Regulation.\n- \u00b7 Global Environmental Policy.\n\nOur actions and those of our suppliers (who are located in over 60 different countries) may give rise to adverse impacts on society and the environment. The most important of these relate to the labour conditions of those working in the supply chain and our suppliers' carbon emissions.\n\nHaving said this, companies can transform these potentially adverse impacts into positive impacts through a responsible management of the supply chain. For example, through the implementation of social criteria that seek to improve the quality of life of workers in the supply chain. Another example would be the reduction of our Scope 3 emissions by engaging with suppliers through programmes that support them in reducing their carbon footprint, or by including climate-change requirements as part of the procurement process.\n\nSimilarly, such responsible supply chain management also helps us to anticipate the main sustainability risks for the Company. Such risks include the possibility of business interruptions due to a failure to address ESG issues in the supply chain and/or the loss of our reputation owing to supplier-related controversies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For further information, see 1.4. Materiality\n\nWe work closely with our suppliers, maintaining ethical and fair business relationships with them. As a result, we are able to create efficiencies , which are reflected, for example, in the reduction of costs in materials, energy and transport. We are also able to increase labour productivity by ensuring decent working conditions in our supply chain. Lastly, we are able to innovate collectively in the face of ever-changing markets to meet the growing demand for sustainable solutions in the transition to a more sustainable economy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Action plan and commitments GRI 2-6\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's purchasing strategy is mainly based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Global management by Telef\u00f3nica Global Services, an organisation made up of a team of buyers specialised by product/service category. This team leads the negotiations of products and services that require more technical knowledge and are more critical for the business, with in-depth knowledge of the market and a focus on capturing synergies.\n\nCoordination with the operators is managed through the local procurement teams in each country, making it possible to anticipate demand and supervise the execution of contracts and supplier performance in the various areas (including social and environmental requirements).\n\n- \u00b7 Internal efficiency through the optimisation of procurement processes and systems, by initiatives to simplify process and develop support systems.\n- \u00b7 The commitment to sustainability present throughout the entire process and relationship with our suppliers and developed through our sustainable management model. This is in line with the objective to generate positive impact favouring economic and social development based on digitalisation.\n\nAs part of our management model, we pay special attention to issues associated with the supply chain that have a high social and environmental impact and are significant for both the sector and the Company's strategy .

Zero tolerance of child labour is a mandatory requirement for our suppliers.\n\nGRI 308-2, 407-1, 408-1, 409-1, 414-2\n\n## Step 1. Minimum standards required\n\nWe require 100% of our suppliers to conduct their business activities in line with ethical standards similar to ours, to ensure respect for core human rights and labour rights, as well as the protection of the environment.\n\nTherefore, all Telef\u00f3nica suppliers must accept the following upon registering and/or renewing in our Procurement platform:\n\n- \u00b7 Supply Chain Sustainability Policy, where we set out the minimum standards for sustainable business that our suppliers must comply with (thus directly affecting their employees).\n- \u00b7 Anti-corruption Policy (Certificate).\n\nPrior acceptance of these minimum conditions means that awarded suppliers are assessed in relation to the social and environmental issues set out in our norms.\n\n## Summary of our minimum responsible business criteria\n\n- \u00b7 Zero corruption and conflicts of interest.\n- \u00b7 Respect for human rights.\n- \u00b7 Zero child labour.\n- \u00b7 Fair treatment of employees.\n- \u00b7 Freedom of association.\n- \u00b7 Zero tolerance of forced labour.\n- \u00b7 Diversity, gender equality and non-discrimination.\n- \u00b7 Zero tolerance for violence and harassment at work.\n- \u00b7 Health and safety.\n- \u00b7 Minimum environmental impact.\n- \u00b7 Waste management.\n- \u00b7 Reduction of single-use plastics.\n- \u00b7 Management and reduction of hazardous substances.\n- \u00b7 Fewer emissions.\n- \u00b7 Eco-efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Responsible sourcing of minerals.\n- \u00b7 Privacy, confidentiality of information, freedom of expression and artificial intelligence.\n- \u00b7 Management of the supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Identification of potential high-risk suppliers\n\nWe focus on our main suppliers according to their level of risk potential and impact on our business, given the volume of purchases awarded.\n\nTo do so, we carry out the following process to analyse the overall potential sustainability risk of our individual suppliers, in accordance with our risk analysis methodology:\n\nFirst criterion: an initial assessment of the potential risk level assigned to the products/services supplied to us and based on the following specific sustainability aspects in our supply chain. As set out in our Minimum Standards for Responsible Business, these are: working conditions, health and safety, environmental, human rights (child/forced labour), conflict minerals, privacy and data protection, and customer responsibility.\n\nTo this end, we take into account how the risk level of each aspect can vary, according to the sector of origin of each type of product or service supplied.\n\nSecond criterion: an analysis of the potential risk is then carried out taking into account the country of origin of the service or product (and its components or raw materials). In this analysis, we have also incorporated the impact of potential risks which arose with the pandemic or those associated with armed conflicts by country of origin.\n\nThird criterion: lastly, we assess the potential reputational impact on Telef\u00f3nica should the risks analysed materialise.\n\nThis three-step analysis allows us to identify potentially high-risk suppliers in our supplier base from a sustainability perspective.\n\n## Step 3. Performance assessment of our potential high-risk suppliers\n\nWe monitor the possible risks associated with our potential high-risk suppliers identified in the initial analysis. The procurement teams in the various countries can view the results directly on the purchasing platform:\n\n## External assessment platform (IntegrityNext)\n\nConducts an external 360\u00b0 evaluation of our main potential high-risk suppliers based on 15 sustainability criteria that cover ethical, social, environmental and supply chain management aspects.\n\nThese assessments allow us to identify any aspects that could be better managed by our suppliers and proactively work to avoid or minimise potential adverse impacts on human rights or the environment.\n\n## Performance-based actions\n\n| Sustainability  Performance                                                                                                                           | Action       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| \u00b7 Collaborate with the supplier to  identify possible improvements or  sharing of best practices.                                                     | ADVANCED     |\n| \u00b7 Request a commitment from the  supplier to implement an  improvement plan in the coming  year, with the aim of improving its  level of performance. | PARTIAL      |\n| \u00b7 Preventive blocking of the supplier in  the procurement system.                                                                                     | INSUFFICIENT |\n\n## Dow Jones Risk & Compliance Service\n\nWe cross-check our supplier database with Factiva, a database developed by Dow Jones Risk & Compliance. This comparison takes place on a regular basis from the time the supplier is registered. With this tool, we can identify possible risks related to ethical behaviour and corruption , thereby reinforcing processes already in place for compliance with our Anti-Corruption Policy.\n\n## We identify the potential ethical and corruption risks of 100% of our suppliers when they register on our procurement platform.\n\nIf a supplier does not reach the required level in the external assessment platform or is unable to provide the information requested, we require their commitment to implementing improvement plans to ensure compliance with our standards. If the cross-checking with Dow Jones Risk & Compliance results in adverse information about the supplier, an analysis of this information is conducted to assess this adverse information and its significance in relation to the specific contract.",

Audits of key suppliers\n\nThe performance assessments are complemented by our annual audit plan to verify compliance with the critical aspects identified according to (i) type of supplier, (ii) service and product provided, and (iii) the risks of each region or country. These audits are mainly performed through the internal Allies Programme (for service suppliers) and the sectoral Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) 1 initiative (for product manufacturers). Both types are performed by accredited auditing entities, applying the established protocol when required.\n\nThe audits include improvement plans agreed with 100% of the suppliers who do not comply with any of the aspects that may have a negative social or environmental impact. Suppliers make explicit commitments through the agreed improvement plans to remedy any adverse impacts that they have caused or contributed to.\n\nWe have annual local and corporate budgets to retain external auditors for the performance of the audits and subsequent monitoring of improvement plans, as well as the support of the local teams affected, depending on the aspects that are audited.\n\n## 2.19.5.2. Engagement with suppliers\n\nWe strive to understand the importance of material issues for our suppliers, as well as their perception of Telef\u00f3nica's performance in this regard.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 1.4. Materiality\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is firmly committed to an open and collaborative relationship with its suppliers. Our commitment to them is based on establishing relations that enable us to have a joint positive impact on our surroundings through close collaboration and the sharing of best practices, fostered through different initiatives and meetings with our suppliers.\n\nOne example is the management of third-party and collaborating companies through the Allies Programme.\n\nThe way we engage with these companies has allowed us to foster a culture of sustainability, raising awareness among suppliers about compliance with our standards, while jointly establishing mechanisms for early detection and prevention of possible risks in our contractors and subcontractors (most of them in direct contact with our customers). To this end, we rely on a continual process of administrative and on-site audits of our Allies, with the aim of ensuring that minimum working and workplace health and safety conditions for their workers are provided - important in this type of labour-intensive services.\n\nAnother example is our participation in the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) industry initiative, together with 27 other telecommunications operators. Through this initiative, we join forces to verify, assess and develop the implementation of sustainability standards in factories of mutual suppliers, mainly in at-risk regions such as Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. To this end, we carry out on-site audits of both direct suppliers and tier 2 and 3, etc. In this context, improvement plans are implemented to rectify the non-conformities identified. Additionally, specific working groups are set up in JAC (climate change, human rights and circular economy), in which we go beyond the audits to implement best practices in our supply chains.\n\n## Targets\n\n- \u00b7 100% of potential high-risk suppliers assessed on sustainability matters via an external platform by the end of 2026.\n- \u00b7 Promote audits of Tier 2, 3, etc. suppliers in the ICT supply chain through cooperation with direct suppliers as part of the JAC sector initiative.\n- \u00b7 Promote the participation of SMEs in specific procurement processes in order to strengthen our positive impact on local economies.\n- \u00b7 Improve due diligence processes carried out by our suppliers, through proactive engagement, to ensure traceability of minerals and mitigate risks of human rights violations linked to the components or products they sell to us.\n- \u00b7 Reduce CO 2 emissions in our value chain (Scope 3) by 56% by 2030 compared to 2016, and achieve net zero emissions by 2040.",

Progress in 2023\n\nAs explained above, our approach is based on two complementary pillars, namely risk management and supplier engagement.\n\n## 2.19.6.1. Risk management in 2023 GRI 3-3, 308-1, 308-2, 403-7, 407-1, 408-1, 409-1, 414-1, 414-2\n\nIn 2023 , we required 100% of our suppliers to accept the minimum standards set out in our Supply Chain Sustainability Policy (step 1) .\n\nBased on our global risk analysis of awarded suppliers contracts in 2023, we identified 687 suppliers that provide us with products or services classified as potentially high risk from a sustainability perspective . In 2023 we maintained our analysis methodology in order to focus on those suppliers with a significant impact on the business as well as on the Company's strategy (step 2).\n\nOf the suppliers identified, 72% have been externally assessed against sustainability criteria through the external IntegrityNext platform (including those that are currently in progress, pending analysis of the information provided). The IntegrityNext platform allows us to select the criteria to be included in each assessmen t according to the potential risk level they may pose to Telef\u00f3nica as identified in our overall risk analysis (step 3).\n\nAccording to the information available in the procurement system at the end of this reporting period, 5 suppliers were blocked in our database due to integrity/ sanctions or sustainability risks or non-compliance . These represent 100% of the suppliers with identified risks - relating to either integrity/sanctions or sustainability issues (social or environmental reasons) - which had not yet remedied the situation or shown a commitment to implementing improvement plans to ensure compliance with our standards.\n\nIn addition, we complement our supplier risk management process with audits that allow us to verify suppliers' level of compliance with the various sustainability requirements we ask of them, including respect for human rights.\n\nIn 2023 we conducted 18,324 administrative or on-site audits . According to the results obtained in these audits, at the end of the year we had 853 suppliers with improvement plans in place (representing 10% of all awarded suppliers in 2023), (step 4).",

In 2023 the audit process covered each of our main markets - Brazil, Spain and Germany - and seven countries in Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela).\n\nIn 2023 we audited 85 labour-intensive suppliers. As in previous years, a high level of compliance was achieved: over 86% in the five topics audited (Responsible Business Principles, human resources, health and safety, environment, and security and data protection).\n\nLooking at the average number of risks identified per topic in each of the countries, we found that health and safety was the topic with the highest number of risks, with these being concentrated around industrial hygiene and safety, emergency control, verification and planning.\n\nFor human resources , the most common risks were detected primarily in relation to the recruitment process and personnel administration, training, workplace climate assessment and meeting the percentage target for staff with disabilities. For environmental processes, the most common risks concerned the environmental management system, waste management and noise. As for security and data protection, the most common risks related to failures to identify the personal data processing carried out by the supplier and specific training for their employees in this area.\n\nOf the potential social or environmental 6 impacts of the risks identified, the most significant were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The most significant social impacts were mainly related to industrial hygiene and safety, emergency control, planning, and the recruitment process and personnel administration (mainly due to the absence of certain clauses in contracts or lack of an equal pay policy).\n- \u00b7 The environmental impacts were related to environmental management (due to the lack of a policy approved by the company's senior management) and the lack of preventive measures or monitoring of the level of environmental noise caused by supplier activities.\n\nIn this context, and although the results obtained generally reflect a good performance of our partners, improvement plans have been agreed with each of the audited suppliers to address the negative impacts identified.\n\n## Breakdown of significant non-conformities\n\n## TOTAL 310\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHealth and Safety at Work\n\nHuman Resources\n\nData Security and Protection\n\nEnvironment\n\nBusiness Principles\n\n## Tier 2, 3 supplier management\n\nOur supply chain management goes beyond our direct suppliers.\n\nAs part of the JAC initiative, we place particular emphasis on carrying out audits of manufacturers that supply components and/or equipment to our suppliers. In 2023, 67% of the audits we conducted were of Tier 2 or 3 suppliers.\n\n## 2.19.6.2. Engagement in 2023\n\nFor another year running, we continued promoting new capabilities among our suppliers, in order to improve their performance on key sustainability-related issues.\n\n## Supply chain emissions\n\nIn 2023, we implemented various supply chain decarbonisation engagement initiatives based on each supplier's contribution to our Scope 3 emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 In collaboration with other telcos, we invited our most strategic suppliers to participate in the Carbon Reduction Programme , a project that promotes the decarbonisation of suppliers at product level, considering those products most sold to telcos.\n- \u00b7 Suppliers accounting for around 90% of our supply chain emissions were invited by Telef\u00f3nica to provide climate data through CDP Supply Chain , information used in the Supplier Engagement Programme initiative, to categorise suppliers by their level of climate maturity and provide training sessions to help them make improvements in this regard.",

Energy and climate change\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has implemented a new climate requirement within its procurement process, requesting its key suppliers to provide sciencebased decarbonisation targets and validate them with SBTi.\n\n## Labour conditions\n\nUnder the JAC initiative , we collected direct feedback from 10,342 employees at 13 supplier factories through an anonymous survey conducted on their own mobile phones. This enabled us to analyse working conditions in more detail, especially those concerning the number of hours worked, rest periods, harassment, discrimination, treatment, relationship with their direct manager, overtime, the handling of chemical materials, etc.\n\nIn the new Living Wage Working Group of the JAC initiative , we are working to ensure a living wage in the ICT supply chain. Through the JAC protocol, which we apply to all audits conducted under the scheme, we ensure that suppliers pay their employees a fair and reasonable wage that is high enough to maintain a decent standard of living.\n\n## Human rights\n\nIn 2023, within the JAC initiative, we participated in the creation of a new working group on Due Diligence with the aim to ensure compliance with a set of minimum social and environmental standards throughout the ICT sector supply chain. This working group analysed the different national and international legal requirements (such as the proposed Directive on Corporate Due Diligence in Sustainability) and works on the identification and implementation of sectorial solutions to ensure compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see chapter 2.14. Human rights\n\n## Responsible sourcing of minerals\n\nAlthough we do not have direct business relationships with smelters or refiners, we work actively to tighten controls across our value chain on the use of minerals treated in these plants.\n\n## 1. Policy and clauses\n\nOur Minerals Policy is set out in our Supply Chain Sustainability Policy and is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance regarding minerals. All our suppliers have to accept this Policy and therefore commit to responsible sourcing of minerals.\n\nIn addition, any supplier that submits an offer to us must meet minimum sustainability requirements in the supply chain. These are set out in the Telef\u00f3nica Group's General Conditions for the Supply of Goods and Services . They include a contractual minerals clause whereby we require our suppliers to carry out effective due diligence processes to ensure traceability of 3TG minerals and mitigation of associated risks (such as human rights violations).",

Identification and management of potentially highrisk suppliers\n\n- 1. We identify suppliers with a potential high risk regarding minerals on the basis of our risk analysis methodology.\n- 2. We assess performance based on the Conflict Minerals Reporting Templates (CMRTs) that we request from these suppliers.\n- 3. We engage with those suppliers whose due diligence needs to be improved.\n- 4. We verify compliance of some key suppliers through on-site audits under the JAC sector initiative.\n\n## 3. Commitment initiatives\n\nWe support and participate in major international and sector initiatives to reduce this type of risk, such as:\n\n- a. The Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI): our activities regarding smelters and refiners are supported by industry initiatives such as the RMI, in which audits are performed, best practices are shared and stakeholder dialogue is promoted.\n- b.The Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA): we participate in the PPA, a multi-sector, multi-stakeholder initiative that improves conflict-free mineral supply chains.\n\n## 4. Complaints\n\nWe have a Whistleblowing and Queries Channel through which our stakeholders can submit enquiries and complaints about the sourcing of minerals.\n\n## 5. Information\n\nWe report on the due diligence of the supply chain through various channels (this Report, our website, dialogue with stakeholders, etc.).\n\n## Occupational Risk Prevention\n\nIn 2023, once again, we focused on fostering best practices regarding safety, health and well-being in our supply chain , placing particular emphasis on contractors who assist us in the deployment and maintenance of the network, which are where the main risks lie (work at height, electrical risk and confined spaces).\n\nIn 2023 we worked with our suppliers on a series of initiatives that took different forms depending on the situation in the different countries:\n\n- \u00b7 Specific and direct communication with our suppliers via face-to-face sessions that addressed what needs to be done to prevent the risks inherent in each activity from causing accidents. For example, in Colombia we organised two technical round tables at which we shared best practices with our suppliers on how to manage tasks involving exposure to electrical risk and effective road safety . We showcased our new tool for reporting and monitoring accidents to the almost 100 people who participated in these round tables.\n- \u00b7 Occupational health and safety audits specifically adapted to each country, in order to verify compliance with the established procedures and protocols to prevent risk and ensure employee safety at our facilities (see the table 'Details of the Annual Audit Plan' for a breakdown by country of the audits carried out on occupational health and safety issues).\n- \u00b7 Follow-up and monitoring of the corresponding indicators in order to analyse accident rate trends throughout the year.\n\nThrough dialogue with our suppliers, as well as verification and monitoring of compliance on their part, we can work to improve the level of safety and health of employees in our supply chain.\n\n## Monitoring model at Telef\u00f3nica Spain\n\nAs an ISO 45001-certified company, we have a monitoring model in place to prevent and mitigate potential risks related to the operations of our contractors. The model contains the following work processes:\n\n## \u00b7 Control of preventive documentation\n\nSuppliers must prove, prior to the start of the activity, that they are aware of the risks and preventive measures detailed in the contracts signed. Their workers must have the necessary training and personal protective equipment to carry out the activity in question.\n\n## \u00b7 On-site audits\n\nIn 2023 a total of 7,618 supervision processes (unannounced on-site OHS audits) were carried out. At year end, 34 audited suppliers had improvement plans in place to address the deficiencies identified.",

If the safety report has not been completed, the company is notified of this shortcoming and urged to take the necessary measures to remedy it. In 2023, 18,490 shortcomings were notified.\n\n## \u00b7 Ad hoc meetings\n\n- \u00b7 Ad hoc meetings are convened to coordinate Telef\u00f3nica and third-party business activities (58 and 18 companies respectively).\n- \u00b7 Ad hoc meetings are also held with the heads of our partner companies to inform them about new documents relating to specific prevention measures (all companies in the field of installation and maintenance are present at these meetings).\n- \u00b7 Furthermore, single-issue meetings are held with those companies who obtained the worst prevention indicators.\n\n## \u00b7 OHS+ Initiative\n\nThe OHS+ Initiative is an ongoing forum for dialogue, sharing practices, answering queries and offering proposals for improvement. Its aim is to identify levers that will lead to a reduction in the number, volume and severity of OHS incidents until there are zero incidents.\n\n## 2023 results:\n\nOur accident frequency rate (in the workplace in Telef\u00f3nica Spain) fell to 1.24. Our target of 0.9 by 2024 still stands.\n\n## \u00b7 Updating of regulations and approval of specific prevention measures\n\nAn example of the work done under this process is our approval of the plan to accelerate the replacement of poles in poor condition.\n\n## Diversity\n\nWe see diversity as a competitive advantage that creates business value and positively impacts our results. Therefore, in addition to promoting diversity internally within the Company, we encourage diversity among our suppliers, as stated in our Supply Chain Sustainability Policy.\n\nIn this regard, we promote ' Mujeres en Red' , a collaborative project with our contractors that we run in Colombia and Peru to promote employability and training for women in technical positions in the telecommunications sector, championing equal opportunities in roles where women are underrepresented. By the end of 2023, more than 1,070 female technicians had been hired by our operational partners in both countries, and over 7,000 people (both technicians and administrative staff) had received training on topics such as 'Unconscious Bias', 'Female Empowerment' and 'New Masculinities'.\n\nMujeres en Red has established itself as a leading initiative in terms of employability and equity. As a result, it received the following awards in 2023 : in Peru, the Par Ranking award (in the 'Best Innovative Labour Practice' category), the Corresponsables International Award, the Scotiabank Equality Award and the Companies that Transform Peru prize; in Colombia, the Award for Good Practices in Sustainable Development towards SDG 5 of the Global Compact.\n\nIn addition, 2023 saw the annual 'Allies for Equity' event held in both countries for the first time to recognise the work of the Mujeres en Red project, as well as that of the contractors and Telef\u00f3nica employees involved in this initiative. As part of the ceremony, awards were presented in the following categories: Mujeres en Red Woman of the Year, Breaking Biases: Technical Ally for Diversity, Company Committed to Equity, and Leadership and Commitment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.7. Diversity and inclusion\n\n## Training and communication\n\nUnder our procurement model, ESG topics are incorporated into the regular training sessions given to our buyers in various countries. Our buyers also receive training on specific topics such as low-carbon procurement. In addition, like the rest of the Company's employees, a percentage of their annual variable remuneration is linked to sustainability indicators.\n\nIn Germany , we started offering employee and supplier training as part of our approach to human rights and sustainable supply chain management in 2023. Among other topics, the course explains the requirements contained in the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains and raises awareness about respecting human rights in our own business areas and supply chain. Furthermore, 100% of the Executive Committee of Telef\u00f3nica Germany received training on the German Regulation.",

This plan focused on our processes, procedures and guidelines and was aimed at mitigating potential risks in the procurement of outsourced services.\n\nIn addition to the training given to our buyers and internal contract managers, we continued to provide supplier training and maintained our supplier communication channels for another year running.\n\n## In 2023, we delivered 14,816 in-person courses and 57,028 online courses involving over 548,769 participants from partner companies in Latin America.\n\nOur supplier training was delivered in-person and online, addressing the specific needs in each country and the most critical issues according to the service the suppliers provided.\n\nAt a global level, in 2023 we launched a project to share our main integrity regulations and the consequences of non-compliance with suppliers that have been awarded contracts with us, in twice-yearly sessions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.16. Ethics and compliance\n\nOne of our targets for 2023 was to strengthen our relationship with suppliers in the area of privacy and data protection. One of the key measures taken to achieve this at global level was to provide suppliers with training on the proper processing of personal data. Through specialised content, we shared practical guidelines to ensure respect for key privacy principles and Group Telef\u00f3nica policies when processing data.\n\n- In Ecuador, privacy guidelines issued by the local DPO's office were shared with third parties such as authorised distributors. These guidelines convey the importance of acting in accordance with the provisions of Ecuador's Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.18. Privacy and security\n\nFurthermore, under our Supplier Engagement Program, and as part of the annual CDP Supply Chain campaign, we trained our key suppliers on carbon footprint management and reporting.\n\nIn 2023, our participation in initiatives such as SME Climate HUB and 1.5\u00baC Supply Chain Leaders continued, with the aim of helping SMEs to measure their emissions and take specific action to reduce them and achieve their climate targets. For instance, in 2023, we invited some of our small and medium-sized suppliers to a SME-oriented event entitled 'Decarbonisation of SMEs. Boosting the SME Climate Hub in Spain'.\n\nIn Brazil, we participated in an SME training program to strengthen sustainable value chains in the country. This program is part of the AL-INVEST Verde initiative , organised in partnership with the Spanish Chamber of Commerce. Training is provided by the team at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas and financed by the European Commission.\n\nThe aim is to support Brazilian SMEs in the transition towards a circular and low-carbon economy, thereby facilitating the implementation of sustainable production models. We invited 17 of our suppliers to participate, all of them important SMEs for Telef\u00f3nica Brazil with the potential to incorporate better sustainability practices in their businesses.\n\nWe also promoted continuous communication as a key lever for boosting supplier engagement through a number of channels, such as our allies' newsletter, the Allies' Portal and the Suppliers' Portal. The Suppliers' Portal contains all of our global policies, as well as specific local requirements.\n\nOur suppliers have a confidential channel for submitting queries and complaints related to compliance with our Minimum Standards for Responsible Business.",

In 2023 we conducted a survey of our main suppliers to determine their satisfaction levels and identify what they view positively and what they think could be improved. Our questionnaire targeted approximately 6,800 suppliers and achieved a participation rate of 26%.\n\nOur scores have shown an upward trend over the last nine years, reaching an average rating of 8.33 in 2023 (on a scale of 0 to 10).\n\nLast year, the most highly rated aspects were those related to Telef\u00f3nica's reputation and suppliers' attitudes towards the Company, specifically, Telef\u00f3nica's leadership and reputation in the telecommunications sector, the honesty and transparency of our buyers in ensuring equal opportunities for suppliers, and willingness to work with other companies in the Group. Although none of the aspects scored less than seven, the lowest rated were related to invoicing and the simplification of suppliers' relationships with Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nThe survey also asked our suppliers to give us their views on how they could be impacted by the measures taken by Telef\u00f3nica in relation to each of the main material issues in our materiality analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 1.4. Materiality\n\nWe also organise in-person and online events (global and local) with suppliers, such as:\n\n## The 14th Telef\u00f3nica Global Energy and Climate Change Workshop\n\nLasting three days and attended by around 250 participants , this workshop provides the annual meeting point for the leaders of the Company's energy transformation and our main partner companies , and centres around innovation and digitalisation as the means to protect the planet, reduce energy consumption and lower the global carbon footprint.\n\nDuring the workshop, multiple initiatives from our different markets were presented. Among other things, they focused on energy purchasing, emissions in the value chain, reducing fuel consumption and increasing renewable consumption.\n\nWe also announced our goal of achieving a 90% reduction in global operational emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) and a 56% reduction in emissions in the value chain, in time for finalisation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see 2.2. Energy and climate change\n\n## Workshop on Responsible Supply Chain Performance in Brazil\n\nThis workshop was attended by almost 250 people from 105 Telef\u00f3nica supplier companies. During the event, we shared general insights into our Responsible Business Principles, integrity program, data security and privacy issues and workplace safety management.\n\n## Forum on Occupational Risk Prevention in Spain\n\nWe have been organising this conference since 2018, bringing together our main contractors, technological partners, employee representatives, the prevention services from our other operators, and other participants from leading prevention organisations (the Quir\u00f3n Group, Audelco, ADEMI, etc.). During the conference, we address issues related to prevention and health in a format designed to encourage participation (presentations, round tables, etc.).\n\nThe fifth edition, held in 2023, involved companies from contracts in relation to network deployment and maintenance.\n\n## ESG Event with our Allies in Colombia\n\nLast November we held an event to discuss topics related to the opportunities available to companies that incorporate environmental, social and governance issues. The event was attended by 40 representatives from our main partners in Colombia.",

Structure and scope of consolidation of sustainability information GRI 2-2, 2-4, 2-6\n\n## 2.20.4.1. The origin of sustainability information\n\nThe sustainability information refers to 100% of the Group's controlled companies.\n\n## Economic and financial information\n\nIt comes from the same sources that produce the information included in the Group's Consolidated Annual Accounts Report, audited by PwC.\n\n## Customers\n\nAccess information comes from the systems of the operations in the countries. An 'access' refers to any connection or any telecommunications service offered by Telef\u00f3nica. A customer may contract multiple services, so we count the number of accesses or services contracted by the customer. For example, a customer who has a landline and a broadband service represents two accesses instead of one.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe figure comes from the Corporate Human Resources management systems and local management areas. In cases where the information is presented on a consolidated basis, the number of people is used as a proportionality factor.\n\n## Environment and climate change\n\nThe information is provided by the different managers: energy management, environment and/or operations of each country or legal entity, through online questionnaires and other computerized supports. Environmental and energy data are consolidated by simple addition and, in the case of greenhouse gas emissions (climate change), they are calculated by multiplying the activity data by the corresponding emission factor and then added by simple addition. The emission factors come from sources of information of recognized prestige (GHG Protocol, International Energy Agency, Ministries of environment/energy...) and have been validated by an independent external entity (AENOR).\n\n## Suppliers\n\nSupplier information comes from the procurement system used by the procurement areas to award contracts to suppliers. The information is consolidated without applying any criteria as a factor of proportionality. It is important to highlight the difference between the procurement data in the Consolidated Financial Statements (in accordance with the accrual method and Telef\u00f3nica Group's accounting scope of consolidation) and the purchase award criterion used in different sections of this report, which refers to all purchases approved in the period, regardless of how they are accounted for and accrued as an expense.\n\n## 2.20.4.2. Corporate scope\n\nA list of the companies comprising the Telef\u00f3nica Group, their names, main corporate purpose, country, share capital, percentage of effective ownership by the Group, and the company or companies through which the Group's shareholding is obtained, can be found in Appendix I to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements (Scope of Consolidation).\n\nIn fiscal year 2021 a reporting scope for sustainability information was developed and during fiscal year 2022 the process to update it was determined and consolidated. Since then, the sustainability reporting scope is updated three times a year, in coordination with the Financial Consolidation Area and the Global Areas, which manage sustainability indicators, and reflects corporate changes mainly related to new companies, eliminated companies and structural changes.\n\nThe sustainability reporting scope is based on the financial scope included in the SAP BPC tool, which includes the maximum corporate detail. In addition, it reflects sustainability indicators grouped into different ESG reporting categories, which are:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change\n- \u00b7 Circular economy\n- \u00b7 Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n- \u00b7 Human capital\n- \u00b7 Bribery and corruption\n- \u00b7 Fiscal\n- \u00b7 Human rights\n- \u00b7 Anti-corruption training\n- \u00b7 Training in Responsible Business Principles",

Other information\n\nAll information in this Report is given in euros, unless otherwise stated. The exchange rates applied coincide with those used in the preparation of the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements to facilitate the integral relationship between financial and sustainability variables.\n\nDue to its strategic importance for the Company, the Report contains several specific indicators corresponding to VMO2 UK (Virgin Media O2), the joint venture created in the United Kingdom between Telef\u00f3nica UK and Virgin Media UK. This entity began operating on 1 June 2021. The included indicators have been independently verified under limited assurance by ERM Certification and Verification Services Limited ('ERM CVS').\n\n<!-- image -->",

Principles for the preparation of the Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) GRI 2-14\n\nThis Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) forms part of Telef\u00f3nica's 2023 Management Report and includes the progress made at the Company during the year in economic, social and environmental matters across its value chain, together with its strategic, development and market positioning, so that readers can better understand the sustainability of our business model and its materiality, its capacity to generate value in terms of capital and the interaction with stakeholders.\n\nAs an integral part of Telef\u00f3nica's 2023 Consolidated Management Report, the statement has been evaluated and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Accuracy\n\nTelef\u00f3nica reports sustainability information in accordance with applicable regulations and the foremost internationally recognised benchmark standards. In this regard, the main rules and standards are as follows:\n\n- a. Law 11/2018 of 28 December, which amends the Commercial Code; the revised text of the Corporations Law approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010 of 2 July, and Law 22/2015 of 20 July on the Auditing of Accounts in terms of non-financial information and diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee 2.20.9.

The SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) standard as applied to the telecommunication services sector, in accordance with the Sustainable Industry Classification System \u00ae (SICS\u00ae) TC-TL.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee 2.20.10 SASB compliance table\n\n- d. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) on environmental reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee 2.20.8. Table of Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\n- e. The AA1000AS Standard: in addition, the NFIS has been reviewed by PwC according to the principles defined by the AA1000AS Standard, values that seek to 'ensure the quality of the organisation's Sustainability Report and of the processes, systems and competencies applied as the basis for its execution by the entire organisation'.\n\nIn addition, Telef\u00f3nica reports on its commitment to the following international treaties and targets:\n\n- a. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n- b. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (see chapter 2.8).\n- c. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n- d. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n- e. The Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n- f. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n- g. The Conventions of the International Labour Organization.\n- h. The Basel Convention (hazardous waste).\n- i. International ICNIRP guidelines.\n- j. The Montreal Protocol.\n\n## Balance\n\nThe information presented is reported without bias and is a fair representation of the organisation's impacts.\n\n## Clarity\n\nTelef\u00f3nica presents its information in an accessible and understandable way, attempting to provide it in a form that is clear for users with basic knowledge of the organisation.\n\n## Comparability\n\nThe comparability of the information provided is facilitated by using, for example, internationally accepted units, conversion factors, protocols and procedures. Information is also provided on previous years and the statement details the modification of calculation and measurement methodologies, where applicable.",

In this way, stakeholders can analyse Telef\u00f3nica's performance during the period under analysis.\n\n## Sustainability context\n\nTelef\u00f3nica contributes to the progress of the communities in which we operate and their social and environmental sustainability throughout our value chain and at local, regional, national and international levels, from working with our suppliers through to respecting consumer rights, including marketing sustainable products and services.\n\nThis report covers issues that reflect the Company's significant economic, environmental and social effects and substantially influence our stakeholders' assessments and decisions. To this end, a materiality analysis has been performed at corporate, local and regional level from a dual perspective: significance for our stakeholders and impact on communities.\n\n## Regularity\n\nTelef\u00f3nica provides all its stakeholders with reliable, material, concise and comparable information on its performance, its business model, its value levers and its strategic lines for the coming years. This information is provided at scheduled intervals, so that our various stakeholders can incorporate it into their decision making.\n\n## Verifiability\n\nTelef\u00f3nica subjects its Non Financial Information Statement to independent verification, under limited assurance, following criteria set by GRI standards. Besides, certain non financial indicators are verified under reasonable assurance (see chapter 2.22). In both cases, verifications have been carried out by PwC , with the exception of the indicators related to energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions, that were reviewed by other independent verifiers, in compliance with ISO14064-3 rule (reports of the different verifiers are attached at the end of this annex). Besides, the Internal Audit department performs specific reviews on some processes and indicators.",

Reasonable assurance\n\n## 2.21.1. Strengthening the control over sustainability information\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is aware of the growing importance of reporting sustainability information to our stakeholders. This is a growing demand not only from our customers and society as a whole, but also from investors and regulators. In Spain specifically, the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies (revised in June 2020) strengthens the roles allocated to the Audit Committee. The document recommends allocating roles related to the oversight and assessment of sustainability information preparation and integrity to this committee, as well as the oversight and assessment of sustainability risk management and control systems. It also recommends revising compliance with regulatory requirements, the appropriate definition of the scope of consolidation and the correct application of accounting criteria in line with the guidelines previously established in 2017 under Technical Guidelines 3/2017 of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV).\n\nFor that reason, Telef\u00f3nica began designing the Internal Control System over Sustainability Information in 2019. This project covers risk management, control activities, information and disclosure processes, and oversight activities for the entire sustainability reporting process. The aim is to provide a control framework for the sustainability information to be reported in the Consolidated Management Report of the Telef\u00f3nica\n\nGroup.\n\nThus, efforts have been made to integrate internal control into the daily activities of the Company, where all areas, within their scope of action (management areas), are responsible for controlling the information they manage and disclose, considering the necessary assurance elements as part of their tasks. In addition, Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica serves as the highest supervisory and control body of the Company, relying on the support of the Audit and Control Committee in its supervisory functions.\n\nThe sustainability information system in Telef\u00f3nica Group is regulated by various internal norms, available on the company's intranet, including the following:\n\n- -Internal Control Corporate Policy , which defines the criteria of Telef\u00f3nica's Corporate Internal Control Model, applicable to all companies within Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n\n- -Regulation on Recording, Reporting and Control of Financial and Sustainability Information of\n\nTelef\u00f3nica Group , establishing the general principles of the Sustainability Information System (ICSR) and the Financial-Accounting Information System of the Group (ICFR).\n\n- -Sustainability reporting instructions , establishing the procedures and schedule to be followed by Telef\u00f3nica Group companies in reporting sustainability information and external verification to comply with the legal and information obligations of Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n\nAs a result, the strengthening of internal control has materialized in obtaining a reasonable assurance report from the external auditor, PwC, for the following six indicators::\n\n- \u00b7 Awarded suppliers (N\u00ba)\n- \u00b7 Volume of purchases awarded (M\u20ac)\n- \u00b7 Net Promoter Score (NPS) (%)\n- \u00b7 High severity digital security breaches with an impact on the personal data of customers (N\u00ba)\n- \u00b7 Privacy and data protection fines (N\u00ba)\n- \u00b7 Privacy and data protection fines stemming from a security breach or incident (N\u00ba)\n\nAs referred to in section 2.21.5. Principles for preparing the Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS), Telef\u00f3nica reports sustainability information according to the GRI and SASB standards and frameworks, among others.\n\nThe reasonable assurance procedures followed by the external verifier covered the companies Telef\u00f3nica Spain, Telef\u00f3nica Germany, and Telef\u00f3nica Brazil and their subsidiaries for the purposes of the Integrated Report of the Telef\u00f3nica Group as at 31 December 2023.\n\nOur Company will continue to implement this project with a view to further strengthening our Internal Control System over Sustainability Information.",

The segments differ depending on the country presenting the information.

Introduction and reference frameworks\n\nTelefonica has a Risk Management Framework, based on COSO 1 ) (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission). The framework has been implemented homogeneously throughout the Group's main operations, so that the Company's senior management, within their scope of action, can carry out timely identification, assessment, response and monitoring of the main risks.\n\nThis model, which is inspired by best practices, facilitates the prioritisation and development of coordinated actions against risks, both from a global perspective of the Group and from a specific perspective that focuses on its main operations.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group's Responsible Business Principles specifically state that:\n\n## Culture\n\nTraining and involving employees in the risk management culture, encouraging them to identify risks and actively participate in their mitigation, is one of the basic principles that guide risk management.\n\n## ' We establish appropriate controls to evaluate and manage all relevant risks to the Company'\n\n## Extract from Responsible Business Principles of Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nIn this respect, the Company has a Risk Management Policy , approved by the Board of Directors, and a Corporate Risk Management Procedure , both based on experience, best practices and Good Corporate Governance recommendations, thereby contributing to the continuous improvement in business performance.\n\n## 3.1.2. Risks and strategy\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's risk management is an integral part of our planning process and is fully aligned with our strategy, in line with the requirements of COSO ERM 2017.",

This function falls within the Internal Audit area and is independent of the senior management; it has a global structure and local officers in the main operating companies. Its role is to promote, support, coordinate and verify the application of the provisions of the Risk Control and Management Policy both at Group level and in the Company's main operations. It also assists the ACC in all necessary matters.\n\nIn order to ensure adequate supervision of Telef\u00f3nica's risk management framework by the Audit and Control Committee, various sessions are held by that committee, through:\n\n- \u00b7 General presentations about the risk management framework and the situation of the main risks, given by Internal Audit. Specifically, during 2023, two general presentations on risks were given to Telef\u00f3nica's Audit and Control Committee.\n- \u00b7 Specific presentations on the main risks by those responsible for its management. During 2023, debates dedicated to one particular issue were held, focussing on strategic risks, as well as on the areas of litigation, compliance, sustainability, systems and network, cybersecurity, finance and tax.\n\nIn turn, the Audit and Control Committee reports regularly on these matters to the Board of Directors.\n\n## > Risk Owner\n\nRisk owners actively participate in the risk strategy and in important decisions about managing them. To this end, each of the identified risks will be assigned a person (normally a person at management level) with full responsibility for the risk and its management; a plan will be drawn up to mitigate them and the progress made will be effectively monitored. If the controls or mitigation plans relating to such a risk fall outside the risk owner's scope, their role shall be to identify the party responsible for the control or mitigation plan and to ensure that it is designed and functions effectively.\n\nSpecifically, with respect to fiscal risks, the Group's Tax Department performs its fiscal control role through the Regional Tax Departments and the local fiscal control officers at the subsidiaries in accordance with the principles defined in the Group's Fiscal Control Policy, approved by the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.1.4. Tolerance or risk appetite\n\nThe Company has a risk tolerance or acceptable risk level established at corporate level, which covers its willingness to assume a certain level of risk, to the extent that it allows the creation of value and the running of the business, in order to achieve an appropriate balance between growth, performance and risk.\n\nFor the risk assessment, the different typology of the risks that could affect the Company is considered, as described below:\n\n- \u00b7 In general, tolerance thresholds are defined for all risks, including tax risks, by combination of impact and probability of occurrence. These thresholds are updated annually based on the evolution of the main financial figures, both for the Group as a whole and for the main Telef\u00f3nica companies.\n- \u00b7 In the case of risks related to reputation, sustainability. compliance and corruption, a zero-tolerance level is established.\n\n## 3.1.5. Risk management process\n\nThe risk management process takes the Company's strategy and objectives as a reference for the identification of the main risks that could affect its achievement. This process is performed in the Group's main operations twice a year. There is also an emergency reporting process in the event that the company's management becomes aware of a new risk or a significant change in an existing risk.\n\nThe process consists of four stages, which are described below:\n\n## Risk Management Process\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this respect, it provides for procedures to meet the new challenges from the alignment between the strategic targets and the risks that could affect the fulfilment of those targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe different types of risk response are described below:\n\n## Risk response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal measures (mainly involving the use of financial derivatives) are taken to mitigate certain financial risks such as those relating to exchange-rate and interest-rate fluctuations. We also monitor the main issues identified in relation to tax risks. In addition, for many of the operational risks, the Group uses multinational insurance programmes or insurance policies negotiated locally in each country, depending on the type of risk and cover required.\n\n## > Monitoring and reporting\n\nIn accordance with the different typology of risks, the monitoring and response mechanisms include global initiatives, promoted and coordinated in a homogeneous way in the main operating businesses of the Group, and/ or actions particularly aimed at addressing specific risks in certain companies at the local level.",

Perspectives of the Risk Management Framework\n\nIn order to obtain a comprehensive model, oriented to the needs and specific configuration of the Group, Telef\u00f3nica's ERM Framework contemplates a risk assessment through four complementary perspectives :\n\n## Perspectives of the risk management framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBottom-up: based on the concept of Risk Self -Assessment (RSA), according to which managers are responsible for identifying and describing the specific risks of their area, as well as assessing and defining a response to them.\n\nTop-down: this assessment is based on a cross-cutting analysis of those matters considered material and common to most of the Group's companies, complementing the aforementioned bottom-up approach and thereby obtaining an overview of the main risks of the Company as a whole.\n\nRisks in processes: support for process managers to identify and define their response to risks that may affect the achievement of their targets, with a cross-cutting approach.\n\nRisks in projects: applicable to particularly important internal projects, usually related to transformation initiatives and with a cross-cutting approach.\n\n## 3.1.7 Risk interdependence and scenarios analysis\n\nIn addition to individual assessment of each risk, within its framework the Telef\u00f3nica Group takes into consideration the concept of interdependence. In other words, if a risk materialises, it may have an impact on other risks in the model, thereby making them more critical. In this regard, an analysis of the interdependence between the risks of the model is conducted in conjunction with the risk owners, in order to identify any that may potentially have an impact on other risks and to ensure that they are suitably weighted.",

In addition, this analysis of the interdependence of risks also allows the Company to design stress scenarios that increase, to different degrees, the interdependence between the risks included in the model when adverse socio-economic situations arise (e.g. operational resilience, ESG, etc.).\n\n## 3.1.8. Risk culture\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Telef\u00f3nica's Risk Management Policy, one of the basic principles that guide this activity is: 'educate and engage employees in the risk management culture, encouraging them to identify risks and actively participate in their mitigation'.\n\nTo this effect, Telefonica promotes the following initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Communication: in order to disseminate, through the appropriate channels, the principles and values that should govern risk management, regular meetings are held with the risk owners.\n- \u00b7 Training: to promote knowledge and involvement in the aforementioned values and in the risk management framework, various training initiatives are carried out, including online courses on risk management available to the Company's employees.\n\n\"Training workshops and global awareness campaigns are conducted to strengthen the risk management culture in the Company\"\n\n## 3.1.9. Digitalisation of risk management\n\nWith the aim of managing and supervising risks, Telefonica has a risk management tool, which facilitates the reporting, analysis, assessment and management of risk information within the Telef\u00f3nica Group. These tools are common to all Group companies that report on risks, and their main features are the following:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to integrate ESG aspects into this process, the Company carries out a context analysis that takes into account:\n\n- -emerging risks with a medium- to long-term impact: analysing risk trend reports and studies such as the Global Risks Report produced by the World Economic Forum;\n- -human rights and environmental impact assessment: examining potential adverse impacts on human rights and the environment, as they may pose risks for the Company;\n- -the ESG regulatory environment: taking into account the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the delegated act adopting the first set of European reporting standards concerning sustainability, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), among others; and\n- -our stakeholders' expectations.\n\nThis analysis is complemented by the identification of the impacts, risks and opportunities of the material issues identified through the double materiality process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, see chapter 1.4. Materiality\n\nFor further information, see chapter 2. Non-Financial Information Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSome of the most significant ESG risks for Telef\u00f3nica are detailed below:\n\nEnvironmental risk: direct or indirect impact on Telef\u00f3nica's operations due to environmental issues, especially due to legal requirements during network deployment and operation, as well as future environmental taxes, regulations or fees.\n\nClimate change: direct or indirect impact on Telef\u00f3nica's business operations and lines of business due to the consequences of climate change. Transition risks and physical risks are included. We follow the recommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures) to analyse and manage both physical and transition risks. We analysed these risks on a medium- and long-term basis for two CO\u2082 concentration scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, or RCP): RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 of the IPCC (UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). For more details, see chapter 2.2. Energy and climate change.\n\nHuman rights: risk of possible negative impacts regarding certain human rights as a consequence of the Company's activity. This risk may arise both from the Company's own activities, with regard to our employees, customers, local communities, etc., as well as from the activities carried out by our suppliers on our behalf.\n\nAdaptation to ESG reporting requirements: risk associated with the increased reporting requirements requested by regulators, analysts, investors, customers and other stakeholders from the Group's various legal entities in ESG matters.\n\nIn addition, Telef\u00f3nica manages other risks associated with ESG factors such as those related to people, customers, privacy, cybersecurity, technological changes, quality and continuity of services, the supply chain, fiscal transparency and compliance issues, among others.\n\n## 3.2.3 Emerging risks\n\nIn the process of identifying new risks , Telef\u00f3nica also considers emerging risks .\n\nEmerging risks are recently identified issues which are expected to have an adverse impact on the future development of the Company or the sector in the long term, although their outcome and time horizon are still uncertain and difficult to predict.",

Cybersecurity' in section 2.18.3.6. Action plan and commitments. To mitigate the emerging risk caused by the possible increase in the sophistication of cybercrime, the Telef\u00f3nica Group is focusing on the following aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 Adoption of zero trust models.\n- \u00b7 Measures to ensure the security of cloud services.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of cyber-attacks accompanied by cyber intelligence activities.\n- \u00b7 Increased digital security controls in the supply chain.\n- \u00b7 Automation of detection and response activities.\n- \u00b7 Enhancing cybersecurity training and awarenessraising activities for users.\n\nIf the aforementioned measures do not fully prevent damage to systems or data, there are backup systems designed to recover all or part of the information, as well as insurance programmes and coverage for cyber risks, as described in the section 'Information technology is an\n\nGeopolitical context and macroeconomic situation\n\nChanges in consumer behaviour and generational preferences\n\nimportant element of our business and is exposed to cybersecurity risks' in chapter 3.3 Risk factors.\n\n- \u00b7 New uses of AI:\n\nDescription: the development and use of AI may generate potential risks associated with privacy, intellectual property, societal and environmental impacts, security and the fundamental rights of individuals, if governance models that identify and address these risks are not implemented.\n\nImpact: the absence of controls in the different risk scenarios associated with AI poses the risk of reputational damage to the Group as well as a loss of trust among customers and users. This would have a negative impact on the Group's business, financial position, operating results and/or cash flows.\n\nMitigation actions: the different scenarios will be managed through the continuous improvement cycle of risk analyses carried out considering privacy, intellectual property, security, fundamental rights, environment and society as a whole. All of this is based on an internal governance model that is linked to new digital solutions.\n\n- \u00b7 Critical infrastructure disruptions or failure and resilience:\n\nDescription: given the current international geopolitical situation, as well as the unpredictability of evolving military conflicts, there are risks associated with the intensification of cyber attacks against critical operators and essential services, which could lead to interruptions or outages of critical infrastructures and services. It is also important to ensure the resilience of the Company's infrastructures in an age of increasing digital disruption.\n\nImpact: it may potentially result in damage to the Group's operations, image and/or business, and may also impact Group customers or third parties, including incidents affecting the services provided by the operator to its customers.\n\nMitigation actions: Telef\u00f3nica has drawn up business continuity plans for all its operators, and simulations are carried out to verify business continuity by modelling various crisis situations on a regular basis.

Risks and Opportunities\n\nWe are a technological company that is at the heart of the digital revolution that we are experiencing. The telecommunications and technology market has been able to play a decisive and much more dynamic role, which has situated the sector as one of the main economic drivers in the new societies.

The Company is at an advanced stage in its roll-out of fibre in its main markets. Telef\u00f3nica Spain will lead the way, shutting down its copper network in 2024.\n\nWe are aware that broadband is a strategic pillar to accelerate progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the basis for the development of new digital services to improve education, facilitate access to health and address climate change.\n\n- \u00b7 Acceleration of the momentum towards the digitalisation of all sectors of our economy (education, health, entertainment, commerce, industry, etc.) as a driving force for development\n\nThe telecommunications industry plays a key role for societies, as a connectivity supplier and an enabler of technological advances, collaborating in the shift towards a more digital and sustainable world:\n\nIn the corporate sphere (companies of all sizes and public administrations), there has been a marked acceleration in the shift towards the digitalisation of key functions, in order to meet the demands of their customers more quickly. Telef\u00f3nica is strongly committed to growth in this sector through T-Tech, our unit specialising in business solutions. T-Tech offers the services most in demand among companies (cloud computing, cybersecurity, Internet of Things, big data).\n\nFor our residential customers, technology can offer a new world of possibilities, driving new solutions, services and increasingly innovative content that allow us to connect people's lives. During the last year, we witnessed a substantial increase in the use of digital services for entertainment, remote work, health, etc. In this respect, we offer new ecosystems of relevant digital services for our customers in certain sectors (Movistar Money for financial services, Movistar Salud or Vida V for telemedicine, Movistar Prosegur Alarms for security, etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00b7 Open Gateway and new connectivity business models\n\nThe deployment, management and operation of nextgeneration networks is increasingly being done from a software platform. This allows operators to implement new business models to monetise their networks not only with end customers but also by offering network capabilities to external developers.\n\nIn addition, networks have been incorporating new technologies that allow them to develop innovative services and build new business models based on them (Network as a Service, Edge, Network Slicing, etc.).\n\nAll this creates the opportunity to set connectivity apart once again based on its quality, thereby allowing telecommunications companies to create differentiated offerings based on the needs of developers or end customers. To capture the opportunity offered by these new businesses, operators will need to become orchestrators of all of the above elements (networks, platforms, developers, end customers).\n\n## \u00b7 Improved market conditions and regulation in the telecommunications sector\n\nThe deflationary situation in the telecommunications sector, coupled with the increase in the number of players ( especially in Europe) and the debate surrounding the contribution of the largest traffic generators to network investment, may be the levers that encourage a revision of the regulatory framework to adapt it to the new needs of the sector.\n\n## \u00b7 Growing relevance of sustainability (ESG) aspects\n\nIn a context of increasingly stringent environmental regulations, the transition to a greener economy represents an opportunity for Telef\u00f3nica, specifically due to the positive impact of telecommunications products and services on our customers' processes, allowing companies to save on CO2 emissions, optimise their operations, reduce waste and improve their carbon footprints.\n\nIoT services allow more efficient use of resources such as energy and water; with big data we are helping to improve traffic planning and air quality; and with dronebased services and connectivity, we can improve the response to fires.\n\nLikewise, sustainable financing contributes to Telef\u00f3nica's decarbonisation strategy and its targets to reduce emissions and energy consumption.",

Materialised risks\n\nThe Company tracks risks that have materialised. The strategy and management of Telef\u00f3nica Group's activities tend to minimise the impact of materialised risks, as well as to counterbalance the negative effects of some issues with the favourable evolution of others.\n\nDuring the year, geopolitical events, such as the RussiaUkraine and Israel-Hamas armed conflicts, as well as inflation and high interest rates, among other factors, have affected various areas and operations of the company. The most important aspects and their impact are detailed in section 3.3 Risk Factors\n\nIn this regard and in accordance with current accounting standards, the Telef\u00f3nica Group reviews on an annual basis, or more frequently when the circumstances require it, the need to introduce changes to the book value of its goodwill, investments accounted for by the equity method, deferred tax assets, or other assets, such as intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment. In the case of goodwill, the potential loss of value is determined by the analysis of the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill is allocated at the time it is originated, and such calculation requires significant assumptions and judgement. In 2023 impairment losses in the goodwill of Telef\u00f3nica Ecuador were recognized for a total of 58 million euros. In addition, VMO2, our 50:50 joint venture with Liberty Global in the United Kingdom, recorded in 2023 an impairment of goodwill amounting 3,572 million euros, with a negative impact of 1,786 million euros on the share of (loss) income of investments\n\n## Prioritisation of risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naccounted for by the equity method in the consolidated income statement of the Group.\n\nIn addition, Telef\u00f3nica may not be able to realise deferred tax assets on its statement of financial position to offset future taxable income. The recoverability of deferred tax assets depends on the Group's ability to generate taxable income over the period for which the deferred tax assets remain deductible. If Telef\u00f3nica believes it is unable to utilise its deferred tax assets during the applicable period, it may be required to record an impairment against them resulting in a non-cash charge on the income statement.\n\nFurther impairments of goodwill, deferred tax assets or other assets may occur in the future which may adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## 3.2.6. Prioritisation of Risks\n\nThe risks of the Telef\u00f3nica Group are prioritised based on their level of criticality, which is obtained by combining the impact and likelihood assessments for each of them.\n\nFor public disclosure purposes, Telefonica's risks are presented under four categories, as described above, presenting the risk factors in descending order of importance within each category, in line with the requirements of ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority).\n\nThe details about the main risk factors disclosed by the Company are included in the following section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk Factors\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group's business is affected by a series of risk factors that affect exclusively the Group, as well as a series of factors that are common to businesses of the same sector. The main risks and uncertainties faced by Telef\u00f3nica, that could affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows are set out below and must be considered jointly with the information set out in the rest of this Annual Report.   .\n\nThese risks are currently considered by the Telef\u00f3nica Group to be material, specific and relevant in making an informed investment decision in respect of Telef\u00f3nica. However, the Telef\u00f3nica Group is subject to other risks that have not been included in this section based on the Telef\u00f3nica Group's assessment of their specificity and materiality based on the Telef\u00f3nica Group's assessment of their probability of occurrence and the potential magnitude of their impact. The assessment of the potential impact of any risk is both quantitative and qualitative considering, among other things, potential economic, compliance, reputational and environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") impacts.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group, taking into account the global risks identified by the World Economic Forum, as well as the increase in legal information requirements and the expectations of stakeholders in this area, monitors risks directly related to sustainability, as well as other risks with potential impact on ESG, highlighting those most relevant in the context of Telef\u00f3nica's operations, including the adaptation to ESG expectations and information requirements and climate change.\n\nRisks are presented in this section grouped into four categories: business, operational, financial, and legal and compliance.\n\nThese categories are not presented in order of importance. However, within each category, the risk factors are presented in descending order of importance, as determined by Telef\u00f3nica at the date of this document. Telef\u00f3nica may change its vision about their relative importance at any time, especially if new internal or external events arise.\n\n## Risks related to Telef\u00f3nica's Business Activities.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's competitive position in some markets could be affected by the evolution of competition and market consolidation.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group operates in highly competitive markets and it is possible that the Group may not be able\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto market its products and services effectively or respond successfully to the different commercial actions carried out by its competitors, causing it to not meet its growth and customer retention plans, thereby jeopardizing its future revenues and profitability.\n\nAdditionally, the Telef\u00f3nica Group could be affected by the regulatory actions of antitrust authorities. These authorities could prohibit certain actions, such as new acquisitions or specific practices, create obligations or impose heavy fines. Any such measures implemented by the antitrust authorities could result in economic and/or reputational loss for the Group, in addition to a loss of market share and/or harm to the future growth of some of its businesses.\n\nThe reinforcement of competitors, the entry of new competitors (such as telecommunication companies or providers of OTT Services), or the merger of operators in certain markets (for example, market consolidation following potential mergers of mobile operators Vodafone UK and Three UK in the United Kingdom and Orange and M\u00e1s M\u00f3vil in Spain), may affect Telef\u00f3nica's competitive position, negatively affecting the evolution of its revenues and market share or increasing its costs. In addition, changes in competitive dynamics in the markets in which the Telef\u00f3nica Group operates, such as in Chile, Colombia, Peru, Mexico and Argentina, where there is one or more of new operators entering the market, aggressive customer acquisition offers and competition in network and 5G deployment, can affect the competitive position and the efficiency of Telef\u00f3nica's operations.\n\nRegarding digital services, the speed of technological evolution and changes in demand favoring the appearance of new competitors in the market specializing in certain segments, and that have agile business models, can pose a threat for the business model of the Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n\nIf Telef\u00f3nica is not able to successfully face these challenges, by ensuring a supply of cutting-edge technology products and services and maintaining its competitiveness against current or future competitors, the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\nThe Group requires government concessions and licenses for the provision of a large part of its services and the use of spectrum, which is a scarce and costly resource.",

If the Telef\u00f3nica Group breaches any of such obligations, it may suffer consequences such as fines or other measures that would affect the continuity of its business. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, the terms of granted licenses may be modified before the expiration date of such licenses or, at the time of the renewal of a license, new enforceable obligations could be imposed or the renewal of a license could be refused.\n\nIn addition, the Telef\u00f3nica Group requires sufficient appropriate spectrum to offer its services. The intention of the Group is to maintain current spectrum capacity and, if possible, to expand it, through the participation of the Group in spectrum auctions which are expected to take place in the next few years, which will likely require cash outflows to obtain additional spectrum or to comply with the coverage requirements associated with some of the related licenses. While Telef\u00f3nica considers its current spectrum capacity to be sufficient in all the regions in which Telef\u00f3nica operates, the Group's failure to retain or obtain sufficient or appropriate spectrum capacity in these jurisdictions in the future, or its inability to assume the related costs, could have an adverse impact on its ability to maintain the quality of existing services and on its ability to launch and provide new services, which may materially adversely affect Telef\u00f3nica's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nAny of the foregoing, as well as the additional matters addressed below, could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows of the Group.\n\nAccess to new concessions/ licenses of spectrum.\n\nIn Spain, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation approved in June 2023 a modification to the National Frequency Allocation Table (\"CNFA\"), allowing for the possibility of making available 450 MHz of the 26 GHz spectrum band, to companies, industries and organizations operating in a specific sector, that deploy private networks to support their connectivity needs (verticals). This could mean more competition in the private corporate network segment.\n\nIn the UK, the Office of Communications (\"Ofcom\") continues to make consultations on the opening of access to the 26 GHz and 40 GHz bands for mobile use. Ofcom has confirmed that it does not intend to auction this spectrum until a decision is made on the proposed merger between Vodafone UK and Three UK. The current consultation is focused on award design.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Latin America, the following 5G auction processes are expected in 2024: (i) in Chile, in October 2023, Subtel announced a second 5G auction process to assign 50MHz of spectrum in the 3400 - 3600 MHz band. The assignment of spectrum is expected for the first half of 2024; and (ii) in Peru, with regards to 5G and the auction for additional 3.5 GHz band spectrum, the government has announced that it will commission the Peruvian Private Investment Promotion Agency to conduct the auction and, in parallel, the refarming of this spectrum band will be carried out. Nevertheless, on September 20, 2023, after an employee presented a false document regarding his academic degree, Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa was disqualified following a decision of the government procurement supervisor (OSCE), from contracting with the Peruvian state for a period of 36 months, meaning it cannot request concessions for spectrum or participate as a contractor or subcontractor in any government tender process. However, Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa has concessions for the provision of public telecommunications services and 4G and 5G spectrum (including in the same 3.5 GHz band, but obtained in a previous auction) with validity that exceeds the disqualification period. In addition, this disqualification does not affect the renewals of Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa licenses. Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa has initiated legal actions against the sanction resolution, and the aforementioned employee was fired and criminally prosecuted, before any participation in the execution of the public contract.\n\nExisting licenses: renewal processes and modification of conditions for operating services.\n\nIn Spain, and in accordance with Law 11/2022, of June 28, on General Telecommunications, Telef\u00f3nica requested the Administration to extend the duration of its spectrum licenses up to a maximum of 40 years, which means an extension of up to ten additional years. If this extension does not take place, the first set of licenses will expire in 2030. In this context, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation has launched a public consultation on the modification of current spectrum licenses of Telef\u00f3nica and other operators. The final decision could be adopted in the second quarter of 2024. In Germany, in the allocation procedure for the frequencies at 800 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2.6 GHz, which will partially expire at the end of 2025, the Bundesnetzagentur ('BNetzA') published the consultation paper \"Demand update and framework conditions for a transitional decision\" (framework conditions). The framework conditions are based on the BNetzA's position paper from September 2022 and the comments received thereon. The framework conditions provide for the existing frequency usage rights in the above-mentioned frequency ranges, which expire at the end of 2025, to be extended for a transitional period of five years in an initial action plan. The BNetzA intends to make a decision about frequency provision in 2024. As part of a second set of actions, a larger procedural framework is to be established for utilization from 2031 onwards, including",

A decision on this set of actions is planned for 2028.\n\nIn the UK, mobile spectrum licenses are generally indefinite in term, subject to an annual fee set after a fixed period (usually 20 years) from the initial auction. In 2033, after this mentioned fixed period, Ofcom will set spectrum fees for 800 MHz and 2.6 Ghz bands. VMO2 currently holds spectrum in both of these bands.\n\n## With respect to Latin America:\n\nIn Brazil, the Agencia Nacional de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es ('ANATEL') approved on February 8, 2021, Resolution 741/2021 which sets the Regulation for the Adaptation of Fixed Commuted Telephony Service ('STFC') concessions. ANATEL has presented an estimated value for calculating the migration balancing from the concession to the authorization regime, which on March 22, 2023 was validated by the Federal Court of Accounts (the 'TCU'). However, the TCU requires ANATEL to consider the market value for the valuation of reversible assets. On July 24, 2023, ANATEL presented a balance of the estimated economic value based on the determinations of TCU. The value of the balance must be evaluated by Telefonica Brazil within 120 days. However, with the possibility of an agreement between ANATEL and Telef\u00f3nica Brazil on the controversies present in arbitration and migration, ANATEL agreed with the request to suspend the aforementioned period of 120 days and sent to the TCU the Request for a Consensual Solution for the resolution of existing conflicts between ANATEL and Telef\u00f3nica Brazil. The TCU's deliberation on the admissibility of the Request for a Consensual Solution is still ongoing. If the Request is accepted by the TCU, the TCU will establish a Commission that will have a maximum of 120 days to reach a consensus. After that, final approval by the TCU may take up to 90 days. There is a risk of not achieving success in the Consensual Solution and agreement between the parties regarding the migration calculation resulting in the right of Telef\u00f3nica Brazil to hold the STFC concession until December 31, 2025.\n\nIn addition, Resolution 744/2021 of April 8, 2021 (the 'Continuity Regulation') establishes that, at the end of the life of the concession contracts, the transfer of the right of use of shared-use assets will be guaranteed under fair and reasonable economic conditions, in the event that the granting authority or the company that succeeds the provider wishes to make use of these assets to maintain the continuity of the provision of STFC under the public regime. In relation to the process that is being carried out before the TCU, the technical area of the Court proposed the revision of the Continuity Regulation's terms so that it provides for the reversion, to the concessionaires, of the assets used in the provision of STFC. This proposal is still subject to deliberation by the Plenary of the TCU. Nevertheless, the TCU minister ordered the suspension of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe process. ANATEL agreed to extend the currently existing 850MHz band authorizations until November 2028, and the 900/1800 MHz in Minas Gerais (except sector 3) until December 2032, provided the relevant legal and regulatory requirements were met. Additionally, pursuant to Resolution n\u00b0 757/2022, ANATEL intends to carry out, respectively, a refarming action consisting of the promotion of changes in the channel arrangements of the 850 MHz (2028) and 900/1800 MHz (2032) subbands.  Certain specific requirements imposed for these renewals, including those related to the valuation criteria and obligations, are still under review by the TCU.\n\nIn Peru, an arbitration process was started by Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa, to challenge the decision adopted by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications ('MTC'), denying the renewal of concessions for the provision of fixed-line services, valid until 2027, which ended with a favorable award for Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa. The award recognizes that the methodology applied to assess compliance with the concession obligations in the concession renewal process was not in accordance with the provisions of the concession contract. The MTC, following this award, has initiated a new evaluation of our request of renewal of these concessions for the period 2027-2032. In any case, Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa S.A.A. holds other concessions for the provision of fixed-line services that allow it to provide these services beyond 2027. The renewal of the 1900 MHz band in all of Peru, except for Lima and Callao, which expired in 2018, and of other licenses to offer telecommunications services were requested by the Group and a decision by the MTC is still pending. Nevertheless, these concessions are valid while the procedures are in progress.\n\nIn Colombia, on June 1, 2023, Telefonica Colombia submitted a renewal request for 30 MHz of spectrum in the AWS band that expired in December 2023. Additionally, in September 2023, the company has initiated the licenses renewal process of 25 MHz in the 850 MHz band and 15 MHz licenses in the 1900 MHz band that will expire in March 2024. Regulation in Colombia allows for the usage of spectrum without any restrictions until the final conditions for renewal are agreed.\n\nIn Argentina, in connection with the Decree of Necessity and Urgency 690/2020 ('DNU 690/2020'), Telef\u00f3nica de Argentina, S.A. and Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles Argentina, S.A. (collectively, 'Telef\u00f3nica Argentina') filed a lawsuit against the Argentine State, in relation to a series of contracts for licenses to provide services and spectrum use authorizations entered into between Telef\u00f3nica Argentina and the Argentine State, including the licenses resulting from the 2014 spectrum auction. These contracts and their regulatory framework stated that the services provided by Telef\u00f3nica Argentina were private and prices would be freely set by Telef\u00f3nica Argentina. However, DNU 690/2020, by providing that the services will be 'public services' and that prices will be regulated by the Argentine State, substantially modified the legal",

The lawsuit was rejected in September 2021 and Telef\u00f3nica Argentina appealed this decision. On December 17, 2021, the first instance ruling was revoked and the application of articles 1\u00ba, 2\u00ba, 3\u00ba, 5\u00ba and 6\u00ba of DNU 690/2020 and Resolutions 1666/2020, 204/2021 and 1467/2020 (relating to the control of tariffs and the universal basic service) was suspended for six months or until the final decision was adopted. On June 10, 2022, the Federal Contentious Administrative Court extended the precautionary suspension of the effects of DNU 690/2020 for an additional six months in Telef\u00f3nica's favor. On December 27, 2022, the Federal Contentious Administrative Court extended the precautionary suspension of the effects of DNU 690/2020 for another six months in Telef\u00f3nica's favor. In August 2023, the precautionary measure was further extended for six months. During any such suspension, Telef\u00f3nica Argentina will not be subject to the provisions contained in the DNU 690/2020 in relation to price and public service regulations.\n\nIn Ecuador, a concession contract that authorizes the provision of telecommunication services by Telef\u00f3nica and includes the spectrum licenses (25 MHz in the 850 MHz band and 60 MHz in the 1900 MHz band), which was valid until November 2023, was extended for an additional 10 months under the same conditions as the original contract through an addendum. The renewal negotiation is ongoing to extend the licenses for a longer period, but at the end of 2023, the renewal negotiation process was again suspended by the Telecommunications Regulation and Control Agency (ARCOTEL) for up to 120 days.\n\nIn relation to 5G, in Europe (Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom) Telef\u00f3nica (and VMO2 in the case of United Kingdom) is deploying 5G in the frequency bands identified as \"pioneering\" by the European Commission (3.5 GHz and 700 MHz) acquired in recent years. Additionally, technological migration to 5G is being carried out in the traditional 2G/3G/4G bands using Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) technology to make the use of the spectrum more efficient, based on user demand. In Chile and Brazil, Telef\u00f3nica is offering 5G services using spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band. In Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia there were 5G spectrum auctions in 2023. In Uruguay, an auction was held in May 2023 and Telef\u00f3nica Uruguay acquired 100 MHz of spectrum, with Telef\u00f3nica having initiated the provision of 5G services. In Colombia the auction of 5G spectrum took place on December 20, 2023 and Telefonica acquired, through a Temporary Union with Tigo (Colombia M\u00f3vil S.A. E.S.P.), a block of 80 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5GHz band. In Argentina, in October 2023 there was an auction of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band and Telef\u00f3nica Argentina acquired 50MHz of spectrum.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2023, the Group's consolidated investment in spectrum acquisitions and renewals amounted to 183 million euros, mainly due to the acquisition of spectrum in Argentina (173 million euros in 2022, mainly due to the acquisition of spectrum in Colombia). In the event that the licenses mentioned above are renewed or new spectrum is acquired, it would involve additional investments by Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nFurther information on certain key regulatory matters affecting the Telef\u00f3nica Group and the concessions and licenses of the Telef\u00f3nica Group can be found in Appendix VI of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica could be affected by disruptions in the supply chain or international trade restrictions, or by the dependency on its suppliers.\n\nThe existence of critical suppliers in the supply chain, especially in areas such as network infrastructure, information systems or handsets with a high concentration in a small number of suppliers, poses risks that may affect Telef\u00f3nica's operations. In the event that a participant in the supply chain engages in practices that do not meet acceptable standards or does not meet Telef\u00f3nica's performance expectations (including delays in the completion of projects or deliveries, poor-quality execution, cost deviations, reduced output due to the suppliers own stock shortfalls, or inappropriate practices), this may harm Telef\u00f3nica's reputation, or otherwise adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Further, in certain countries, Telef\u00f3nica may be exposed to labor contingencies in connection with the employees of such suppliers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group depended on three handset suppliers (none of them located in China) and seven network infrastructure suppliers (two of them located in China), which, together, accounted for 86% and 80%, respectively, of the aggregate value of contracts awarded in 2023 to handset suppliers and network infrastructure suppliers, respectively. One of the handset suppliers (not located in China) represented 48% of the aggregate value of contracts awarded in 2023 to handset suppliers. As of December 31, 2023, the Telef\u00f3nica Group had 120 information system (\"IT\") providers that accounted for 80% of the total amount of IT purchase awards made in 2023, five of them representing 25% of purchases in that area.\n\nIf suppliers cannot supply their products to the Telef\u00f3nica Group within the agreed deadlines or such products and services do not meet the Group's requirements, this could hinder the deployment and expansion plans of the network. This could in certain cases affect Telef\u00f3nica's compliance with the terms and conditions of the licenses under which it operates, or otherwise adversely affect the business and operating results of the Telef\u00f3nica Group.",

During 2021, 2022 and 2023 a specific monitoring has been carried out and action plans have been developed by the Group with respect to the supply chain challenges resulting from the armed conflict in Ukraine as well as the potential discontinuation of use of some suppliers as a result of tensions between the United States and China. While Telef\u00f3nica's supply chain has been generally resilient in recent years, despite various stresses affecting the semiconductor industry and raw materials, this may change in the future.\n\nThe imposition of trade restrictions and any disruptions in the supply chain, such as those related to international transport, could result in higher costs and lower margins or affect the ability of the Telef\u00f3nica Group to offer its products and services and could adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nFurther, in its sale of digital services, the Telef\u00f3nica Group regularly integrates the digital services it offers with thirdparty technologies. Similar to more traditional supplier relationships, these integrations subject the Telef\u00f3nica Group to the risks of performance failures by these third parties and the cost of continuously monitoring these strategic partners to ensure they maintain appropriate levels of accreditation and that the technologies they provide remain secure and up to date. Any such performance failure by the third parties or the technologies they provide could negatively impact the digital services offered by the Telef\u00f3nica Group, and the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be adversely affected as a result.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica could be affected by the global technology talent shortage and the need for new skills in the workforce due to rapid technological changes, which may limit the Group's competitiveness.\n\nThe changing need for new skills in the workforce due to ongoing technological disruptions and the shortage of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntechnology talent in the marketplace pose significant risks that may affect the Group's competitiveness.\n\nThe successful execution of Telef\u00f3nica's strategic plan and our ability to compete effectively now and in the future depend to a large extent on the company's key talent, as well as on a highly skilled workforce. Experienced profiles in the technology sector are in high demand and competition for talent is fierce worldwide. A lack of talent and the necessary skills in the Group can slow down innovation and adaptation to rapid changes in the sector, impacting business opportunities and the quality of services provided.\n\nWhile we take various steps to manage these risks, including by fostering a culture of continuous learning, though ambitious employee training and reskilling programs, motivating and seeking to retain the Group's key talent and by redefining our corporate culture to ensure the company's long-term growth and sustainability, there can be no assurance that such steps will be sufficient.\n\nIf the Group fails to attract and retain technology talent, this could negatively affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica operates in a sector characterized by rapid technological changes and it may not be able to anticipate or adapt to such changes or select the right investments to make.\n\nThe pace of innovation and Telef\u00f3nica's ability to keep up with its competitors is a critical issue in a sector so affected by technology such as telecommunications. In this sense, significant additional investments will be needed in new high-capacity network infrastructures to enable Telef\u00f3nica to offer the features that new services will demand, through the development of technologies such as 5G or fiber.\n\nNew products and technologies are constantly emerging that can render products and services offered by the Telef\u00f3nica Group, as well as its technology, obsolete. In addition, the explosion of the digital market and the entrance of new players in the communications market, such as mobile network virtual operators (\"MNVOs\"), internet companies, technology companies or device manufacturers, could result in a loss of value for certain of the Group's assets, affect the generation of revenues, or otherwise cause Telef\u00f3nica to have to update its business model. In this respect, revenues from traditional voice businesses have been shrinking in recent years, while revenues from connectivity services (e.g., fixed and mobile internet) are increasing. To diversify revenue sources, Telef\u00f3nica offers new digital services such as Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, big data, Artificial Intelligence and cloud services among others. Although these services still have a lower weight in Telef\u00f3nica's total revenues, the related revenues grew in double digits in 2023. Additionally, the world of telecommunications is",

This type of network can be used by programmers in a completely new and different way than it had been in the past. As a first big step, the GSMA is leading the Open Gateway initiative for the standardized exposure of APIs to developers. This is a totally new market in which telecommunications companies must be able to develop not only attractive services but new skills in order to be successful.\n\nOne of the technologies currently being developed by telecommunications operators, including Telef\u00f3nica (in Spain and Latin America), is the new FTTx type networks which allow the offering of broadband accesses over fiber optics with high performance. However, the deployment of such networks, in which the copper of the access loop is totally or partially replaced by fiber, requires high levels of investment. In Spain, Telef\u00f3nica plans to switch off all copper access loops by April 2024. As of December 31, 2023, in Spain, fiber coverage reached 29.3 million premises. There is a growing demand for the services that these new networks can offer to the end customer. However, the high levels of investment required by these networks result in the need to continuously consider the expected return on investment. Telef\u00f3nica is constantly looking for co-investments through Telef\u00f3nica Infra.\n\nIn addition, the ability of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's IT systems (operational and backup) to adequately support and evolve to respond to Telef\u00f3nica's operating requirements is a key factor to consider in the commercial development, customer satisfaction and business efficiency of the Telef\u00f3nica Group. While automation and other digital processes may lead to significant cost savings and efficiency gains, there are also significant risks associated with such transformation processes. Any failure by the Telef\u00f3nica Group to develop or implement IT systems that adequately support and respond to the Group's evolving operating requirements could have an adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nThe changes outlined above force Telef\u00f3nica to continuously invest in the development of new products, technology and services to continue to compete effectively with current or future competitors. Any such investment may reduce the Group's profit and margins and may not lead to the development or commercialization of successful new products or services. To contextualize the Group's total research and development effort, the total expenditure in  2023 was 741 million euros (656 million euros in 2022), representing 1.8% of the Group's revenues (1.6% in 2022). These figures have been calculated using the guidelines established in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') manual. Telef\u00f3nica's investment in CapEx in 2023 was 5,579 million euros (5,819 million euros in 2022).\n\nIf Telef\u00f3nica is not able to anticipate and adapt to the technological changes and trends in the sector, or to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproperly select the investments to be made, this could negatively affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## The Telef\u00f3nica Group's strategy, which is focused on driving new digital businesses and providing data-based services, involves exposure to risks and uncertainties arising from data privacy regulation.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group's commercial portfolio includes products and/or services  whose provision involves the processing of large amounts of information and data. This entails an enormous responsibility, while at the same time increasing the challenges related to compliance with strong and growing privacy and data protection regulations throughout the Telef\u00f3nica Group's footprint, which may stifle the technological innovation that characterizes it and to which the Group is committed. Similarly, the Group's efforts to promote innovation may result in increased compliance risks and, where applicable, costs.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of April 2016, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (\"GDPR\"), which is considered by the Group as a common standard of compliance in all its operations, even beyond the European Union. Additionally, the European Union has initiated a data legislative strategy that seeks to make the EU a leading space for the datadriven society, allowing data to flow freely throughout the territory and between different sectors. As a result, it is expected that new regulatory obligations will be imposed on operators.\n\nIn addition, progress continues to be made on the proposal for a future European regulation concerning the respect for privacy and protection of personal data in electronic communications ('e-Privacy Regulation'), which would repeal Directive 2002/58/EC. If approved, this proposal could establish additional and more restrictive rules than those established in the GDPR, with the consequent increase in the risks and costs that this could entail for Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nMoreover, considering that the Telef\u00f3nica Group operates its business on a global scale, it frequently carries out international data transfers concerning its customers, users, suppliers, employees and other data subjects to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that have not been declared to have an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission, either directly or through third parties. In this context, it is particularly relevant to have the necessary legal and technical controls and mechanisms in place to ensure that such international data transfers are carried out in accordance with the GDPR, in an environment marked by uncertainty on this issue as to the most adequate and effective measures to mitigate such risks.",

The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EU to U.S. companies participating in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. This adequacy decision nevertheless remains subject to challenge, and is expected to be challenged, by privacy activists.\n\nIn Latin America, Law No. 13,709 in Brazil imposes standards and obligations similar to those required by the GDPR, including a sanctioning regime which is in force from August 2021, which may increase compliance risks and costs. In addition, in 2022 the Brazilian data protection authority, Autoridade Nacional de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados (ANPD), became an independent agency not linked to the presidency of the Republic, thus providing it with additional autonomy to develop its control and supervision functions.\n\nIn Ecuador, the Organic Law on Data Protection, which is aligned with the principles of the European GDPR, has entered into force (including, since 2023, the sanctioning regime). In addition, Argentina has ratified Convention 108+, which is an international treaty of the Council of Europe which is open to accession by any State outside Europe, and which regulates the protection of the rights of individuals with regard to the automated processing of their data, in a very similar way to the protection granted by virtue of the GDPR.\n\nIn addition, there are projects to reform Law 19.628 on the Protection of Personal Data in Chile, and the Regulations of Law 29.733 in Peru. There are regulatory projects aimed at updating regulations in line with standards similar to the GDPR, which may increase compliance risks and costs. To limit the risks derived from international transfers of personal data among Telef\u00f3nica Group companies, Group companies will adopt Telef\u00f3nica Group's Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which are currently in the process of being approved by the European data protection authorities. However there can be no assurance that such rules will be sufficient to ensure compliance with requirements in every jurisdiction in which the Telef\u00f3nica Group operates.\n\nData privacy protection requires careful design of products and services, as well as robust internal procedures and rules that can be adapted to regulatory changes where necessary, all of which entails compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrisk. Failure to maintain adequate data security and to comply with any relevant legal requirements could result in the imposition of significant penalties, damage to the Group's reputation and the loss of trust of customers and users.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's reputation depends to a large extent on the digital trust it is able to generate among its customers and other  stakeholders.  In  this  regard,  in  addition  to  any reputational  consequences,  in  the  European  Union,  very serious breaches of the GDPR may entail the imposition of  administrative  fines  of  up  to  the  larger  of  20  million euros  or  4%  of  the  infringing  company's  overall  total annual revenue for the previous financial year. Furthermore, once it is approved, the e-Privacy Regulation  may  set  forth  sanctions  for  breaches  of  it similar to those provided for in the GDPR.\n\nAny of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows of the Group.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica may not anticipate or adapt in a timely manner to changing customer demands and/or new ethical or social standards, which could adversely affect Telef\u00f3nica's business and reputation.\n\nTo maintain and improve its position in the market vis-\u00e0vis its competitors, it is vital that Telef\u00f3nica: (i) anticipates and adapts to the evolving needs and demands of its customers, and (ii) avoids commercial or other actions or policies that may generate a negative perception of the Group or the products and services it offers, or that may have or be perceived to have a negative social impact. In addition to harming Telef\u00f3nica's reputation, such actions could also result in fines and sanctions.\n\nIn order to respond to changing customer demands, Telef\u00f3nica needs to adapt both (i) its communication networks and (ii) its offering of digital services.\n\nThe networks, which had historically focused on voice transmission, have evolved into increasingly flexible, dynamic and secure data networks, replacing, for example, old copper telecommunications networks with new technologies such as fiber optics, which facilitate the absorption of the exponential growth in the volume of data demanded by the Group's customers.\n\nIn relation to digital services, customers require an increasingly digital and personalized experience, as well as a continuous evolution of the Group's product and service offering. In this sense, new services such as \"Living Apps\", 'Connected Car', 'Smart Cities', 'Smart Agriculture', 'Smart Metering' and \"Solar 360\" which facilitate certain aspects of the Group's customers' digital lives, are being developed. Furthermore, new solutions for greater automation in commercial services and in the provision of the Group's services are being developed, through new apps and online platforms that facilitate",

In addition, Telef\u00f3nica has launched new customer care applications (My Movistar in Spain, Me Vivo in Brazil, My O2 in the United Kingdom) and developed a virtual assistant, Aura, with the aim of increasing the accessibility of the products and services we offer. However, there can be no assurance that these and other efforts will be successful.\n\nIn the development of all these initiatives it is also necessary to take into account several factors: firstly, there is a growing social and regulatory demand for companies to behave in a socially responsible manner, and, in addition, the Group's customers are increasingly interacting through online communication channels, such as social networks, in which they express this demand. Telef\u00f3nica's ability to attract and retain clients depends on their perceptions regarding the Group's reputation and behavior. The risks associated with potential damage to a brand's reputation have become more relevant, especially due to the impact that the publication of news through social networks can have.\n\nIf Telef\u00f3nica is not able to anticipate or adapt to the evolving needs and demands of its customers or avoid inappropriate actions, its reputation could be adversely affected, or it could otherwise have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows of the Group.\n\n## Operational Risks.\n\n## Information technology is key to the Group's business and is subject to cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe risks derived from cybersecurity are among the Group's most relevant risks due to the importance of information technology to its ability to successfully conduct operations. Despite advances in the modernization of the network and the replacement of legacy systems in need of technological renewal, the Group operates in an environment increasingly prone to cyber-threats and all of its products and services are intrinsically dependent on information technology systems and platforms that are susceptible to cyberattacks. Successful cyberattacks could prevent the effective provision, operation and commercialization of products and services in addition to affecting their use by customers. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to identify and remedy any technical vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the Group's operating processes, as well as to strengthen its capabilities to detect, react and recover from incidents. This includes the need to strengthen security controls in the supply chain, often with a high number of participants spread across different countries, by focusing on the security measures adopted by the Group's providers and other third parties, and, in particular, by ensuring the security of cloud services provided by third parties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTelecommunications companies worldwide face continuously increasing cybersecurity threats as businesses become increasingly digital and dependent on telecommunications, computer networks and cloud computing technologies. As a result of the circumstances brought by the COVID pandemic, remote access and teleworking of employees and collaborators has spread and is now a common practice, increasing the use of cloud services provided by third parties. Thus, the risks associated with their use has increased, forcing companies to review the security controls beyond the perimeter of the corporate network. Likewise, the proliferation of IoT environments makes security management more complicated, given their volume and heterogeneous nature. All of the above, together with the professionalization of cybercriminals and their financing (which facilitates their adoption of emerging technologies and techniques, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence), is leading to an increase in the sophistication of cybercrime and the use of automated attack tactics that reduce the time frame that cyber-defense teams have to protect a company's digital assets. In addition, the Telef\u00f3nica Group is aware of the possible cybersecurity risks arising from the various international conflicts, and is monitoring cyberattacks that may affect our infrastructure, and maintaining contact with national and international organizations to obtain cyberintelligence information, without having so far detected a significant increase in attacks in our perimeter compared to other previous periods, though this may change in the future. Cybersecurity threats may include gaining unauthorized access to the Group's systems or propagating computer viruses or malicious software, to misappropriate sensitive information like customer data or disrupt the Group's operations. In addition, traditional security threats, such as theft of laptop computers, data devices and mobile phones may also affect the Group along with the possibility that the Group's employees or other persons may have access to the Group's systems and leak data and/or take actions that affect the Group's networks or otherwise adversely affect the Group or its ability to adequately process internal information or even result in regulatory penalties.\n\nIn particular, in the past three years, the Group has suffered various types of cybersecurity incidents that have included (i) intrusion attempts (direct or phishing), exploitation of vulnerabilities and corporate credentials being compromised; (ii) Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, using massive volumes of Internet traffic that saturate the service; and (iii) exploitation of vulnerabilities to carry out fraud in respect of services provided by Telef\u00f3nica. To date, none of these cybersecurity incidents have had material consequences for the Telef\u00f3nica Group, but this may change in the future.\n\nAlthough Telef\u00f3nica seeks to manage these risks by adopting technical and organizational measures as defined in its digital security strategy, such as the use of",

Therefore, the Telef\u00f3nica Group has insurance policies in place, which could cover, subject to the policies terms, conditions, exclusions, limits and sublimits of indemnity, and applicable deductibles, certain losses arising out of these types of incidents. To date, the insurance policies in place have covered some incidents of this nature, however due to the potential severity and uncertainty about the evolution of the aforementioned events, these policies may not be sufficient to cover all possible losses arising out of these risks.\n\n## Climate change, natural disasters and other factors beyond the Group's control may result in physical damage to our technical infrastructure that may cause unanticipated network or service interruptions or quality loss or otherwise affect the Group's business.\n\nClimate change, natural disasters and other factors beyond the Group's control, such as system failures, lack of electric supply, network failures, hardware or software failures or the theft of network elements, can damage Telef\u00f3nica's infrastructure and affect the quality of, or cause interruption to, the provision of the services of the Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n\nFurther, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns associated with climate change may increase the energy consumption of telecommunications networks or cause service disruption due to extreme temperature waves, floods or extreme weather events. These changes may cause increases in the price of electricity due to, for example, reduction in hydraulic generation as a result of recurrent droughts. Further, as a result of global commitments to tackle climate change, new carbon dioxide taxes may be imposed and could affect, directly or indirectly, Telef\u00f3nica Group, and may have a negative impact on the Group's operations and results. Telef\u00f3nica analyses these risks in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD').\n\nNetwork or service interruptions or quality loss or climaterelated risks could cause customer dissatisfaction, a reduction in revenues and traffic, the realization of expensive repairs, the imposition of sanctions or other measures by regulatory bodies, and damage to the image and reputation of the Telef\u00f3nica Group, or could otherwise have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows of the Group.\n\n## Financial Risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Worsening of the economic and political environment could negatively affect Telef\u00f3nica's business.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's international presence enables the diversification of its activities across countries and regions, but it exposes Telef\u00f3nica to diverse legislation, as well as to the political and economic environments of the countries in which it operates. Any adverse developments in these countries, such as economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, rapid normalization of monetary policy, exchange rate or sovereign-risk fluctuations, as well as growing geopolitical tensions, may adversely affect Telef\u00f3nica's business, financial position, debt management, cash flows and results of operations and/or the performance of some or all of the Group's financial indicators.\n\nIn recent years, successive shocks have ushered in a period characterized by extraordinary uncertainty and the simultaneous occurrence of multiple negative disruptions. Inflationary pressures arising from bottlenecks associated with the rapid post-pandemic recovery, coupled with increases in commodity prices, led to a robust response from central banks (raising interest rates and withdrawing liquidity from the system) and a significant loss of purchasing power for consumers. Additionally, the recent higher wage demands observed internationally, reflecting both the strength of labor markets, especially those in major developed economies, and the prevalence (though to a lesser extent than in the past) of wage indexation mechanisms, have also contributed to these inflationary pressures.\n\nThere are also doubts about the timing of the conclusion of the inflationary period, as geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas armed conflicts, among others, negatively impact energy prices or maritime transport. Moreover, there is a risk that the decrease in global liquidity and elevated interest rates could generate increased financial volatility, giving rise to new stress episodes, as observed in the United Kingdom, especially if inflation proves to be more persistent than expected. Additionally, premature monetary easing by central banks could lead to resurgent inflation, potentially triggering a new stagflationary period akin to the 1970s.\n\nLooking forward, elements that could worsen the effects of the current situation include the escalation of armed conflicts and potential disruptions to energy and goods supply, as well as possible additional increases in commodity prices. This could result in a potential deanchoring of inflation expectations and higher-thanexpected wage hikes, prolonging and amplifying the inflation-recession scenario. As a consequence of the above, economic growth is expected to remain weak in the short term, with the risk of recession still present in many parts of the world.\n\nSo far, the main European countries where the Group operates have been affected by the ongoing geopolitical",

However, there continues to be a concern in Europe  about energy dependence in the face of potential episodes of gas shortages. Latin America could be affected by lower external demand associated with slower global growth, deteriorating terms of trade and tighter financial conditions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the contribution of each segment to the Telef\u00f3nica Group's total assets was as follows: Telef\u00f3nica Spain 26.0% (25.5% as of December 31, 2022), VMO2 7.5% (9.8% as of December 31, 2022), Telef\u00f3nica Germany 17.8% (17.5% as of December 31, 2022), Telef\u00f3nica Brazil 25.0% (22.7% as of December 31, 2022) and Telef\u00f3nica Hispam 14.4% (14.5% as of December 31, 2022). Part of the Group's assets are located in countries that do not have an investment grade credit rating (in order of importance, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela). Likewise, Venezuela and Argentina are considered countries with hyperinflationary economies in 2023 and 2022.\n\nDuring 2023, the contribution of each segment to the Telef\u00f3nica Group's revenues was as follows (does not include VMO2 that is recorded by the equity method and therefore does not contribute to the consolidated revenues): Telef\u00f3nica Spain 31.1% (31.2% in 2022), Telef\u00f3nica Germany 21.2% (20.6% in 2022), Telef\u00f3nica Brazil 23.7% (22.2% in 2022) and Telef\u00f3nica Hispam 20.6% (22.9% in 2022).\n\nThe main risks by geography are detailed below:\n\nIn Europe, there are several economic and political risks. Firstly, the evolution of armed conflicts poses a threat to growth and inflation prospects. Any worsening in the supply of gas, oil, food, or other goods due to disruptions in the transportation chain would negatively impact their prices, with a consequent effect on the disposable income of both households and businesses. In the medium term, this could result in wage increases, a persistent rise in inflation, and tighter monetary policy. Any of the above could have a negative impact on the cost of financing for the private sector, including Telef\u00f3nica, and could trigger episodes of financial stress.\n\nIn addition, there is also a risk of financial fragmentation in the transmission of monetary policy in the eurozone, meaning that interest rates may react differently in different countries within the eurozone, leading to differences in yields on bonds issued by peripheral countries (such as Spain) and those issued by core countries, making it challenging for the former to access credit. Lastly, Europe faces two significant long-term risks. First, a risk that Europe may fall behind in the global technological race in particular because of its dependence on several critical raw materials, indispensable for key sectors, that must be imported from other regions. Second, demographic factors such as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndeclining birth rates and population aging may have a negative impact on the region's labor force and long-term growth prospects.\n\nRegarding political risk, the 2024 European Parliament election may deepen political fragmentation and result in a reduced representation of moderate positions in favor of extreme options, potentially weakening governance and hindering the implementation of the ongoing agenda with respect to fiscal and economic matters, climate and energy policy and other critical aspects of state governance.\n\n- \u00b7 Spain : there are several local sources of risks. One of them stems from the risk that high commodity prices and/or the emergence of wage pressures could prolong the inflationary episode with a deeper impact on household income. Secondly, and although the disbursement of Next Generation European Funds (NGEU) appears to be gaining traction, further delays or even designing flaws could limit their final impact on GDP growth and employment. In addition, as one of the most open countries in the world from a commercial point of view, being among the top ten countries in respect of capital outflows and inflows globally, Spain could be negatively impacted by the rise of protectionism and trade restrictions. Lastly, the impact of rising interest rates could be a source of financial stress due to high public indebtedness and lead to a possible correction in the real estate market. In the long term, the challenge is to increase potential growth through productivity and ensure the sustainability of public debt.\n- \u00b7 Germany : the risk of energy shortages has diminished in recent months due to Europe's response in terms  of diversification of energy sources and the rapid construction of regasification plants in the country. However, it is  possible that problems with energy supply may arise again. Gas flows (from Russia via Ukraine) could be lower than expected, consumption could be higher due, for example, to an unusually cold winter, or competition for gas from other countries could increase. On the other hand, there is concern that higher-than-expected wage growth and/or higher input costs could lead to a stronger and longer inflationary cycle. As for the medium to long term, there is a risk that a potential escalation of geopolitical tensions could reduce international trade, with a consequent impact on the country's potential growth, which is dependent on exports. In addition, long-term challenges remain, such as the ageing of the population.\n- \u00b7 United Kingdom : a slower disinflationary process than previously expected could weigh on consumption and further depress economic growth. In particular, there is a concern that currently dynamic wage growth could lead to a further increase in the prices of goods and services, preventing inflation rates from normalizing as quickly as anticipated. On the other hand, although the UK economy has few direct trade links with Russia and",

Finally, the formal exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union on December 31, 2020 (Brexit) has created new barriers to trade in goods and services, mobility and cross-border exchanges, which will continue to entail an economic adjustment in the medium term.\n\nIn Latin America, the exchange rate risk is currently considered moderate by the Telef\u00f3nica Group, except in Argentina and Venezuela, but may increase in the future. The end of electoral events and rapid central bank actions to contain inflation may, at least partially, limit the impact of external risks (global trade tensions, abrupt movements in commodity prices, concerns about global growth, tightening U.S. monetary policy and financial imbalances in China) and internal risks (managing the monetary normalization and the possible fiscal deterioration) but there is no assurance that this will be the case.\n\n- \u00b7 Brazil : fiscal sustainability and increased economic intervention remain the main domestic risk, but it has recently decreased. The new administration has demonstrated its commitment to fiscal sustainability by announcing a new fiscal framework to replace the previous spending cap rule. Additionally, the Congress has also voted favorably on the tax reform aimed at simplifying the indirect tax system and promoting stronger and sustainable economic growth. So far, the economic measures announced by the new administration have helped alleviate uncertainty around economic policies, resulting in an upward revision of Brazil's credit rating outlook by S&P. Risks related to inflation and monetary policy have also decreased with the approval and maintenance of the inflation target at low levels.\n- \u00b7 Argentina : macroeconomic and exchange rate risks remain high. The main internal challenges include achieving the political and social consensus necessary to reduce the public deficit and rebuild international reserves in a context of high inflation, which jeopardizes the achievement of the new administration's objectives. On the external front, a global slowdown leading to reduced demand for exported products and lower prices would result in decreased foreign currency inflows, increasing vulnerability to volatility in international financial markets. Finally, the application of price control measures and the still-existing exchange restrictions could adversely affect Telef\u00f3nica's profitability.\n- \u00b7 Chile, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador : these countries are exposed not only to changes in the global economy, given their vulnerability and exposure to changes in commodity prices, but also to tightening of global financial conditions. On the domestic side, existing political instability and the possibility of further social unrest and the resurgence of populism could have a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnegative impact in both the short and medium term. In this regard, measures that result in excessive growth in public spending that jeopardize fiscal balance could have a negative impact on sovereign credit ratings, further deteriorating local financing conditions. Inflation is becoming more persistent than expected, which could limit central banks' ability to respond to an abrupt drop in activity levels and could also increase the risk of financial instability. Political uncertainty has decreased in Chile, following the  rejection of the new proposed Constitution in December 2023, but the maintenance of the former status quo could give rise to new social demands. In Colombia, the structural reforms promoted by Colombia's government are currently expected to be more market friendly due to the weakening of the government coalition. In Peru, the government succeeded in reducing the social protests against the installation of the new administration, although it remains politically weak. In Ecuador, the new government is dealing with a turbulent political situation and internal violence, marked by an increase in criminality.\n\nAs discussed above, the countries where the Group operates are generally facing significant economic uncertainties and, in some cases, political uncertainties. The worsening of the economic and political environment in any of the countries where Telef\u00f3nica operates may materially adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## The Group has and in the future could experience impairment of goodwill, investments accounted for by the equity method, deferred tax assets or other assets.\n\nIn accordance with current accounting standards, the Telef\u00f3nica Group reviews on an annual basis, or more frequently when the circumstances require it, the need to introduce changes to the book value of its goodwill (which as of December 31, 2023, represented 17.9% of the Group's total assets), deferred tax assets (which as of December 31, 2023, represented 6.0% of the Group's total assets) or other assets, such as intangible assets (which represented 10.9% of the Group's total assets as of December 31, 2023), and property, plant and equipment (which represented 22.0% of the Group's total assets as of December 31, 2023).  In the case of goodwill, the potential loss of value is determined by the analysis of the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill is allocated at the time it is originated, and such calculation requires significant assumptions and judgment. In 2023 impairment losses in the goodwill of Telef\u00f3nica Ecuador were recognized for a total of 58 million euros (impairment losses in other assets of Telef\u00f3nica Argentina were recognized for a total of 77 million euros in 2022 and impairment losses in the goodwill of Telef\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa were recognized for a total of 393 million euros in 2021).

The recoverability of deferred tax assets depends on the Group's ability to generate taxable income over the period for which the deferred tax assets remain deductible. If Telef\u00f3nica believes it is unable to utilize its deferred tax assets during the applicable period, it may be required to record an impairment against them resulting in a non-cash charge on the income statement. By way of example, in 2021 deferred tax assets corresponding to the tax Group in Spain amounting to 294 million euros were derecognized.\n\nFurther impairments of goodwill, deferred tax assets or other assets may occur in the future which may materially adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## The Group faces risks relating to its levels of financial indebtedness, the Group's ability to finance itself, and its ability to carry out its business plan.\n\nThe operation, expansion and improvement of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's networks, the development and distribution of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's services and products, the implementation of Telef\u00f3nica's strategic plan and the development of new technologies, the renewal of licenses and the expansion of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's business in countries where it operates, may require a substantial amount of financing.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group is a relevant and frequent issuer of debt in the capital markets. As of December 31, 2023, the Group's gross financial debt amounted to 37,061 million euros (39,079 million euros as of December 31, 2022), and the Group's net financial debt amounted to 27,349 million euros (26,687 million euros as of December 31, 2022). As of December 31, 2023, the average maturity of the debt was 11.6 years (13.1 years as of December 31, 2022), including undrawn committed credit facilities.\n\nA decrease in the liquidity of Telef\u00f3nica, or a difficulty in refinancing maturing debt or raising new funds as debt or equity could force Telef\u00f3nica to use resources allocated to investments or other commitments to pay its financial debt, which could have a negative effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nFunding could be more difficult and costly to obtain in the event of a deterioration of conditions in the international or local financial markets due, for example, to monetary policies set by central banks, including increases in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninterest rates and/or decreases in the supply of credit, increasing global political and commercial uncertainty and oil price instability, or if there is an eventual deterioration in the solvency or operating performance of Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group's gross financial debt scheduled to mature in 2024 amounted to 3,701 million euros, and gross financial debt scheduled to mature in 2025 amounted to 3,900 million euros.\n\nIn accordance with its liquidity policy, Telef\u00f3nica has covered its gross debt maturities for the next 12 months with cash and credit lines available as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Telef\u00f3nica Group had undrawn committed credit facilities arranged with banks for an amount of 11,315 million euros (11,148 million euros of which were due to expire in more than 12 months). Liquidity could be affected if market conditions make it difficult to renew undrawn credit lines. As of December 31, 2023, 1.5% of the aggregate undrawn amount under credit lines was scheduled to expire prior to December 31, 2024.\n\nIn addition, given the interrelation between economic growth and financial stability, the materialization of any of the economic, political and exchange rate risks referred to above could adversely impact the availability and cost of Telef\u00f3nica's financing and its liquidity strategy. This in turn could have a negative effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nFinally, any downgrade in the Group's credit ratings may lead to an increase in the Group's borrowing costs and could also limit its ability to access credit markets.\n\n## The Group's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if it does not effectively manage its exposure to interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nInterest rate risk arises primarily in connection with changes in interest rates affecting: (i) financial expenses on floating-rate debt (or short-term debt likely to be renewed); (ii) the value of long-term liabilities at fixed interest rates; and (iii) financial expenses and principal payments of inflation-linked financial instruments, considering interest rate risk as the impact of changes in inflation rates.\n\nIn nominal terms, as of December 31, 2023, 89% of the Group's net financial debt had its interest rate set at fixed interest rates for periods of more than one year. The effective cost of debt related interest payments for the last 12 months excluding leases was 3.80% as of December 31, 2023 compared to 3.96% as of December 31, 2022. To illustrate the sensitivity of financial expenses to variations in short-term interest rates as of December 31, 2023: (i) a 100 basis points increase in interest rates in all currencies in which Telef\u00f3nica had a financial position",

For the preparation of these calculations, a constant position equivalent to the position at that date is assumed of net financial debt.\n\nExchange rate risk arises primarily from: (i) Telef\u00f3nica's international presence, through its investments and businesses in countries that use currencies other than the euro (primarily in Latin America and the United Kingdom); (ii) debt denominated in currencies other than that of the country where the business is conducted or the home country of the company incurring such debt; and (iii) trade receivables or payables in a foreign currency to the currency of the company with which the transaction was registered. According to the Group's calculations, the impact on results, and specifically on net exchange differences, due to a 10% depreciation of Latin American currencies against the U.S. dollar and a 10% depreciation of the rest of the currencies to which the Group is most exposed, against the euro would result in exchange gains of 17 million euros as of December 31, 2023 and a 10% appreciation of Latin American currencies against the U.S. dollar and a 10% appreciation of the rest of the currencies to which the Group is most exposed, would result in exchange losses of 17 million euros as of December 31, 2023. These calculations have been made assuming a constant currency position with an impact on profit or loss as of December 31, 2023 taking into account derivative instruments in place.\n\nIn 2023, the evolution of exchange rates (without considering the effects of hyperinflationary countries) had a small positive impact on the Group's results, increasing the year-on-year growth of the Group's consolidated revenues by an estimated 0.2 percentage points, and not impacting OIBDA (positive impact of 4.5 percentage points and 3.0 percentage points, respectively, in 2022, mainly due to the evolution of the Brazilian real). Furthermore, translation differences in 2023 had a positive impact on the Group's equity of 37 million euros (1,169 million euros in 2022). If the impacts of hyperinflationary countries were considered, the adverse impact of variations in currencies on our consolidated results, statement of financial position and statement of cash flows would have been higher.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group uses a variety of strategies to manage this risk including, among others, the use of financial derivatives, which are also exposed to risk, including counterparty risk. The Group's risk management strategies may be ineffective, which could adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. If the Group does not effectively manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates, it may adversely affect its\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## Legal and Compliance Risks.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica and Telef\u00f3nica Group companies are party to lawsuits, antitrust, tax claims and other legal proceedings.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica and Telef\u00f3nica Group companies operate in highly regulated sectors and are and may in the future be party to lawsuits, tax claims, antitrust and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of their businesses, the outcome of which is unpredictable.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group is subject to regular reviews, tests and audits by tax authorities regarding taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates and is a party and may be a party to certain judicial tax proceedings. In particular, the Telef\u00f3nica Group is currently party to certain tax and regulatory proceedings in Brazil, primarily relating to the ICMS (a Brazilian tax on telecommunication services) and the corporate tax.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica Brazil maintained provisions for tax contingencies amounting to 515 million euros and provisions for regulatory contingencies amounting to 329 million euros as of December 31, 2023. In addition, Telef\u00f3nica Brazil faces possible tax and regulatory contingencies for which no provisions are made. As of December 31, 2023, the Telef\u00f3nica Group maintained contingent liabilities related to income tax, other taxes and regulatory proceedings in Brazil amounting to 5,678 million euros, 6,909 million euros and 1,264 million euros, respectively  (see Note 24c. Other Provisions and Note 25-Tax Litigation in Telef\u00f3nica Brazil, to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Group makes estimates for its tax liabilities that the Group considers reasonable, but if a tax authority disagrees, the Group could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no guarantee that any payments related to such contingencies or in excess of our estimates will not have a significant adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In addition to the most significant litigation indicated above, further details on these matters are provided in Notes 25 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The details of the provisions for litigation, tax sanctions and claims can be found in Note 24 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica Group is also party to certain litigation in Peru concerning certain previous years' income taxes in respect of which Telef\u00f3nica has been notified that the judicial resolutions which resolve the contentious administrative processes are unfavorable to the Group and will require it to pay taxes related to prior years. At the end of the relevant proceedings, the Tax Administration, through an administrative act, will determine the amount of the payment obligation. The estimated impact of the",

Further, expectations and requirements may differ from region to region, may be based on diverging calculation or other criteria and may experience material changes as they still are at their emerging phase.\n\nFurther, the Telef\u00f3nica Group's disclosure of information on its ESG objectives and initiatives in its public reports and other communications (including its CO 2 emission reduction targets) subjects it to the risk that it will fail to achieve these objectives and initiatives.\n\nAlthough the Telef\u00f3nica Group is working to comply with new ESG reporting requirements, to achieve its objectives, and to meet the expectations of its stakeholders in these matters, if the Company is unable to meet these expectations, fails to adequately address ESG matters or fails to achieve the reported objectives (including its CO 2 emission reduction targets), the Telef\u00f3nica Group's reputation, its business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## The Telef\u00f3nica Group is exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group is required to comply with the anticorruption laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where it conducts operations around the world, including in certain circumstances with laws and regulations having extraterritorial effect such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. The anti-corruption laws generally prohibit, among other conduct, providing anything of value to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nadvantage or failing to keep accurate books and records and properly account for transactions.\n\nIn this sense, due to the nature of its activities, the Telef\u00f3nica Group is increasingly exposed to this risk, which increases the likelihood of occurrence. In particular, it is worth noting the continuous interaction with officials and public administrations in several areas, including the institutional and regulatory fronts (as the Telef\u00f3nica Group carries out a regulated activity in different jurisdictions), the operational front (in the deployment of its network, the Telef\u00f3nica Group is subject to obtaining multiple activity permits) and the commercial front (the Telef\u00f3nica Group provides services directly and indirectly to public administrations). Moreover, Telef\u00f3nica is a multinational group subject to the authority of different regulators and compliance with various regulations, which may be domestic or extraterritorial in scope, civil or criminal, and which may lead to overlapping authority in certain cases. Therefore, it is very difficult to quantify the possible impact of any breach, bearing in mind that such quantification must consider not only the economic amount of sanctions, but also the potential negative impact on the business, reputation and/or brand, or the ability to contract with public administrations.\n\nAdditionally, the Telef\u00f3nica Group's operations may be subject to, or otherwise affected by, economic sanctions programs and other forms of trade restrictions ('sanctions') including those administered by the United Nations, the European Union, the United States, including by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United Kingdom. The sanctions regulations restrict the Group's business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, territories, individuals and entities and may impose certain trade restrictions, among others, export and/or import trade restrictions to certain good and services. In this context, the provision of services by a multinational telecommunications group, such as the Telef\u00f3nica Group, directly and indirectly, and in multiple countries, requires the application of a high degree of diligence to prevent the contravention of sanctions (which take various forms, including economic sanctions programs applicable to countries, territories, lists of entities and persons sanctioned or certain trade restrictions). Given the nature of its activity, the Telef\u00f3nica Group's exposure to these sanctions is particularly noteworthy.\n\nAlthough the Group has internal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the above mentioned applicable anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be sufficient or that the Group's employees, directors, officers, partners, agents and service providers will not take actions in violation of the Group's policies and procedures (or, otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations) for which the Group, its subsidiaries or they may be ultimately held responsible.

Corporate Governance System\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's basic corporate governance system principles are set forth in its Bylaws, in the Regulations of its Board of Directors, in the Regulations for the General Shareholders' Meeting, in the Regulations for the Audit and Control Committee, in the Regulations for the  Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, in the Internal Code of Conduct for Securities Markets Issues,  and in certain Policies relating to this matter; particularly noteworthy, among others, are the Diversity Policy in relation to the Board of Directors and the Selection of Board Members, the Disclosure, Contact and Engagement Policy for Shareholders, Institutional Investors and Proxy Advisors, the Remuneration Policy of the Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. and the Responsible Business Policy. These regulations determine the action principles of the Board of Directors, govern its organization and operation and set the rules of conduct of its members.\n\nThe principles underlying Telef\u00f3nica's corporate governance system are the following:\n\n- a. the maximization of the value of the Company in the interest of the shareholders,\n- b. the essential role of the Board of Directors in the supervision of the management of the Company, and\n- c. transparency as regards information in relations with its stakeholders including employees, shareholders, investors and customers, among others.\n\nIn this regard, the Board of Directors will take the necessary measures to ensure: (i) that the Company's management team pursues the creation of value for the shareholders, (ii) that such management team is under its actual supervision, (iii) that no person or small group of persons holds a decision-making power that is not subject to checks and balances or controls, and (iv) that any shareholder receives privileged treatment compared to the others.\n\n## 4.1.2. Continuous improvement of Corporate Governance\n\nTelef\u00f3nica undertakes the firm commitment to continuously improve its corporate governance framework by expanding, enhancing and consolidating best practices in this subject.\n\nIn relation to the above, the Company carries out an ongoing analysis and review of its corporate governance structures and the degree of compliance with the main recommendations existing in the subject of good governance, always in consideration of possible initiatives to make short and medium term improvements and seeking out the formula for governance that best defends the interests of its shareholders and sustainable value creation.\n\nIn this context, as it has done in previous financial years, Telef\u00f3nica has continued to improve and strengthen its corporate governance framework in 2023 by adopting, among other, the following decisions and measures:\n\n- i)  the  renewal  and  reorganisation  of  the  Board  of Directors and its Committees, which has allowed the increase  of  the  number  of  Independent  Directors, achieving  a  more  balanced  and  diverse  composition with  more  female  Directors,  reducing  the  number  of Board  Committees  and  improving  the  distribution  of competencies among them.\n\nIn particular, following the vacancies that arose on the Board as a result of the voluntary resignation tendered by Mr. Peter Erskine (Director Other External) and Mr. Juan  Ignacio  Cirac  Sasturain  (Independent  Director), for  personal  reasons  and  in  order  to  facilitate  the renewal of the Company's governing body, the Board of  Directors,  at  the  proposal  of  the  Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, appointed Ms. Solange Sobral Targa and Mr. Alejandro Reynal Ample by co-option as Directors of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.,  with  the  category  of  Independent Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Likewise, the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee verified and assessed that the new Directors did not fall under any of the circumstances envisaged in article 529 duodecies.4 of the Capital Companies Act, and that they could perform their duties without being conditioned by relations with the Company or its Group, its Significant Shareholders or its Executives, and could therefore hold the category of Independent Directors.\n\nMs. Solange Sobral Targa holds a degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Sao Carlos (Brasil), and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the State University of Campinas (Brasil).\n\nMs. Sobral also has extensive professional experience, having held positions in digital business development and leadership of multidisciplinary teams, currently acting as a digital transformation agent.\n\nMs. Sobral is Vice-Chairwoman  of CI&T, a leading information technology and software development",

Ownership Structure\n\nGRI 2-1\n\n## 4.2.1. Share Capital\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the share capital of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. was set at 5,750,458,145 euros and is divided into 5,750,458,145 common shares, of a single series and with a par value of 1 euro each, fully paid in. All the shares of the Company have the same characteristics and carry the same rights and obligations.\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the share capital reduction deed was registered, for an amount of 24,779,409 euros, in which 24,779,409 own shares that were in treasury stock were redeemed, with a nominal value of 1 euro each. Following the share capital reduction, the share capital was set at 5,750,458,145 euros.\n\nThe shares of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. are represented by book entries that are listed on the Spanish Electronic Market (within the selective Ibex 35 index) and on the four Spanish Stock Exchanges (Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Bilbao), as well as on the New York and Lima Stock Exchanges (on these latter two Exchanges through American Depositary Shares (ADSs), with each ADS representing one share of the Company).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total number of shareholders of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. amounted to 1.1 million, and the distribution by investors categories was as follows:\n\n| Investor Category      | % Share Capital   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Domestic Institutional | 21 %              |\n| Foreign Institutional  | 49 %              |\n| Retail                 | 30 %              |\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nAt its meeting held on May 31, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the General Framework for Discretionary Treasury Shares Operations of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., as provided in articles 16.2 and 17.6 of Telef\u00f3nica's Internal Rules of Conduct in Matters Relating to the Securities Markets (the 'IRC').\n\nSuch General Framework sets forth the discretionary action principles for the management of treasury shares, observing and respecting the provisions of the abovementioned Rules, particularly as regards restrictions on price, volume and timing of the transactions.\n\nAs of the closing date of the 2023 fiscal year, the number of direct shares held as treasury shares stood at 111,099,480 (1.93% of the share capital).\n\nAs for the changes in treasury shares that occurred during the fiscal year, see Note 17 (Equity) of the Consolidated Accounts of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. for fiscal year 2023.\n\nFurthermore, and in connection with the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the shareholders at the General Shareholders' Meeting to acquire the Company's own shares, the shareholders acting at the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Telef\u00f3nica held on March 31, 2023 resolved to renew the aforementioned authorization granted by the shareholders themselves at the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 8, 2018 for the derivative acquisition of own shares, either directly or through companies of the Group, on the terms that are literally set forth below:\n\n\"A) To authorize, pursuant to the provisions of Section 144 et seq. of the Spanish Companies Act (Ley de Sociedades de Capital), the derivative acquisition by Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., -either directly or through any of the subsidiaries-, at any time and as many times as it deems appropriate, of its own fully-paid in shares through purchase and sale, exchange or any other legal transaction.\n\nThe minimum acquisition price or minimum value consideration shall be equal to the par value of the shares of its own stock acquired, and the maximum acquisition price or maximum value consideration shall be equal to the listing price of the shares of its own stock acquired by the Company on an official secondary market at the time of the acquisition.\n\nSuch authorization is granted for a period of 5 years as from the date of this General Shareholders' Meeting and is expressly subject to the limitation that the par value of the Company's own shares acquired directly or indirectly pursuant to this authorization added to those already held by Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. and any of its subsidiaries shall at no time exceed the maximum amount permitted by the Law at any time, and the limitations on the acquisition of the Company's own shares established by the regulatory Authorities of the markets on which the shares of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. are traded shall also be observed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board of Directors was also authorized to exclude pre-emptive rights in whole or in part, as provided in section 506 of the Companies Act. However, the power to exclude pre-emptive rights is limited to 20% of the share capital on the date on which the resolution is adopted. In accordance with the above-mentioned authorization, as of the end of fiscal year 2023, the Board would be authorized to increase the share capital by the maximum nominal amount of 2,596,065,843 euros.\n\nFurthermore, the shareholders at the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., held on June 12, 2020, delegated to the Board of Directors, in accordance with the general rules governing the issuance of debentures and pursuant to the provisions of applicable\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\nlaw and the Company's Bylaws, the power to issue debentures, bonds, notes and other fixed-income securities and hybrid instruments, including preferred shares, which may in all cases be simple, exchangeable and/or convertible and/or grant the holders thereof a share in the earnings of the Company, as well as warrants, with the power to exclude the pre-emptive rights of shareholders. The aforementioned securities may be issued on one or more occasions, within a maximum period of five years as from the date of adoption of the resolution. However, the power to exclude pre-emptive rights is limited to 20% of the share capital on the date on which the resolution is adopted. The securities issued may be debentures, bonds, notes and other fixed-income securities, or debt instruments of a similar nature, or hybrid instruments in any of the forms admitted by Law (including, among others, preferred interests) both simple and, in the case of debentures, bonds and hybrid instruments, convertible into shares of the Company and/ or exchangeable for shares of the Company, of any of the companies of its Group or of any other company and/or giving the holders thereof an interest in the corporate earnings. Such delegation also includes warrants or other similar instruments that may entitle the holders thereof, directly or indirectly, to subscribe for or acquire newlyissued or outstanding shares, payable by physical delivery or through differences. The aggregate amount of the issuance or issuances of instruments that may be approved in reliance on this delegation may not exceed, at any time, 25,000 million euros or the equivalent thereof in another currency. In the case of notes and for purposes of the above-mentioned limits, the outstanding balance of those issued in reliance on the delegation shall be computed. In the case of warrants, and also for the purpose of such limit, the sum of the premiums and exercise prices of each issuance shall be taken into account.\n\nFurthermore, under the aforementioned delegation resolution, the shareholders at the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. resolved to authorize the Board of Directors to guarantee, in the name of the Company, the issuance of the aforementioned instruments issued by the Companies belonging to its Group of Companies, within a maximum period of five years as from the date of adoption of the resolution.\n\n## Restrictions on the transferability of securities and/or voting rights\n\nAs for the existence of restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights, in accordance with article 26 of the Company's Bylaws, no shareholder may exercise a number of votes exceeding 10 percent of the total share capital with voting rights existing at any time, regardless of the number of shares held, all of the foregoing with full and mandatory submission to the provisions of the Law.

Telef\u00f3nica believes that this measure does not constitute a mechanism to block public tender offers but rather a guarantee that the acquisition of control will require sufficient consensus among all the shareholders since, as is natural and may be seen from experience, potential offerors may condition their offer to the removal of such requirement.\n\nIn addition, and in accordance with section 527 of the Companies Act, at listed companies, bylaw provisions that directly or indirectly establish, in general terms, the maximum number of votes that may be cast by a single shareholder, companies belonging to the same group or those acting in concert with the foregoing shall cease to have effect when, following a public tender offer, the offeror has reached a percentage equal to or greater than 70 percent of the capital carrying voting rights, unless such offeror is not subject to equivalent neutralization measures or has not adopted them.\n\nOn the other hand, the shareholders at a General Shareholders' Meeting of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. have not resolved to adopt any neutralization measure in the event of a public tender offer in reliance on the provisions of the Securities Market Act.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\nIn addition, the provisions of Article 7 of Law 19/2003 of July 4, 2003 on the legal regime governing the movement of capital and economic transactions abroad and on certain measures to prevent money laundering and Article 18 of Royal Decree 571/2023 of July 4, 2003 on foreign investment, which require prior authorisation for foreign investments in Spain in activities directly related to national defence, are applicable. This authorisation is exempted in two cases: (a) acquisitions of less than 5% of the share capital provided that they do not allow participation in the administrative body and (b) acquisitions of between 5% and 10% of the share capital provided that the investor renounces in a public deed before the Administration not to exercise or transfer to third parties its voting rights and not to form part of any corporate administrative bodies.\n\nLikewise, the provisions of Article 7.bis.1 of the aforementioned Law 19/2003 must be taken into account, which requires prior authorisation for foreign investment involving the acquisition of a stake equal to or greater than 10% of the share capital (or any that entails the acquisition of total or partial control) when it affects strategic sectors such as: critical telecommunications infrastructure, data processing or storage, critical and dual-use telecommunications technologies, artificial intelligence, robotics, cybersecurity, sectors with access to sensitive information, etc. Article 7.bis.3 of this Law requires prior authorisation for foreign investments with the same percentage or effect on the control of the company when, among other cases, the foreign investor is directly or indirectly controlled by the government of a third country.\n\nIn both cases, investment transactions carried out without the required prior authorisation are not valid and have no legal effect until they are legalised, so that, until the necessary authorisation is obtained, the foreign investor cannot exercise his economic or political rights.\n\n## 4.2.2. Significant Shareholders\n\nAccording to the information existing at the Company, there is no individual or legal entity that directly or indirectly, individually or jointly with others, exercises or may exercise control over Telef\u00f3nica on the terms set out in section 5 of the Securities Market Act.\n\nAs of the closing date of fiscal year 2023, there are, however, certain shareholders holding interests that may be considered significant within the meaning of Royal Decree 1362/2007, of October 19, and which are the following:",

General Shareholders' Meeting\n\nGRI 2-9, 2-10\n\n## 4.3.1. Shareholders' Rights\n\nThe Bylaws of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. provide for a single class of shares (common shares), giving all the holders thereof identical rights. There are no non-voting shares or shares, or a loyalty vote, carrying more than one vote or with privileges in the distribution of dividends, or reinforced quorum or qualified majorities other than those established by law.\n\nThere is no provision for the shareholders at a General Shareholders' Meeting having to approve decisions entailing an acquisition, disposition or the contribution to another company of essential assets or similar corporate transactions other than those established by law.\n\nThis section describes some of the main rights of the shareholders of the Company.\n\n## Right to receive information\n\nThe General Shareholders' Meeting is called as much in advance as required by law, through a notice published in, at a minimum: (i) the Official Gazette of the Commercial Registry or one of the widest circulation dailies in Spain; (ii) the website of the National Securities Market Commission; and (iii) the Company's corporate website.\n\nThe notice published on the Company's corporate website remains accessible on a continuous basis at least until the holding of the General Shareholders' Meeting. Likewise, the Board of Directors may publish notices in other media, if it deems appropriate, in order to ensure public and effective dissemination of the call to meeting.\n\nFrom the date of publication of the notice of the call to the General Shareholders' Meeting, the Company makes available to its shareholders the documents and information that must be provided to them in accordance with legal or bylaw-mandated requirements in connection with the various items included on the Agenda; such items and documents are posted on the Company's website from the above-mentioned date.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, shareholders may obtain such documents and information immediately and free of charge at the Company's registered office, and request that they be delivered or mailed to them free of charge, in the cases and on the terms established by law.\n\nIn addition, from the date of publication of the call to the General Shareholders' Meeting and until the fifth day prior to the date set for the holding of the meeting on first call, any shareholder may request in writing such\n\ninformation or clarifications or ask such questions in writing as it deems relevant concerning the matters included on the Agenda of the call to meeting, or concerning the information accessible to the public that the Company may have provided to the National Securities Market Commission since the holding of the immediately preceding General Shareholders' Meeting, or concerning the auditor's report.\n\nThe Board of Directors will be required to provide in writing, until the day of the holding of the General Shareholders' Meeting, the requested information or explanations, as well as to reply, also in writing, to the questions asked. The replies to the questions and to the requests for information will be sent through the Secretary of the Board of Directors by any of the members of the Board or by any person expressly authorized by the Board of Directors for such purpose.\n\nDuring the holding of the General Shareholders' Meeting, shareholders may request such information or explanations as they deem appropriate concerning the matters included on the Agenda or with respect to the information accessible to the public provided by the Company to the National Securities Market Commission since the holding of the last General Shareholders' Meeting or concerning the auditor's report. In the event that it is impossible to satisfy the shareholder's right at that time, the Board of Directors will be required to provide such information in writing within seven days of the end of the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Board of Directors will be required to provide the requested information as described in the two preceding paragraphs in the manner and within the periods established by law, except in those cases where: (i) such information is unnecessary for the protection of the shareholder's rights or there are objective reasons to consider that it could be used other than for corporate purposes, or the dissemination thereof would harm the Company or its related companies; (ii) the request for information or explanations does not relate to matters included on the Agenda or, in the case of paragraph two of this subsection (Right to Receive Information), to information accessible to the public that was provided by the Company to the National Securities Market Commission since the holding of the last General Shareholders' Meeting; and (iii) it is so established in statutory or regulatory provisions. The exception described in subsection (i) above shall not apply if the\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, and on the terms set forth in section 519 of the Companies Act (Ley de Sociedades de Capital), shareholders representing at least three percent of the share capital may, within five days following publication of the notice of the call to meeting, submit duly substantiated proposed resolutions on matters already included or that must be included on the Agenda. Such rights shall be exercised by means of duly authenticated notice, which must be received by the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Law.\n\n## Right to attend and to appoint a proxy\n\nShareholders holding at least 300 shares registered in their name in the respective book-entry register five days prior to the General Shareholders' Meeting and providing evidence thereof through the respective attendance card or certificate issued by the Company or by any of the Depositary Entities Members of Sociedad de Gesti\u00f3n de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensaci\u00f3n y Liquidaci\u00f3n de Valores, S.A.U.

Proxies may be granted through the proxy forms printed on the attendance cards or in any other manner allowed by law, without prejudice to the provisions of the Companies Act regarding cases of representation by family members and the grant of general powers of attorney. The documents granting the proxy for the General Shareholders' Meeting shall include instructions concerning the direction of the vote. Unless the shareholder granting the proxy expressly states otherwise, it shall be deemed that such shareholder issues precise voting instructions in favor of the proposed resolutions submitted by the Board of Directors on the matters included on the Agenda. If there are no voting\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\ninstructions because the shareholders acting at the General Shareholders' Meeting could decide on matters that, while not included on the Agenda and therefore not known on the date on which the proxy is granted, might be put to a vote at the General Shareholders' Meeting, the proxy shall cast the vote in the direction the proxy considers best, taking into account the interest of the Company and that of the shareholder the proxy represents. The same provisions shall apply when the respective proposal or proposals submitted to a decision of the shareholders at the General Shareholders' Meeting were not made by the Board of Directors.\n\nIt is expressly stated for the record that the notice of call of the last Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting expressly provided that unless the shareholder granting the proxy expressly stated otherwise, such shareholder would be deemed to issue precise instructions to vote against the respective resolution on any matter that, while not included on the Agenda and therefore not known on the date on which the proxy was granted, might be put to a vote at the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIf the proxy document does not state the specific person to whom the shareholder grants his proxy, it shall be deemed to have been granted to the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company or to the person who may replace him as Chair of the General Shareholders' Meeting. If the appointed proxy should be in a situation of conflict of interest regarding the vote on any of the proposals which, whether or not included on the Agenda, are submitted at the General Shareholders' Meeting and the shareholder granting the proxy has not issued precise voting instructions, the proxy shall be deemed to have been granted to the Secretary for the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nShareholders who are not holders of the minimum number of shares required to attend may also grant a proxy in writing with respect to such shares to a shareholder with the right to attend or form a group with other shareholders in the same situation until they have the necessary number of shares, and grant a proxy in writing to one of them.\n\n## Right to vote and adoption of resolutions\n\nEvery share present in person or by proxy at the General Shareholders' Meeting shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote.\n\nResolutions shall be adopted by simple majority, meaning that proposed resolutions will be approved when the number of votes in favor of each proposal is greater than the number of votes against it (regardless of the number of blank votes and abstentions), without prejudice to the reinforced voting quorums established in the law and in the Bylaws.",

In particular, if the General Shareholders' Meeting is summoned to deliberate on Bylaw amendments, including capital increases or reductions, bond issuance, on eliminating or restricting pre-emptive rights in respect of new shares and on the transformation, merger, spin-off or the global assignment of assets and liabilities and the relocation of the registered office abroad, then shareholders that own at least fifty percent of the subscribed capital with voting rights will have to be present or be represented by proxy on first call. If there is no sufficient quorum, the General Shareholders' Meeting will be held on second call, in which case at least twenty-five percent of the subscribed capital with voting rights will need to be present, either in person or by proxy. When shareholders that represent less than fifty percent of the subscribed capital with voting rights are present at the Meeting, either in person or by proxy, the resolutions referred to above may only be approved when two-thirds of the capital, present or represented by proxy at the Meeting, vote in favor of the resolution.\n\nPursuant to section 286 of the Companies Act, if the Bylaws are amended, the Directors or, if appropriate, the shareholders who made the proposal must draw up in full the text of their proposed amendment and a written report justifying the amendment, which must be made available to the shareholders when the General Shareholders' Meeting is called to deliberate on the amendment.\n\nFurthermore, and pursuant to section 287 of the Companies Act, the notice calling the General Shareholders' Meeting must clearly state the items that might be amended, and note that all the shareholders are entitled to analyze the full text of the proposed amendment and the report on such amendment at the registered offices, as well as to request such documents to be delivered or sent to them free of charge.\n\nPursuant to section 291 of the Companies Act, when new obligations are established for the shareholders due to an amendment of the Bylaws, the resolution must be passed with the approval of the affected shareholders. Furthermore, if the amendment directly or indirectly affects a type of shares, or part of them, the provisions of section 293 of such Act shall apply.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\nThe procedure for voting on proposed resolutions at the General Shareholders' Meeting is regulated in section 197 bis of the Companies Act and in the internal regulations of Telef\u00f3nica (in particular, article 23 of the Regulations for the General Shareholders' Meeting).

In any event, the proposals must be accompanied by a supporting report from the Board of Directors assessing the competence, experience and merits of the proposed candidate.\n\nIn this regard, and in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, this Committee must evaluate the skills, knowledge and experience required on the Board of Directors, defining the functions and competencies required of the candidates who must fill each vacancy, and evaluating the specific amount of time and dedication that will allow them to perform their duties effectively.\n\nWith regard to the latter, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 27.2 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, those who are members of more than five Boards of Directors of other companies other than Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. and its Group companies may not be appointed to the Company's Board.

Specifically, due grounds shall be deemed to exist when the Director has failed to perform the duties inherent in his position.\n\nThe removal of Independent Directors may also be proposed as a result of Public Tender Offers, mergers or other similar corporate transactions that entail a change in the structure of the company's capital.\n\nLikewise, in accordance with the provisions of article 12 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Directors must tender their resignation to the Board of Directors and formalize, where appropriate, and depending on the circumstances, such resignation in the following cases:\n\n- a.

Mr. Pablo de Carvajal Gonz\u00e1lez is also Telef\u00f3nica's Global Director of Regulatory Affairs and Head of the Security Area.\n\nThe Board of Directors also has a Deputy Secretary, Mr. Antonio Garc\u00eda-Mon Mara\u00f1\u00e9s, who assists the Secretary and replaces him in the performance of his duties in the event of his absence or inability. Mr. Garc\u00eda-Mon is also Deputy General Secretary and Director of Corporate Legal Services.\n\nNeither the Secretary nor the Deputy Secretary of the Board have the status of Directors.\n\n- \u00b7 Committees of the Board of Directors\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, and on the date of issuance of this Report, the Board of Directors had and has an Executive Commission and three advisory or control committees, whose composition, duties and powers are described in detail in advance.\n\n## Operation of the Board of Directors\n\nBoth the Bylaws and the Regulations of the Board specify that the Board of Directors shall meet routinely once a month, and, at the initiative of the Chairman, as often as he deems it appropriate for the proper functioning of the Company.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2023 the Telef\u00f3nica Board of Directors held 18 meetings, each lasting between three and four hours, depending on the topics discussed. Likewise, it should be noted that one of these meetings corresponds to the strategic session that the Board of Directors holds annually to analyze the company's strategy and its impact on the business developed by the Telefonica Group. In particular, as mentioned before in this Report, the Capital Markets Day was held on November 8, 2023.\n\nThe meetings of the Board of Directors have been held in mixed format.  At all these meetings, the Secretary of the Board of Directors attested to the identity of all the attendees.\n\nThe power to call a meeting of the Board of Directors and, if appropriate, to draw up the Agenda of the Board's meetings rests with the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who must however call a meeting when requested to do so by three Directors who indicate the issues to be discussed.\n\nA meeting of the Board of Directors may also be called by at least one-third of its members, with an indication of the Agenda, if, after the submission of a request to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chairman, without just cause, has not called the meeting within a period of one month.\n\nThe Company adopts the measures that are necessary in order for the Directors to have, whenever possible and sufficiently in advance, the necessary information, which shall be drawn up and oriented specifically toward the preparation of the meetings of the Board and of its Committees. In no case shall its compliance be waived on the grounds of the importance or confidential nature of the information, except under absolutely exceptional circumstances.\n\nIn this regard, and in accordance with the provisions of articles 18 and 20 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors and its Committees shall draw up a calendar of the meetings to be held during the year. Such calendar may be modified by resolution of the Board itself or of the corresponding Committee, or pursuant to a decision by its Chairman, in which case the modification must be disclosed to the Directors as soon as possible.",

The Agenda for each meeting clearly indicates the items regarding which the Board of Directors or the Executive Commission must make a decision or adopt a resolution.\n\nWith the same goal, in general, the documentation associated with the Agenda for the meetings is made available to the Directors sufficiently in advance. In this regard, and in compliance with the provisions of article 19 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors organizes the discussions, seeking and encouraging the active participation of all of the Directors in the deliberations, safeguarding the unconstrained statement of their viewpoints. Similarly, with the assistance of the Secretary, the Chairman ensures that the Directors receive beforehand sufficient information to deliberate on the items on the Agenda. He also ensures that sufficient time is devoted to the discussion of strategic issues and stimulates debate during the meetings, safeguarding the unconstrained statement of viewpoints by the Directors.\n\nTo facilitate the provision of all of the information and clarifications that may be necessary regarding some of the issues to be addressed, the main officers of the Group attend essentially all of the meetings of the Board and of its Committees, along with the speakers who are deemed appropriate, for the presentation of matters lying within their purview, according to the matters to be dealt with on the agenda for each meeting.  In this regard, before the start of the corresponding agenda item, the Chairman requests the incorporation of the speakers to participate in said item. The speakers present the appropriate information and answer the questions raised, but in no case do the speakers or any other guests at the meetings take part in the deliberations, and this does not affect the independence or freedom of judgement of the directors and members of the Board Committees.\n\nFurthermore, and in general, the Regulations of the Board of Directors (article 25) expressly provide that the Directors are vested with the broadest powers for obtaining information about any aspect of the Company and to examine its books, records, documents and other background materials relating to corporate activities. The exercise of this right of information is channeled through the Chairman or the Secretary of the Board of Directors, who handle requests from the Directors, either providing the information directly to the Directors or placing them in touch with the proper contact persons at the appropriate organizational level.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\nThe Board of Directors can validly hold a meeting when a majority of its serving members are present or represented at the meeting. The Directors must personally attend the meetings of the Board of Directors. If, under exceptional circumstances, they are unable to do so, they shall ensure that the proxy they give to another member of the Board of Directors includes, insofar as possible, the appropriate instructions. Non-executive Directors can delegate their proxy only to another non-executive Director. Such delegations may be made by letter, mail or in any other way that ensures the certainty and validity of the proxy, in the opinion of the Chairman of the Board of Directors (article 19 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors and article 34.4 of the Bylaws).\n\nIn all cases, resolutions are adopted by an absolute majority of the votes of the Directors who are present at the meeting, either in person or by proxy, except in those instances in which, for certain resolutions to be valid, the law, the By-Laws or the Regulation of the Board of Directors requires the favorable vote of a larger number of Directors.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nBoth the Bylaws and the Regulations of the Board provide for an Executive Commission of the Board of Directors, with general decision-making authority and, consequently, with the express delegation of all of the powers of the Board of Directors, except for those powers that, by law or pursuant to the Bylaws, cannot be delegated.\n\nThe Regulations also authorize the Board of Directors to create one or more advisory or control committees entrusted with the task of examining and continuously monitoring any area of special importance to the good governance of the Company, or performing the specific analysis of any factor or issue whose significance or magnitude requires it. Such Committees do not have the status of corporate bodies, but rather are tools in the service of the Board of Directors, to which they convey the conclusions that they reach with regard to the issues or subjects whose handling has been entrusted to them.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, and on the date of issuance of this Report, the Board of Directors had and has an Executive Commission and three advisory or control committees, whose composition, duties and powers are described below.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting held on December 13, 2023, and at the proposal of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, approved the partial amendment of the Regulations of the Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., in order to: i) to simplify and adapt the organisational structure of the Board of Directors' Committees to the current composition of the Company's administrative body, reducing the number of Committees by two (from six to four); ii) enhance the strategic definition and oversight role of the Company's Board of Directors by abolishing the Strategy and Innovation Committee to ensure that all deliberations and discussions on the Company's strategy take place in the Board of Directors, in",

At all these meetings, the Secretary of each Committee attested to the identity of all the attendees.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article 20 b) 3. of the Regulations of the Board, a full report is delivered to the Board of Directors on the matters addressed by the Committees, and  so that it will be aware of the said matters for the exercise of its responsibilities. At the beginning of each of the monthly meetings of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of each of the Committees delivers a report on the major matters that were addressed and on the activities and tasks that were carried out by the respective Committee, making available to the Directors the corresponding documentation, so that the Directors will be aware of such activities for the purposes of the exercise of their responsibilities.\n\nAdditionally, and in the same way as the Board of Directors itself, all of the Committees prepare, at the start of each fiscal year and in accordance with the provisions of article 20 b) 3. of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, an Action Plan that contains a detailed description of, and a schedule for, the actions to be taken in each fiscal year in each Committee's individual area of activity.\n\nSimilarly, all of the Committees prepare an Activity Memorandum (which, for the Audit and Control Committee and the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, is known as the Performance Report), which summarize the major activities and actions that were carried out during the preceding fiscal year, including the details of the matters that were examined and addressed at the meetings that were held, and emphasizing\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\nthe aspects associated with their duties and responsibilities, composition and performance.\n\n## The Executive Commission\n\nThe Board of Directors has delegated its authority or powers (except for those that by law, under the bylaws and pursuant to the regulations cannot be delegated) to an Executive Commission.\n\nThe Executive Commission provides the Board of Directors with greater operability and effectiveness in the exercise of its functions, inasmuch as it meets more often than the Board of Directors does.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article 38 of the Bylaws of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., article 21 of the Regulations of the Company's Board of Directors governs the Executive Commission in the following terms:\n\n## a) Composition.\n\nThe Executive Commission shall consist of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, once he has been appointed as a member of the Committee, and no fewer than three and no more than ten other members, all of whom shall be Directors, appointed by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall endeavor to ensure that the Executive Commission has at least two non-executive Director, of whom at least one shall be independent.\n\nIn any event, in order to be valid, the appointment or renewal of the members of the Executive Commission shall require the favorable vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, and on the date of issuance of this Report, the Executive Commission was and is composed of the following persons:\n\n| Name                                  | Post           | Category       |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez- Pallete L\u00f3pez | Chairman       | Executive      |\n| Mr. Isidro Fain\u00e9 Casas                | Vice  Chairman | Proprietary    |\n| Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Abril P\u00e9rez            | Vice  Chairman | Proprietary    |\n| Mr. Jos\u00e9 Javier Echenique  Landir\u00edbar | Vice  Chairman | Independent    |\n| Mr. \u00c1ngel Vil\u00e1 Boix                   | Member         | Executive      |\n| Mr. Peter L\u00f6scher                     | Member         | Independent    |\n| Mr. Francisco Javier de Paz  Mancho   | Member         | Other External |\n| Ms. Claudia Sender Ram\u00edrez*           | Member         | Independent    |",

Governance and culture of sustainability.\n\nMost important activities during the fiscal year and fulfillment of duties.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Sustainability and Regulation Committee was created on December 13, 2023 and therefore no meetings of this Committee were held during the 2023 financial year. However, there were previously two Committees, the Sustainability and Quality Committee and the Regulation and Institutional Affairs Committee. In this regard, the most important actions of each Committee are outlined below:\n\n- (i) Sustainability and Quality Committee: Throughout the 11 meetings held during the financial year 2023, the Committee has analyzed the quality indexes for the principal services provided by the companies within the Telef\u00f3nica Group, evaluated the main Customer Experience indicators  given to customers by those companies, and has analyzed the Corporate Social Reputation of the Telef\u00f3nica Group, including the most relevant issues in terms of Sustainability (ethical behavior, sustainable finances, the supply chain, privacy and cibersecurity, risk on Sustainability (ESG), talent and diversity management, human rights, the environment and climate change), including Responsible Business Plans in the Global Sustainability (ESG) Office and the Statement of NonFinancial Information (Sustainability Information).\n- (ii) Regulation and Institutional Affairs Committee: Throughout the 11 meetings held during the financial year 2023, the Committee has analysed and reported, among others, on the following issues:\n- \u00b7 The most relevant regulatory matters for the Telef\u00f3nica Group, reflected in the Regulatory Agenda, at global level, by region (Europe and Latin America) and by country. The most significant developments in relation to the most important matters in the Regulatory Agenda are updated at each meeting, as well as the specific documents or reports submitted to the Commission when the matter or its situation so advises.\n- \u00b7 Update on regulatory approvals of corporate transactions.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing monitoring of the Sponsorship and Patronage Policy and the sponsorship proposals presented by the Global Sponsorship Department of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\n- \u00b7 The Telef\u00f3nica Group's most significant institutional milestones in terms of Institutional Relations.\n\n## Evaluation of the Board and of its Committees\n\nOnce a year, all of the Company's Directors evaluate the performance of the Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., of its Committees and of the General Shareholders' Meeting. Furthermore, every three years such evaluation is carried out with the assistance of an external consultant, whose independence is verified by the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee.  The assessments for the 2021 and 2022 financial years were carried out internally by the Company, without the support of an external advisor. For the evaluation for the financial year 2023, the Board of Directors, on the proposal of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, was supported by the Consulting Firm Egon Zehnder as external advisor.\n\nThis evaluation process consisted of the completion by each of the Directors of the corresponding evaluation questionnaires, as well as individual interviews conducted by the aforementioned Consulting Firm with each of them in order to assess and ascertain the opinions of the Directors on the issues and aspects that were the object of the evaluation.\n\nThe aforementioned questionnaires contained a wide range of questions grouped under the following five headings: i) Structure and composition of the Board of Directors; ii) Function of the Board of Directors; iii) Rights and obligations of the Directors, expressly including the adequacy of the performance and contribution of the Directors on the Board of Directors; iv) Committees of the Board of Directors, expressly including the function of each Committee, and performance of their Chairmans and v) Shareholders and Stakeholders.\n\nOnce this process was completed, the Egon Zehnder Consultancy issued the corresponding Report on the results, which was submitted to the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee for review and analysis. Then the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, at its meeting held on February 20, 2024, reviewed and analysed the results of this evaluation, concluding that the Directors had expressed a high degree of satisfaction, in general terms, with the functioning of the Board of Directors and its Committees, pointing out aspects that could be optimised. Likewise, the aforementioned Report on the results of the 2023 evaluation was presented by the Egon Zehnder Consulting Firm itself to the Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on February 21, 2024 and made available to all Directors.\n\nHence, after a detailed examination and analysis of the results achieved, the Board of Directors of the Company, at the proposal of the Nominating, Remunerations and Corporate Governance Committee, established an Action Plan for the implementation of the the suggestions and recommendations deemed appropriate, in order to optimise",

Transactions with Related Parties\n\n- \u00b7 The procedure for approval of related-party and intragroup transactions\n\nAs mentioned above, the Board of Directors, at its meeting held on June 29 and 30, 2021, and at the proposal of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, approved the partial amendment of the company's Board of Directors' Regulations which basically consists of adapting them to the novelties of Law 5/2021 of April 12, which amends the revised text of the Capital Companies Act and other financial regulations with regard to the promotion of longterm shareholder involvement in listed companies (Law 5/2021). Specifically, the Board of Directors' Regulations were adapted to the amendments introduced by Law 5/2021 to the regime of related-party transactions applicable to listed companies.\n\nLikewise, the Board of Directors, at its aforementioned meeting held on June 29 and 30, 2021, approved, in coordination with the aforementioned amendment of the Board of Directors' Regulations, to partially amend the Regulations of the Audit and Control Committee, in order to incorporate the changes introduced in the Board of Directors' Regulations.\n\nFollowing the aforementioned amendment, Article 5.4 of the Board of Directors' Regulations includes the following non-delegable powers of the Board, among others:\n\nThe approval, subject to a report from the Audit and Control Committee, of related-party transactions under the terms established in Article 37 of these Regulations, unless its approval corresponds to the General Meeting.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors may delegate the approval of transactions between companies forming part of its group that are carried out within the scope of ordinary management and under market conditions, as well as transactions entered into under contracts whose standard conditions are applied en masse to a large number of customers, carried out at prices or rates established on a general basis, and whose amount does not exceed 0.5% of the net turnover of the company, determined in accordance with the rules of calculation laid down in the Law.\n\nIn this regard, and in accordance with the provisions of article 29.f) of the Board of Directors' Regulations:\n\nNo Director may directly or indirectly carry out professional or commercial operations or transactions\n\nwith the company or with any of the companies of its group, when such operations or transactions are outside the ordinary course of business or are not carried out under market conditions, except for those operations or transactions that are authorised by the company under the terms provided for in the regime on related-party transactions established by law, in the Articles of Association, and in these Regulations.\n\nArticle 37 of the Board of Directors' Regulations establishes the following with regard to the regime on related-party transactions:\n\n- 1. The Board of Directors, subject to a favourable report from the Audit and Control Committee, shall approve transactions that the company or its subsidiaries carry out with directors, shareholders holding 10% or more of the voting rights or represented on the company's Board of Directors, or any other persons who should be considered related parties under the terms of the law, provided that, under current legislation, they are considered to be related party transactions, and unless their approval corresponds to the General Shareholders' Meeting. This power cannot be delegated, except in the cases and under the terms provided for in the law and in Article 5.4 of these Regulations.\n- 2. In relation to the adoption of the motion to approve related-party transactions whose competence corresponds to the Board of Directors and has not been delegated, the Director involved or the Director representing or related to the shareholder involved must abstain from participating in the deliberation and voting in accordance with the provisions of the law.\n- 3.       In the event that the Board of Directors delegates the approval of related-party transactions in accordance with the provisions of the law and Article 5.4 of these Regulations, the Board of Directors itself shall establish an internal procedure of information and periodic control in relation thereto, in which the Audit and Control Committee shall intervene, in order to verify the fairness and transparency of these transactions and, where appropriate, compliance with the applicable legal criteria. The approval of such transactions shall not require a prior report from the Audit and Control Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk Assessment of Financial Information\n\n## Main characteristics of the risk identification process, including those related to error or fraud.\n\nThe ICFR was developed by the Group in accordance with international internal control standards established by COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, of the Treadway Commission), in its Internal Control - Integrated Framework report, which establishes five components in which the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control systems should be based:\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annual Corporate Governance Report\n\n- \u00b7 Establish an effective internal control environment, emphasizing organizational culture, integrity and ethical values.\n- \u00b7 Assess the risks that an entity could incur in compiling its financial information.\n- \u00b7 Design and implement the necessary controls to mitigate the risks identified, ensuring that actions are aligned with the financial reporting objectives of the Organisation.\n- \u00b7 Establish the appropriate information and communication circuits to support effective decision making and control processes, including those related to the detection and communication of system weaknesses or inefficiencies.\n- \u00b7 Monitor said controls to ensure their effective design and operability, as well as the validity of their effectiveness over time.\n\nGiven the width of the universe of processes with impact on financial reporting at the Telef\u00f3nica Group, a model has been developed to select the most relevant processes based both on risk assessment and materiality, the socalled Scope Definition Model, and which is a part of the Audit Methodology on the  Internal Control over Financial Information (ICFR) System of the Telef\u00f3nica Group. This model, based both in the principle of relative importance and the assessment of risks related to financing reporting at Group level, is applied to the financial information reported by subsidiaries multi-group and associate companies. The model selects the significant accounts, so that the evaluation of ICFR of the Group can be upholded. Subsequently, identifies the relevant processes which generate the financial information for these epigraphs or accounts.\n\nOnce the relevant processes have been identified, an understanding is made on those processes that have a more relevant impact on significant accounts, to review, in the first instance, the effectiveness of the design, and in a second phase, the operating of the key controls which address the main associated risks or 'objectives of financial information' (also named financial premises).Given that the internal control evaluation the Group's financial reporting is performed as of the closing date of each year, during the year the corresponding activities are carried out to contrast the initial results obtained through the Scope Definition Model.\n\nThe aforementioned procedure for identifying and reviewing the key controls covers the objectives of the financial information (also named financial premises) of accuracy, valuation, completeness, cut-off of operations, existence / occurrence, presentation, breakdown, and rights and obligations. This identification of the key controls, aimed at addressing the aforementioned financial premises of the significant accounts and relevant processes in scope, is carried out annually, verifying that no event has taken place so as to determine a modification of this as at the year-end date.",

People, information, technologies and material resources that support them are considered fundamental assets, reason why guaranteeing their security is considered an essential asset in the strategy of Telef\u00f3nica and an essential enabler of the organization 's activity. In order to reach a homogeneous level of security, a global corporate security regulatory Framework is defined that will take into account the analysis of threats and risks, as well as the establishment of preventive, detection and corrective controls, in the activities aimed at identify, protect, detect, respond and recover. This regulatory framework aims to preserve its assets and protect its strategic interests and objectives, both in its vertical organization  (including its business units) and in its cross-cutting dimension (applicable to all its platforms): infrastructure and network assets, communication technologies, products and services, and data; safeguarding, on the one hand, their integrity and, on the other, protecting them, from potential threats that might damage their value, affect their confidentiality, reduce their efficiency or affect their operability and availability.\n\nThe Global Director of Security and Intelligence leads the development and monitors the implementation of the regulatory framework and global security initiatives.

In that Policy, 'internal control' is defined as the process performed by the Board of Directors, Management and the rest of the staff of the Company, being designed with the purpose of providing a reasonable assurance degree for the attainment of the objectives related to operations, information and compliance. With the purpose of helping to the achievement of its objectives, the Company has an internal control model defined in accordance with the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO').\n\nLikewise, there is an Internal Audit Organization Policy, which includes aspects regarding the organization and functioning of this area. According to what is set in that Policy, Internal Audit is the area in Telef\u00f3nica in charge of confirming, by means of appropriate evidence, the adequate functioning of the internal control and risk management structures and, if applicable, detecting possible inefficiencies or non-compliance with the control system that the Group establishes in its processes. In this respect, Internal Audit functionally depends on the Audit and Control Committee and becomes an area independent from the Company management which supports this Committee in its competencies on assurance, risk management and the internal control system, applying a systematic and disciplined approach, through the means indicated above.\n\nThe Internal Audit function is developed in accordance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and, in this regard, it has been awarded a Quality Certificate from the International Institute of Internal Auditors.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\nWith regard to the supervision of the Internal Control System over Financial Reporting (ICFR), Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., as company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is subject to the regulatory requirements established by the North American regulatory bodies that affect companies listed on that Stock Exchange. Among those requirements is the aforementioned Sarbanes-Oxley Act, of 2002, and, specifically, Section 404 of that Act, which stipulates the need for companies listed in the US market to assess on an annual basis the effectiveness of the procedures and structures of the internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). In order to comply with this requirement, and as stated above, the Telef\u00f3nica Group has a Methodology of the system for the internal control over Financial Reporting (ICFR), Internal Audit is the area in charge of performing, on an annual basis, the assessment on its effectiveness as of the year-end date, with a reasonable assurance approach, in accordance with the guidelines established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its Internal Control Integrated Framework report.\n\nAdditionally, and also in accordance with what is established in Section 404 of this Act, the External Auditor issues their own independent opinion of reasonable assurance on the effectiveness of the Internal Control System over Financial Reporting (ICFR), in accordance with the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO').\n\n## Review on specific processes and controls\n\nWithout prejudice to filling in the self-assessment questionnaire, in certain companies of the Group, according to criteria regarding the relevance of their contribution to the economic-financial magnitudes of the Group and other considered risk factors, a direct review is made on their processes and key controls, applying the Internal Control System Auditing Methodology on the Group's Financial Information, which is aligned with the guidelines established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its Internal Control - Integrated Framework report for which the 'Scope Definition Model' is available, which is based both on the principle of relative importance(materiality) and on the assessment of risks related to the financial reporting processes of the Telef\u00f3nica Group. Based on the application of this model, the identification of the significant financial accounting by company of the consolidation perimeter is carried out. Additionally, and for the purposes of being able to execute and conclude respect the evaluating of the Internal Control System for Financial Information (ICFR) of the Telef\u00f3nica Group, based on the aforementioned evaluation methodology.\n\nOnce the significant accounts are identified having identified within the scope of the evaluation based on the calculated consolidated materiality, the Internal Control System Auditing Methodology on the Group's Financial Information is applied as follows:",

Additionally, appropriate audit testing of internal control over cybersecurity aspects included within the scope of the Assessment of the effectiveness of the ICFR.\n\n## Self-assessment Questionnaires\n\nIn addition, all the companies that depend from the Group which are not within the direct scope of the Annual ICFR Assessment performed by Internal Audit, receive annually internal control self-assessment questionnaires, whose answers must be subsequently certified by the local persons responsible of their ICFR in each Company (Executive Presidents and/or Finance Directors, or functional positions). These questionnaires address aspects of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) that are considered minimum requirements in order to achieve a reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial information reported. The answers are demonstrably audited by the corresponding Internal Audit Units.\n\n## Weakness detection and management procedure\n\nAs previously stated, the Internal Audit area is also in charge, among other functions, to provide support to the Audit and Control Committee in the supervision of the functioning of the system for the internal control over financial reporting (ICFR).\n\nThe Internal Audit department participates in the Audit and Control Committee meetings and informs regularly about the conclusions of the carried out works, and also informs about the action plans designed and agreed for mitigation and about the degree of implementation thereof. This includes, where applicable, to communicate internal",

As well as Internal Audit, the External Auditor is obliged to communicate the significant deficiencies or material weaknesses identified in the development of their integrated audit, which includes the audit of the Internal Control System over Financial Information (ICFR)  on the system for the internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). For this purpose, the Accounts Auditor has direct access at all times to Senior Management and the Chairman of the Audit and Control Committee, and, in parallel with the Internal Auditing, it also reports independently to that Committee the results of both the preliminary and final phase of their audit on the ICFR.\n\n## Action plans\n\nIn the event that control deficiencies and/or opportunities for improvement are detected as a result of the assessment of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's Internal Control System for Financial Information (SCIIF), depending on the scope established, the control owners communicate their action plans agreed for solving the identified control deficiencies and/or improvement opportunities, as well as the deadlines scheduled for their implementation  which is regularly monitored by the Audit and Control Committee. These action plans have as fundamental objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 To remedy the control deficiencies identified in the ICFR annual assessment, so that the control activities are designed and operate in an effective manner, or failing that, the risk generated is substantially mitigated.\n- \u00b7 To prioritize the implementation of improvement opportunities in the efficiency of processes; improvement opportunities are defined as such, since they do not constitute internal control deficiencies.\n\n## Conclusion of the assessment of the Internal Control System for Financial Information (ICFR) as of December 31, 2023.\n\nInternal Audit has carried out its assessment of the effectiveness of the Internal Control System for Financial Information (ICFR) as of December 31, 2023.

Under no circumstances shall such a requirement not be fulfilled, on the grounds of the importance or the confidential nature of the information, apart from absolutely exceptional cases.\n\nIn this regard, and in accordance with Articles 18 and 20 of the Regulation of the Board of Directors, at the beginning of each year the Board of Directors and its Committees set the calendar of ordinary meetings to be held during the year. The calendar may be amended by resolution of the Board itself, or by decision of the Chairman, in which case the Directors shall be made aware of the amendment as soon as practicable.

The Agenda for each meeting will clearly state points on which the Board of Directors, or the Executive Committee, have to adopt a decision or resolution.\n\nFor the same purpose, in general, the Directors are sent the documentation related to the agenda of the meetings sufficiently in advance. In accordance with Article 19 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors organizes the debates, promoting and encouraging all Directors to play an active role in the deliberations, safeguarding their right to freely adopt their own position on all matters. Moreover, with the assistance of the Secretary, he shall ensure that the Directors are sent sufficient information to discuss the points set out in the agenda sufficiently in advance of the meeting. He also ensures that sufficient time is given over to discussing strategic matters, and shall encourage debate during meetings, safeguarding the Directors' right to adopt their positions freely on all points discussed.\n\nTo provide all the information and clarifications necessary in relation to certain points deliberated, the Group's senior executive officers attend nearly all the Board and Committee meetings to explain the matters within their powers.\n\nFurthermore, and as a general rule, the Regulations of the Board of Directors (Article 25) expressly establish that Directors are granted the broadest powers to obtain information about all aspects of the Company, to examine its books, records, documents and other data regarding corporate transactions.

Annual remuneration on which the indemnity is based is the last fixed remuneration and the arithmetic mean of the last two variable remuneration payments received by contract .\n\nRegarding the contracts of members of Senior Management, in general, they are contractually entitled the right to receive the economic compensation indicated below in the event that their employment relationship is ended for reasons attributable to the Company or, in some instances, is due to objective reasons such as a change of control in the Company. However, if the employment relationship is terminated because of a breach attributable to the Executive, he/she will not be entitled to any compensation whatsoever. That notwithstanding, in certain cases the severance benefit to be received by the member of Senior Management according to their contract is not calculated as per these general criteria, but rather is based on other circumstances of a personal or professional nature or on the time when the contract was signed. The agreed economic compensation for the termination of the employment relationship, where applicable, consists of a maximum of three times annual remuneration plus another year based on length of service at the Company. Annual remuneration on which the indemnity is based is the last fixed remuneration and the arithmetic mean of the last two variable remuneration payments received by contract.\n\nMeanwhile, contracts that tie employees to the Company under a common employment relationship do not include indemnity clauses for the termination of their employment. In these cases, the employee is entitled to any indemnity set forth in prevailing labor legislation.

Degree of Compliance with Corporate Governance Recommendations\n\nSpecify the Company's degree of compliance with recommendations of the Good Governance Code for listed companies.\n\nIn the event that a recommendation is not followed or only partially followed, a detailed explanation of the reasons must be included so that shareholders, investors and the market in general have enough information to assess the company's conduct. General explanations are not acceptable.\n\n- 1. That the Articles of Association of listed companies should not limit the maximum number of votes that may be cast by one shareholder or contain other restrictions that hinder the takeover of control of the company through the acquisition of its shares on the market.\n\n## Explain\n\nIn accordance with Article 26 of the Corporate Bylaws, no shareholder may cast a number of votes in excess of 10 percent of the total voting capital existing at any time, regardless of the number of shares held by such shareholder and in full compliance with mandatory requirements of law. In determining the maximum number of votes that each shareholder may cast, only the shares held by each such shareholder shall be computed. It does not include additional votes cast on behalf of other shareholders who may have appointed them as proxy, who are themselves likewise restricted by the 10 percent voting ceiling.\n\nThe limitation established in the preceding paragraphs shall also apply to the maximum number of votes that may be collectively or individually cast by two or more shareholder companies belonging to the same group of entities, as well as to the maximum number of votes that may be cast by an individual or corporate shareholder and the entity or entities that are shareholders themselves and which are directly or indirectly controlled by such individual or corporate shareholder.\n\nIn addition, Article 30 of the Corporate Bylaws stipulates that no person may be appointed as Director unless they have held, for more than three years prior to their appointment, a number of shares of the Company representing a nominal value of at least 3,000 euros, which the Director may not transfer while in office. These requirements shall not apply to those persons who, at the time of their appointment, are related to the Company under an employment or professional relationship, or when the Board of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report\n\nDirectors resolves to waive such requirements with the favorable vote of at least 85 percent of its members.\n\nArticle 31 of the Corporate Bylaws establishes that, in order for a Director to be appointed Chairman, ViceChairman, Chief Executive Officer or member of the Executive Commission, it shall be necessary for such Director to have served on the Board for at least the three years immediately prior to any such appointment. However, such length of service shall not be required if the appointment is made with the favorable vote of at least 85 percent of the members of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Corporate Bylaws (Article 26) restrict the number of shares that may be cast by a single shareholder or by shareholders belonging to the same group in order to achieve a suitable balance and protect the position of minority shareholders, thus avoiding a potential concentration of votes among a reduced number of shareholders, which could impact on the guiding principle that the General Shareholders' Meeting must act in the social interest and interest of all the shareholders. Telef\u00f3nica believes that this measure does not constitute a blocking mechanism of takeover bids but rather a guarantee that the acquisition of control required the sufficient support of all shareholders, because, naturally, and as taught by experience, potential offerors may make their offer conditional upon the removal of this requirement.\n\nIn relation to the above and in accordance with the provisions of Article 527 of the Spanish Corporations Act, any clauses in the Bylaws of listed corporations that directly or indirectly restrict the number of shares that may be cast by a single shareholder by shareholders belonging to the same group or by any parties acting together with the aforementioned, will rendered null and void when, subsequent to a takeover bid, the offeror has a stake equal to or over 70% of the share capital which confers voting rights, unless the offeror was not subject to neutralization measures to prevent a takeover bid or had not adapted these measures accordingly.\n\nIn addition, the special requirements for appointment as Director (Article 30 of the Corporate Bylaws) or as Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Chief Operating Officer or member of the Executive Commission (Article 31 of the Corporate Bylaws) are justified by the desire that access to the management decision-making body and to the most significant positions thereon is reserved to persons who have demonstrated their commitment to the Company and who, in addition, have adequate experience as members of the Board, such that continuity of the management model adopted by the Telef\u00f3nica Group may be assured in the interest of all of its shareholders and stakeholders. In any event, these special requirements may be waived by broad consensus among the members of the Board of Directors, namely, with the favorable vote of at least 85",

Annual Report on Remuneration\n\n## Introduction to the report\n\nThis section 5.1 and the section 5.2 below form the Annual Report, which must be drawn up and submitted to a vote of the General Shareholders' Meeting in an advisory manner. Pursuant to the provisions in Act 5 of April 12, 2021, amending the redrafted text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, this report forms part of the Company's Management Report. This will remain accessible on the websites of the Company and the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) for the legally stipulated term.\n\nThis report is essentially composed of two sections:\n\n- \u00b7 First, a summary of our Directors' Remuneration Policy (the Remuneration Policy) applicable in 2024, approved at the Company's General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2023, with 92.66% of the votes cast (this policy can be accessed at the following link: https:// www.telefonica.com/en/wp-content/uploads/ sites/5/2021/10/remunerations-policy-directorstelefonica.pdf).\n- \u00b7 Secondly, it provides a description of how the Directors' Remuneration Policy has been applied during the fiscal year 2023. Two remuneration policies were applied that year;\n- \u00b7 From 1 January to March 30, 2023, the Directors' Remuneration Policy approved at the Company's General Shareholders' Meeting held on April 23, 2021, with 88.97% of the votes cast. (this policy can be accessed at the following link: https://telefonica.com/ en/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/10/PoliticaRemuneraciones-Consejeros-punto-IX-Orden-deldia.pdf).\n- \u00b7 From March 31, until December 31, 2023, the Directors' Remuneration Policy approved by the Company's General Shareholders' Meeting on March 31, 2023.\n\nOutlined below is the background against which certain decisions related to the Remuneration Policy and its application have been made and considered by the Nominating, Compensation, and Corporate Governance Committee (NCCGC) and the Board of Directors of the Company\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica's results in 2023\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has once again delivered solid results in 2023. Despite a changing macroeconomic context and uncertain competitive and regulatory environments, Telef\u00f3nica once again met its commitments to the market for the third consecutive year (since COVID). These commitments had been revised upwards with the publication of the results for the first half of the year. In fact, with the publication of a Free Cash Flow figure of 4,227 million euros (reported in euros, including exchange rate impacts), Telef\u00f3nica has exceeded market expectations and its own ambition to reach around 4 billion euros. Free Cash Flow is the best and most accurate indicator of the Company's situation as it reflects both the Company's operational performance and its increasingly solid strategic positioning.\n\nAt the operating level, revenues and OIBDA grew between 3% and 4% in organic terms, as well as in reported terms.\n\nIn terms of positioning, the ongoing execution of the Company's strategic plan is enabling it to continue to make progress in its transformation, becoming more relevant for Telef\u00f3nica's customers, with networks at the cutting edge of technology, and with efficiency levels that make the Company fit for the future.\n\nBased on the above, Telef\u00f3nica has confirmed compliance with its targets and the cash dividend set for 2023.\n\nIn addition to the above, Telef\u00f3nica continues to be an industry leader in terms of ESG, being part of CDP's Climate A List and holding the top position in the Digital Inclusion Benchmark (from the World Benchmarking Alliance), Ranking Digital Rights and FTSE4Good.\n\nIn more detail, the following aspects of the 2023 results would stand out:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a strong market position and growing value access, up 14% in FTTH (fibre to the home) and 3% in mobile contracts, while continuing to accelerate 5G deployment. In addition, improvements have been made in network agility, efficiency, intelligence, quality and sustainability (zero-touch process and AI). This is evidenced by the improvement in customer loyalty as measured by the Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 31 (+1 p.p. vs. 2022) and the reduction in customer churn rate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenue growth has been supported by service revenues (+3.8%), as well as the strong performance of B2B revenues (+6.3%), with T. Tech being a differential growth engine. Meanwhile, OIBDA growth is explained by a consistent generation of efficiencies through the transformation process undertaken by the company in recent years, which more than offsets inflationary pressures.\n- \u00b7 The intensity of invested capital has decreased, resulting in an 8% growth in the OIBDA-CapEx ratio in 2023 (+8% organic). Additionally, the cash margin has improved by 0.8 percentage points to 19%, reflecting the Company's enhanced operational leverage.\n- \u00b7 All of the above has allowed the Free Cash Flow, as above-mentioned, to reach EUR 3,98 billion, and EUR 4,227 millions excluding spectrum, exceeding the ambition communicated to the market with the release of first-half year results of around EUR 4 billion euros.\n\nAs part of Telef\u00f3nica's commitment to create value for its stakeholders, the following milestones were achieved in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Despite the macroeconomic context with high inflation and uncertainty, the sound evolution of the business has resulted in a strong performance of the stock and has allowed to continue with the dividend distribution policy. As a result, Telef\u00f3nica's Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") over the last three years (2021-2023) has reached to 37.9%, outperforming the TSR of the Ibex-35 which was 37%, and the median TSR of the peer group used in the Long-Term Incentive Plan which was of 17.9%.\n- \u00b7 The Company has updated its Climate Action Plan, approved by the Board of Directors, positioning Telef\u00f3nica ahead of various regulatory requirements and in line with the recommendations of the TCFD (\"Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\") with more details on climate-related risks and opportunities, monitoring mechanisms, and accountability within the governance model, among other aspects.\n- \u00b7 Reduction of Scope 1+2 CO 2 emissions by 81% compared to 2015 globally (51% considering Scope 1+2+3).\n- \u00b7 40% of women on the Board of Directors and 32,8% women in executive positions at December 31, 2023.\n- \u00b7 Fair and equal pay for work of equal value, with an adjusted pay gap of 0.7%.\n- \u00b7 33.6% of the Group's total funding comes from funding linked to sustainability criteria.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\nAnnual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\n## New Strategic Plan 2023-2026 (\"GPS Plan\") and alignment of the Remuneration Policy\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has fulfilled the 5 strategic pillars presented in 2019. Our core markets have strengthened their position; Telef\u00f3nica Tech has been key to complete our B2B transformation process; Telef\u00f3nica Infra has not only reinforced the value of our infrastructure assets, but through the deployment of FTTH networks has contributed to the improvement of growth in our markets; and we have continued to reduce the exposure to the region in Hispam, establishing a more sustainable and selfsufficient model.\n\nIn this regard, the radical transformation carried out over the last few years has generated operational efficiencies and reduced capital intensity. Over the last three years (since the presentation in November 2019 of the previous strategic plan) the Company has returned to growth in reported terms, improved its OIBDA-CapEx margin, reduced its leverage levels and restored the payment of an attractive cash dividend. All of the above has allowed Telef\u00f3nica to rank as one of the best companies in the sector in terms of operating cash margins.\n\nIn this context, Telef\u00f3nica's new Strategic Plan - \"Plan GPS\" for the period 2023-2026 - was presented on 8 November. According to this plan, the Company aims to continue to grow (\"Growth\"), with greater profitability (\"Profitability\") and in a more sustainable way (\"Sustainability\").\n\nThe main financial targets of the GPS Plan are an approximate reported annual revenue growth of 1%, 2% CAGR of EBITDA, 5% CAGR of operating cash (EBITDAaL CapEx) and above 10% CAGR of cash generation (Free Cash Flow). In addition, the Company is committed to pay, at a minimum, a cash dividend of 0.30 euros per share in the period 2023-2026.\n\nTo achieve these new and ambitious goals, the GPS plan relies on five key vectors to accelerate their achievement: (i) the sustainability of B2C revenue growth; (ii) maintaining the momentum of the B2B business; (iii) the evolution of revenue derived from agreements with the company's partners; (iv) obtaining efficiencies to help reduce cost structure; and (v) maintaining Telef\u00f3nica's differential profile in the sector, being able to reduce investment.\n\nIn this context, the Remuneration Policy to be applied in 2024, specifically the design of Short and Long-Term Variable Remuneration, aims to incentivize the achievement of the strategic priorities of the GPS Plan (growth, profitability, and sustainability), as well as value creation for shareholders and other stakeholders. Section 5.1.4 of the Report provides detailed information on this matter.",

For the first cycle 2024-2026, the objectives and weights that are planned to be proposed to the 2024 Annual General Shareholders Meeting are Relative TSR (50%), Free Cash Flow (40%), CO2 Emissions Scope 1+2 Neutralization (5%), and, as a novelty, with the aim of reflecting Telef\u00f3nica's ambition for gender equality, the presence of women in executive positions (5%).\n\nIn addition, with the aim of incentivizing cash flow generation, it will be proposed the possibility of paying up to 150% of the incentive linked to this objective in case (i) a 115% level of achievement is reached and (ii) to ensure continuity in cash flow generation, the annual target objective is met in each of the three years of each cycle (for further information, see section 5.1.4).\n\n## Implementation of the Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy in 2023\n\nBelow is a summary of the main characteristics of the remuneration of Executive Directors for the year 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed components of remuneration (Fixed Remuneration, Remuneration in Kind, and Pension Plan): unchanged from the previous year, subject to minor differences in the valuation of Remuneration in Kind.\n- \u00b7 Short-Term Variable Remuneration: The metrics and relative weights established for 2023 were Operating Income (30%), OIBDA (30%), Free Cash Flow (20%), and non-financial objectives - ESG (20%).\n\nThe weighted payment coefficient has risen to 85,92% of the maximum amount, as a result of the overall achievement level of financial objectives being above the target level. In addition, the degree of performance of the non-financial - ESG has exceeded target levels except for Rep Trak, which has remained almost at the target level.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\nAnnual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\n- \u00b7 Long-Term Variable Remuneration: the performance period of the first cycle of the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in 2021 ended on 31 December 2023. 50% of the incentive was subject to the relative TSR, 40% to the Free Cash Flow generated in each of the years of the performance period, and 10% to the Neutralization of CO2 emissions Scope 1+2. Due to the strong performance of the stock and dividends paid during the 2021-2023 period, Telef\u00f3nica's TSR has reached 37.9%. This percentage is higher than the TSR obtained by most of the companies in Telef\u00f3nica's comparison group, allowing the payout linked to the Relative TSR objective to reach 78.9%. Additionally, both (i) the Free Cash Flow objective has been achieved, enabling the Company to continue reducing debt and improving flexibility, and (ii) the Neutralization of CO2 emissions objective has been achieved, in line with the commitments made by the Company regarding carbon emissions. Thus, the weighted payout coefficient of the Long-Term Variable Remuneration has reached 89.45%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Executive Directors' remuneration in 2024\n\n- \u00b7 The Fixed Remuneration of the Executive Chairman has remained unchanged since 2013 when it was determined for his position as Chief Executive Officer and remained the same after his appointment as Chairman in 2016. In the case of the Chief Operating Officer, his amount remains unchanged since his appointment in 2017.\n- \u00b7 Variable performance-related remuneration is significant in relation to total remuneration (79% for the Executive Chairman and 77% for the Chief Operating Officer)\n- \u00b7 The main characteristics of variable remuneration remain unchanged, without prejudice to adapting metrics and achievement levels to the new Strategic Plan 2023-2026 (GPS Plan) and its main axes (Growth, Profitability, and Sustainability).\n- \u00b7 Long-Term Variable Remuneration: it is expected to propose to the General Shareholders Meeting the approval of the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2024-2028, which will have similar characteristics to previous plans, and the maximum value of the allocated shares is below the maximum limit established in the Remuneration Policy.\n- \u00b7 The structure and contribution levels (as a percentage of base salary) of the Executive Directors' Pension Plan are aligned with the conditions that apply to the rest of Telef\u00f3nica's employees in Spain.\n- \u00b7 Executive Directors fulfil the commitment to hold shares equivalent to two years of their gross Fixed Remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Telef\u00f3nica has an Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy, which clearly and comprehensively regulates the Company's right to recover variable remunerations paid during the general three-year clawback period.\n\nAs specified above, on the date of this Report, the Executive Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. are Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete L\u00f3pez, Executive Chairman, and Mr. \u00c1ngel Vil\u00e1 Boix, Chief Operating Officer (COO).",

GROWTH, in the form of Operative Revenue objective included in Short-Term Variable Remuneration and the commitment to long-term shareholder value creation reflected in the Relative TSR metric included in Long-Term Variable Remuneration.\n- ii. PROFITABILITY, with the inclusion of the EBITDA objective in Short-Term Variable Remuneration, replacing the OIBDA objective.\n- iii. SUSTAINABILITY, both from a financial perspective and from the ESG perspective:\n- -Financial: generation of Free Cash Flow growth included in both Short-Term and Long-Term Variable Remuneration.\n- -ESG: through objectives related to the reduction of CO2 emissions, customer trust, and the percentage of women in executives positions. In this regard, the weighting of the latter objective has been increased in ShortTerm Variable Remuneration and included in Long-Term Variable Remuneration.\n\nAll the objectives are predetermined, specific, quantifiable and aligned with Telef\u00f3nica's strategic goals, strictly determined and assessed by the NCCGC, which monitors them, so that their alignment with Telef\u00f3nica's social interests is ensured.\n\nFrom the perspective of the remuneration mix the Executive Directors' pay package is leveraged mainly on variable remuneration, with most of the total remuneration being received only if the objectives set out for the shortand long-term variable remuneration are met. This pay structure is consistent with the 'pay for performance' principle.\n\nThe Executive Directors therefore may not receive any variable remuneration in the event that the minimum performance thresholds are not met. The short-term and long-term variable remuneration percentage is significant in relation to the total remuneration. The pay mix for Telef\u00f3nica's Executive Directors is shown below, a scenario where objectives an achieved at a target level:\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n## Annual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\n## Executive Directors' remuneration structure for 2024\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, results-based remuneration has a significant weighting in total remuneration (remuneration structure for 100% or target level achievement)*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Type of objective                                           | Metric                                                   | Weighting   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Operating and  financial  objectives (80%)                  | Free Cash Flow                                           | 30%         |\n| Operating and  financial  objectives (80%)                  | EBITDA 1                                                 | 25%         |\n| Operating and  financial  objectives (80%)                  | Operating  Revenue                                       | 25%         |\n| Sustainability  objectives - ESG (20%)                      | Gender Equality -  % of women in                         | 5%          |\n|                                                             | executive positions Climate Change -  GHG Emissions      | 5%          |\n| Value creation for  shareholders and  financial  objectives | Relative TSR 2                                           | 50%         |\n| (90%)                                                       | Free Cash Flow                                           | 40%         |\n| Sustainability  objectives - ESG                            | Neutralization of  CO2 Emissions                         | 5%          |\n| (10%)                                                       | Gender Equality -  % of women in  executive  positions 1 | 5%          |",

As part of this process, an external competitiveness remuneration analyses are conducted, and the remuneration policy of the Executives and the organization's employees is also considered.\n\nTo carry out external competitiveness analyses, under the framework established in the Remuneration Policy, it is expected to propose a reference market established based on a series of objective criteria, as outlined below:\n\n- 1. Sufficient number of companies to obtain statistically reliable and robust results.\n- 2. Size (revenue, asset volume, market capitalization, and number of employees) and complexity of the business. For each of the selected companies, the dimension data for each of the mentioned variables must fall within predetermined ranges.\n- 3. Geographic distribution: Only companies included in the Stoxx All Europe 100, Ibex-35, and European companies in the telecommunications sector have been considered.\n- 4. Geographical scope: Companies with international presence.\n- 5. Sectoral distribution: Multi sectoral sample with a homogeneous distribution, avoiding overrepresentation of sectors very different from Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nTaking these criteria into account, the comparison group would be composed of 20 European companies with international presence. The most represented geographies will be those where Telef\u00f3nica's business presence is highest. Consequently, the country that will contribute with a higher number of companies to the comparison group will be Spain. Additionally, it will ensure of that the telecommunications sector has the highest relative weight within the group.\n\nConsidering this comparison group, the total remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer in a target scenario of objective achievement would fall between the median and the 75th percentile of the peer group.\n\n## Components of the remuneration package in 2024:\n\nThe elements included in the remuneration package for executive directors for the performance of their executive duties are similar to those of the 2023 fiscal year:\n\n## A.

For such purpose, it applies the internal objective assessment rules and procedures set out by the Company for its executives. When conducting this assessment, the NCCGC is supported by the Audit and Control Committee, which provides information about the results audited by the company's external auditor\n\n(PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS AUDITORES, S.L.) and by the internal audit. The Committee also considers any associated risk for both setting the objectives and assessing their performance thereof.\n\nIn this respect, any positive or negative economic effects caused by extraordinary events that could distort the findings of the assessment are disregarded and the longterm quality of the results and any associated risk are considered in the proposed Short-Term Variable Remuneration.\n\nThe Short-Term Variable Remuneration is fully paid in cash providing the targets set for this purpose have been\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n## Annual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\nachieved. This remuneration will not be paid until the NCCGC and the Audit and Supervisory Committee have carried out the actions described above in the first quarter of the following year, in line with recommendation 59 of the CNMV's Good Governance Code for listed companies.\n\nMoreover, the NCCGC is authorized make a proposal to the Board of Directors to fully or partially cancel payment of the short-term variable remuneration if certain unforeseen circumstances arise, as described in this Report, as well as its partial or full clawback within twentyfour (36) months after the payment thereof.\n\nThis clawback authority has been developed in a specific Recoupment Policy (\"Executive Officer Compensation Recoupment Policy\") approved by the Board of Directors in 2023, at the proposal of the NCCGC, applicable to Executive Directors and other Company executives, with which Telef\u00f3nica consolidates its commitment to best practices in remuneration at the international level and complies with the listing requirements for issuers of foreign securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The following section on variable remuneration clawback clauses sets out the main terms of this policy.\n\n## C. LONG-TERM VARIABLE REMUNERATION\n\n## Purpose:\n\nTo increase the Executive Directors' and management team's commitment to the company and its corporate plan, linking their remuneration to creating value for the shareholders and sustainable strategic objective performance, so that they are in line with the best remuneration practices. In turn, by means of its Long-Term Incentive Plan, the company also aims at offering a competitive remuneration package that contributes to retaining the managers who hold key positions in the organization.\n\n## Description of granted Long-Term Variable Remuneration incentives in force in 2024 :\n\nThe cycles in force in 2024 arising from long-term incentive plans are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                       | Performance  period                                                                   | Number of granted shares for  achieving 100% of objectives (Value of shares allocated as % of  Fixed Remuneration) Executive  Chairman Chief  Operating   | Number of granted shares for  achieving 100% of objectives (Value of shares allocated as % of  Fixed Remuneration) Executive  Chairman Chief  Operating   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                       |                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                           | Officer                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General  Shareholders' Meeting of 2021       | Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General  Shareholders' Meeting of 2021       | Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General  Shareholders' Meeting of 2021                                                                           | Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General  Shareholders' Meeting of 2021                                                                           |\n| Second cycle                                                                          | 2022-2024                                                                             | 995,000 (200%)                                                                                                                                            | 745,000  (180%)                                                                                                                                           |\n| Third cycle                                                                           | 2023-2025                                                                             | 1,110,000  (200%)                                                                                                                                         | 831,000  (180%)                                                                                                                                           |\n| Long-Term Incentive Plan to be approved by the General  Shareholders' Meeting of 2024 | Long-Term Incentive Plan to be approved by the General  Shareholders' Meeting of 2024 | Long-Term Incentive Plan to be approved by the General  Shareholders' Meeting of 2024                                                                     | Long-Term Incentive Plan to be approved by the General  Shareholders' Meeting of 2024                                                                     |\n| First cycle                                                                           | 2024-2026                                                                             | Pending grant                                                                                                                                             | Pending grant                                                                                                                                             |",

In any case, the grant will be made respecting the maximum limit established in the Remuneration Policy.\n- \u00b7 The number of shares indicated for the cycles of the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting of 2021 is the maximum number that the Executive Directors may receive in case of meeting or exceeding the targets. This number is significantly lower than the maximum limit approved in the aforementioned Meeting\n- \u00b7 If the objectives are met, the shares will be delivered once the accounts for the last financial year of the measurement period have been prepared and audited, as established in recommendation 59 of the CNMV's Code of Good Governance for listed companies.\n\n## Operation of the New Long-Term Incentive Plan 2024-2028 :\n\nAt the next General Shareholders' Meeting in 2024, it is planned to propose a Long-Term Incentive Plan 2024-2028 consisting of the delivery of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. shares to Telef\u00f3nica Group Executives, including Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. Executive Directors who, complying with the requirements established for such purpose, are invited to participate in the Plan.\n\nIt is expected to have a total duration of five (5) years and to be divided into three (3) cycles, independent of each other, of three (3) years each (First Cycle 2024-2026, Second Cycle 2025-2027 and Third Cycle 2026-2028).\n\nThe design of the Plan has similar characteristics to those of the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting in 2021, without prejudice to the inclusion of the following new features in the First Cycle to align it with the GPS Plan: (i) possibility of a payout level above the target level in the event of overachievement of the Free Cash Flow target and (ii) incorporation of the objective of percentage of women in executive positions.\n\nThe shares corresponding to each cycle will be delivered three years after the beginning of each cycle, once the accounts for the last financial year of the measurement period have been prepared and audited, as established in recommendation 59 of the CNMV's Good Governance Code of Listed Companies.\n\nThe metrics to be established for the First Cycle of the Long Term Incentive Plan 2024-2026 are Relative TSR (50%), Free Cash Flow (40%), CO2 Emission Neutralisation (5%) and presence of Women in Executive positions (5%):\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n## Annual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\n| Metrics                           | Weighting  (%)   | Company results           | Incentive to be  accrued(%)   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Relative TSR 1                    | 50%              | 75th percentile or  above | 100%                          |\n| Relative TSR 1                    | 50%              | Median                    | 30%                           |\n|                                   |                  | Below median              | 0%                            |\n|                                   | 40%              | 115% achievement          | 150%                          |\n|                                   | 40%              | 100% achievement          | 100%                          |\n| Free Cash Flow                    | 40%              | 92% achievement           | 50%                           |\n|                                   | 40%              | Below 90%  achievement    | 0%                            |\n| Neutralization  of CO2  emissions | 5%               | 100% achievement          | 100%                          |\n| Neutralization  of CO2  emissions | 5%               | 90% achievement           | 50%                           |\n| scopes 1+2                        | 5%               | Below 90%  achievement    | 0%                            |\n| Gender Equality  - Presence of    | 5%               | 100% achievement          | 100%                          |\n| Women in                          | 5%               | 90% achievement           | 50%                           |\n| Executive  Positions              | 5%               | Below 90%  achievement    | 0%                            |\n\n- 1 Comparison group: Vodafone Group, America Movil, Deutsche Telekom, BT Group, Orange, Telecom Italia, Telenor, TeliaSonera, Swisscom, Koninklijke KPN, TIM Brasil, Proximus, Millicom, Liberty Global.\n- 2 In addition, a minimum level of emission reductions must be achieved for the incentive to be paid.\n\nEach of these metrics is explained below:\n\n## Relative TSR (50%)\n\nDefinition: Share profitability taking into account the sum of the cumulative variation of Telef\u00f3nica's share value, plus the dividends and other similar items received by shareholders during the cycle in question.\n\nDetermining the level of achievement : The evolution of TSR from Telef\u00f3nica's shares is measured from the beginning of the cycle (2024) until the end of such cycle (2026), in relation to the TSR from other companies pertaining to the telecommunication sector, weighted depending on their relevance to Telef\u00f3nica S.A. that, for the purpose of the Plan, will be used as the comparison group. The companies included in the comparison group are the following: Vodafone Group, America Movil, Deutsche Telekom, BT Group, Orange, Telecom Italia, Telenor, TeliaSonera, Swisscom, Koninklijke KPN, TIM Brasil, Proximus, Millicom and Liberty Global.\n\nPerformance Scale: The number of shares to be delivered associated with the performance of this objective will be between 15% of the number of target theoretical shares granted, in the case the evolution of the TSR of Telef\u00f3nica S.A.'s shares is, at least, the median of the Comparison Group (below this threshold no incentive will be payable) and 50% if the evolution is in the third or higher quartile of the comparison group. The results between the median and the third quartile, the incentive level will be calculated by linear interpolation.",

Minimum threshold of 92% achievement, below which no incentive is paid and the performance of which implies 20% of the theoretical target actions allocated.\n- ii. Target level of 100% achievement, which implies the delivery of 40% of the theoretical target shares assigned.\n- iii. Maximum level of 115% achievement, which would entail the delivery of an additional 20% to the theoretical target shares granted, and which will be applicable provided that the 100% target of Free Cash Flow is met in each of the years comprising this first cycle (2024-2026), thus ensuring continuity in cash generation while incentivizing overachievement.\n\nIt should be noted that the following adjustments have been made with respect to the third cycle of the LongTerm Incentive Plan approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting in 2021 with the aim of aligning Long-Term Variable Remuneration with the ambitious Free Cash Flow target set in the GPS Plan: (i) the minimum requirement level has been raised from 90% to 92%, and (ii) the possibility to over-achieve the objective up to 115% has been established.\n\n## Neutralization of CO 2 Emissions (5%)\n\nDefinition: Level of neutralization/Offset of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's CO2 emissions at the end of each cycle of the Plan, with the additional requirement for this part of the incentive to be paid being to achieve a minimum level of scope 1 + 2 emissions reduction, in line with the 1.5 \u00baC scenario of the Paris Agreement (SBTi). All this is aimed at achieving net zero emissions by 2040 and neutralising scope 1+2 emissions from 2025 in its main markets.\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions consist of direct and indirect CO2 emissions from daily activity caused by fuel consumption, leakage of refrigerant gases and electricity use.\n\nEmission neutralisation/offsetting is the purchase of carbon credits to absorb or reduce CO2 emissions from the atmosphere.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\nAnnual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\nIn accordance with Telef\u00f3nica's Climate Action Plan, and the recommendations of SBTi, carbon credits for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation will also be accepted, with the aim of contributing to slowing deforestation in certain regions where Telef\u00f3nica operates.\n\nCarbon credits involve the purchase of CO2 certificates on the voluntary market. These credits are generated from projects that absorb or reduce the emission of CO2 from the atmosphere, which must be certified to international standards of the highest quality and where possible have social benefits associated with them. This is verified on an annual basis by an external auditor.\n\nDetermining the level of achievement: Neutralisation/ offsetting of emissions is calculated as the ratio between the amount of carbon credits retired on behalf of the Company and the scope 1+2 emissions.\n\nThe level of direct and indirect CO2 emissions from Telef\u00f3nica's daily activity is calculated according to the following formula:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCO 2 emission = Activity Data x Emission Factor\n\n## Where:\n\n- -Activity Data: The amount of energy, fuel, gas, etc. consumed by the company during the year.\n- -Emission Factor: The amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere by the consumption of each activity unit.\n\nFor electricity, the emission factor provided by official sources (European Union, Ministries, CNMC, etc.) is used and for fuels the GHG Protocol emission factors are used and IPCC (UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).\n\nPerformance Scale: The Board of Directors, according to a proposal made by the NCCGC, has determined a performance scale that includes a minimum threshold of 90% achievement, below which no incentive is paid and the achievement of which implies 2.5% of the theoretical shares granted being delivered, and a maximum level of 100% achievement, which implies 5% of the theoretical shares granted being delivered. In addition, achieving a minimum level of emission reductions of Scope 1 + 2, in line with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario of the Paris Agreement (SBTi), will be necessary for this part of the incentive to be paid.\n\n## % of Women in Executive positions (5%)\n\nDefinition: Percentage of women in executive positions in the Telef\u00f3nica Group at 31 December 2026, measured as the number of women in management positions compared to the total number of executive positions in Telef\u00f3nica.\n\n## Determination the level of achievement: The\n\npercentage of women executive positions is compared to the target percentage set by the Board of Directors for 2026.\n\nPerformance Scale: The Board of Directors, at the proposal of the NCCGC, has determined a performance scale that includes a minimum threshold of 90%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

When conducting this assessment, the NCCGC is supported by the Audit and Control Committee, which provides information on the results audited by the external auditor and the Company's internal auditor, which will have been analysed first by the Audit and Control Committee itself. The NCCGC also considers any associated risk for both setting the targets and assessing their achievement.\n\nWhen determining the objective performance level, any positive or negative economic effects caused by extraordinary events that may distort the findings of the assessment are disregarded and the long-term quality of the results are considered in the proposed Long-Term Variable Remuneration.\n\nThe Members will not receive the shares to which they may be entitled until the NCCGC and the Audit and Control Committee have carried out the actions described above.in line with recommendation 59 of the Code of Good Governance.The amount paid, if any, will be subject to the clawback clauses described in the following subsection \"Clawback clauses for variable remuneration\" of this Report.\n\nIn any case, 100% of the shares settled within the scope of the Plan to the Executive Directors are subject to a retention period of two years. In addition, as stipulated in Remuneration Policy the Executive Directors must hold (directly or indirectly) a number of shares (including those settled as remuneration) equivalent to two years' gross Fixed Remuneration as long as they are members on the Board of Directors and perform executive duties.\n\nUntil this requirement is met, the retention period for any shares given to Executive Directors under the Plan, if any, is three years.\n\nThe foregoing is not applicable to the shares that the Executive Directors need to sell to pay the costs related to their acquisition or, with prior consideration of the NCCGC, to cover extraordinary situations where this is required.\n\n## Operation of the Second (2022-2025) and Third cycle (2023-2026) of the Long Term Incentive Plan 2021-2026:\n\nThe main characteristics of these cycles are described in the Annual Directors' Remuneration Reports for the years 2021 and 2022.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the metrics, weightings and payout levels depending on the level of compliance for these cycles are set out below:\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n## Annual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\n| Metrics                                          | Weighting  (%)   | Company results           | Incentive to be  accrued(%)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Relative TSR 1                                   | 50%              | 75th percentile or  above | 100%                          |\n| Relative TSR 1                                   | 50%              | Median                    | 30%                           |\n| Relative TSR 1                                   | 50%              | Below median              | 0%                            |\n| Free Cash Flow                                   | 40%              | 100% achievement          | 100%                          |\n| Free Cash Flow                                   | 40%              | Below 90%  achievement    | 0%                            |\n| Neutralization  of CO2  emissions  scopes 1+2  2 | 10%              | 100% achievement          | 100%                          |\n| Neutralization  of CO2  emissions  scopes 1+2  2 | 10%              | 90% achievement           | 50%                           |\n| Neutralization  of CO2  emissions  scopes 1+2  2 | 10%              | Below 90%  achievement    | 0%                            |\n\n- 2 In addition, a minimum level of emission reductions must be achieved for the incentive to be paid.\n\n## Impact of a change in control on Long-Term Variable Remuneration:\n\nIn the event of a change in control in Telef\u00f3nica, the cycles in progress in 2024 will be subject to early settlement on a pro rata basis, delivering to the Members, where appropriate, the shares, or the equivalent amount in cash, taking into account for such purpose the closing price of the last stock exchange session of the month immediately prior to the date on which the change of control occurs.\n\nThe incentive to be paid is pro-rated for the time elapsed since the start date of the relevant cycle, and adjusted according to the achievement of targets on the date of the change of control.\n\n## D. PENSION PLAN FOR TELEF\u00d3NICA'S EMPLOYEES\n\n## Contributions:\n\nThe Pension Plan for the Executive Directors follows the same structure as in recent years and both the determination of the amounts and the conditions described below are identical to those applied to the rest of Telef\u00f3nica's staff in Spain:\n\n- \u00b7 The Executive Chairman: 6.87% of his base salary, plus 2.2% as a mandatory contribution to be made by the Executive Chairman up to the maximum annual limit that the law stipulates from time to time.\n- \u00b7 Chief Operating Officer: 4.51% of his base salary, plus 2.2% as a mandatory contribution to be made by the Chief Operating Officer up to the maximum annual limit that the law stipulates from time to time.\n\n## Functioning:\n\nAs described in each of the Executive Directors contracts, the Pension Plan is a defined-contribution plan and the contingencies covered are as follows: retirement; the member's death; the beneficiary's death; total and permanent disability to work in one's usual profession,",

It is quantified according to the number of account units that correspond to each member based on the amounts contributed to the Pension Plan and is assessed for the purpose of payment according to the value of the account unit from the business day before the date when the benefits become effective.\n\nThe members may also exercise their vested rights, in whole or in part, on an exceptional basis in the event of serious illness or long-term unemployment.\n\nThe Pension Plan is included within the 'Fonditel B Fondo de Pensiones,' managed by Fonditel Pensiones, EGFP, S.A.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2024 the law may change the financial and tax limits for contributions to pension plans. In this respect, as has been the case in the past, a collective unitlink insurance policy has been taken out to cover the excess of contribution over the annual fiscal limits included in the legislation\n\nThis unit-link insurance policy taken out with the company Plus Ultra, Seguros Generales y Vida, S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros covers the same contingencies as those included in the Pension Plan with the same exceptional liquidity events in the case of serious illness or long-term unemployment.\n\n## E. REMUNERATION IN KIND\n\nIn addition to the life insurance policy covering death or disability described above, the Executive Directors are provided with a general health insurance policy and dental coverage as remuneration in kind and they are also provided with a company vehicle, all of the foregoing in line with the general policy applicable to the Company's Executives.\n\nThe Executive Directors also participated in the Global Employee Share Purchase Plan (PLAN100), under the same conditions as the rest of Telef\u00f3nica's employees. The Executive Directors decided to allocate the maximum amount established in the PLAN 100 (\u20ac1,800) to the acquisition of shares. Under the terms of the PLAN100, the Executive Directors will each receive 589 shares, 489 from their contribution to the acquisition of the shares and 100 which will be given free of charge by the company to all beneficiaries to commemorate the Company's centenary.\n\nMoreover, Telef\u00f3nica has taken out a third-party liability insurance policy (D&O) for its managers, executives and staff performing similar duties in the Telef\u00f3nica Group, with the usual terms and conditions for these kinds of insurance policies. This policy also includes the company's subsidiaries in certain cases.\n\n## Clawback clauses for the variable remuneration\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\nAnnual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has an Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy, which clearly and comprehensively regulates the company's right to recover variable compensations paid during the general three-year clawback period.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy submitted to the vote of the General Shareholders' Meeting in 2023 standardized the clawback clauses applicable to all variable remuneration, establishing that the Board of Directors shall assess, following a report from the NCCGC, whether it is appropriate (i) to cancel all or part of the variable remuneration that is pending payment, and/or (ii) the total or partial recovery of any element of variable remuneration within thirty-six (36) months after the payment thereof (\"clawback\"), when there are certain exceptional circumstances that affect the Company's results, or that derive from an inappropriate conduct of the Executive Director.\n\nAdditionally, this regime has been complemented and developed by an Executive Officer Compensation Recoupment Policy approved by the Board of Directors in 2023, at the proposal of the NCCGC, with which Telef\u00f3nica consolidates its commitment to the best practices in remuneration matters at international level and complies with the listing requirements for issuers of foreign securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as with the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of the United States of America (U. S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act). S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.)\n\nRegarding clawback formulae or clauses in order to claim the return of the variable remuneration components based on results, the following should be taken into account if such components have been paid based on data that is later clearly shown to be inaccurate, and in order to adopt measures to avoid any conflict of interest:\n\n- \u00b7 The NCCGC is authorized to propose cancellation of payment of the variable remuneration to the Board of Directors under circumstances of this kind.\n- \u00b7 Furthermore, the NCCGC must assess whether exceptional circumstances of this kind could even lead to termination of the relationship with the respective party or parties responsible, proposing to the Board of Directors that such measures should be adopted as may be appropriate.\n\nFor these purposes, exceptional situations shall be deemed as those that will be subject to assessment by the Board of Directors, among others, as examples but not limited thereto, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Reformulating the company's financial statements without being based on an amendment of the applicable accounting standards.",

This clause implies that, once the relevant contract has been terminated and during the valid term of the clause (two years after the termination of the contract for any reason), the Executive Directors may not indirectly or directly render their services themselves or through others, either on their own behalf or for third parties, to Spanish or foreign companies that engage in the same or similar business activities as Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nRegarding the conditions related to the termination of the contracts, the Executive Chairman, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarezPallete L\u00f3pez, and the Chief Operating Officer (C.O.O.), Mr. \u00c1ngel Vil\u00e1 Boix, have the same terms and conditions as in their previous contracts, which specify agreed severance pay for termination of the relationship, when appropriate, which could amount to a maximum of four (4) annual payments. Each annual payment consists of the last fixed remuneration and the arithmetic mean of the sum of the last two (2) amounts of annual variable remuneration paid pursuant to the contracts.\n\nIn addition, the Executive Directors are members of an Executive Pension Plan that covers the contingencies of retirement, early retirement, permanent total or absolute disability or severe disability and death, the annual contribution to which is equivalent to 35% of the Fixed Remuneration, after deducting the contributions made to the Pension Plan for Telef\u00f3nica employees described in section D above. However, the receipt of the remuneration described in the previous paragraph is incompatible with the awarding of any financial rights related to this Executive Pension Plan. Therefore, if an Executive Director receives the aforementioned financial remuneration, he/ she would not be entitled to any financial rights under this Plan.\n\nThe implementation vehicle of this Plan approved in 2006 is a unit-linked group life insurance policy taken out with an insurance company, and the amount of the benefit under this guarantee will be equivalent to the mathematical provision applicable to the insured on the date on which the policyholder notifies and proves to the\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\nAnnual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\ninsurance company that he/she is in one of the situations covered by the Plan.\n\nThere is currently no vesting of economic rights in favor of the Executive Directors. In the case of legislative amendments on this matter, according to a proposal made by the NCCGC, the Board of Directors could make the appropriate adjustments.\n\nEven though there are no changes planned for the functioning of this Plan, any adjustments to be made to the Executive Pension Plan must be approved by the Board of Directors. These adjustments must be justified and proposed by the NCCGC. The reasons for the adjustments must be duly explained in the annual report on the directors' remuneration.\n\n## Contractual terms and conditions for the Executive Directors\n\nThe contracts that currently regulate the Executive Directors performing their duties and responsibilities are of a commercial nature and include clauses that are normally used for these kinds of contracts. These contracts were been proposed by the NCCGC, approved by the Board of Directors and have not suffered any significant modifications in 2023.\n\nIn addition to the severance pay terms and conditions explained in the previous point, a summary is provided below of the main terms and conditions of the Executive Directors' contracts:\n\n- \u00b7 Term: Indefinite\n- \u00b7 Prior notice: There is an obligation to provide prior notice in the event of the contract being terminated due to a unilateral decision adopted by the Chief Operating Officer, being stipulated that he must notify such unilateral decision in writing with at least three months' prior notice, except in cases of force majeure. If this obligation is not fulfilled, he must pay the Company an amount equivalent to the Fixed Remuneration for the period of prior notice he had failed to observe.\n- \u00b7 Exclusivity: During the term of the contracts, it is prohibited to sign (either directly or through intermediaries) any employment, commercial or civil contracts with other companies or institutions that engage in activities similar in nature to those of Telef\u00f3nica.\n- \u00b7 Non-competition clause: The contract states the relationship is compatible with holding representative, administrative and management posts and other professional positions in other companies in the Telef\u00f3nica Group or in any other undertakings unrelated to the Company when expressly notified to the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nOn the other hand, it states that the relationship is incompatible, during the term of the clause (two (2) years after the termination of the contract for any reason) with directly or indirectly rendering services, as an employee",

This policy is consistent with the one approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting on April 23, 2021. In relation to Executive Directors, the possibility of granting extraordinary remuneration was eliminated, and the duration of the clawback period was extended to thirty-six (36) months.\n\nThere have been no deviations from the procedure for the application of the Remuneration Policy in force at any given time, nor have any temporary exceptions to it been applied.\n\nIn this respect, the remuneration obtained in 2023 to the Executive Directors and the Directors in their positions as such consists of the same components as those described for the current Remuneration Policy in force in 2024.\n\nThe detailed description of the Directors' remuneration system for 2023 was included in section 5.1.4 of the DRR for 2022. This report was approved by 92.81% of the votes cast, with a 6.28% of votes against and 0.91% abstentions.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\nAnnual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\n## The Executive Directors' remuneration in 2023\n\n\u00b7 The Fixed Remuneration of the Executive Chairman\n\nhas remained unchanged since 2013 when it was determined for his position as Chief Executive Officer and remained the same after his appointment as Chairman in 2016.

This percentage is explained by the good performance of Telef\u00f3nica's Free Cash Flow and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in the period 2021-2023, which was above the TSR obtained by most of the companies included in the comparison group. In addition, Telef\u00f3nica has met its Emission Neutralisation target.\n- \u00b7 The total remuneration earned by Executive Directors is below the maximum remuneration established in\n\n## A.

The theoretical number of granted shares, corresponding to the Executive Directors, if 100% of the TSR, Free Cash Flow and Neutralization of CO2 emissions objectives are achieved, was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Executive Chairman: 1,094,000 shares.\n- \u00b7 The Chief Operating Officer: 819,000 shares.\n\nIn order to determine the correct number of shares to be granted at the end of the aforementioned cycle, the NCCGC analysed the level of achievement of each of the three objectives.\n\n| Metries                           | Weighting (%)   | Company  Results                  | Incentive  accrued (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Relative TSR*                     | 50%             | 75th percentile or  above  Median | 100%                     |\n| Relative TSR*                     | 50%             |                                   | 30%                      |\n| Relative TSR*                     | 50%             | Below median                      | 0%                       |\n| Free Cash  Flow                   | 40%             | 100% of  achievement              | 100%                     |\n| Free Cash  Flow                   | 40%             | 90% performance                   | 50%                      |\n| Neutralization  of CO2  emissions | 10%             | 100% of  achievement              | 100%                     |\n| Neutralization  of CO2  emissions | 10%             | 90% performance                   | 50%                      |\n| Neutralization  of CO2  emissions | 10%             | Below 90%  performance            | 0%                       |\n\n- *Comparison group: America Movil, BT Group, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telecom Italia, Vodafone Group, Proximus, Koninklijke KPN, Millicom, Swisscom, Telenor, TeliaSonera, Tim Brasil and Liberty Global.\n\nRegarding the Relative TSR, the weighting of which is 50%, Kepler provided the NCCGC with the calculation of Telef\u00f3nica's Relative TSR since the beginning of the cycle (2021) until its end (2023), related to the TSR obtained by certain companies belonging to the telecommunications sector, weighted according to their relevance for Telef\u00f3nica which are included in the comparison group are the following:\n\nAmerica Movil, BT Group, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telecom Italia, Vodafone Group, Proximus, Koninklijke KPN, Millicom, Swisscom, Telenor, TeliaSonera, Tim Brasil and Liberty Global\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's TSR for the period was 37.9%, ranking sixth in the comparison group, that is, in the 68th percentile according to the established achievement scale. Therefore, the right to receive 78.9% of the shares linked to the achievement of the Relative TSR target has been generated.\n\nRegarding the Free Cash Flow, weight of which is of 40%, the Planning and Supervision Department drew up a report related to the Free Cash Flow generated by the Telef\u00f3nica Group in each year in the objective performance period (2021, 2022 and 2023), based on the results audited by the company's internal and external",

When conducting this assessment, the NCCGC was supported by the Audit and Supervisory Committee, which provides information about the results audited by the Company's external auditor.\n\nIn this respect, the annual achievement level of Free Cash Flow was 135% (year 2021), 108.5% (year 2022) and 106.9% (year 2023). Therefore, the payment coefficient linked to Free Cash Flow was 100%.\n\nIn relation to the CO2 emissions Neutralization/offsetting objective, whose weighting is the remaining 10%, and which also measures the reduction of scope 1 + 2 emissions, in line with the 1.5\u00baC scenario of the Paris Agreement (SBTi), and with the objective set by the Company to reach net zero emissions in 2040 and neutralize scope 1+2 emissions as of 2025 in our main markets. The Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Department prepared a report in relation to the neutralization/offsetting of CO2 emissions as of December 31, 2023, based on the results audited by the Company's internal and external auditor.\n\nThe CNRBG has been periodically monitoring the level of CO2 emissions neutralization/offsetting, and after analyzing the report of the Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Department, has determined the degree of achievement. In this evaluation function, the CNRBG has been supported by the Sustainability and Regulation Committee and the Audit and Control Committee.\n\nIn this respect, the minimum CO2 emissions reduction underpinning that triggers the possibility of assessing the degree of compliance with the CO2 emissions neutralization/compensation target in the different markets has been met, which in this fiscal year was 65% above the target level and, therefore, the payment coefficient linked to CO2 emissions neutralization was 100%.\n\nBearing in mind the results of the Relative TSR, the Free Cash Flow, and the neutralization of CO2 emission, the weighted payment coefficient amounted to 45% (978,583 shares for the Executive Chairman and 732,596 shares for the Chief Operating Officer). This incentive will be delivered during March 2024, once the 2023 financial statements have been prepared and audited, as established in recommendation 59 of the CNMV's Good Governance Code for listed companies.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\n## Annual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\n| Metrics                           | Payment (%)   | Weighting  (%)   | Weighting  payment (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| Relative TSR                      | 78.9 %        | 50.0 %           | 39.45 %                  |\n| Free Cash  Flow                   | 100.0 %       | 40.0 %           | 40.0 %                   |\n| Neutralization  of CO2  emissions | 100.0 %       | 10.0 %           | 10.0 %                   |\n| TOTAL                             | TOTAL         | TOTAL            | 89.45 %                  |\n\nOn the other hand, as detailed in section C) of section 5.1.6 of last year's Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration, in March 2023, the third cycle of the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018-2023 was settled, whose measurement period covered the period 2020-2022 and the incentive was linked to Relative TSR and Free Cash Flow. In this regard, considering that the weighted payment coefficient was 50%, 133,500 shares were paid to the Executive Chairman and 99,000 shares to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## D.

Detailed information on this point can be found in section 5.1.6 of this report.\n- \u00b7 The Remuneration Policy contains specific and consistent clawback clauses, to be applied to any variable remuneration component. In this respect, , in addition to adhering to recommendation 59 of the Good Governance Code when assessing the achievement of objective prior to the payment of variable remuneration, the possibility is established to fully recover any variable remuneration component within thirty-six (36) months after payment thereof (clawback), when certain exceptional situations arise that affect the company's results or are related to the Chief Officer's inappropriate conduct.\n- \u00b7 The Company's Audit and Supervisory Committee takes part in the decision-making process related to the ShortTerm Variable Remuneration of the Executive Directors by verifying the economic-financial and non-financial information that may be part of the objectives set for the purpose of such remuneration, as this Committee must first verify the company's results as the basis for calculating the relevant objectives.\n- \u00b7 The NCCGC is composed of 5 members, two of whom are also members on the Audit and Supervisory Committee. The fact that some Directors are members of these two Committees ensures that the risks related to remuneration are taken into account in the discussions held by both Committees and in their proposals submitted to the Board, both in the determination and assessment process of the annual and multiannual incentives.\n- \u00b7 According to the Remuneration Policy, at the proposal of the NCCGC, the Board of Directors is authorized to agree on the possible revaluation or modification of the remuneration linked to the results if there are significant internal or external changes that mean they need to be reviewed.\n- \u00b7 Regarding the measures required to avoid conflicts of interest by the directors, according to the provisions in the Spanish Capital Companies Act, the Regulations of Telef\u00f3nica's Board of Directors includes a series of obligations related to its duties of loyalty and to avoid situations of conflict of interest. Moreover, the NCCGC's Regulations determine that one of its duties is to ensure that possible conflicts of interest do not harm the independence of the external advice provided to the Committee.\n\n\u2776       \u2777       \u2778       \u2779       \u277a       \u277b\n\nAnnual Report on Remuneration of the Directors\n\n## Consistency with the Company's strategy and focus on achieving results in the long-term\n\nThe design of the remuneration policy, consistent with the Company's strategy and aimed at obtaining long-term results, is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The total remuneration for the Executive Directors and Senior Executives consists of various remunerative components, mainly composed of the following: (i) Fixed Remuneration, (ii) Short-term Variable Remuneration and (iii) Long-term Variable Remuneration. In the case of the Executive Directors, under normal conditions, at the date of the grant this long-term component accounts for a weight of on the date such General no less than 30% of their total remuneration in a scenario of standard achievement of objectives (fixed + short-term variable + long-term variable).\n- a. The Long-Term Variable Remuneration plans are part of a multi-annual framework in order to ensure that the assessment process is based on long-term profits and that the company's underlying economic cycle is taken into account. This remuneration is allocated and paid in the form of shares based on the creation of value, so that the Executives' interests are in line with those of the shareholders. In addition, they are overlapping cycles that generally follow one another indefinitely over time, with a permanent focus on the long-term in all decision-making.\n- b. Under the Remuneration Policy, 100% of the shares provided within the scope of the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the 2021 General Shareholders' Meeting and, if applicable, under the Long-Term Incentive Plan proposed for approval at the 2024 General Shareholders' Meeting to the Executive Directors and other members determined by the Board of Directors are subject to a retention period of two years. In addition, if an Executive Director does not fulfill the commitment to permanently hold the shares, the retention period of the shares that, if any, they receive due to any variable remuneration component will be increased up to 3 years.\n- \u00b7 A suitable balance between the fixed and variable components of the remuneration: Executive Directors have a variable remuneration scheme that is fully flexible, which includes a minimum threshold below which no incentive is payable. The Short- and LongTerm Variable Remuneration percentage can be relevant in the event of maximum objective performance. In any case, such percentage with respect to the total remuneration (considered as the Fixed Remuneration, Short-Term Variable Remuneration and annualized Long-Term Incentive) will not exceed 85%.\n- \u00b7 Receiving 20% of the Short-Term Variable Remuneration is linked to the following ESG metrics: Gender Equality - % of women in executive positions (10%). NPS (5%), Climate Change - GHG Emissions (5%). Additionally, payment of 10% of the incentives",

Commercial debtors that may cause a relevant impact on the Telef\u00f3nica Group consolidated financial statements and increased risk profile products - due to customer target, term, channels or other commercial characteristics - are subject to specific management practices in order to mitigate the exposure to credit risk.
