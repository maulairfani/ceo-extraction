We do the right thing and take our responsibilities seriously.\n\nWe innovate\n\nWe use the diversity of our global experience to find bold and agile ways to solve problems and make a positive difference throughout our customers' lives.\n\nBrand Message\n\nBy your side, for life\n\nPurpose \uff06 Values\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Redefining the concept of ' By your side, for life ' for the future\n\nThe Dai-ichi Life Group was founded in Japan in 1902 and has since expanded its business globally, including Asia Pacific and North America. In recent years, the Group has broadened its business and value offerings beyond the life insurance business.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, in FY2024 we revamped our Principles and established our Purpose (the ' reason ' behind our existence in society) and Values (Values we uphold). As social conditions, people ' s behavior patterns, and values change and new social issues evolve, the role the Dai-ichi Life Group must play has expanded into ever more diverse areas.\n\n## Co-creation by Group employees\n\nThe development of our Purpose and Values was completed with the participation of ca. 1,000 employees from Japan and overseas, who engaged in discussions about the future significance of the Dai-ichi Life Group in society and the values that should be cherished.\n\n## (What) What kind of world we want to help create\n\n## (How) How we will make such a contribution\n\n' A brighter and more secure future '\n\n' Partnering with you to build a future '\n\nWe support a wide variety of people ' s lives through many lines and propositions across the businesses. This includes not only straightforward positive ' hope ' but also the hopes of people in tough circumstances. We will focus on the future more than ever, take on challenges ahead of the curve and contribute to building a better future for our stakeholders.\n\n' Brighter future ' encompasses the spirit of hope and happiness and resonates better in English. ' Secure future ' is not limited to the meaning of life insurance protection. Security applies to a broader range of businesses (e.g., asset management, retirement, employee benefits), and for people to have a ' secure future, ' they need to have financial health as well as physical and mental wellbeing.\n\n## Linkages with Core Materiality\n\n## Acting on our Values to achieve our Purpose\n\nIn formulating our Purpose, we considered the four Core Materiality of the Group. We aim to realize the world envisioned in our Purpose by addressing solutions to social issues defined in our Core Materiality through our corporate activities.\n\n\u2160 . Financial Well-being for All\n\n\u2161 . Healthy People and Society\n\n\u2163 .  Proactive Governance and Engagement\n\n\u2162 . Environmental Leadership\n\nOur Values incorporate the values that we have cherished since our founding and express the values and decision-making principles that we wish to further strengthen for the future.\n\nThe energy of the Group comes from each and every employee striving to realize our Purpose and demonstrating our Values in their work. We believe this will help us provide value to our customers and other stakeholders and resolve social issues. These efforts will enable us to achieve our midterm management plan and become a global top-tier insurance group by FY2030. Moving forward, we aim to continue evolving strongly to realize our Purpose.\n\nClick here to view our Purpose Video\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe move ahead as a group with stakeholders, looking ahead to the future and proactively taking on challenges. Through value creation for our customers and other stakeholders, we will build a better future. The words have been chosen thoughtfully and deliberately to capture the meaning:\n\n' Partnering ' reflects the collaborative, supportive, and guiding role we play.\n\n' With you ' speaks directly to the reader and is broad and inclusive enough to encompass a variety of stakeholders including customers, partners, and employees.

' Let me explain the background of this vision.\n\nIn 2010, after a long history as a mutual company, we became the first major life insurer in Japan to change to a stock company and go public. The reason for this decision was that we determined that the stock company structure was the best option for increasing the value we provide to society, achieving sustainable growth as a company, and enhancing corporate value in the medium to long term. Achieving sustainable growth as a Group and enhancing corporate value in the medium to long term are also my mission, and I am deeply committed to fulfilling this mission in a bold and impactful manner.\n\nTo put it simply, our goal is to become a global top-tier insurance group in terms of corporate value by FY2030, which is 20 years after we became a listed company. Currently, the market capitalization of the top 10 insurance groups is ca. \u00a510tn, and I aim to reach that level by FY2030.\n\nTo achieve this, we must consider what we need to accomplish now by backcasting from our vision for FY2030, taking into account anticipated changes in the external environment. This approach served as the starting point for formulating our new mid-term management plan, which started from this fiscal year. Instead of confining ourselves to the mindset of the past, I am determined to swiftly implement the strategies needed to realize our vision for FY2030. I am also committed to boldly embracing challenging initiatives without hesitation, free from the constraints of our past.\n\nWe have revamped our Principles and newly established our Purpose, which reflects the reason for our existence, to unite the entire Group in embracing the challenge of achieving the aforementioned vision. Our Purpose, ' Partnering with you to build a brighter and more secure future, ' embodies our commitment to continuously challenge ourselves to deliver innovative services that go beyond the traditional scope of services offered by life insurance companies. Through this, we aim to become a company that serves as social infrastructure, closely supporting our customers throughout their lives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Transitioning from a traditional \u02a0 insurance provider \u02a1 to an \u02a0 insurance-related service provider \u02a1 without fear of change\n\n## What we need to achieve in the new mid-term management plan to fulfill our vision for FY2030\n\nTo become a company that serves as social infrastructure and closely supports customers throughout their lives, we aim for a business model that delivers a broad range of experiential values through services that transcend the traditional narrow definition of life insurance. Specifically, we aim to provide wide-ranging value to our customers, focusing on the four experiential values of ' Protection, ' ' Asset Formation/ Succession, ' ' Health and Medical Care, ' and ' Enhancing Connections. '\n\nLet me explain the background and objectives behind this shift in our business model.\n\nTraditionally, the role of life insurance companies has been to provide coverage against uncertainties, such as unforeseen future events, illness, and financial insecurity after retirement in this aging society. In today ' s society, however, lifestyle choices, values, and the people ' s concerns have become increasingly diverse. Therefore, we believe that the products and services we offer to\n\nour customers must also evolve to keep pace with these changes.\n\nIn addition, the services traditionally provided by life insurance companies were based on the premise that customers maintain their contracts over the long term. As a result, the frequency of services provided by insurance companies was limited unless there was a claim for insurance benefits or annuity payments. However, by offering a wide range of services and value beyond just life insurance, we can establish extensive connections with our customers across various life stages, allowing us to support their lives even more closely.\n\nI am convinced that we can further contribute to our customers ' well-being by transitioning from a traditional insurance company into an ' insurance-related service provider ' that also provides life insurance. Consequently, we can gain the support of our customers and society, allowing us to grow our business further.\n\n## Review of previous mid-term management plan: Opening the door to the future\n\n## Laying the foundation for enhancing corporate value beyond the new mid-term management plan\n\nDuring the three years of the previous mid-term management plan, ' Re-connect 2023, ' we started with our recognition that the capital markets ' evaluation of us was undervalued. This was because we believed that if this undervaluation persisted, we would be unable to achieve our intentions when we decided to become a stock company. We recognized that the undervaluation was mainly because our capital efficiency (adjusted ROE) was below our cost of capital. Therefore, we took action to reverse this relationship in the near future.\n\nOur cost of capital, which we disclosed as 10% three years ago based on our self-recognition, reduced to ca. 9% at the end of the previous mid-term management plan thanks to our strong efforts to decrease market-related risks during that plan ' s period. On the other hand, our capital efficiency is ca. 8%, which remains below our cost of capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the domestic business, which accounts for ca. 70% of the Group adjusted profit, Dai-ichi Life ' s sales performance declined significantly during the previous mid-term plan. This was due to COVID-19 and the impact of changes in the operation of our sales reps after the past misconducts at Dai-ichi Life.\n\nHowever, Dai-ichi Life released a new product in December 2023 after a long hiatus, and it has been well received by customers. As a result, the activity levels of our sales representatives, which had been stagnant for some time, have significantly increased, clearly indicating a recovery trend in new business performance. As of March 2024, the end of the previous mid-term management plan, the performance per sales rep at Dai-ichi Life had almost returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. On the other hand, we adopted a policy to selectively hire ca. 4,000 new sales reps annually, compared with the previous 6,000 to 7,000 per year, in order to secure higherquality personnel. As a result, the number of sales reps has decreased from ca. 40,000 before COVID-19 to ca. 34,000. To fully restore Dai-ichi Life ' s overall sales performance to preCOVID-19 levels, we need to further improve the productivity of each sales rep from this point onward. To enhance productivity, I believe it is crucial to swiftly leverage AI and other technologies, as well as data, as early as possible.\n\nIn addition to initiatives aimed at recovering the new business performance of Dai-ichi Life ' s sales reps, we strove to enhance our business portfolio, including by acquiring ipet in Japan and Partners Life in New Zealand, a new overseas market for us. We also introduced and expanded our CxO system and created a diverse and highly specialized management team to match the expansion of our business fields. Through these initiatives, I believe we have finally laid the foundation to address key challenges, such as achieving capital efficiency that consistently exceeds the cost of capital, during the period of the new mid-term management plan, which started in FY2024.\n\n## Ensure that capital efficiency consistently exceeds the cost of capital\n\nAs I mentioned at the outset, our new mid-term management plan is based on backcasting from our vision for FY2030 (become a ' global top-tier insurance group ' and ' leader of the Japanese insurance industry future. ' It concretely outlines what needs to be accomplished over the next three years. Our most important challenge for FY2026, the final year of the plan, is to achieve capital efficiency that consistently exceeds the cost of capital, which we have been working on since the previous plan, and we are determined to achieve this goal at any cost. To this end, we must reach Group adjusted profit of \u00a5400bn and adjusted ROE of 10% in FY2026. In Japan, as I mentioned earlier, our goal is to transition from a narrowly defined life insurance company into an ' insurance-related service provider ' that offers a wide range of services and value. By evolving in this way, we aim to meet the diverse needs of our customers at various life stages and closely support them throughout their lives. I believe we can increase our financial value by being rewarded for the services we provide.\n\nWe will continue reducing market risk to lower the cost of capital and improve capital efficiency. To expedite the reduction of equity risk, which increased during the previous mid-term management plan due to the appreciating market value of its equity holdings, Dai-ichi Life intends to sell more than \u00a51.2tn worth of domestic stocks \u0336 ca. 30 \uff05 of the market value of its stock holdings \u0336 over the next three years.\n\nFurthermore, increasing the ratio of overseas business, including in emerging markets where significant growth of the insurance market is expected, is essential for improving capital efficiency and driving the business growth of the overall Group. However, there is no point in expanding our overseas business at the expense of shrinking the domestic business. Therefore, we will continue to grow our domestic business, while growing our overseas business which growth speed is higher to increase its contribution to the Group adjusted profit to 40% by FY2026.\n\n## Leveraging digital technology to provide protection and asset formation services in Japan\n\nAs mentioned in the review of the previous mid-term management plan, we are beginning to see a recovery in new business performance of our sales reps channel. However, to achieve sustainable growth in Japan, where significant overall market growth is not expected, it is important to offer proposals from both perspectives of protection and asset formation/succession. In particular, with the recent recovery in domestic interest rates and the Japanese government ' s promotion of asset formation through NISA and iDeCo, interest in asset formation is growing, especially among young people. I believe it is crucial to enhance our asset formation services, as well as our product development and asset management capabilities, to meet the needs of customers in their 20s and 30s. Because money paid for protection-type life insurance and\n\nfunds set aside for asset formation and investment come from the same wallet, we must provide consultation that emphasizes a balance between protection and asset formation/succession according to the situation of each customer ' s household or level of concern.\n\nWhen making proposals that offer both protection and asset formation/succession, we plan to strengthen our marketing creativity to offer tailored suggestions that meet the increasingly diverse needs of each customer. At the same time, we aim to optimize our customer touchpoints and enhance customer satisfaction. In this regard, I believe that accelerating our IT and digital strategies, particularly in relation to generative AI and digital data, will be crucial factors determining the success or failure of our domestic business.\n\nTo this end, we appointed Dr. Figen Ulgen as Chief Data and AI Officer (CDAO), an expert executive officer, in April 2024 to strengthen our IT and digital strategies. Our aim is to build a customer data platform that consolidates the vast amount of information held by the Group, deploy generative AI to enhance our consulting capabilities, and provide stronger support for the daily activities of our sales reps. These efforts will significantly improve customer experience (CX) and greatly increase the productivity of those representatives.\n\n## Broadening our insurance-related services with Benefit One\n\nAnother crucial factor determining the success or failure of our domestic  business  will  be  the  deployment  of  synergies  with Benefit One, which recently became a member of our Group.\n\nThe decision to acquire Benefit One was motivated by our strategic objective to broaden our insurance-related services, through leveraging that company ' s robust service platform in the employee benefits market. For some time, we have engaged in in-depth internal discussions regarding the future of our domestic business. Through these discussions, we recognized the need to acquire a robust platform and expand into non-insurance businesses in order to provide experiential value to our customers seamlessly. Amid these discussions, we turned our attention to Benefit One and began exploring the potential for collaboration with it. In November 2023, another company announced a takeover bid (TOB) for Benefit One. It came as a surprise to us, but after considering the opinions of our Board of Directors and employees, including younger staff, we concluded that Benefit One was a unique and irreplaceable entity. This led us to make the firm decision to make our own TOB. We submitted our proposal about two weeks after the other company ' s TOB announcement, but it was our prior studies that enabled us to respond so quickly.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Benefit One had ca. 10mn members. With our support, we aim to add ca. 2mn new members within the first three years. In addition to these shortterm synergies, we will pursue long-term profit growth across the entire Group by leveraging Benefit One ' s platform \u0336 based on its Kyutokubarai, which is a salary deduction scheme \u0336 to offer our Group ' s products and services related to protection,\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness",

        "page_content": "asset formation/succession, and health and medical care. We will fully commit the entire Group ' s resources to realize these synergies.\n\n## Pursuing growth through the life insurance business in overseas markets with growth potential\n\nOur overseas business is an important growth engine. It currently accounts for about 30% of the Group adjusted profit, but we are aiming for 40% by FY2026 and above 50% by FY2030. While Japan is experiencing a declining population due to low birth rates and an aging society, many countries in the US and Asia are seeing population growth. We aim to realize growth in these regions, primarily through the life insurance business.\n\nSpecifically, we aim to further expand our presence in countries where we already have a significant market share, such as Australia, the US, and Vietnam, while striving to achieve a Top 5 position in other markets where we operate. We will also expand the most suitable sales channels \u0336 such as sales reps and banks \u0336 according to the specific characteristics of each country. In India, for example, we plan to strengthen our partnerships with banks, as well as the sales reps channel. In the US, we will continue to advance the acquisition strategy that Protective, our US subsidiary, excels at. In April 2024, we decided to acquire ShelterPoint, a company that operates group life insurance mainly in New York State.\n\nIn our overseas business, our overall strategy is formulated by the holding company, but we also entrust the management of individual country operations to the local leadership. As we do not sell tangible products, we need to adapt our services to the insurance regulations of each country and the needs of local customers. Therefore, it is important to have a talented management team that is familiar with the local insurance industry. Our basic approach is to provide support and effective governance, leaving the actual management to a team of local experts. To further accelerate the Group ' s globalization efforts, in July 2024 we appointed Brett Clark, who has served as CEO of our Australian subsidiary TAL for many years, as a Senior Managing Executive Officer of Dai-ichi Life Holdings. He was also assigned the responsibility of managing our business operations in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nWhile the foundation for growing our overseas business is now in place, achieving our goals will require not only organic growth but also inorganic growth through mergers and acquisitions (M&As). We will continue pursuing additional acquisition opportunities in regions where we are already present, such as the US and Asia Pacific, and will also consider entering new markets in Asia, where we anticipate high growth in the future.\n\n## Financial and capital strategy for achieving vision for FY2030\n\nWe are also formulating our financial and capital strategy by backcasting from our vision for FY2030. Until capital efficiency consistently exceeds the cost of capital, we intend to emphasize shareholder payouts over strategic investments and maintain the level of total shareholder payouts of the previous mid-term management plan. For our strategic investments, we plan to allocate ca. \uffe5 300bn over the three years of the new mid-term management plan, with a focus on overseas businesses and asset management. We will also pursue M&As that enhance the capital efficiency and growth potential of the entire Group. Meanwhile, after achieving capital efficiency that consistently exceeds the cost of capital, we will transition to growth-oriented investments and accelerate initiatives that prioritize profit growth, although this will probably happen during the period of the next mid-term management plan. At that time, we plan to gradually reduce share buybacks and shift toward dividends as part of shareholder payouts. During the next mid-term management plan, we presume to raise the dividend payout ratio to 50%.\n\nWith this highly transparent, road map-style financial and capital strategy, we aim to enhance corporate value toward our vision for FY2030.\n\n## Matrix-style management system that promotes optimal capital circulation\n\nSince I assumed the role of CEO in April 2023, we have expanded our CxO system and established the position of Group Head, who oversees each business from a group-wide perspective. This matrix-style management system began full-scale operation and entered into the stage of functioning in April 2024, coinciding with the start of the new mid-term management plan. At first glance, this system might appear to complicate the decision-making process, but we adopted it to foster healthy conflict between Group Heads, CxOs, and the heads of each operating company. We also aim to promote the visualization of optimal strategies and challenges from a groupwide perspective.\n\nIf we did not have CxOs or Group Heads, for example, each operating company would simply be placed under the holding company. In such a case, the operating companies would choose the strategies and tactics that are optimal for themselves. This would pose the risk that operating companies might become overly attached to established practices or past successes, hindering fundamental transformation or maintaining inefficient business operations. In advancing effective and efficient capital circulation management, the holding company ' s primary role is to redistribute management resources from mature businesses that no longer require a large amount of capital to growing businesses and operations with high capital efficiency that will need capital in the future. Group Heads and CxOs play a crucial role in swiftly achieving what is optimal for the entire Group. Furthermore, as the number\n\nPurpose\n\n\uff06\n\nValues\n\nof Group companies increases both in Japan and overseas, it is inefficient for each company to operate independently. Therefore, we need to share best practices among operating companies, unlock synergies across the Group, and establish a cross-functional framework that ensures the most suitable company takes on the most appropriate role within the Group.\n\nOur CxO system and Group Head system also play an important role in expanding our overseas business. I believe that CxOs and Group Heads, who are responsible for overseeing the entire Group from a global perspective, will contribute significantly to enhancing our global competitiveness and becoming a global top-tier player.\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability management: The driving force for realizing our vision\n\n## Spreading awareness of the Group Principles and Core Materiality to foster a sense of unity\n\nIn formulating the new mid-term management plan, we updated our Group Purpose and Values as mentioned earlier and identified our Core Materiality (priority material issues for the Group). I believe that these foundational management decisions, combined with the human resources strategy set in the new mid-term management plan and ongoing efforts to strengthen governance, will serve as a powerful unifying force that aligns and motivates all Group employees and executives to achieve our vision for FY2030.\n\nOur newly established Group purpose and values, introduced alongside the new mid-term management plan, are designed to create a sense of unity within the Group by encouraging every employee to have empathy, share, and internalize them. They also serve as a commitment to society, expressing the reason for our existence. Therefore, we engaged employees, executives, and managers, both in Japan and overseas, in a collaborative process to develop that sense of unity. As a result, our Group purpose and values and the intent behind them have been profoundly shared and internalized across the entire Group.\n\nThe Group previously identified 14 material issues. Alongside the formulation of the new mid-term management plan, we reassessed and reorganized the material issues to clarify our priorities further, thereby consolidating them into four main categories: ' Financial Well-being for All, ' ' Healthy People and Society, ' ' Environmental Leadership, ' and ' Proactive Governance and Engagement. ' Rather than setting forth what is good for society in a blanket statement, we have narrowed down our priorities in an effective manner that is firmly linked to the Group ' s Principles and our businesses. In fact, Group Heads and CxOs have already taken the lead to start working on incorporating newly identified Core Materiality into our business strategies consciously. Through business activities based on these Core Materiality, we will create both social and economic\n\nvalue and sustainably strengthen our own financial and nonfinancial management foundation while having a positive impact on society.\n\nThe renewal of the Group Principles and the formulation of Core Materiality signals a significant shift in direction for the entire Group. It is crucial that each individual employee perceives this change and takes action to bring about tangible transformation. Sharing the Group Principles with empathy becomes a powerful motivator in executing our strategy, uniting all members to move forward together. I will continue explaining the new Group Principles and Core Materiality through town hall meetings and other forums to facilitate the transition from understanding to execution.\n\n## Safari park of human resources, rich in diversity\n\nWe believe that a human resources strategy that enables diverse talent to fully realize their potential is crucial for achieving our vision for FY2030. Therefore, as our business domains expand, we are actively bringing in executives from outside the Group, including those of foreign nationality or origin, to drive transformation and growth with speed and provide diverse perspectives and expertise. When I say I aspire to create a ' Safari park of human resources, ' this concept is rooted in the belief that the environment where diverse talent express their ideas without any constraints and engage in creative work leads to increased productivity. Of course, certain rules and integrity must be maintained, but I believe it is essential to cultivate a corporate culture where individuals can unleash their creativity as much as possible within that framework.\n\nDigital technology and AI are key to clarifying the Group ' s strengths, especially in its mature domestic business. I also recognize the risk of new competitors emerging due to advancements in technology. To address this risk, we must respond agilely and strive continuously to take in cutting-edge technology. To achieve this, attracting and retaining specialized talent is essential. Accordingly, we are creating an environment where employees can thrive by offering an attractive corporate",

        "page_content": "culture and appropriate compensation.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have introduced and expanded the CxO system since FY2022, and appointed highly specialized external talent to executive positions. This has allowed our management team to incorporate outside perspectives and make faster and more appropriate decisions. We are also actively recruiting mid-career professionals beyond just executive roles, with ca. 40% of our new hires coming from mid-career recruitment.\n\nWe will further accelerate the promotion of diversity in our workforce, including by empowering women, and combine this with a global perspective and a strong management foundation. By doing so, we aim to become a company that can freely utilize cutting-edge technology and consistently provide sustainable value to all stakeholders.\n\n## Enhancing corporate value with unity throughout the whole Group\n\nIn May 2024, we introduced a stock-based compensation plan for employees. As mentioned earlier, we were founded as Japan ' s first mutual company, and we operated under this structure for many years. In 2010, we went public as a stock company, and in 2016 we adopted a holding company structure. Employees of the holding company have a strong mindset of our businesses as a stock company, but employees in the Group ' s operating companies have found it challenging to perceive how the shift to a stock company directly impacts their daily work.\n\nTo foster a common understanding among all employees of their contribution to enhancing corporate value, we introduced a stock-based compensation plan in this fiscal year that rewards employees by sharing our increased corporate value with them. The program covers ca. 50,000 employees, including sales reps. This is a fairly large-scale initiative, but I believe it will significantly increase a sense of unity and motivation, enabling the entire Group to move forward together to achieve our vision for FY2030.\n\n## In conclusion\n\nAfter assuming the role of Group CEO, I had the opportunity to take a fresh, comprehensive view of the Dai-ichi Life Group through dialogue with external stakeholders, including investors, and through town hall meetings with employees both in Japan and overseas. What stood out to me is the importance of transformation and the strong expectations for change.\n\nTo achieve our vision for FY2030 to become a ' leader of the Japanese insurance industry future ' and a ' global top-tier insurance group, ' we need to become double or even triple compared to the past in terms of market capitalization. This requires a sense of speed and significant, large-scale changes. Each of us must question conventional wisdom, break free from the bias toward maintaining the status quo, and think critically about the most effective path forward, then take action accordingly. One manifestation of this approach is our transformation from an insurance company to an insurance-related service provider, as well as our acquisition of Benefit One, which is designed to accelerate this shift. The decision to acquire Benefit One was greatly influenced by the enthusiasm of our younger employees for the Group ' s transformation.\n\nWe have 60,000 employees across 10 countries. I am confident that these employees, united under our newly established Purpose, will deliver significant outcomes as they embrace challenges and transformation with excitement to realize our vision for FY2030. I also believe that the Dai-ichi Life Group has the DNA for the transformation needed to achieve this vision. Furthermore, it is my role to support and drive these challenges and transformations, and I am firmly committed to courageously leading the changes necessary to enhance corporate value.\n\nI am committed to meeting the expectations of all stakeholders and transforming the Group into one that is even more essential to everyone. I kindly ask for your continued support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n## Group Management Organization\n\nSince FY2022, we have introduced and expanded ' CxO ' positions to oversee key corporate functions, enhancing their effectiveness through external appointments. In FY2024, we established ' Group Heads ' roles to manage crucial business areas. These changes have created an organic, matrix-type management system within the holding company. By fostering close collaboration between CxOs, Group Heads, and the management of each group company, we aim to strengthen individual company growth, improve overall group business operations and governance, and accelerate the enhancement of corporate value.\n\nDiscussion at the Global Leaders Committee, composed of CEOs and other leaders from overseas Group companies (covering discussions on Group management strategies, business strategies, and sharing of the Group Principles and initiative directions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n14",

In this section, the Chair of the Board and two outside directors held a discussion to share their reflections on FY2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board discussions in FY2023\n\nInagaki: The succession of Mr. Kikuta in FY2023 ended the situation in which one person served concurrently as president of both Dai-ichi Life Holdings and The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company (Dai-ichi Life). Under this new leadership structure, the Board held discussions about our new mid-term management plan, which started in April 2024. Our mission as directors is to understand Mr. Kikuta ' s vision and support him to take the necessary risks to unleash the potential of the Daiichi Life Group at a maximum. With this in mind, we engaged in discussions by backcasting from Mr. Kikuta ' s vision. As a result, the Board held 21 meetings in FY2023.\n\nShingai: As Mr. Inagaki mentioned, we engaged in discussions by backcasting from the vision for FY2030, focusing on what actions we need to take now. This was particularly noteworthy. In the past, our discussions often seemed to be an extension of the present, but in FY2023 they were different.\n\nReflecting on our Board meetings in FY2023, we discussed a wide range of topics, such as financial and capital strategies, domestic business strategies, overseas business strategies, business risk management, and market risk management, as well as sustainability including human capital. Looking ahead to FY2030, meanwhile, we couldn ' t avoid discussions about our Purpose of why we exist as a company. We also discussed our acquisition of Benefit One, the merits of our matrix-style management approach centered on CxOs\n\nMessages to Our Stakeholders\n\nStrategy &\n\nand Group Heads, and many other substantial agenda items. I feel that the Board of Directors engaged in open and lively discussions on these topics.\n\nMasuda: As the Chairperson of the Nominations Advisory Committee, I was in a position to nominate Mr. Kikuta, and I believe that his appointment as CEO was a positive and welcomed. His clear targets of ' increasing market capitalization from \u00a53tn to \u00a56tn by FY2026 and \u00a510tn by FY2030 ' resonated effectively with investors and other stakeholders. For a moment, I thought he might be going too far, but I believe that the clarity of his message has actually helped us to better define what we need to achieve.\n\n## Formulation of the Purpose and the new mid-term management plan\n\nInagaki: The previous mid-term management plan, ' Re-connect 2023, ' focused on two key pillars: ' Expanding ' and ' Exploring. ' When formulating the new mid-term management plan, however, we were able to go beyond that and start our discussions from the perspective of our ' raison d ' \u00eatre. ' As a result, we formulated our Purpose: ' Partnering with you to build a brighter and more secure future. ' The discussions in which we were fully engaged were instrumental in developing the concept of closely supporting customers throughout their lives through platforms such as Benefit One.\n\nI also feel that Mr. Kikuta ' s clear vision of financial value \u0336 particularly his goal to double market capitalization \u0336 and his strategy to increase the price-to-earnings ratio (PER) by securing current profit levels while boosting expectations for future growth have been effectively communicated both internally and externally.\n\nShingai: Both corporate finance and corporate culture are crucial. The foundation of our corporate culture is the Purpose. Both our internal and outside directors emphasized the need for discussions about our Purpose. Originally, the discussions started with our corporate brand, but everyone realized that we couldn ' t instill our brand or advance discussions on our business domains without first returning to our raison d ' \u00eatre. ' Purpose ' must not be mere wordplay. It must resonate with society and address societal challenges. Therefore, our discussions on this aspect were crucial. In addition, defining our business domains is critically important for the company ' s long-term sustainability and growth. I often say that if we define our business domain too narrowly without returning to our Purpose, we risk missing opportunities for expansion and growth, which could ultimately lead to declination. That ' s what happened to the former ' railroad barons ' in the US.\n\nIn addition, ' Expanding ' to ensure they continue generating strong profits from existing businesses and ' Exploring ' to launch a new business are distinct activities. It ' s not uncommon for employees focusing on ' expanding '\n\nBusiness\n\nto envy those engaged in ' exploring, ' and vice versa. Such an approach would not create strong momentum for growth across the company. Therefore, we needed a Purpose that emotionally connects these two activities.\n\nIn the past, when I was managing another company, integrating corporate cultures emerged as a significant challenge when conducting a large-scale M&A. At that time, we took the opportunity to reconsider and redefine what our corporate culture truly was. I believe that corporate culture is a ' pattern of behavior ' that has been cultivated within a company over many years. To realize the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s vision for FY2030, we must consider how we will change this ' pattern of behavior. ' I believe that discussing the Purpose before formulating the mid-term management plan was highly valuable, as it serves as the cornerstone of the plan.\n\nMasuda: What was beneficial about our discussions on our Purpose was that we involved not only our domestic employees but also those from our Group companies overseas in thinking it through together. The content of the Purpose is important, but the process of developing it is equally crucial. Because the employees played a role in deciding it, they feel like it ' s their own Purpose.\n\nInagaki: As societal challenges evolve with the times, we must continue to change in order to be the partner for our customers consistently. In the past, however, there have been instances where friction arose between aspects that we couldn ' t change, leading to decreased employee motivation. Therefore, reaffirming our raison d ' \u00eatre with our Purpose was instrumental in shaping the new mid-term management plan. I believe this will positively influence the actions of each and every employee.\n\nShingai: You ' re absolutely right. In addition to the discussion of Purpose we ' ve mentioned, it was essential to incorporate discussions from a corporate finance perspective when formulating the mid-term management plan to achieve the financial targets set by Mr. Kikuta. In other words, to achieve our targets, we must not only realize capital efficiency that consistently exceeds our cost of capital but also ensure that the capital markets hold expectations of growth for us.\n\nDuring the previous mid-term management plan, for example, we reduced interest rate risk considerably, which lowered our cost of capital and led to an increased in adjusted ROE to some extent. With the rise in the market value of our equity holdings, however, our equity risk actually increased. Under the new mid-term management plan, therefore, we must further reduce equity risk, and then reduce market risk and the cost of capital. In addition, to raise growth expectations in the capital markets, we need to demonstrate that we can not only expand our overseas business but also maintain or increase profit levels of our domestic business. Japan ' s rapid population decline and aging society, now unfolding before us, was described by management scholar Peter Drucker back in the late 1980s as ' the future that has already happened. ' In this context, our discussions on how to leverage and grow our",

        "page_content": "domestic insurance business based on the ' four experiential values ' led to the acquisition of Benefit One.\n\nMasuda: Over the past decade or so, Dai-ichi Life has undergone significant change, transitioning from a mutual company to a stock company, going public, and shifting to a holding company structure. These changes were made with a view to evolving into an ' insurance-related service provider ' that offers a wide range of services beyond life insurance, as well as expanding our presence overseas. In a sense, the discussions at our Board meetings in FY2023 might have signified that we have returned to our roots and reached a stage where we are thoroughly committed to executing our original goals.\n\nShingai: By transitioning to a stock company and shifting to a holding company structure, we have gained a broader perspective beyond just being an insurance company. The new Purpose and the new mid-term management plan are about fully leveraging this potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOutside Director\n\nYasushi Shingai\n\nAt Japan Tobacco Inc., Mr. Shingai spent  many years as an executive leading corporate  transformation and driving globalization through  large-scale M&As. He is the author of the book,  JT no M&A ('JT's M&As'). Since 2019, he has  served as an outside director of Dai-ichi Life  Holdings, where he oversees management from a  global perspective and acts as an advisor in Board  meetings and other forums.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Discussions behind the Benefit One acquisition\n\nShingai: To briefly recap, in August 2023 our executive team emphasized the need to build a platform and suggested methodologies for doing so, as well as potential companies for acquisition. In other words, to advance the ' four experiential values '\u0336 particularly ' Enhancing Connections ' and ' Health and Medical Care '\u0336 it is essential to have a platform. As for the methodologies, there were two options: build the platform in-house or leverage external resources. Among the external resources, Benefit One emerged as the best candidate.\n\nWe received word that Pasona Group Inc. might consider selling Benefit One in the future, then we scheduled an appointment for late November 2023. However, in the interim, M3, Inc., announced a takeover bid, which led us to engage in four lengthy but intensive rounds of discussion. Due to the urgency of the situation, our executive team had already established a relationship with Benefit One and was wellprepared, enabling a swift response.\n\nThe key point was that we discussed the matter from multiple perspectives and asked ourselves many questions. For example, is acquisition the best way to expand as an insurance-related service provider and build an ecosystem based on the four experiential values? Do we need to acquire 100%? How much information can we gather after expressing our TOB intention? To what extent can we realize postacquisition synergies? In light of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ' s ' Guidelines for Corporate Takeovers, ' should we go as far as an acquisition without consent? How will we implement Group governance to maximize post-acquisition synergies? Can we fulfil our commitment to shareholders of enhancing shareholder payouts, even after a \u00a5300bn acquisition, until we achieve capital efficiency that exceeds the cost of capital? In addressing these and other questions, we had meaningful and constructive discussions.\n\nMasuda: I, too, thought the acquisition was important and significant. While previous acquisitions have focused on insurance companies, this time the target was in a noninsurance sector. There were also some risks to consider, such as whether the synergies and post-merger integration (PMI) would be successful and whether the fact that the majority of the \u00a5300bn acquisition cost would result in goodwill as an intangible asset could be acceptable from a financial perspective. Nevertheless, the Board of Directors recognized the high rarity of this opportunity. Despite the many challenges to overcome, the Board ' s opinion was that the executive team should proceed with the acquisition with determination.\n\nAs a member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, I will need to monitor the ongoing operations and synergy effects. The crucial phase lies ahead, but I am confident that both parties will grow together, leading to an increase in corporate value.\n\nThe TOB without consent garnered significant attention because it was initiated by a major Japanese life insurance company. However, we conducted it appropriately in\n\nY\n\nStrategy &\n\naccordance with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ' s guidelines and received high praise from the media. I believe that embracing challenges such as this is crucial for helping Japan break free from its current stagnation.\n\nInagaki: Although it was a TOB without consent, the Board of Directors approved it because it had the potential to create value for Benefit One as well, and it was not just a financial transaction but also its business affinity was compelling.\n\nI am grateful to the outside directors for gathering multiple times in a short period, allowing us to engage in deep and meaningful discussions. The outside directors raised many issues, such as how to address cultural differences, manage PMI and value enhancement, and forecast return on investment from a quantitative perspective. The executive team thoroughly addressed these issues, which led to meaningful and productive discussions. We had already recognized the need for a specialized M&A team and had selected its members. Therefore, in the summer of 2023, we quickly assembled internal resources and rapidly formed the team. I am grateful for Mr. Kikuta ' s leadership in driving the executive team ' s deliberation process forward in such a short time.\n\nMr. Kikuta met several times with Mr. Shiraishi, the President of Benefit One, to discuss whether their future visions aligned and how we would collaborate with Benefit One ' s management team. The importance of these points was also highlighted at our Board meetings. The alignment of opinions between the executive team and the Board of Directors on key points provided a sense of reassurance to the Board.\n\nMasuda: Our discussions about Benefit One were intense, with many questions raised not only by the outside directors but also by the inside directors. Despite being pressed for time, the executive team focused intently on addressing the issues and worked hard to prepare. They provided satisfactory answers, which I believe ultimately enabled the Board of Directors to approve the acquisition.\n\nShingai: This acquisition was different from traditional insurance company acquisitions. It involved a completely different business domain, and we sought to turn ' one plus one ' into three or four. Therefore, as we moved to make it a 100% subsidiary, it was crucial to clearly define areas of responsibility and authority \u0336 what to delegate and what to manage by ourselves. I believe we had solid discussions on what kind of group governance and contractual relationships we should establish to further enhance Benefit One ' s growth potential and maximize synergies with us.\n\nAs we were unable to conduct proper due diligence before announcing the TOB, however, some of the information we needed was uncertain. Therefore, it was crucial to determine how we would address this uncertainty after the announcement. In addition, two key concerns for me were how to minimize downside risk and how to manage Benefit One after the acquisition. Mr. Kikuta ' s commitment to addressing these concerns served as a crucial litmus\n\nBusiness\n\nOutside Director\n\n## Koichi Masuda\n\nAfter serving as Chair of the Japanese Institute of  Certified Public Accountants (JICPA), Mr. Masuda  became an advisor to that organization. He was  appointed as an outside director (Audit & Supervisory  Committee member) of Dai-ichi Life Holdings in  2016. Drawing on his financial expertise, he actively  expresses his opinions from an objective perspective  at Board meetings and other forums and plays a role in  supervising and auditing management of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntest for our decision. I believe the executive team, under his leadership, demonstrated more than enough commitment.\n\nMasuda: To add one point about being unable to conduct due diligence in its entirety, we considered that Benefit One was a listed company at the time, which provided a certain level of credibility. Indeed, the subsequent due diligence did not reveal any significant discrepancies. I think we can rest assured on this point.\n\nAfter the TOB announcement, the Board of Directors requested further investigation, which led to deeper discussions based on information directly received from Benefit One. This process clarified the amount of risk and the expected synergies, ultimately leading to a favorable outcome.\n\nShingai: As a publicly traded company, Benefit One had a responsibility to protect shareholder interests. Therefore, a special committee, consisting primarily of its outside directors, evaluated the appropriateness of our proposal. In this process, it was able to engage in rigorous discussions through information exchange about what synergies could be achieved and to what extent.",

This allowed outside directors to hear not only the agenda items presented to the Board but also the opinions of those in the field and how executive officers are thinking on their management of the businesses and enhancement of their functions, which I believe added depth to discussions at Board meetings.\n\nAt the Board meetings, we were able to operate effectively by delegating areas that we were satisfied with to the executive team while taking the time to properly discuss any points we identified as issues. These efforts have enhanced the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. I believe that the proactive involvement of our outside directors has been a significant driving force in advancing our governance even further.\n\nShingai: In FY2023, we held engagements with executive officers involved in business execution on 22 occasions. This is more than the 21 meetings held by the Board of Directors. As an outside director, my first step was to ask questions from various angles to deepen my understanding. Through\n\nthe responses I received, I was able to organize my thoughts on the key issues to keep in mind as an outside director of the holding company. This approach is the cornerstone of corporate governance, and it has been a great help in shaping my approach to group governance.\n\nMasuda: I would like to speak on the evolution of our group governance. As a member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, I also conduct audits of each Group company. Overall, I believe those operations are well managed, but I intend to closely monitor whether the holding company is providing appropriate oversight while respecting the independence of each company.\n\nIn that regard, over the past two years, we have introduced a CxO system and a Group Head system, thereby separating functional and business roles to strengthen our oversight capabilities. The introduction of this matrix-style management approach might lead to conflicts with the operating companies. These conflicts should serve to clarify areas of responsibility and the authority of each side \u0336 CxOs, Group Heads, and operating companies \u0336 helping our group governance evolve further. I see this as a very positive development.\n\nInagaki: When I served as President, the only CxO except me was the CFO, and that position was held by Mr. Kikuta. As soon as he became President, however, Mr. Kikuta quickly appointed CxOs from outside the Company, such as the Chief Information Officer (who serves concurrently as Chief Digital Officer) and the Chief Compliance Officer. His vision for group governance is now clear. I feel that the level of group governance significantly improved in FY2023.\n\nMoreover, by bringing in top talent with experience in group management from other companies as CxOs, we identified issues we hadn ' t previously recognized, which added momentum to the entire Group. These initiatives are integral to Mr. Kikuta ' s vision for matrix-style management, and I believe his management vision has been effectively brought to life.\n\nWhile the recruitment of CxOs was reported to and approved by the Nominations Advisory Committee in advance as a matter of course, I feel it was Mr. Kikuta ' s leadership that drove this success.\n\nMasuda: To date, we have adopted a group management approach that respects the independence of the operating companies and allows them to grow individually. This has been a positive approach and should continue to be respected. However, the holding company must also consider the allocation and recovery of resources across the entire Group. With this in mind, we introduced the CxO system, which enables the functional intervention and supervision of each operating company.\n\nThe matrix-style management might cause conflicts to arise between the operating companies and the CxOs. However, I believe this approach will be highly effective in advancing group governance, and as a member of the Audit\n\nStrategy &\n\n& Supervisory Committee I have high expectations for its success.\n\nShingai: I find Mr. Kikuta ' s transformational leadership to be truly remarkable. Several factors have made this possible. The first was separating the roles of the President of Dai-ichi Life Holdings and Dai-ichi Life. This has allowed the President of Dai-ichi Life Holdings to allocate time to optimize the entire Group and focus on group management.\n\nIn addition, we revised the remuneration system in FY2022 to attract talent from outside the Company. Specifically, we changed the executive remuneration system to one based on job value, while also ensuring flexibility when recruiting talent from overseas.\n\nThese two factors were extremely important, and I feel that Mr. Kikuta is making full use of those new foundations.\n\nAt the Board level, we have fostered a culture where outside and inside directors can engage in frank discussions while maintaining a healthy tension, or ' productive tension. ' As seen in the discussion for the acquisition of Benefit One, we have established a relationship enabling each Board member to actively express his or her opinion.\n\nFinally, I find it noteworthy that during Mr. Kikuta ' s succession, Mr. Inagaki did not exert any influence over the composition of the Kikuta cabinet. In many Japanese companies, the President continues to exert influence after becoming the Chairperson of the Board, practicing a kind of behind-the-scenes control, or initiatives undertaken by the previous President cannot be changed. In his case, however, the notion that ' you can ' t move forward if you ' re always looking back ' was reflected in concrete action, which is extremely significant. I feel this could serve as a model case to help Japanese companies drive future transformation.\n\n## Toward mid- to long-term value creation\n\nMasuda: Looking ahead, one of the key challenges we emphasize is the need to not only enter new markets but also withdraw from existing ones when necessary. Entering new markets might appear courageous, but withdrawing and recovering investments is difficult and often unpleasant. Nevertheless, we need to do this diligently as part of the ' scrap and build ' process. As a holding company, maintaining this balance is crucial to increasing the Group ' s overall profitability and corporate value.\n\nIn Japan, the Dai-ichi Life Group consists of real estate companies and asset management companies, in addition to life insurance companies. I believe we should harness these strengths and adopt a comprehensive approach to drive even greater progress.\n\nInagaki: I believe that entirely new businesses that we have not yet envisioned could become part of the Group ' s operations in the future. As a member of the Board of Directors, I believe we need to engage in dialogue with the executive team and encourage them to take risks\n\nBusiness\n\nunder the framework of capital circulation management in pursuit of new growth opportunities.\n\nShingai: I want to reiterate that the driving force behind transforming a company is not the Board of Directors, but the CEO. There are many examples worldwide of exceptional CEOs who have transformed companies, driven growth, and increased corporate value. The Board of Directors bears the critical responsibility of selecting such executives and, through necessary engagement, ensuring the long-term and sustained enhancement of corporate value. This requires effective corporate governance, which involves selecting an excellent CEO and encouraging that CEO to build an exceptional team.\n\nCompared to five years ago when I first became an outside director, the atmosphere of the Board of Directors has changed dramatically. Our outside directors have made numerous challenging recommendations, and I believe a key factor in the transformation was Mr. Inagaki ' s willingness, as the President at the time, to confront these recommendations directly. The real turning point came when he had the courage to break from tradition and make bold changes. While changing tradition in a company with a long history is not easy, we must adapt to the rapidly changing times and meet the evolving needs of our customers and society.\n\nInagaki: I don ' t believe the Board of Directors or outside directors are the ones who drive growth, but a great Board is far better at generating corporate value than a not great one. The culture of the Board of Directors isn ' t crafted by the Chairperson alone, but by each director who embraces the company ' s vision and contributes to it with full commitment. Thanks to everyone ' s cooperation, the current Board of Directors has cultivated an excellent culture. I believe this has positively impacted Mr. Kikuta ' s performance as well.\n\nAlso, as Mr. Shingai mentioned earlier, there needs to be a healthy tension in the Board of Directors. This is difficult to achieve with inside directors alone, so I am grateful to the outside directors for their contributions. It ' s important to have a culture where outside directors actively voice their opinions, and inside directors respond constructively when they disagree. This approach allows us to set the direction at the Board level, leading to long-term value creation and enabling us to meet the expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n\u76e3\u67fb\u7b49\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a\u59d4\u54e1\u9577\n\n\u524d\u2f65\u5e78-\n\n\u77f3\u4e95\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e8b\u52d9\u6240 \u30d1-\u30c8\u30ca-\u30022016\u5e74\u3088\u308a\u5f53\n\n\u793e\u793e\u5916\u53d6\u7de0\u5f79\uff08\u76e3\u67fb\u7b49\u59d4\u54e1\uff09\u306b\u5c31\u4efb\u3002\u53d6\u7de0\u5f79\n\n\u4f1a\u306a\u3069\u3067\u4f01\u696d\u6cd5\u52d9\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u77e5\u898b\u3092\u6d3b\u304b\u3057\u5ba2\u89b3\u7684\n\n\u306a\u8996\u70b9\u304b\u3089\u7a4d\u6975\u7684\u306b\u610f\u898b\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001\u7d4c\u55b6\u3092\u76e3\u7763\u00b7\n\n\u76e3\u67fb\u3059\u308b\u5f79\u5272\u3092\u62c5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002",

In FY2023, while Dai-ichi Frontier Life improved to steady positive performance, Dai-ichi Life experienced a decline, excluding its increase in the group annuities business. The value of new business for certain products turned negative at Protective Life in the US, and there was a slump and loss of sales momentum at Dai-ichi Life Vietnam. As a result, the Group value of new business decreased 30% compared with FY2022.\n\n* Starting from FY2020, changes were made to the ultimate forward rate, and the corporate bond spread was reflected in the discount rate used for Dai-ichi Frontier Life ' s debt valuation. Beginning from FY2023, the three domestic companies (Dai-ichi Life, Dai-ichi Frontier Life, and Neo First Life) applied the new economic value-based calculation method, which is set to be introduced in Japan at the end of FY2025 (retroactively applied for FY2022).\n\n\uff09\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup EV, which represents corporate value based on economic value, increased 26.8% year on year in FY2023, primarily due to the rise in market value of domestic equities and the increase in domestic interest rates.\n\n* Beginning from FY2023, the three domestic companies (Dai-ichi Life, Dai-ichi Frontier Life, and Neo First Life) applied the new economic value-based calculation method to be introduced in Japan at the end of FY2025 (retroactively applied for FY2022).\n\n## Shareholder payouts (Total dividends/Share buybacks/Dividend per share)\n\nTotal dividends\n\nShare buybacks\n\nDividend per share\n\n(\u00a5)\n\n113\n\n(\u00a5 bn)\n\n300\n\n120\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs an early application of the current mid-term management plan ' s dividend payout ratio of 40%, based on FY2023 business results, the per-share dividend has increased to \u00a5113, \u00a527 more than the previous period. We have also decided on a large-scale share buyback of up to \u00a5100bn.\n\n\uff09\n\nGroup adjusted profit, our unique indicator and a source for shareholder returns, increased 87.2% year on year to \u00a5319.3bn in FY2023. This growth was driven by factors such as improved gains from core insurance activities at Dai-ichi Life, the improvement in new policy acquisition costs at Dai-ichi Frontier Life, and the elimination of a negative impact at Protective Life in the previous fiscal year due to bank failures in the US.\n\n* IFRS 17 was applied from FY2023 for TAL and Partners Life, and retroactively to their figures for FY2022 (Group adjusted profit and Group adjusted ROE for FY2022 before retroactive application were \u00a5184.4bn and 5.0%, respectively).\n\nEconomic solvency ratio (ESR)*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nESR, an indicator of financial soundness based on economic value, increased by 14 points compared with the end of FY2023.

Based on our understanding of this changing environment, we reevaluated how we connect with stakeholders, including our customers, and took initiatives focusing on four key initiatives: Financial and Capital Strategy, Domestic Business Strategy, Overseas Business Strategy, and Management Foundation & Sustainability.\n\n## Review of Key Initiatives\n\nThe acquisition of ipet in Japan and the acquisition of Partners Life in New Zealand, a new country in our overseas business, have brought some outcomes in improving our business portfolio.\n\nIn addition, although specific strategies will be developed and implemented during the new mid-term management plan starting in FY2024, we have acquired Benefit One to further extend our business domains and form an ecosystem.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn the other hand, although we have achieved certain outcomes through various initiatives, capital efficiency remains below the cost of capital, and we are aware that the new business performance of Dai-ichi Life is an issue. In executing the new mid-term management plan, we will work to resolve issues based on our recognition of the challenges of the previous plan.\n\n| Strategy                       | Key initiatives

|\n\n## Status of KPI Achievement\n\nThe KPIs set in the previous mid-term management plan have largely achieved the levels targeted at the beginning of the plan.\n\nIn particular, with regard to the results for FY2023, the final year of the mid-term management plan, the relative TSR, which is based on the starting point of the previous mid-term management plan (end of March 2021), was fourth place, which is above the medium level, and the Group adjusted profit was well above the target due to an upswing in investment income backed by the impact of yen depreciation and other factors. The Group ' s ROEV also overachieved due to the support of external factors such as rising stock prices and interest rates.\n\nWhile significant progress was made in reducing market-related risk, equity risk remained high due to rising stock prices. We have also set a target for adjusted ROE, but it is not yet at a level that exceeds the cost of capital, so we recognize the need to continue to promote capital circulation management initiatives and take steps to reduce the cost of capital and improve capital efficiency.\n\nSustainability &\n\nFoundation\n\nRegarding the value of new business (VNB), a leading indicator of insurance profit, there were positive factors such as higher sales volume at Dai-ichi Frontier Life, supported by rising domestic and overseas interest rates. However, this was offset by sluggish new business performance at Dai-ichi Life and weak sales in the banking channel at Dai-ichi Life Vietnam due to low sales momentum. As a result, VNB was below the target as a Group and was lower than the FY2022 result.\n\nAt Dai-ichi Life, we are aiming for an early recovery in sales volume through the provision of integrated value in protection and asset formation/succession, in addition to securing new points of contact with customers through touchpoint products such as pet insurance. Beyond the KPIs in the previous mid-term management plan, we have added KPIs that are more consistent with our Vision for FY2030 to better visualize our progress in the new mid-term management plan.\n\n|                                                                                    | Target level at the end of FY2023                                                  | FY2021 result   | FY2022 result             | FY2023 result                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Group adjusted ROE* 1 (Group adjusted profit basis)                                | ca. 8%                                                                             | 8.0%            | 4.9%                      | 8.2%                                                    |\n| Group ROEV* 2                                                                      | Average ca. 8%  (by around FY2026)                                                 | 4.9%            | 3.9%                      | 26.8%                                                   |\n| Market-related risk reduction (Interest rate risk and equity  risk vs. March 2021) | Risk reduction  \u00a5560bn (equivalent to ca. 20% interest rate risk  and equity risk) | \u00a5392.9bn        | Cumulative total \u00a5537.3bn | Cumulative total \u00a5706.2bn ((25.4)% vs. March 2021) 226% |\n| Economic solvency ratio  (ESR)* 3                                                  | Maintain stable level in range   170%-200% in the medium and long term             | 227%            | 212%                      |                                                         |\n| Relative TSR (Total shareholder return) 1                                          | compared to 10 domestic and  overseas peers* 4                                     | 2nd             | 4th                       | 4th \u00a5319.3bn                                            |\n| Group adjusted profit*                                                             | ca. \u00a5250bn to \u00a5280bn                                                               | \u00a5296.1bn        | \u00a5170.5bn                  |                                                         |\n| Reference:  Group value of new business *3                                         | Operate according to targets  set for each fiscal year                             | \u00a598.6bn         | \u00a577.7bn                   | \u00a554.5bn                                                 |\n\n- *1  As TAL and Partners Life have adopted IFRS 17 from FY2023, the figures for FY2022 have been restated to retrospectively apply IFRS 17 for TAL and Partners Life.

Through the plan, we aim to become No. 1 in Japan in the four areas of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, innovation in products and services, and corporate value by FY2030, thereby becoming a global top-tier insurance group and a leader shaping the future of the Japanese insurance industry. The plan was formulated by backcasting the necessary actions to be taken over the next three years to reach these goals. We have set \u02a0 achieving capital efficiency that consistently exceeds the cost of capital \u02a1 as the most important KPI, and other important KPIs have been set as a quantitative target to which

In the previous mid-term management plan, our Group set improving capital efficiency and reducing the cost of capital as its most important issues, and implemented various measures, including risk reduction initiatives. As a result, we have achieved a certain level of success, with the cost of capital falling to around 9% as of the end of FY2023, but we have yet to reach the level we had targeted. In this section, I will explain the financial and capital strategy for the current mid-term management plan, along with my thoughts on our Group ' s business as a whole.\n\nOur Group is aiming to achieve market capitalization of \u00a56tn in FY2026 and \u00a510tn in FY2030, in order to rank among the global top tier companies by FY2030.\n\nWe have positioned the new mid-term management plan period as the final stage to achieve capital efficiency that consistently exceeds the cost of capital, a goal we have been working toward since the previous mid-term management plan, on a timeline to FY2030. Adjusted ROE in FY2023 was 8.2%, which is still below our cost of capital level of 9%. We will work to reverse this relationship and achieve capital efficiency that consistently exceeds the cost of capital as our most important issue for improvement. Therefore, in addition to improving the capital efficiency of existing businesses, we will reallocate capital to businesses where higher growth and higher capital efficiency are expected. We will also continue to emphasize share buybacks as part of our commitment to improving capital efficiency. By FY2026, we will ensure capital efficiency that exceeds the cost of capital, after which we will accelerate strategic investments to scale up profits and realize our Vision for FY2030. Our Group ' s challenge is\n\nfirst to recover the domestic value of new business (VNB) and, by extension, to maintain the profit scale of the domestic business centered on Dai-ichi Life over the medium to long term.\n\nIn anticipation of the new economic value-based capital regulations scheduled for introduction in FY2025, we are revising our ESR for internal management purposes, but currently the standards of our domestic companies have shifted to the new ones. In the future, we would like to clearly indicate the level of ESR based on the new standards after transitioning the standards of our overseas operations to the new ones as well, so that we can both maintain our financial soundness and improve capital efficiency.\n\nIt is also necessary to strengthen initiatives to control costs and improve productivity. We will work with each Group Head and CxO to improve productivity in anticipation of future inflation, for example, by strengthening the Group ' s vendor management.\n\nThe capital efficiency we aim to achieve after FY2026 and the business portfolio to realize it also need to be more specific. For example, as part of our initiatives to reduce the cost of capital and improve capital efficiency, we plan to sell \u00a51.2tn of domestic equities held by Dai-ichi Life over the three years of the current mid-term management plan. We will continue to consider the ideal level of shareholding, including the period after that.\n\nWith the stable profits generated from our domestic business, the Company has been strengthening shareholder payouts and investing in businesses with high capital efficiency. Supported by the strong domestic stock market, our financial base has remained favorable. If domestic interest rates rise, we expect to enjoy a positive impact on the business environment, such as\n\nimproved attractiveness for insurance products and increased VNB, although a certain amount of loss on sales of yendenominated bonds is anticipated.\n\nWe will also strengthen our business portfolio. We intend to demonstrate the strength of our Group, which has grown its insurance business with a long-term frame, in growing countries, particularly in Southeast Asia. The insurance business is heavily regulated and growth is not easy, but we believe only the Dai-ichi Life Group is capable of achieving this. In developed countries, we expect the retirement market to grow as the population ages, and we are working to strengthen our annuity product development and sales, as well as the asset management business. In addition, we\n\n## Basic approach to capital policies\n\nOur Group bases its capital policies on the enterprise risk management (ERM) framework, aiming for the sustainable enhancement of corporate value and further improvement of shareholder payouts while ensuring financial soundness.\n\nIn the current mid-term management plan, we aim to achieve sustainable growth through ' capital circulation management ' in a continuation of our approach from the previous plan. ' Capital circulation management ' is a concept that aims to improve corporate value by creating a virtuous cycle of capital and cash\n\nSustainability &\n\nacquired Benefit One, the largest employee benefits platform in Japan. We intend to expand this customer base and achieve profit growth commensurate with the investment.\n\nWe will further promote capital circulation management to become a global top-tier insurance group in FY2030 by utilizing our Group ' s strengths, while practicing high-quality IR activities that are trusted by the market and sustainably improving our corporate value.\n\ngeneration through the reallocation of capital to more capitalefficient and high-growth businesses while ensuring financial soundness, using capital earned through business operations and capital freed up through risk reduction as financial resources.\n\nRegarding the economic solvency ratio (ESR), an indicator of financial soundness based on economic value, we have set a target range of 170%-200%. If the ESR exceeds 200%, we will actively consider strategic investments and flexible and additional payouts, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors.\n\nCapital circulation management\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, ESR is an indicator that enables more consistent evaluation of assets and liabilities based on the same measure, that is, economic value, and encompasses fluctuations in the market value of liabilities as a result of interest rate fluctuations, which cannot be understood from accounting information.\n\nIn initiatives to evaluate economic value, we began disclosing embedded value (EV) when we listed our shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2010, and we began disclosing ESR after setting a target range from 170% to\n\n## Realization of capital circulation management\n\nTo pursue capital circulation management, we have sought to improve capital efficiency by reducing market risk at Dai-ichi Life and raising the rate of remittances from subsidiaries and by applying the surplus capital generated from this to shareholder payouts including share buybacks, and we have exercised discipline in allocating capital to strategic investments for future growth. We will also pursue the capital circulation management required to realize sustainable growth in the future by continuously\n\n200% in our mid-term management plan covering FY2015 to FY2017. Since introducing EV and ESR, we have worked to improve our measurement techniques in accordance with changes in the external environment including reflecting actual operating conditions as appropriate and capital solvency regulations.\n\nCurrently, the Insurance Capital Standard (ICS), which applies to internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs) and is being developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), and the economic value-based solvency regulation due to be introduced in Japan in FY2025 (the new regulation) are still in the process of finalization.\n\nIn preparation for the introduction of the new regulations, our three domestic life insurance companies \u0336 Dai-ichi Life, Dai-ichi Frontier Life, and Neo First Life \u0336 proactively adjusted their calculation methods to align with the new regulations starting from the end of FY2023.\n\nallocating capital to growing markets where even higher growth is expected, while simultaneously stably generating cash flow from mature markets such as Japan. At the same time, we will strive for further evolution of capital circulation management by optimizing capital utilization and increasing earnings retained within the Group through intragroup finance including reinsurance.\n\nSustainability &\n\nFoundation\n\n## Main strategies for realizing capital circulation management: Risk reduction initiatives\n\nOur Group ' s cost of capital, which was 10% at the beginning of the previous mid-term management plan, is now 9%, reflecting the effect of the reduction in the cost of capital due to the progress made in market risk reduction over the period of the previous plan.\n\nWe aim to reduce this rate to 8% by the end of the new mid-term management plan through reductions in interest rate risk and equity risk.\n\nOver the period of the previous mid-term management plan (from FY2021 to FY2023), we reduced market risk by ca. \u00a5700bn, an achievement rate of 125% against the market risk reduction\n\ntarget for the period covered by the plan, which was formulated at the end of FY2020. In the new mid-term plan, the pace of equity risk reduction will be accelerated by reducing the domestic equity holdings of Dai-ichi Life by \u00a51.2tn over three years.\n\nIn the wake of the new regulations scheduled to be introduced at the end of FY2025, we will not only reduce risk but also shift to risks where higher capital efficiency can be expected, thereby enhancing the level of capital circulation management that leads to enhancing corporate value.\n\n## Reduction in the cost of capital by reducing market risk\n\n<!-- image -->",

During the previous mid-term management plan, Dai-ichi Frontier Life and Neo First Life were both impacted by rising overseas interest rates and insurance payments related to COVID-19, but this has led to more effective utilization of capital, for example, utilization of intragroup reinsurance to efficiently\n\nimprove the solvency margin ratio. TAL has been utilizing intragroup reinsurance with Dai-ichi Life, but the establishment of the reinsurance company has made it possible to expand the scope of intragroup reinsurance utilization and further reduce capital requirements.

If we fail to recognize specific future risks and fail to ensure the necessary protection, the protection gap will widen, which will not only increase the anxiety of future generations about their lives but could also make it difficult for each individual to realize the life they want to have.\n\nIn the Protection Business (Japan), we will continue to meet diversifying customer needs and pursue optimal solutions to close these protection gaps and work to demonstrate our social significance as a life insurance company. To this end, we believe it is necessary to refine the Group ' s product and channel strategies based on a market-in approach, with the customer as the starting point, in order to create the best possible customer experiential value (CX) for our customers. We play a complementary role to the social security system by providing insurance products that resonate with customers in the four categories of death protection, medical protection, income protection, and long-term care protection. Through the integrated value offering of ' protection ' and ' asset formation/succession ' in the era of 100-year life spans,\n\nwe will collaborate with our customers to co-create life designs that help them achieve their desired lives.\n\nIn terms of sales channels, we will strengthen the face-toface consulting capabilities of the sales rep channel of Dai-ichi Life, expand the product lineup in the agency channel including walk-in shops, and strengthen the digital direct channel.\n\nWe also recognize that in order to deliver protection to customers at the optimal times and across the right channels, it is important to combine the strengths of the real world (face-toface consulting channel) and the advantages of the digital world (online contact points) to create better CX and improve the productivity of the sales channels.\n\nThrough these efforts, we will embody our ' By your side, for life ' brand message that has earned the trust of customers and aim for a sustainable Production Business (Japan) that continues to create customer value and social value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability &\n\n## Initiatives and results of the previous mid-term management plan\n\nIn the previous mid-term management plan (Re-connect 2023), we worked to build business processes that focus on CX through four experiential values including protection and the CX Design Strategy that unites them.\n\nDai-ichi Life has promoted an integrated reform of its products and consulting services by upgrading its consulting methods through the Total Life Plan, a life plan simulation linked to the social security system, and by renewing its product lineup. In addition, we have fundamentally reviewed our recruitment, training, and salary evaluation systems in the sales reps ' channel, and have made improvements to systems to make the sales channel one that embodies CX through higher-quality consulting. Although these major reforms took time to take root, the effects have become steadily apparent.\n\nIn the group protection area, to meet the needs of companies and their employees, we have expanded our lineup of employee benefits programs by launching products such as ' Smart Iryo, ' which provides a lump-sum payment to cover expenses in the event of hospitalization, and ' Anshin My Package, ' which allows individuals to select the necessary coverage and complete the process digitally.\n\nAt Neo First Life, we launched products such as ' Neo de Gan Chiryo ' and ' Neo de 3 Shippei  Support, ' which help cover the costs associated with cancer and other major illnesses.

We will promote strategic product development by leveraging the strengths of each Group company in Japan.\n\nAt Dai-ichi Life, we launched the index-linked personal annuity insurance ' Step Jump ' in December 2023, followed by the whole life insurance ' Towa Support ' in March 2024, which provides lifetime coverage against three major illnesses, long-term care, and physical disabilities. We are promoting consulting services that address both ' protection ' and ' asset ormation/succession, ' and these products have received positive feedback from many customers. ' Towa Support ' was developed in response to customer voices such as ' I want lifetime coverage for major illnesses ' and ' I want a plan with cash value to meet sudden\n\nfinancial needs. ' Our aim was to directly meet the increasingly diverse needs of our customers.\n\nAt Neo First Life, under the new brand concept ' Just Right, Just What You Need, ' we revised our main medical insurance product, ' Neo de Iryo, ' in August 2024. The revisions included enhanced coverage for lifestyle disease prevention and the ability to provide necessary medical protection at lower premiums.\n\nAt Dai-ichi Smart Small-amount and Short-term Insurance, we are leveraging the features of fully digital insurance to provide a seamless insurance experience within customers ' everyday consumption activities. We aim to meet explicit needs with products and explore initiatives such as embedded insurance schemes, where customers can purchase cancellation insurance when booking or buying airline tickets.\n\nWe will continue to work as a unified group to create value that resonates with our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Realize financial well-being for customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Channel strategy\n\nTo deliver protection to our customers at the most optimal timing and through the most appropriate channels, we recognize the importance of integrating the strengths of real channels (face-toface consulting) with the advantages of digital (online touchpoints), from the perspective of enhancing customer experience value and improving productivity.\n\nOur Group is committed to strengthening the face-to-face consulting capabilities of Dai-ichi Life ' s sales rep channel; expanding the product lineup in the agency channels, including walk-in insurance shops; and enhancing our digital direct channels.\n\nDai-ichi Life has begun development of an avatar powered by generative AI, serving as a digital buddy to support sales activities in the sales rep channel. The avatar will assist in providing information during customer interactions and advise on the best actions to take going forward.

Therefore, we recognize the importance of pursuing productivity and efficiency more than ever. While actively investing in future initiatives such as digital transformation (DX), we will continue to improve business efficiency in existing areas.\n\nDai-ichi Life is working to optimize the allocation of branches and sales offices nationwide, strategically review the allocation of human resources, and improve the efficiency of various administrative workflows using digital technology. As a result, fixed-cost reductions in existing businesses are progressing faster than were planned when the previous mid-term management plan was formulated.\n\nIn addition, Neo First Life has been taking steps to strengthen its efficient sales promotion and support systems for independent insurance agencies, and productivity per sales rep is steadily increasing.\n\nWe will continue to promote products and channel strategies that resonate with customers, while driving DX across the value chain and advancing business efficiency at each Group company. Through these efforts, we aim to contribute to the sustainable growth and enhancement of corporate value for the entire Group.",

In particular, with the progression of longer life expectancies, there is a growing concern about the risk that the longevity of financial assets (the age at which financial assets such as savings and pensions are depleted) might not match an individual's life span, leading to greater anxiety about retirement funds. Extending asset longevity through individual efforts has become a pressing social issue.\n\nWe believe that the life insurance business comprehensively contributes to stable household asset formation, in that it plays a role not only in supporting the risk of loss of household assets due to a decrease in household income or an increase in expenses caused by a customer ' s\n\nillness or other cause (protection-type products) but also in building household assets for the future (saving-type products). We also believe that our strength as an insurance company lies in our ability to visualize the balance sheet of households and to simultaneously demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of insurance as an off-balance-sheet asset in addition to necessary asset rebalancing (consulting on both protection and asset formation). In addition, as customers ' needs diversify in response to changes in the social environment and technological innovations, we will work from the asset formation/succession domain to transform ourselves into an insurance-related service provider that provides not only insurance products but also means to help customers solve their problems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group is engaged in a wide range of businesses in the asset formation/succession domain, including a savings and investment trust business for individuals, group pension businesses, and a bancassurance business, as well as asset management and real estate. The asset formation/succession domain is expected to continue to grow at a high rate in response to the government ' s ' doubling asset-based incomes plan ' and other measures. In addition, because of its higher capital efficiency compared to the traditional life insurance business, we believe that growth in this domain will drive the Group ' s overall growth in corporate value. We intend to efficiently capitalize on the growth opportunities in the asset formation/ succession domain as they continue to emerge with a sense of speed, while bringing together and demonstrating the strengths of each business and incorporating external growth. We aim for this domain to contribute more than 25% of the Group ' s targeted Group adjusted profit of \u00a5600bn by FY2030, including about half of the domestic insurance area and the asset management business in the non-insurance area.\n\nAs an insurance group that provides products and services to support stable asset formation by households, as both an asset owner and asset manager, and as one of the entities that make up the financial and capital markets, the Group intends to fulfill its roles and responsibilities throughout the investment chain and contribute to the realization of an asset management-oriented country, the growth of the domestic economy, and the buildup of customers ' asset income.\n\nFinancial Well-being for All\n\nHealthy People and Society\n\nWe will accelerate the development of human resources capable of providing consulting services that are tailored to customer needs in terms of both ' protection ' and ' asset formation/succession ' based on the life plans of each customer. At the same time, we aim to enhance our products and services to support the needs of customers at each stage of their lives, such as asset formation for younger generations, the extension of asset life expectancy for middle-aged and older generations, and asset succession for the next generation. Moreover, we strive to consistently earn and maximize investment income that meets customer expectations through the investment of insurance premiums and other assets entrusted to us by our customers. We will support our customers ' asset formation through long-term and stable investment income based on our business characteristics as a life insurance company by further diversifying and upgrading asset management instruments and products, and by utilizing M&As.\n\nAs one of the leading institutional investors in Japan, we will also work to revitalize the financial and capital markets and solve environmental and social issues. We will strive to realize a sustainable and resilient environment and society through stewardship activities including dialogue with portfolio companies, ESG investments and loans, and proactive financing of growth areas, taking advantage of the characteristics of the life insurance business that enable us to supply funds over the medium to long term.\n\n## Initiatives and results of the previous mid-term management plan\n\nThe Group has been working to strengthen and expand product competitiveness, enhance consulting functions, and strength digital points of contact with customers.\n\n## Comprehensive  Group  strengths\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDai-ichi Life has begun offering a new plan for iDeCo, known as ' Dai-ichi Life iDeCo Mirai-deco. ' We have also started training asset formation/succession and inheritance advisors who handle iDeCo and investment trusts in addition to insurance products centered on protection products. As of the end of March 2024, we have certified more than 300 advisors, enabling us to perform consulting activities in terms of both protection and asset formation/succession. In addition, we have launched the digital platform service ' Asset Formation Plus ' to encourage people to\n\nthink about asset formation/succession in their daily lives by providing advice and information on how to extend the life of their assets through the use of digital functions. The ' Asset Formation Plus ' service improves digital services by providing net banking services utilizing BaaS (Banking as a Service) provided by SBI Sumishin Net Bank and Rakuten Bank.

Vertex Investment Solutions has been established as a new asset management company under the Group. The company offers investment functions and solutions based on advanced financial engineering techniques (quantitative strategies). In the Asset Management Business, we have invested in domestic and overseas asset management companies (Topaz Capital and Canyon Partners) that have strengths in areas such as private debt investment to strengthen our asset management functions in the high-growth and highly profitable alternative asset area.

In the Group Pension Business, we have been aiming to expand our fee business as a stable source of income independent of the interest rate environment, such as the Separate Accounts products sales business for DB pension funds and DC and investment trusts. However, in light of the current interest rate environment, we will also consider expanding sales of the spread business (interest rate-guaranteed products) to meet customers ' needs for guaranteed principal.\n\n## Strengthening and expanding product competitiveness\n\nInvesting know-how, expertise, and agility Investing know-how, expertise, and agility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\nThe Group ' s product development capabilities\n\nExpand the highly competitive product lineup that facilitates asset formation/ succession (e.g., saving-type products, group pension products)\n\nFurthermore, to provide optimal solutions to each customer, we believe it is important to provide consulting services that are tailored to the customer ' s lifetime with regard to both protection and asset formation/succession. In particular, it will be critical for us to refine our consulting services for customers in the pre- and post-retirement periods, when the need for asset management and asset succession is growing. We will continue to promote consulting activities from both protection and asset formation/ succession perspectives, including the expansion of asset formation/succession and inheritance advisor systems, and the expanded iDeCo services by sales rep channel.\n\nTo make our ' Asset Formation Plus ' and BaaS-based net banking services more convenient and attractive for customers to use on a daily basis, we will continue to enhance the functions that support customers ' asset formation/succession by utilizing external services and functions that have a proven track record in the digital domain.\n\nBy combining the strengths of the Group, actively considering alliances and M&As with companies outside the Group, and embarking on new initiatives while strengthening the value chain,\n\n## Enhancing consulting functions\n\n## Expanding the asset formation/ succession and inheritance advisor (SSSAD) system Expanding the asset formation/ succession and inheritance advisor (SSSAD) system\n\n## Strengthening digital points of contact with customers\n\nNew points of contact with customers through BaaS and asset formation platforms New points of contact with customers through BaaS and asset formation platforms\n\nAccelerate the development of human resources capable of providing integrated consultation on protection and asset formation/ succession in the face-to-face channel, which used to focus on  life insurance sales\n\n## Scale up to 1,700 advisors by the end of FY2026\n\n(human resources distinct from existing sales reps)\n\nSupport customers\n\n'\n\nasset\n\nformation/succession through\n\nthe use of account functions,\n\ndaily contact building, and visualization\n\nof current and future income and expenses\n\nNumber of BaaS accounts opened (cumulative) (89,000 as of July 2024)\n\nPurpose\n\n\uff06\n\nValues\n\nwe will remarkably enhance our CX in the area of asset formation/ succession, seeking to realize our customers ' everyday well-being and address social issues.\n\nIn addition, the Group strives to earn and maximize investment income that meets customer expectations from both the standpoint of an asset owner that manages insurance premiums entrusted by customers and the standpoint of an asset manager that provides optimal solutions to a wide range of customers from other asset owners to households.

As invested assets are the source of future insurance benefits, individual annuities, corporate pension funds, and so on, we aim to obtain long-term and stable income in accordance with the characteristics of the assets, and we conduct asset portfolio construction based on strict risk management (integrated asset and liability management: ALM).\n\nIn addition, we have been working to upgrade and diversify our investment methods in the changing financial market environment, such as the continuing low interest rate environment.\n\n## Asset management and real estate business strategy\n\nThe Group ' s asset management and real estate business is committed to providing optimal solutions to a wide range of customers, from other asset owners to households.\n\nIn addition to Asset Management One, which is one of the largest asset management companies in Japan and develops and provides investment products that meet the needs of a wide range of clients, we have recently established Dai-ichi Life Realty Asset Management, which provides investment opportunities focusing on real estate properties, and Vertex Investment Solutions, which provides sophisticated investment products by leveraging its quantitative management expertise.\n\nLed by Dai-ichi Life, we have actively invested not only in traditional assets such as government and corporate bonds but also in selective credit investments and alternative assets such as infrastructure, private equity, and real estate, which ensures profitability while also strengthening portfolio risk diversification.

As Group Head, I will work to achieve the Group ' s Vision for FY2030 by ensuring our role as a growth driver for the Group as well as our contribution to enhancing our corporate value. In this section, I would like to touch upon our action plan.\n\nThe history of our International Life Insurance Business dates back to our entry into Vietnam in 2007, and we have since expanded into markets at different business stages for a well-balanced portfolio of businesses: stable markets in developed countries such as the US, growing markets such as India in the Asia-Pacific region, and earlystage emerging markets where business expansion in the long run is expected.\n\nUnder the previous mid-term management plan (Re-connect 2023), we added Partners Life in New Zealand as a subsidiary, bringing the number of international life insurance Group companies to nine. In addition, we have been exploring opportunities to expand in existing business areas and invest in digital projects.\n\nAs a result of the solid growth of our international business since 2007, over the three years of the previous mid-term management plan, the International Life Insurance Business generated around \u00a5230bn of adjusted profit, which accounted for ca. 30% of the Group adjusted profit.\n\nThe history of our International Life Insurance Business to date is also a history of promoting our Values (We care/We do what ' s right/We innovate) overseas. Currently, we have more than 37mn overseas customers, and I believe that we have contributed to the\n\npenetration of the insurance business in each country.\n\nThe environment surrounding the International Life Insurance Business is changing at great speed, for instance, with new regulations such as ICS (Insurance Capital Standard) and IFRS 17, growing awareness of fiduciary duty mainly in Asia, and changes in consumer behavior through accelerated digitalization, initiatives related to climate change, and geopolitical and human rights risks. These factors make it hard to predict the future. In managing our business under these circumstances, I have three major pillars as Group Head. The first is to develop and execute a sustainable International Life Insurance Business growth strategy under a matrix-type governance structure and in closer collaboration with the CxOs.  Second, we will proactively engage in further M&A activities, including those in new business areas, by mobilizing the Group ' s organizational capabilities and external expertise. Third, to build an operating structure that is resilient to environmental changes, we will develop and appropriately assign a large number of professional and managerial talent. We will pursue various initiatives based on these three major pillars.\n\nIn the International Life Insurance Business, by working together with Group companies around the world to build a brighter and more secure future for customers in each country, we aim to increase adjusted profit to \u00a5160bn and its proportion within the Group to 40% in FY2026. As Group Head, I will remain committed to the development of the insurance business in each country and to the enhancement of corporate value, keeping our Purpose in mind.\n\nSustainability &\n\nFoundation\n\nFinancial Well-being for All\n\nHealthy People and Society\n\n## History of the International Life Insurance Business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Re-connect 2023 \uff5c Review of expansion efforts\n\nWe steadily strengthened existing businesses through M&As by overseas subsidiaries and through the expansion of bancassurance alliances.

Since the initial investment, TAL has grown to become the leading life insurer in Australia, protecting more than 5mn customers today. The strength of TAL ' s business resulted in the company maintaining the No. 1 position in the Australian life insurance protection market for the last 10 consecutive years (by Annualized Premium In-force, API).\n\n## Growth in a challenging environment\n\nThe last few years have seen significant shifts in the regulatory and market landscape that have challenged the growth of the Australian life insurance market. The life insurance market totaled ca. AU$18bn in FY2023, experiencing API growth of 1% p.a. over the last five years. In contrast, TAL achieved average API growth of 12% p.a. over that same time frame to solidify its No. 1 position.\n\nThe success has been underpinned by organic and inorganic growth supported by the Group under a diversified distribution model. TAL has established long-term relationships with large superannuation funds, which have accelerated organic premium growth. The acquisitions of InsuranceLine (2008) and Lifebroker (2013) advanced TAL ' s presence in the direct-to-consumer channel and the more recent acquisitions of Suncorp ' s (2019) and Westpac ' s (2022) life insurance businesses have also served to solidify TAL ' s position in the individual life channel.\n\n## Aiming Higher with Initiatives\n\n## Extending into retirement\n\nTAL took the first steps to expand its protection products to include retirement solutions by entering into a retirement partnership with AMP, one of the largest superannuation funds, in October 2022. TAL continues to actively engage in the retirement market in order to provide more value to customers and is partnering with superannuation fund partners to meet the retirement needs of their members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stable profitability and cash contribution\n\nTAL ' s diversified portfolio and competitive standing has enabled the company to deliver stable performance and value to the Group. In the last five years, adjusted profit has grown steadily and the company has provided \u00a554.7bn of dividends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enhancing customer experience through technology\n\nAs part of TAL ' s efforts to continually improve experiences for customers, partners, and their members, TAL continues to invest in technological capabilities. Claims is one area of focus where the company is investing in its technology to reduce operational complexity and automate the claims experience. TAL has also developed a digital platform within the Group Life Business and is focused on expanding the platform capabilities and integrating it into Group Life partner systems to provide members with leading life insurance digital experiences.\n\nSustainability &\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives to strengthen Group management through optimal allocation of talented human resources\n\nCEO, DLI Asia Pacific Brett Clark2008: Joined TAL 2015: Group CEO & Managing Director of TAL 2024:  Senior Managing Executive Officer of Dai-ichi Life Holdings Appointed CEO of DLI Asia Pacific\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assignment of overseas talent\n\nThrough its acquisitions, investments, and external recruitment activities to date, the Group has acquired management personnel with global knowledge and expertise.\n\nWe also appoint top management personnel who have achieved outstanding results at international Group companies to serve as executives of or advisors to Dai-ichi Life Holdings or regional headquarters after they retire from the top management positions at those companies, in order to incorporate their global knowledge and management experience into the management of the Group.

In that role, I will support customer well-being in value propositions other than insurance by expanding into new fields of business such as healthcare and employee benefit platforms. I will also do my utmost to increase the contribution of non-insurance businesses (new businesses + asset management) to 10% of the Group adjusted profit by FY2030. In this section, I would like to talk about the New Fields of Business being pursued by our Group as I envision that.\n\nIn Japan, the social environment continues to change with an accelerating population decline, a falling birth rate, an aging population, and the diversification and segmentation of values. Given this environment, we recognize that life insurance is a mature industry. At the same time, we believe that there are various business opportunities given the tight labor market and the rapid evolution of digital technology. For the Group to continue to contribute to society and grow sustainably, we will go beyond the traditional life insurance business and evolve into a company that supports customers in all aspects of their daily lives. In other words, we will transform ourselves into an insurance-related service provider. To achieve this, it is essential for us to engage in new fields of businesses that are not restricted by our existing business fields.\n\nHere I would like to present some examples of recent initiatives that exceed the fields of the life insurance business.\n\nIn 2021, in light of current social issues, we started offering ' Healstep \u00ae , ' a service that supports medical expense optimization for health insurance associations. ' Healstep \u00ae ' broadly consists of four services: (1) Visualization of future disease risks and medical costs with a future medical cost prediction model (AI engine); (2)\n\nFormulation of a policy based on these data; (3) Assistance to receive online health guidance, and similar support, in cooperation with service providers; and (4) ' QOLism, ' a health promotion app for health insurance association members, which offers a wide range of content to help individual customers improve their well-being, including through exercise, diet, and mental health. In 2023, we added ipet Insurance, which focuses on pet insurance, as a member of our Group. Customers who own pets treat them as members of their family, and their pets significantly impact how their well-being improves. Our Group aims to improve the wellbeing of both pets and customers through value propositions that include consultations with customers to provide protection and resultant medical care opportunities for their pets. In 2024, Benefit One, which operates the employee benefit platform ' Benefit Station ' with 9.76mn members in Japan, became a member of our Group.\n\nNew businesses, in other words, are those outside the scope of our existing businesses, and there are plenty of opportunities. However, choosing the right business \u0336 one that is compatible with our existing operations, highly needed by society, and aligned with our Group's vision \u0336 requires a multifaceted approach. When considering new businesses among these various options, I try to remember the words of Tsuneta Yano, the founder of Dai-ichi Life: ' Think about whether it will bring joy to people, or if they could do without it. ' As this phrase suggests, I would like to pursue new fields of business without being constrained by existing frameworks, but instead by thinking through what will please customers and what they need.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expansion into non-insurance fields\n\nIn today ' s society, where various changes and evolutions including technological innovations such as generative AI are occurring at a remarkable pace, it is important to recognize both the risk of making hasty decisions and the risk of taking too much time, and to take speedy actions such as M&As utilizing our strategic investment budget on options that are judged to contribute to increasing corporate value. We are considering a wide range of directions for our next initiatives, including strengthening healthand medical-related services, further improving the functionality and attractiveness of the ' Benefit Station ' platform, and taking on\n\nFinancial Well-being for All\n\nHealthy People and Society\n\nthe challenge of entering new business areas that have a high affinity with our existing businesses. In new business fields, we will strive to create new points of contact with customers and other stakeholders while improving the capital efficiency of the Group.\n\nOur Group has set a target of \u00a5600bn in Group adjusted profit by FY2030. To achieve this goal, we will explore and realize value propositions in new fields of businesses that will please society and our customers, and enhance the corporate value of the Group.\n\n## Direction of New Fields of Business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Direction of expansion into  New Fields of Business                                              | Direction of strategic  investment and M&As                                                       | Target share of adjusted profit  for non-insurance fields   | Target share of adjusted profit  for non-insurance fields                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u25a0 Scaling up experiential value areas  such as health and medical care and enhancing connections | \u25a0 Leveraging the Benefit One platform  to strengthen our health and  medical-related services     | FY2023                                                      | Domestic insurance Overseas insurance Non-insurance (New business + Asset |\n| \u25a0 Expanding non-insurance fields and  building an ecosystem with Benefit  One as a hub           | \u25a0 Additional investments to strengthen  the Benefit One platform other than  that mentioned above | Small % 10% FY2026 (Target) 40% \u301c 60% \u00a5400bn               | management)                                                               |\n| \u25a0 Exploring adjacent areas with a high  affinity to existing businesses                          | \u25a0 Acquisition of organizational  capabilities with competitiveness,  such as digital technology   | Vision for  FY2030 50% \u00a5600bn  level                        | 40%                                                                       |\n\n## Ecosystem concept\n\nWe believe that a robust well-being ecosystem capable of providing customers with a range of services, both insurance and noninsurance, is essential for our Group to be ' By your side, for life ' in modern and contemporary ways. This ecosystem needs to be the one that customers want to use and continue to use.\n\nFor customers to want to use an ecosystem, there must be trust that quality content and services will be provided with economic benefits. In addition, for customers to want to continue using that ecosystem, there must be a high level of convenience that allows seamless access to a wide range of content and\n\nservices. To build an ecosystem that meets these requirements, it was necessary for our Group to possess platform functions that would serve as a hub connecting customers with such content and services.\n\nBenefit One has a solid platform called ' Benefit Station ' in the B2B2E business that meets these requirements, and we recognized its superiority in developing new businesses that will lead to the well-being of our customers in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability &",

' Their main business, employee benefits, has 9.76mn members and ca. 16,000 client companies, making it the market leader in terms of membership share in the employee benefits outsourcing service market. Amid tightening labor supply and demand, we recognize that interest in employee benefits services, in addition to wage increases, is growing as companies seek to enhance their attractiveness in the labor market. We believe there is significant growth potential in this area.\n\nIn terms of synergies between our Group and Benefit One, in the short term, the sales channels of Dai-ichi Life will be utilized to expand Benefit One ' s customer base and acquire new members. In the medium to long term, our Group will solidify its strategy to utilize the Benefit One platform, starting with the employee benefit\n\nsolution and ' Kyu-Toku-Barai, ' which is a payroll deduction service, in order to provide existing products and services of our Group such as protection, asset formation, and health and medical care, as well as products and services in new business fields. We will also consider synergies between Benefit One ' s healthcare business, which provides health checkup outsourcing services and specified health guidance services, and our various healthcare services such as ' Healstep \u00ae . ' We share a common goal of encouraging individual customers to promote health and improve their well-being, and we believe that combining our services and providing them in an integrated manner will create synergies and lead to greater convenience for corporate personnel and employees.\n\nThrough these various efforts to create synergies, we will contribute to the well-being of our customers and aim to enhance the corporate value of our Group while achieving profitable growth as a whole Group.\n\n## Benefit Station\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Member voice\n\n## Voice of person in charge\n\nTatsuo Nishikawa  Kazunori Imaeda  Ryosuke Usui\n\nDai-ichi Life Holdings Benefit One Collaboration Task Force\n\nWe are very pleased to welcome Benefit One to our Group. In May, the Benefit One Collaboration Task Force was formed to promote collaboration and is working to create and realize synergies as early as possible. Benefit One ' s services are important for delivering a variety of services, including in non-insurance fields, to our customers over the medium to long term, and we hope to create a win-win relationship for further growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ipet Insurance\n\nIn 2019, our Group began a business alliance with ipet Insurance for the sales reps of Dai-ichi Life to introduce and propose pet insurance. In 2023, we also acquired ipet Insurance as a subsidiary. Pets have become as important as family members, hobbies, and health in improving people ' s quality of life. ipet Insurance supports the happy lives of people and pets by providing pet insurance, and takes a role of important value proposition in ' enhancing connection, ' one of the experiential values offered by the Daiichi Life Group.\n\nipet Insurance has been delivering products that meet the needs of pet owners, such as its main product, Uchi-no-Ko ( ' Our Pet ' ) pet insurance, which protects the health of pets. These products have been popular with customers, leading to a record number of new policies in FY2023.\n\nTogether with ipet Insurance, we are committed to the realization of well-being for all family members, including pets.\n\nFinancial Well-being for All\n\nHealthy People and Society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting the healthcare business to extend healthy life expectancy and solve corporate issues\n\nTo solve the social issue of the high cost of medical care for the nation ' s aging society, our Group is working to help people achieve well-being in the areas of health and medical care beyond the life insurance business.\n\nWe provide ' Healstep \u00ae , ' which supports efficient health business operations aimed at optimizing medical costs and promotes health management and collaborative health initiatives in a comprehensive package, as well as the health promotion app ' QOLism, ' to health insurance associations and companies. The number of organizations adopting these solutions is steadily increasing.\n\nAs an example from health insurance associations that have implemented the service, there is a correlation showing that the higher the frequency of QOLism usage within a group, the more effective it is in suppressing the future increase in medical costs (based on analysis using a future medical cost prediction model).\n\nGoing forward, we will enhance collaboration with Benefit One ' s services and, by improving healthcare and employee benefits systems, work to maximize the value of solutions offered to health insurance associations and companies, while contributing to the well-being of their members and employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability &\n\nFoundation",

        "page_content": "## Special Dialogue\n\n## Synergies between the Dai-ichi Life Group and Benefit One\n\nWhat kind of synergies will be created by Benefit One joining the Dai-ichi Life Group in 2024? In this dialogue, we discuss the role Benefit One plays as the Dai-ichi Life Group transitions from a insurance provider to an insurance-related service provider.\n\n## Benefit One \u029f s  vision and its alignment with the Dai-ichi Life Group\n\nShiraishi: Benefit One is fundamentally committed to resolving problems faced by society. It was founded with the goal of enabling the visualization of services, which are often difficult to compare and evaluate, and creating a social infrastructure enabling customers to make such comparisons with safety and security.\n\nSince then, Benefit One has operated under the corporate philosophy of ' Connecting people and businesses to create new value while helping enrich people ' s lives and fostering social development through service creation and distribution. ' By expanding its membership base, centered on the workplace, and networking with service suppliers (in the leisure and entertainment industries), it has developed businesses that help resolve corporate management challenges and improve user satisfaction.\n\nKai: The Dai-ichi Life Group shares a similar philosophy, as reflected in its brand message, ' By your side, for life. ' For 120 years, we have operated as an ' insurance provider. ' To meet the diverse needs of our customers and be even more closely involved in their lives, however, we are transitioning into an ' insurance-related service provider. ' This will allow us to offer wide-ranging experiential value through services that extend beyond life insurance.\n\nTo seamlessly deliver wide-ranging experiential value, we must have a powerful platform that is closely connected with many customers. However, building such a platform from scratch would require significant cost and time. For this reason, we researched various industries with the belief that collaborating with a company that already possesses a strong platform would be more effective and efficient. Our top candidate for collaboration was Benefit One, which shares a common philosophy with the Dai-ichi Life Group and provides employee benefit services that contribute to human capital management.\n\nShiraishi: Benefit One ' s vision is to become a company that provides services covering the entire lifetime of every individual in Japan \u0336 from birth to end of life. It aspires to have ca. 67mn working people in Japan, along with their families, totaling ca. 120mn people, become members of Benefit One. It also aims to connect all members and every service supplier in Japan through a single network called Benefit Station, creating a distribution infrastructure that functions as a social infrastructure.\n\nIt took 28 years for Benefit One to reach 10mn members, and its market penetration rate for employee benefit outsourcing services is around 26%-28%. As we approach 30%, regarded as critical mass for influencing decision-making for service adoption, we can anticipate rapid growth going forward. Also, Japan is emerging from a 35-year period of deflation characterized by an excess labor supply, and we are now experiencing the tailwinds of both entering an inflationary society and facing labor shortages. With the added benefit of the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s powerful\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRepresentative Director, President of Benefit One\n\nNorio Shiraishi\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability &\n\nresources, we are now in a position to introduce our services to companies across Japan and achieve rapid growth in our membership base.\n\n## Expanding into untapped markets through our sales reps\n\nKai: There is still a lot of potential to increase the number of Benefit Station members. In particular, we are entering an era where employee benefits are becoming increasingly important for talent acquisition and retention, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We believe that by communicating the appeal of Benefit Station to the Daiichi Life Group's corporate and individual customer base, we can help unlock its full potential.\n\nShiraishi: Unfortunately, Japan ' s SMEs offer few non-statutory employee benefits, resulting in a significant disparity compared to large corporations and public-sector employees. The tax system related to employee benefits is well-developed. While wages paid in cash are subject to taxation, services provided as employee benefits can be non-taxable if certain conditions are met. Therefore, offering employee benefits can provide significant cost-effectiveness for companies. Typical examples of such tax-advantaged benefits include government employee housing, company housing for large corporations, and employee cafeterias. This also leads to an increase in disposable income for employees.\n\nWhile large corporations have made good use of tax benefits for employee welfare, SMEs have not offered many benefits, perhaps due to their relative lack of financial resources. As a result, a significant gap has emerged between large corporations and SMEs in terms of not only wages but also employee benefits. By offering employee benefits, SMEs can also increase their employees ' disposable income. Therefore, we are currently conducting awareness campaigns, specifically targeting SMEs, to promote employee benefit services. While competition among SMEs for talent is intensifying due to labor shortages, offering employee benefits can also help protect employees ' standard of living from inflation.\n\nKai: We aim to actively expand our reach to SMEs going forward. Benefit One already holds a strong market share among large corporations and government agencies, but there is still significant untapped potential in the SME sector.\n\nWe aim to leverage the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s nationwide branch network and the connections of its ca. 35,000 sales reps to showcase the attractiveness of our employee benefit platform to SMEs and encourage them to become members.\n\nShiraishi: That is reassuring. To realize Benefit One's vision, our immediate mission is to achieve quantitative expansion by increasing both the number of members and the range of services offered. After achieving quantitative expansion,",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nhowever, our most critical KPI will be how to effectively increase the total transaction volume within the ecosystem where service providers and consumers are connected. To this end, Benefit One is expanding its range of services and promoting their use.\n\nSustainability &\n\nabout the business development in Japan, you also presented on global expansion, and everyone in attendance was engaged in listening. Members from our Asian subsidiaries, in particular, showed a strong interest in the Japanese business model. In Thailand and India, where mobile and digital technologies are even more widespread than in Japan, there is a strong synergy between employee benefit services and the insurance industry. After thoroughly researching the legal and tax systems, we believe it is possible to expand Benefit One ' s business in the footprint of our subsidiary insurance companies. Therefore, we will pursue global expansion as a medium- to long-term objective.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nShiraishi: One of the major hurdles we face is the challenge of scale. Realistically speaking, our target of reaching 120mn members is an extraordinarily ambitious figure. It ' s easy to say that we aim to network all services across Japan, but the reality is far more complex. When you consider the inclusion of SMEs from Hokkaido to Okinawa, the scale becomes truly immense. The biggest challenge is how quickly we can work toward these overwhelming targets. I believe that with steady, persistent effort, we will eventually see our goal. However, I ' m continually thinking of ways to speed up a process that would naturally take a tremendous amount of time. By joining the Dai-ichi Life Group, I am confident that we can significantly shorten that timeline.\n\nKai: The Dai-ichi Life Group has set targets of achieving market capitalization of \u00a56tn by the end of FY2026 and \u00a510tn by FY2030. I believe that Benefit One will be the catalyst to help achieve these targets. By transitioning from a traditional insurance provider to an insurance-related service provider, offering a variety of services, and improving capital efficiency, we can achieve the \u00a510tn target. To this end, we will position Benefit One at the center in our effort to build a platform that serves as an ecosystem for providing insurance-related services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe believe that the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s sales reps will play a crucial role in promoting service utilization and increasing the total transaction volume. At present, our focus is on further expanding our reach among large corporations by working with the ca. 400 relationship managers (corporate sales reps who mainly target large companies) of the Dai-ichi Life Group. However, it is important to note that ca. 99% of companies in Japan are SMEs. In the untapped market of SMEs, company presidents often hold significant authority, making it crucial to focus our approach directly on them. Therefore, we aim to develop the new market of SMEs through sales reps who have access to the top management of these companies.\n\n## Through Benefit Station, sales reps can become true \u02a0 By your side, for life \u02a1 partners.\n\nShiraishi: Although it ' s still a future consideration, we are exploring the possibility of making Benefit Station memberships free by using transaction fees generated from our payroll deduction service ' Kyu-Toku-Barai ' as a source of revenue. We aim to have every citizen in Japan become a member. However, we understand that it would take a long time to significantly increase our membership if we were to charge membership fees to ca. 10mn self-employed individuals, employees of SMEs, and workers in the agriculture and forestry sectors. At some point, therefore, we will need to make the membership fee free. However, monetization is also necessary, so we are considering leveraging payment services as a method to achieve this. Traditionally, the distribution business generates revenue from the spread between the buying and selling prices. However, we have established a subscription model based on membership fees. Looking ahead, we are considering shifting even from this model to a revenue model based on payment transactions. In such a payment-based revenue\n\nmodel, the total transaction volume will form the foundation of our profitability. We are also considering a system where we could pay commissions to sales reps from revenue generated through these transactions. Because Benefit Station provides services tailored to major events throughout one ' s life, it will enable the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s sales reps to offer more personalized services to their customers.\n\nBenefit Station is not just an impersonal Internetbased platform, but rather something that allows people to communicate with each other and be a part of each other ' s lives, so I am confident that your sales reps can support it.\n\nKai: It ' s truly a win-win relationship. From the perspective of our sales reps, the tools for communicating with customers have so far been limited to insurance and asset formation/ succession products, with the main points of contact being when customers revisit their coverage of existing insurance or at the time of insurance payouts. Through our collaboration with Benefit One, however, our sales reps will have significantly greater opportunities to connect with customers. As reflected in our brand message, ' By your side, for life, ' our sales reps can also use Benefit Station to propose necessary services to company employees. In addition to insurance, they will be able to introduce a wide variety of services featured on Benefit Station that are tailored to life events, such as home purchases, childcare and healthcare support, and training content for reskilling. This aligns perfectly with our vision of evolving from a traditional insurance provider to the broader concept of an ' insurance-related service provider. '\n\nShiraishi: I think we will likely see the development of new insurance products. When I recently revisited our original business plan from the early days of Benefit One, I noticed that the integration of comprehensive services with the financial businesses was a theme right from the outset. Throughout a person ' s life, various products and financial services are closely connected. When buying a home, for example, things like mortgage, savings, and fire insurance all come into play, don ' t they? There are undoubtedly many unmet insurance and financial needs related to various life events. I believe we will witness the development of products that seamlessly integrate services such as insurance, savings, and loans into comprehensive solutions.\n\nKai: You ' re right. I also believe we can collaborate effectively in areas such as health management and healthcare. Consider QOLism, a health promotion app provided by the Dai-ichi Life Group for members of health insurance associations and other organizations. By incorporating QOLism into Benefit Station ' s employee benefit menu, we can anticipate that various benefits, such as enhanced financial stability of health insurance associations, can be expected.\n\nFrom the perspective of the corporate function, I also believe there are numerous opportunities for collaboration\n\nin such areas as IT and human resources. In our efforts to enhance the convenience of Benefit Station, for example, we can contribute by further improving the user interface and experience.\n\nShiraishi: About healthcare, Benefit One aims to advance the visualization of both financial and healthcare data. From a consumer perspective, these two areas have many ambiguous aspects. Although our relationship did not extend to a capital alliance, we share a common vision with M3, Inc., in aiming to provide appropriate medical care through service visualization. By collaborating with M3, which has strong connections with doctors and medical institutions, and leveraging our coverage of the consumer side, we can contribute to solve one of Japan ' s major social issues \u0336 reducing healthcare costs.\n\nIn Japan, government policies are increasingly encouraging companies to manage employee health, such as passing legislation related to metabolic syndrome and emphasizing mandatory stress checks and online counseling. The visualization of healthcare is therefore a highly important theme that also aligns well with life insurance. As healthcare is the fastest-growing component of personal consumption in an aging society, we intend to work exhaustively in this area.\n\nKai: We hope to continue exploring areas of collaboration with M3.\n\n## Medium- to long-term vision: Global expansion\n\nShiraishi: I believe that Benefit One is still in its early stages of global expansion. Despite the challenges posed by a shortage of local talent and networks, we ' ve been making steady progress through trial and error. In Asia, we ' re finally close to turning a profit, but we continue to face difficulties in North America. To overcome this situation, we plan to accelerate our global expansion, seizing the opportunity presented by joining the Dai-ichi Life Group.\n\nOur approach is to first achieve success within Japan, then replicate that success in other countries. Although we are proud of our strong position in Japan, we recognize that an increasing number of companies worldwide are operating similar business models. This underscores the need to achieve success on a global scale, beyond just Japan. Asia holds great potential, but we are also eager to achieve results in North America. We expect that leveraging the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s global network and organizational strength will accelerate our international expansion.\n\nKai: The Dai-ichi Life Group has operations in 10 countries, primarily in Asia and in North America. We recently held a meeting with the CEOs from 10 countries, and you gave a presentation. In addition to speaking",

The Customer Experience Unit was newly established in FY2024 to enhance the customer experience (CX)  of products, services, and customer service in Japan.\n\nIn our domestic business, we will contribute to the wellbeing of our customers by providing our four experiential values of ' Protection, ' ' Asset Formation/Succession, ' ' Health and Medical Care, ' and ' Enhancing Connections ' to our customers. The Group has expanded its business domains with the addition of ipet Insurance, a pet insurance company, and Benefit One, a platform for employee benefit services. Through the provision of optimum products and services, including in non-insurance areas, we will work to create values unique to the Group.\n\nMoreover, various digital tools utilizing the latest technologies have become an indispensable part of our lives. In addition to real contact with customers through sales reps and insurance agencies, the Group regards digital contact with customers as an important connection with them. By integrating real and digital connections, we will build a system that provides\n\n## What does ' CX ' refer to?\n\nWe define customer experience (CX) as the psychological and emotional value that customers experience through all points of contact with the Group.\n\nBy focusing on CX and working to improve the customer experiential value, we will create value that exceeds that of the original product or service.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noptimal consulting and customer follow-up services at the optimal time by deepening our understanding of each individual customer.\n\nWe will continue to pursue value that resonates with our customers and meet their diversifying values and needs by making repeated improvements through the STPD cycle*, not only in the traditional areas of protection and asset formation/ succession, but also in all customer experiences, including new products and services, with the aim of being consistently chosen by customers.\n\n*A management approach based on ' See, ' ' Think, ' ' Plan, ' and ' Do. '\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u25a0 Management based on the \u02a0 voices of customers \u02a1\n\nAs customers continue to diversify their values and change their behavior, we believe it is more important than ever to enhance CX by closely aligning ourselves with the values of each customer.\n\nWe intend to improve CX by collecting a wide range of ' voices of customers ' including opinions, requests, complaints, and thanks and implementing improvement initiatives based on the ' voices of customers. '\n\nFor example, Dai-ichi Life has established a system to collect and analyze ' voices of customers ' from across Japan and reflect them in management and is gradually improving the system. Specifically, at ' Voice of Customer ' (VOC) meetings, in addition to the ' voices of customers, ' we utilize and analyze the NPS \u00ae * from customer satisfaction surveys to identify issues by checking what is supported by customers and what needs improvement.\n\n## Management based on the ' voices of customers ' at Dai-ichi Life\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also receive feedback from consumers through the ' Quality Advisory Committee, ' the ' Consumer Monitor System, ' and other initiatives, and work to respond to customers ' requests. In addition, the ' CX Improvement Committee ' follows up on our initiatives and shares the results with management. Through these initiatives, we are repeatedly improving our points of contact with customers as well as our products and services, leading to further CX improvement.\n\nBy realizing and establishing a culture of sincerely respecting the ' voices of customers ' in conducting business operations, we will not only provide value for our products and services but also deliver the psychological satisfaction that customers gain = ' emotional value. ' We aim to achieve ' Top-level NPS \u00ae in Japan ' and ' 15mn customers in Japan ' by FY2026 with increasingly diverse values and addressing the needs of customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u25a0 Expand and raise the level of digital contacts\n\nTo improve CX, we are working to expand digital contacts and raise the level of the customer experience through digital technologies.\n\nDai-ichi Life operates a website called ' Mirashiru ' to provide information related to people and their lives, health, money, and insurance. The site focuses on the four experiential values and daily communication with customers. The function was expanded to meet various customer needs including insurance counseling through the connection of customers and sales reps in Dai-ichi Life.\n\nIn addition, we provide dedicated My Page functions that serve as a direct point of contact with customers of Dai-ichi Frontier Life, Neo First Life, ipet Insurance, and other companies. Expanding that support by enabling various procedures to be completed digitally helps improve customer convenience. We also provide various services and applications related to health promotion and asset formation to help customers achieve well-being.\n\nWhile working to expand and upgrade the level of digital contacts, we will work to improve CX for customers by promoting the integration of real and digital contacts.\n\n## Information site ' Mirashiru '\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability &",

This section features a special dialogue between Peter David Pedersen, an external expert who was involved in the formulation of our Core Materiality, and Hidehiko Sogano, our CSuO (Chief Sustainability Officer).\n\n## Sustainability at the Dai-ichi Life Group\n\nSogano: When considering sustainability, what is important is the sustainability of the Dai-ichi Life Group itself. ' If we keep the same insurance business as we do now, this company may be gone in 100 years. ' With this healthy sense of crisis in mind, we are promoting transformation in many business divisions. Recent developments such as the participation of Benefit One in the Group and company-wide promotion of digital transformation (DX) are all linked to these perspectives for sustainability management.\n\nIn this context, the role of the Sustainability Unit is crucial. As a company, we cannot escape from pursuing profits based on short-term financial indicators. But at the same time, we need to enhance long-term corporate value, and to do so we must consider what is essential for people to live in a humane way. From this perspective, elements such as the environment, diversity, and human rights naturally come to the forefront, in my opinion.\n\nPedersen: The Dai-ichi Life Group is fundamentally a life insurance company. Life insurance is a product that involves long-term relationships with customers, so maintaining close connections with people is crucial.\n\nAlthough I ' m only in my second year of involvement with the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s sustainability efforts, I believe that the Group is currently in a transitional phase where sustainability and business strategy are becoming truly integrated. In addition to considering how the Group can be a lifetime partner of its customers, I see that now we are already in an era where we need to think about protecting the environment, and what kind of services we can provide to vulnerable people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hidehiko Sogano CSuO\n\nStrategy &\n\n## Roles of the CSuO and the Sustainability Unit\n\nSogano: Sustainability is a broad concept, and as you mentioned the key lies in how we integrate sustainability into our business strategy. My role is to share this perspective with management and at the Board level. In management discussions, we tend to focus on financial indicators, but I feel that it is necessary to gather information on how the world is moving, what is required from us by the world, and to communicate and share that information within the Group.\n\nThe Group Sustainability Committee (Sustainability Committee) is a forum for open exchange of ideas among CxOs including CEO Mr. Kikuta, Group Heads of the holding company, presidents of major domestic Group companies, and executives from relevant departments along with external experts like yourself. To encourage candid discussions, we minimize briefings by the secretariat at committee meetings. We also widely open the meetings to the Group so that employees who are not the members of the Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBusiness\n\nCommittee can become aware of it.\n\nPedersen: Let me share my thoughts from attending Sustainability Committee meetings. I believe that, first and foremost, it is crucial for the leaders of each business and corporate department to have a strong awareness of the strategic significance of promoting sustainability. In this regard, I ' ve noticed significant progress over the past year or two. Many leaders have begun to speak about sustainability as a personal commitment.\n\nLife insurance companies don ' t operate factories that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases like, say, automakers. This can make it somewhat difficult to know what to do about sustainability. Therefore, we need to approach sustainability in a proactive and creative manner, exploring new angles to drive our initiatives forward. From that perspective, it is encouraging to see that many leaders are beginning to proactively think and speak about sustainability and take actions accordingly.\n\n## Formulation of Core Materiality\n\nSogano: In the process of developing our new mid-term management plan, announced in April 2024, we also formulated our list of Core Materiality. Mr. Pedersen, you actively participated in these discussions as well.\n\nPedersen: While the Group had previously established a set of materiality, this time we engaged in extensive discussions to identify Core Materiality that more closely reflects the Group ' s strategies and intentions.\n\nMr. Kikuta has set a goal of becoming a ' global toptier insurance group ' as the vision for FY2030. During our discussions on Core Materiality, therefore, we placed emphasis on ensuring that the expressions we use resonate globally. The Group ' s four new Core Materiality are primarily presented in English, with Japanese explanations provided beneath them. This approach signifies the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s genuine commitment to becoming a global top-tier insurance group.\n\nSogano: Our biggest challenge was distinguishing ourselves, because many other companies are also formulating their own Materiality. We needed to create something that not only stands up globally but also reflects the unique character of the Group, conveying a sense of human connection.\n\nThe first Core Materiality, ' Financial Well-being for All, ' signifies our commitment to supporting everyone ' s happiness, starting with providing financial support. Traditionally, we have provided this ' Financial Well-being ' through conventional life insurance products. Moving forward, we aim to deliver this through a broader range of services, including those outside insurance services. As people ' s lifestyles and values become more diverse, our commitment to expanding our services reflects our desire to financially support the lives of all people. This intention is encapsulated in the words ' for All. '\n\nExternal expert of the Group Sustainability Committee\n\n## Peter David Pedersen",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe second one, ' Healthy People and Society, ' emphasizes that true happiness requires both physical and mental well-being. Here, it is essential to not only pursue individual happiness but also contribute positively to the society in which each person is a part. Accordingly, we established the Core Materiality that also includes the perspective of connecting individuals and society.\n\nAs our business activities expand, environmental issues that impact the entire planet become increasingly important. The key here is ' Environmental Leadership, ' our third Core Materiality. We must go beyond simple environmental awareness. Given the Group ' s scale, we must provide leadership to other financial institutions and be at the forefront in engaging with investees on addressing environmental issues. That ' s why we included the word ' Leadership. '\n\nThe fourth Core Materiality, ' Proactive Governance and Engagement, ' is an essential foundation for achieving the other three issues. It emphasizes the need to build a solid base for sustainable management through strong corporate governance, group governance, and HR strategies. Building connections with all stakeholders is also another important element within this issue.\n\nPedersen: In our discussions on Core Materiality, I focused on proposing language that would capture the unique character of the Dai-ichi Life Group and leave a strong and lasting impression.\n\nAs time goes on, the Group will likely see a turnover of people. I hope that new members will understand the intent behind the Core Materiality and view them as crucial guiding principles for leading the Group forward. Once everyone genuinely embraces its Core Materiality and regards them as ' cool, ' it will inspire leaders to put them into practice.\n\nSogano: Whether the content resonates with what Mr. Kikuta wants to convey is crucial to the success of our sustainability initiatives, so we were conscious of including this perspective. What is important is how we act voluntarily, not the ' feeling of being forced to do something ' under regulations.\n\n## Environmental initiatives: TNFD and GFANZ\n\nSogano: As you mentioned, as a significant portion of the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s business is life insurance, the impact of\n\nour sustainability initiatives might not be directly apparent, making them difficult to understand. On the environment, for example, our own GHG emissions account for only 3% of the Group ' s total emissions. The remaining 97% comes from the GHG emitted by companies in which we invest using insurance premiums we receive from our customers.\n\nTherefore, we need to collaborate with each of our investees, engaging in dialogue to consider ways to reduce emissions. In this process, we also seek insights from external experts like you, ensuring that we stay informed on current trends while developing our plans.\n\nIn addition, in FY2024, the Group registered as an Early Adopter* 1 of the recommendations by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). Under the TNFD, location plays a crucial role, requiring us to investigate the specific characteristics of each business location and analyze the impacts on ecosystems, water quality, air quality, and other environmental factors. When considering the environment, we cannot ignore ecosystems, so we must address the recommendations of the TNFD and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) together under a comprehensive approach.\n\nHowever, how to deal with the TNFD recommendations has not yet been firmly established, globally. For this reason, we aim to take the lead by starting early and setting examples for other companies to follow. This is also the rationale for our registration as an Early Adopter.\n\nPedersen: Over the past three to four years, the actions we need to take on the environment have become much clearer. The three concepts of net zero (NZ)* 2 , circular economy (CE)* 3 , and nature positive (NP)* 4 are all essential elements in building a sustainable society.\n\nThe NZ concept, which involves improving energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy, is relatively easy to understand and quantify. On the other hand, CE and NP are more complex and challenging issues, but addressing them is crucial for the survival of humanity on this planet.\n\nIn particular, the TNFD recommendations, which focus on achieving NP, present challenges to implement, but no matter how much NZ is achieved, it is meaningless if nature has been destroyed. While we have a fiduciary responsibility in terms of financial investments, we now also bear a responsibility related to sustainability. How the Dai-ichi Life Group engages in investing and lending within the framework of NZ, CE, and NP will play a key role in shaping the future standard.\n\nSogano: In terms of shaping the standard, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) is also an important initiative. GFANZ, an initiative that began at COP26 (the 26th UN Climate Change conference ) in Glasgow, has its AsiaPacific regional headquarters in Singapore. In June 2023, it established the world ' s first national chapter, the Japan Chapter. A total of 24 Japanese companies are participating in this chapter, including Dai-ichi Life, megabanks, regional banks, asset management firms, and life and non-life insurance companies. In addition, the GFANZ Japan Chapter provides a platform for discussion among stakeholders such as financial institutions including regional banks and public-sector lending institutions, government agencies (the Financial Services Agency, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of the Environment) to build mutual understanding of the current perspectives of financial institutions. Japan does not have a well-established system for private-sector advocacy toward the government, so such platforms are particularly\n\nStrategy &\n\nimportant. Participation in the Japan Chapter enables public and private institutions to come together and engage in unified discussions, which I believe is important.\n\nPedersen: GFANZ has commitments from financial institutions worldwide, with Japan playing a central role. For the Daiichi Life Group, which aims to be a global top-tier insurance group, it is crucial to demonstrate leadership and enhance its presence within this organization.\n\n## Publication of the Human Rights Report\n\nSogano: We were talking earlier about the importance of people. During our recent review of the Group Principles, we also reassessed our Values (values that we uphold) and placed ' We care (for our customers, business partners, employees, and the communities and environment in which we operate) ' at the top of our priorities. Human rights are a fundamental consideration when it comes to people, impacting not only our employees but also our customers, business partners, and the entire supply chain. In Japan, human rights due diligence is still in its early stages. To promote proper due diligence and increase awareness of its significance, we published the ' Daiichi Life Group Human Rights Report 2024. '\n\nPedersen: At the core of this initiative is the belief that respect and care are essential when interacting with various stakeholders throughout the value chain, from upstream suppliers to customers, including socially vulnerable groups in the countries where the Group operates. In the journey to achieve it, human rights are just the first step, not the ultimate goal. Having said so, a strong foundation of human rights recognition is still crucial for effective sustainability management, making your commitment to human rights vital. I ' m encouraged by the progress you are making, including the publication of the Human Rights Report.\n\nFrom a pragmatic perspective, publishing an advanced report like the Human Rights Report also benefits you by positively influencing assessments from shareholders and external evaluation agencies. Sustainability management requires both idealism and realism. Focusing solely on idealism can lead to inefficiency, while adhering only to realism can cause people to derail from their guiding light. Therefore, it is important to drive activities with realism while pursuing our ideal goals.\n\n## Challenges in promoting sustainability at the Dai-ichi Life Group\n\nSogano: I believe there are three main challenges. First is the issue of communication. Those in sales are likely aware of sustainability through their daily interactions with customers, and top management ' s awareness of sustainability is also high. However, awareness among our middle-level management seems to be lacking.\n\nSecond, all sustainability initiatives need to be disclosed in accordance with global standards. As the Daiichi Life Group strives to become a global top-tier insurance company, it is essential for all Group companies to act with a unified perspective. To accomplish this, we need to enhance communication with both domestic and international subsidiaries, ensuring that all parties are aligned.\n\nThe third challenge is how to measure and communicate the progress of non-financial value, such as human value and\n\nBusiness\n\nenvironmental value. Human value means values created by people, who are not just a component of capital but are themselves  the core of a company. By enhancing people ' s creativity and embracing an output-oriented mindset, the human value increases overall productivity and corporate value. Sustainability-related initiatives are challenging to quantify, making it difficult to communicate them in an easy-tounderstand manner. To address this issue, we plan to cooperate with external research institutions and seek solutions within a two- to three-year time frame. Once this challenge is resolved, the other two challenges will become easier to communicate, leading to a better overall understanding. It also relates to how we address Core Materiality through our business activities and how we link that to corporate value. I am sure that non-financial initiatives are linked to finance, but how can we explain that to the capital markets and others in an easy-to-understand way? Actually, that is my biggest concern right now.\n\nPedersen: It might take until FY2026, the final year of your new mid-term management plan, to fully integrate the financial and non-financial aspects. Once you have achieved this, the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s business will become much more exciting as the Group heads toward FY2030.\n\nI agree with Mr. Kikuta ' s views on human capital. While financial performance is a matter of course in a sense, a company should also be able to invigorate both its employees and customers.\n\nI don ' t really like the idea of financial and non-financial dichotomy. What matters most, in my view, is working toward a larger goal that unifies the two. I believe the Group ' s goal should be to become a company with a higher overall value by integrating financial value, human value, and, of course, environmental value, thereby earning the support of stakeholders.\n\nSogano: I look forward to your continued support for the Daiichi Life Group as we pursue our vision.\n\n- *1  Early adopters of disclosure recommendations published by the TNFD in September 2023\n- *2  Achieving net zero by subtracting the amount of GHG captured/absorbed from the amount emitted\n- *3  An economy that maximizes added value through the efficient and circular use of resources at all stages (circular economy)\n- *4  Preventing and reversing the loss of biodiversity and putting nature back on a path to recovery\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Climate Change and Natural Capital Initiatives\n\n- - Disclosures Based on the TCFD and TNFD Recommendations -\n\n## \u25a0 Introduction and background\n\nIt is estimated that more than half of the world ' s GDP is derived from nature and ecosystems, and natural capital is an important foundation for the Group ' s business activities. The two are also said to be closely related, as heavy rains, floods, and droughts caused by climate change can lead to the degradation of natural capital.\n\nBased on this recognition, the Group, as a member of society, considers that the conservation of the local environment, climate change countermeasures, global environmental protection, the preservation of natural capital and biodiversity, and the creation of a recycling-oriented society are among its corporate social responsibilities. The Group will always act in consideration of its impact on the environment, in compliance with the Group ' s ' Vision and Group Action Principles for Environmental Initiatives* 1 , ' and in keeping with the ' Basic Policy on Responsible Investment* 1 ' of our domestic core subsidiary, Dai-ichi Life.\n\nIn the new mid-term management plan, we  have defined ' Core Materiality ' as important issues that we must prioritize in order to realize our Group ' s vision for FY2030. We have also defined ' Environmental Leadership ' as an issue that we must address to\n\nensure the sustainability of the global environment, which is the foundation of people ' s lives. Under this Core Materiality, the Group, as an operational company and as an institutional investor, is committed to strategic responses to environmental challenges, particularly climate change and natural capital, with the goal of contributing to the realization of a decarbonized society. We will also actively communicate our views and become more involved in and contribute to global rulemaking through active participation in domestic and international initiatives such as GFANZ* 2 , the world ' s largest coalition of financial institutions with a net-zero commitment.\n\nTo realize the aspirations* 3 embedded in the Group Purpose, we will demonstrate leadership both as an institutional investor and a operational company to an even greater degree. This includes enhancing measures that could become examples to others, such as improving sustainability disclosures. Through these efforts, building public trust, and creating customers ' empathy, we aim to help form a sustainable society and ultimately accelerate the sustainable growth of our business.\n\n## \u25a0 Governance\n\n## Roles of the Executive Management Board and the Board of Directors\n\nUnder the supervision of the Board of Directors and in accordance with its business plan on climate change led by the Executive Management Board, the Group is promoting initiatives related to climate change and natural capital through the Group Sustainability Committee, the Group ERM Committee, and other committees. The status of initiatives (e.g.,\n\nGroup goals, direction of initiatives, risk responses) is regularly reported to the Executive Management Board and the Board of Directors. By ensuring oversight from the Board of Directors, we have a framework that further strengthens efforts to address climate change and natural capital issues.\n\n## Initiatives to strengthen our governance structure\n\nAs one of the measures to strengthen the Group ' s governance structure, the Group Sustainability Committee was established in April 2021, and since April 2023 the Committee has been chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer. Under this structure, the Committee is responsible for developing sustainability-related policies and strategies, including measures to address climate change and natural capital, and monitoring the implementation of these measures. In addition, starting in July 2022,  sustainability\n\nindicators* 4 , including an indicator related to progress in reducing CO2 emissions, have been included as part of performance-based stock remuneration for the Company ' s executives. In April 2024, we reorganized the Sustainability Office into the Sustainability Unit. We beefed up the workforce by coordinating the sustainability policies and activities of the entire Group, thereby reinforcing our contributions to a decarbonized society and nature-positive activities.\n\n- *3  The Group Purpose: ' Partnering with you to build a brighter and more secure future. '\n\n- *6  Degree of impact is assessed based on economic loss, reputational damage (impact on sales, management responsibility, and stock price), and other factors.\n\n## \u25a0 Risk management\n\n## Risk management system\n\nThe Group is implementing risk management that takes appropriate measures at an early stage by specifying foreseeable risks with the potential to significantly impact its business as ' material risks ' and formulating business plans that take these risks into account* 5 .\n\nWe rate the impact* 6 of the risks and the possibility of their occurrence on a scale of one to four based on the results from identifying material risks affecting Group companies. Using a heat map, the Risk Management Unit specifies material risks and reviews them every fiscal year. With the Paris Agreement taking effect in 2016, there is a growing recognition that environmental\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\nissues, particularly climate change, are a challenge to be tackled by the international community as a whole, and the Group recognizes that addressing climate change is an important management issue that could have a significant impact on customers ' lives and health, corporate activities, and social sustainability. In response to this, since fiscal 2019 we have selected climate change-related risks as one of our material risks and have been strengthening our risk management. Specifically, the Group ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, discusses how to assess and respond to physical and transition risks, and reports to the Executive Management Board and the Board of Directors as necessary.\n\n## Governance/Risk management framework for addressing climate change and natural capital (as of April 2024)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u25a0 Strategy/Metrics and targets - Climate Change Initiatives -\n\n## Net Zero Transition Plan\n\nAs a financial institution, we produced and disclosed our Net Zero Transition Plan in August 2023 to promote a more integrated response to climate change issues aimed at transitioning to net zero in the real economy. This plan was formulated in reference to the transition plan guidance of GFANZ, etc.\n\nThe current transition plan is formulated mainly focusing on the activities of Dai-ichi Life, the Group ' s core subsidiary in Japan. It is overseen by the CSuO and administered by the Sustainability Unit, with relevant departments of Dai-ichi Life in charge of promoting their respective initiatives. Its implementation progress is monitored and discussed by the Group Sustainability Committee, which reports its findings to the Executive Management Board and is supervised by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn March 2024, we set new interim reduction targets for GHG emissions, aiming to reduce Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 75% by FY2030 (compared with FY2019 levels), and a common target for\n\nDai-ichi Life and Dai-ichi Frontier Life to reduce Scope 3 (investments) emissions by 50% by 2030 (compared with 2020 levels). As of the recent time period, Scope 1 & 2 emissions have been reduced by 62% (compared with FY2019), and Scope 3 (investments) emissions have been reduced by 31% (compared with 2020, on an absolute emissions basis) and 34% (compared with 2020 on an intensity basis) at Dai-ichi Life and Dai-ichi Frontier Life, respectively, demonstrating steady progress toward our goals.

Based on the TCFD recommendations, the Group recognizes climate change risks by classifying them into physical risks* 16 and transition risks* 17 and sorting them out by risk category. The Group assumes the examples shown in the table on the right as climate change risks that could materialize over a time frame of about three years in the short term and more than 10 years in the long term, and conducts scenario analyses for underwriting risks and market/credit risks.\n\nAs part of our efforts to understand risks related to claims and benefit payments, we have been analyzing the relationship between temperature and Dai-ichi Life ' s claims and benefits since FY2020, in cooperation with Mizuho-DL Financial Technology Co., Ltd. Please refer to the Sustainability Report published in the autumn of 2024 for details.\n\nIn addition, we use MSCI ' s CVaR methodology for analyzing those market and credit risks that constitute physical and transition risks for invested assets. The aggregated CVaR was (13.8%) for the NDCs scenario* 18 with the highest physical risk and (18.8%) for the Net Zero 2050 scenario with the highest transition risk. In comparison to the benchmark, superior results were shown in the Net Zero 2050 scenario in terms of both transition and physical risks. In addition, the implied temperature rise (ITR)* 19 of the Group ' s portfolio was 2.3 \u009b C.\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n| Risk categories     | Examples of major physical and transition risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Underwriting  risk  | [Physica l  risk]  Risk of an increase in insurance claims and benefits  paid due to an increase in mortality, etc., caused by the spread of heat  stroke and infectious diseases resulting from rising temperatures                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Market/credit  risk | [Physica l  risk]  Risk of deterioration in the financial condition of  a credit recipient due to damage to business facilities caused  by extreme weather or disruption of supply chains in the  manufacturing industry [Transition risk]  Risk that the prices of assets held will decline  as businesses are affected by decarbonization and as society  increasingly chooses to invest in decarbonization |\n| Liquidity risk      | [Physica l  risk]  Risk of increased insurance payouts due to extreme  weather conditions and risk of inability to conduct sufficient market  transactions due to market disruptions caused by natural disasters                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Operational  risk   | [Physica l  risk]  Risk of damage to data centers, business offices,  and other locations necessary for operations due to extreme  weather conditions, resulting in the suspension of operations [Transition risk]  Risk of financial losses due to fines, lawsuits, etc.,  stemming from inadequate measures to address climate change                                                                       |\n| Reputational  risk  | [Transition risk]  Risk that our business will be negatively impacted  by being evaluated as inappropriate by stakeholders (due to our  inadequate climate change initiatives), continued relationships with  business partners that are insufficiently environmentally conscious,  or other factors.                                                                                                         |\n\n## CVaR (impact/amount of subject assets)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSubject assets are Dai-ichi Life's equities and corporate bonds and Dai-ichi Frontier Life's corporate bonds, totaling approximately \u00a510 trillion.

Analysis of nature-related dependencies and impacts, and assessment of nature-related risks <Evaluate, Assess>\n\nWe analyzed the dependence on and impact of nature on the operations and processes taking place in the six sites in priority areas identified in the Locate phase (Figure 2). The analysis showed that in the six identified locations, there is a significant dependence on ecosystem services such as climate control, surface water, and water quantity maintenance, which impact nature through terrestrial ecosystem use, water use, and freshwater ecosystem use. Analysis of risks related to natural capital based on address information and business/processes\n\nshowed that, overall, reputational risks related to biodiversity and water tended to be high (Figure 2). We understand that this indicates that there is a high risk that the our business activities could adversely affect the lives of local residents, thereby negatively impacting our reputation. In terms of physical risks, the risk of natural disasters such as flooding and degradation of ecosystem services was assessed as high, reaffirming the importance of promoting appropriate management

industry association for the natural capital sector, and others. The current version as of June 2024 was used.\n- *34  The top three risks identified by the WWF risk filter are listed in descending order of risk. Of the risk items, indicates WWF risk filter (Biodiversity) and indicates WWF risk filter (Water).\n\nIn this analysis, we attempted to analyze nature-related risks from a geographical perspective, using not only the business activities of the companies but also the address information of their business locations. We believe that based on the knowledge gained from this analysis, we will help improve the quality of our\n\nengagement with investees and lead to a more resilient portfolio of investments in the future. We will continue to contribute to nature positivity by utilizing these kinds of nature-related risks analysis in our engagement and analysis of our investments.\n\n## TOPICS\n\n## Joint research with Mizuho-DL Financial Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nTo more precisely understand the risks of portfolio companies related to natural capital, we conducted an additional analysis on a trial basis, utilizing Sustainability Scores* 35 , which were developed independently by Mizuho-DL Financial Technology, based on disclosed information of the companies.\n\nFirst, among the domestic stock portfolio of Dai-ichi Life, ca. 200 companies in the three sectors of consumer staples, materials, and utilities, which were identified as high risk in our previous year ' s analysis, were targeted. ENCORE* 36 was then used to calculate risk scores by sub-industry for each factor (impact driver) of corporate activities affecting nature. Each risk score was supplemented by factor-specific Sustainability Score, which evaluate the sustainability efforts of each company, to refine the risk scores for each individual company (Figure 3). The analysis showed that while more than half of the companies were rated as ' Very Low ' or ' Low ' risk, some remained at high risk and required caution. In addition, the risk was particularly high for factors (impact drivers) such as water use, GHG emissions, and solid waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this analysis, we attempted to evaluate risks based not only on the nature of a company ' s business but also on the status of each company ' s sustainability initiatives. We will continue to conduct this kind of trial analysis in the future as we work to identify natural capital-related risks and opportunities more precisely.\n\n- *35  The scores were developed with the aim of identifying risks and opportunities for companies from a sustainability perspective. They are compiled based on various sustainability themes, which can be linked to impact drivers in ENCORE to enable a company-specific risk analysis of the portfolio.\n- *36  The current version as of April 2024 was used.",

Starting this fiscal year, Dai-ichi Life Holdings created the position of CHRO to improve employee satisfaction and create opportunities for diverse human resources to unleash their potential, while consolidating the previously dispersed planning functions for personnel and compensation systems, recruitment, and other aspects under the holding company, Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe biggest objective of the HR Strategy is to promote initiatives throughout the human resources life cycle, including recruitment, talent development, compensation, and benefits. The strategy also seeks to expand and enhance opportunities for employees to succeed through the promotion of DE&I (diversity, equity, and inclusion), to foster an organizational culture that includes health and productivity management, and to drive measures related to employee well-being. We believe that this approach will contribute to realizing the Group ' s management and business strategies.\n\nIn March 2024, we launched our new mid-term management plan, and in line with this plan, we also renewed our Group HR Strategy. First, we defined the key message that forms the backbone of the Human Resources Strategy: ' Empowering diverse human resources to maximize their potential, driving challenges and transformation. ' To become a global top-tier insurance group and a leader of the Japanese insurance industry future which is our vision for FY2030, each and every employee of the Group must take on daily challenges and maximize their capacity to transform both themselves and the organization. We have incorporated this strong sentiment into our key message and have made it the cornerstone of our HR Strategy. Based on this key message, the Group HR Strategy will develop measures based on five pillars.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup HR governance will look at the Group as a whole and allocate human resources where they are needed to further business strategies, as well as review the succession plans of each Group company from the perspective of stable business continuity.\n\nIn terms of opportunities for success, we aim to create an organization with the strength and flexibility to realize sustainable enhancement of corporate value by encouraging motivated employees to take on challenges autonomously, and by proactively providing opportunities for them to succeed.\n\nIn the areas of talent acquisition and development, to support extending our business domains, including entry into non-insurance areas and overseas business expansion, we will strategically develop new graduate recruitment, mid-career hiring, and in-house appointments, as well as implement a wide range of training measures to enhance the expertise of our employees, the source of our corporate value creation.\n\nIn our personnel and compensation systems, we aim to elicit a sense of growth and fulfillment from employees through fair evaluation and performance-based compensation. We strive so that employees can directly experience the impact that their daily efforts have on corporate value.\n\nStrategy &\n\nFinally, corporate culture and well-being are important foundations of the Group ' s HR Strategy. The Group will further promote diverse work styles along with health and productivity management to create an open and dynamic corporate culture in which all organizations are full of diversity, and where all employees can flourish with vitality and peace of mind.\n\n## Our commitment to employees\n\nIn a complex and changing business environment, human resources are the driving force to execute management strategies and realize our purpose. The Dai-ichi Life Group has been committed to the brand message of ' By your side, for life ' for more than 100 years, and this sentiment is expressed in our Employee Philosophy Statement, and shared with Group companies around the world. To realize a world in which all employees can thrive and demonstrate their individuality, and to further enhance our corporate value, we are working to develop human resources, strategically assign human resources, and foster a corporate culture in which diverse human resources can maximize their potential.\n\nBusiness\n\nIn this rapidly changing environment, the driving force for the Group ' s growth is our human resources, and we will implement the HR Strategy based on the belief that the diversity and expertise of each and every employee is our most important management resource. In addition, through individual measures based on the five pillars, we will maximize the potential of the Group ' s HR, leverage diversity as a strength, and strive to achieve the sustainable enhancement of corporate value.\n\n## The Dai-ichi Life Group Employee Philosophy Statement\n\nGrowth is not a solo endeavor. As over 100 years of experience has taught us, growth comes from belonging to something bigger than ourselves. At Dai-ichi Life Group, we are by your side, growing with you. Challenging you. Supporting you to prosper. Protecting the well-being of all, now and for the future. Wherever you are with us, and wherever you go in our group, we work together to open up a world of opportunities.\n\n## Status of human capital enhancement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Five pillars of  HR strategy                                               | Progress index* 5   | April 2022     | April 2023     | April 2024   | Target (April 2025)           | Connection to corporate value creation   | Connection to corporate value creation   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Human capital shift  (including natural attrition)                         | 682ppl              | 1,211ppl       | 2,016ppl       | ca.2,600ppl  |                               |                                          | Group HR  governance                     |\n| Number of core DX talent* 1                                                | 100ppl              | 254ppl         | 353ppl         | 850ppl       |                               |                                          | Talent acquisition and development       |\n| Number of candidates for future global management leaders                  | 241ppl              | 286ppl         | 314ppl         |              | Implement business strategies | that is continuously chosen by           | Personnel and compensation systems       |\n| Number of global job-posting positions (cumulative) Percentage of          | 8                   | 13             | 26             | 40           | Implement business strategies | that is continuously chosen by           | Personnel and compensation systems       |\n| My Career program applicants                                               | 302ppl              | 371ppl         | 411ppl         |              | Implement business strategies | that is continuously chosen by           | Personnel and compensation systems       |\n| female executives* 2                                                       | 12.1%               | 13.4%          | 13.7%          | 30% (2030)   | Implement business strategies | that is continuously chosen by           | Personnel and compensation systems       |\n| Percentage of female organizational heads* 3                               | 16.5%               | 18.5%          | 19.1%          | 30% (2030)   | Implement business strategies | that is continuously chosen by           | Personnel and compensation systems       |\n| Uptake rate/number of days of  childcare leave taken  by male employees* 4 | 92.3% 11.8 days     | 100% 21.5 days | 100% 23.1 days | 100% 1 month | Implement business strategies | that is continuously chosen by           | Corporate culture  and well-being        |\n| Percentage completing secondary medical exams                              | 85.7%               | 87.6%          | 87.6%          | 100 \uff05       | Implement business strategies | that is continuously chosen by           | Corporate culture  and well-being        |\n\n- *4  The total for Dai-ichi Life Holdings, its three domestic life insurance companies, and ipet Insurance.

By strengthening the Group ' s governance through optimal allocation of human capital and acquiring new perspectives, the HR Strategy is closely linked to each business strategy even in a rapidly changing business environment, and we are developing various measures to maximize the potential of our human resources.\n\n## Appointment of external human resources as executive officers\n\nSince 2007, the Group has made a full-scale entry into the overseas life insurance business, and has continuously challenged and transformed itself in response to changes in the business environment, including demutualization and listing in 2010, and the transition to a holding company structure in 2016. In recent years, the environment surrounding the Group has been changing even more quickly with the rapid evolution of digital technology and generative AI, the emergence of geopolitical risks in various parts of the world, and increasing uncertainty in macroeconomic and financial markets. In such a business environment, it is essential to utilize human resources who can contribute to value creation beyond the boundaries of gender, age, nationality, and so on, so\n\nFigen Ulgen Chief Data and AI Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStephen Barnham Chief Information Officer and Chief Digital Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWebster Coates Chief Compliance Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKyoko Wada Chief Communications Officer\n\n## Governance for overseas Group companies\n\nThe Group has established compensation guidelines for the CEOs of overseas Group companies and ensures fair and competitive compensation based on the Group mid-term management plan, each company ' s business stage, market standards, and other factors. This approach aims to promote value sharing with shareholders and recruit and retain talented CEOs who will drive the Group ' s growth. Operating under these guidelines, we ensure transparency and fairness in compensation levels and decisionmaking processes, while respecting local regulations, market practices, and the authority of the decision-making bodies of Group companies.\n\nFrom the perspective of Group human resource governance, we recognize the critical importance of managing succession plans for the top management at subsidiaries. We assist our overseas Group companies in developing succession plans for key management personnel and centrally manage these plans. Each company identifies candidates at an early stage and trains them to ensure stability and continuity of management. In particular with regard to CEO successors, we are deeply involved in the selection process as the parent company, including interviewing candidates, and work together with subsidiaries to ensure smooth successions.\n\nthat the Group can achieve growth as a global top-tier insurance group by FY2030.\n\nTo build a strong governance structure to support Group management, we are strengthening our efforts to diversify our human resources by appointing outside talent as executive officers. Starting with the appointment of Senior Managing Executive Officer Stephen Barnham as Chief Information Officer and Chief Digital Officer in 2023, we have continued to develop an environment that strengthens governance and drives innovation from a personnel perspective by securing a diverse range of highly specialized human resources, including welcoming a Chief Compliance Officer, a Chief Communications Officer, and in FY2024, a Chief Data and AI Officer.\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n## Strengthening coordination with human resources departments at overseas Group companies\n\nAs a group that operates globally, we have formed task forces and working groups on specific themes with personnel in charge of human resources in each country in order to promote the advancement of Group management from the aspect of human resources. These meeting bodies regularly engage in dialogue on a wide range of topics, such as the development of future management-level personnel and philosophy sharing, with the aim of creating synergies across countries, and have contributed to the growth of the entire Group through the implementation of numerous group-wide measures.\n\nFor example, we provide various measures for the next generation of Group leaders to acquire a global management perspective, and prepare tools for new employees that communicate the Group ' s history, philosophy, and other qualities so that each employee can feel that they are a part of the Group.\n\nIn addition, to instill our philosophy throughout the Group, we have formed a working group on the theme of DE&I in different countries, and plan and operate a DE&I Summit, which will be described later.\n\n## Allocating human resources aligned with business strategy\n\nWe will implement a strategic shift of about 3,400 human resources by FY2026 to realize the business strategies of each Group company and to build a foundation that will enable diverse human resources to realize their full potential. We are committed to promoting the optimal allocation of diverse and specialized human resources across various areas to enhance the business efficiency and profitability of Dai-ichi Life Insurance. This includes rotating personnel into expanding business areas such as digital technology and international operations along with new businesses including ipet and Benefit One, and bringing in human resources from both inside\n\n## Employee voices\n\nBenefit One Sales Promotion Department, Sales Office\n\nAi Yamamoto\n\nAt my current workplace, I am in charge of promoting efforts to create synergies between the Dai-ichi Life Group and Benefit One. Through service proposals for Benefit Station, efforts to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincrease utilization rates among companies and organizations that have already implemented Benefit Station, and the provision of new products and services through the platform, we hope to help solve issues and enhance the value of experiences for companies and organizations. We will boldly take on the challenge of new initiatives as a unified Group, aiming for value propositions that go beyond the insurance domain.\n\nand outside the Group to assume key roles at Dai-ichi Life Holdings, which steers the entire Group.\n\nIn addition, career rotations as a strategic shift of human resources play a part as investments in cross-boundary learning for employees. The skills and experience acquired by employees who have had career rotations will be utilized to realize business strategies and enhance corporate value at Group companies. Furthermore, career rotations contribute to ensuring the sustainability of local communities and society as such staff take part in solving social issues through dispatch to local governments and other organizations.\n\nFukui City Government General Affairs Department, Future Creation Promotion Bureau\n\nMika Tsubota\n\nI applied to this program because I wanted to help women who are trying their best to balance work and family life. Currently, I am in charge of organizing\n\nsocial events for working women, disseminating information about role models on social media, improving the workplace environment including promoting male employee childcare leave and improved engagement, and projects related to career design for students. I feel that my outlook has been greatly broadened by listening to the voices of corporate executives, working women, and students, and by recognizing the need to conduct business while communicating with people outside the government based on multiple perspectives, such as raising awareness, improving the workplace environment, and promoting the sharing of household and childcare responsibilities. I would like to leverage this experience to solve various issues and create an environment where everyone can work in their own way in the future.",

That is why one of the key themes of the Group ' s Human Resources Strategy is providing opportunities for success. The Group is active in a wide range of fields both in Japan and overseas, and actively supports the autonomous efforts of employees who seek to learn and grow through the career rotation system that spans different positions\n\nand countries. We will also continue our efforts to create opportunities for women to succeed, based on the belief that the creation of new corporate value comes from the participation of human resources with diverse values, perspectives, abilities, experience, and expertise in sharing their opinions and taking part in decision-making.\n\n## Global job postings\n\nWe have been running global job postings since 2022 as an open recruitment system to encourage each employee of the Group, both in Japan and overseas, to take advantage of their expertise and experience beyond their current Group company and country, and to obtain opportunities to work globally on their own.\n\n## Feedback from global job postings participants\n\n## From TAL to Dai-ichi Life Holdings\n\nSarah Khoo\n\nI applied for a position in the International Life Insurance Business Unit at Dai-ichi Life Holdings as I was interested in learning more about other life insurance markets and wanted to challenge myself both professionally and personally.

During my time in the UK, learning the innovative ways in which YuLife approaches sales and marketing, among other things, has enriched my professional knowledge. I also acquired invaluable skills in cross-cultural communication, problemsolving, and adaptability, which strengthened my personal growth.

We offer a wide range of roles that enable employees to flourish beyond the traditional scope of insurance at companies both inside and outside the Group. The number of open positions, applicants, and accepted candidates is increasing year by year, and an era where employees can choose their own career paths is increasingly becoming a reality. By having employees take on the challenges of jobs based on their own career visions, we will allow each employee to maximize their skills and potential and ensure that all employees will work together to improve the value of the customer experience and transform and grow the Group as a whole.\n\n## My Career Program\n\n|                                  | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number  of job  postings         | 222    | 301    | 369    |\n| Number of  applicants            | 302ppl | 371ppl | 411ppl |\n| Number of  successful candidates | 93ppl  | 141ppl | 153ppl |\n\n## Development of female leaders and initiatives to achieve our goals\n\nIn Japan, we are working to strengthen our development pipeline and augment our pool of human resources with the goal of increasing the percentage of female executives and organizational heads to 30% by 2030. Along with enhancements to tiered training, when executives select candidates for management posts in the divisions they are in charge of, executives ensure that 30% of the candidates for each post are women. In addition, to create opportunities for the executives themselves to see and develop candidates, they regularly hold 1-for-1 (Dai-ichi Life ' s version of 1 on 1) meetings with candidates from divisions with which they do not normally have contact.\n\nTAL runs Female Sponsorship Programs to develop female leaders at the middle and senior management levels. The program, which incorporates the concept of sponsorship, allows participants to develop strategic thinking and business insight through workshops, project work, and executive coaching sessions over a five-month period while building relationships with sponsoring executives and department heads. It is also an opportunity for sponsors to better understand the potential of their next generation of female employees. Through this program, TAL has been able to produce female leaders.\n\n## Feedback from participants in the program\n\nDai-ichi Life Policy Service Quality Control Division, Policy Service Department\n\n## Mihoshi Kumano\n\nAs most of my experience has been within the same department, I had been feeling a bit of inadequacy due to my lack of experience in other departments and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nareas. However, Ms. Kitahori encouraged me by advising, ' There are seeds of transformation that only someone with your knowledge and understanding can notice, ' and this reminded me of the potential for my own expertise to contribute to the organization. The cross 1-for-1 sessions*, which were opportunities to openly share issues and concerns and receive direct feedback and insights, were a great opportunity to consider the perspective and viewpoints necessary for my own future career.\n\n*1-for-1 session with an executive responsible for another department.\n\n## TAL\n\nHead of AMP Partnerships\n\nWendy Lim\n\nI was fortunate to be selected for this program and had the privilege to interact with ET and Senior Leaders, who are sponsors of the program. I learned the importance of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsponsorship within the business to help shape my career aspirations and build connections. I also had the opportunity to participate in 1-for-1 executive coaching sessions allowing me to explore and reflect on my personal brand. This program really empowers all the women to be better versions of themselves and understand how to own our careers with confidence and clarity. I have recently been promoted to a more senior role within TAL. It was truly a wonderful experience, and I highly recommend the program.\n\nTakako Kitahori\n\nDirector, Managing Executive Officer, Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc. Chief Customer Experience Officer\n\nHaving spent most of her career in the same\n\ndepartment, Ms. Kumano was concerned about the narrow scope of her own experience. However, because she was so familiar with that department, she had deep insight on the issues, and through our dialogue I got a sense for her eagerness to bring about a transformation. Ms. Kumano gave me a lot of inspiration, and hearing her transformation plan filled me with confidence about the future of the Group.\n\nTAL\n\n## Enza D ' Agostino Head of Governance & Risk\n\nMy experience on the Female Sponsorship Program was by far one of the best development programs I have attended at TAL. I have been both a participant and a sponsor in the program;\n\nit's a journey that keeps on going. I have built strong professional and personal connections. Our common bond, founded through the program, allows us to have open and honest conversations when our paths cross on business matters, which leads to a great TAL culture. It's also great to see the support and investment of time from all the sponsors in continuing to make themselves accessible well after the program has ended.",

A lecture and discussion on ' DE&I Promotion and Support for Women ' s Health ' touched on the significance of respecting diversity and the need for equity, as well as understanding and supporting women ' s specific health issues, providing an opportunity for each employee to think about what they can do from their own perspective. In addition, many male employees took part in an event to experience simulated menstrual pain,* allowing them to gain a firsthand appreciation of women ' s health issues. Through these efforts, we are promoting mutual respect and a fair and inclusive culture by spreading understanding of DE&I.\n\n* Experience  using ' Perionoid, ' a VR experience device that simulates menstrual pain produced by Osaka Heat Cool Inc.\n\n## Global DE&I promotion\n\nWe began promoting DE&I throughout the Group in 2022 and held our second online event, the Global DE&I Summit, in 2023. The theme was ' Inclusive Leadership, ' which is essential for promoting collaboration and fostering an inclusive culture. The event provided an opportunity for more than 70 employees from around the world to learn together toward practicing inclusion, and featured panel discussions and group discussions with CEOs from our Group companies in the US, Myanmar, and Japan, as well as outside speakers.\n\nIn November 2023, TAL and domestic Group companies held a discussion event for female executives to share insight about the active participation of women. Despite the differences in the customs and culture of each country and company, there are many commonalities in the working environment and awareness of issues, and the participants learned from each other about how to work, how to create an environment that makes the most of their abilities, and how to support those around them. We also reconfirmed our commitment to each other to create an environment in which human resources with various professional backgrounds and skills can demonstrate their individuality. We will continue to create a corporate culture that leverages diversity through Group-wide efforts to promote understanding and action on DE&I.\n\n## Reference data for expanding the female leadership base\n\nPercentage of female managers* 1\n\n29.6 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n19.1 %\n\n13.7 %\n\n- *1  The total for Dai-ichi Life Holdings, its three domestic life insurance companies, and ipet Insurance\n- *2  The total for Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Dai-ichi Life, Protective Life, TAL, Partners Life, Dai-ichi Life Vietnam, Dai-ichi Life Cambodia, Dai-ichi Life Myanmar, Star Union Dai-ichi Life, and OCEAN LIFE\n\n- *3  The total of line (section) managers and line general managers who head organizations among management positions at the Company and three domestic life insurance companies.\n- *4 The total for the Company and Dai-ichi Life\n\nPercentage of female managers* 2 (global)\n\nPercentage of female organizational heads* 3\n\nPercentage of female executives* 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPurpose\n\n\uff06\n\nValues\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Talent acquisition and talent development\n\n## Securing a competitive advantage by acquiring talent and developing human resources\n\nAs the job market environment intensifies on a global level on a daily basis, the hiring and training of human resources to execute business strategies is the driving force behind our growth.

In addition, to focus on recruiting human resources who will play a central role in driving the Group ' s digital transformation (DX), we have renewed the existing ' IT & Systems ' course as ' IT & Digital. '\n\nAfter joining the Company through this course-specific recruitment, an employee will be assigned to a specific department for a certain period of time to enhance their expertise, and then be rotated based on their own preferences and aptitude. This aims to leverage employees ' specialized skills in various fields to achieve strategic goals. In addition, we are working harder than ever before at mid-career recruitment, and we aim to bring in knowledge from outside the Group and achieve further innovation by diversifying our human resources.\n\n|                                 | FY2021   | FY2022   | FY2023   |\n|---------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Percentage of  mid-career hires | 34%      | 47%      | 42%      |\n\nNote: Mid-career hires as a percentage of core positions filled\n\n## Global human resource development\n\nTo secure human resources who can work globally, we continuously provide opportunities for growth through overseas study and traineeships, and implement initiatives to improve practical global business skills.

These include programs that encourage young employees to take on challenges through in-house recruitment, programs to foster a global mindset for all employees, and programs for mid-level employees to collaborate with non-Japanese employees, mainly through overseas dispatch-type training programs.\n\n## Development of DX-oriented human resources\n\nWe aim to develop human resources who can transform business models and improve business efficiency by utilizing digital technologies to solve the challenges faced by customers and employees.\n\nAs part of our OFF-JT program, we offer basic programs in design thinking, product management, data science, software engineering, UI/UX design, and digital marketing to all employees.

We continue to implement a series of processes for each major position, starting with the identification of candidate talent, followed by assessment through external evaluation, periodic talent reviews throughout the year, and then development and monitoring.\n\n## Domestic talent management\n\n## Global talent management\n\nEach year, the Human Capital Committee reviews and confirms the pool of potential successors for each key position and develops candidates through external assessments, training, and assignment opportunities. We pay particular attention to appointing women and mid-career hires to head our organizations. Here, our aim is to change our organizational culture through decision-making by diverse people. We are also stepping up efforts to swiftly select and train young talent in order to develop and produce next-generation management leaders in a stable and systematic manner.\n\nFor overseas Group companies, we have introduced a common Group-wide framework for talent management. Discovering and fostering the next generation of leaders as a Group, together with overseas Group companies in diverse environments, is growing in importance. To create synergy within the Group, in addition to candidates for management leaders at each company, we are working to identify and develop human resources who can contribute to global business beyond national borders.\n\nBuilding and expanding the talent pool\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS trategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n## Corporate culture and well-being\n\n## Improving well-being and fostering a supportive corporate culture\n\nFostering a free and open organizational culture in which employees around the world respect each other ' s individuality is a prerequisite for implementing the Group ' s Human Resource Strategy. The Group also practices health and productivity management that not only advances the health of employees but also contributes to customers, communities, and society as a whole, aiming to contribute to the well-being of each and every one of us. To realize employee well-being, which is the foundation of our efforts, we promote safety and health initiatives and work daily to create a comfortable workplace environment and culture. In FY2023, we established the DE&I\n\n## Initiatives to improve employee engagement\n\nWe consider a state in which employees are proactively engaged in their work as one of the outcomes of human resource management, and employee engagement is a key indicator of this. We and our three domestic life insurance companies introduced engagement surveys in FY2021 and have been conducting them on an ongoing basis. We have also made active efforts to improve engagement leading to an improvement in the overall score.\n\nImprovements were seen in the overall score and in all nine components, with FY2023 scoring the highest since the survey began. The ' corporate philosophy ' component, which indicates the degree of understanding and extent to which employees identify with the business direction, had been an issue, but the score has steadily improved as a result of continued efforts to deepen understanding and appreciation for management strategies by providing opportunities for dialogue between employees and management, such as by sending out messages from the President and holding town hall meetings. Through these efforts, some employees have commented that they have a better understanding of the management vision and a heightened awareness of the need for change.\n\n## Promoting diverse work styles\n\nStatement to communicate our basic approach to DE&I and our commitment as a Group both internally and externally.

To encourage male employees to proactively participate in childcare and housework, we are implementing initiatives that go beyond the legal requirements, such as holding pre-parent seminars, utilizing written plans for taking childcare leave for supervisors and subordinates, and granting up to 20 days of paid leave. We also hold management-level ' Ikubosu ' seminars and training for all employees regarding support for a work-life balance, and promote the creation of a workplace environment in which everyone can balance work and life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promotion of health and productivity management\n\nWe promote Health and Productivity Management by working to prevent serious illnesses, supporting women ' s health, and implementing measures to help employees balance work and family life through health maintenance and promotion measures based on two pillars: prevention of lifestyle diseases and mental health measures. In addition to continuing efforts aimed at individuals, such as promoting secondary health checkups, we have stepped up organization-level efforts through health events and other activities. The synergistic effects of individual and organizational efforts have also led to a reduction in the number of severe cases of lifestyle diseases and improved engagement. We will continue to support the well-being of our employees, who are tasked with solving the social issue of extending healthy life expectancy and narrowing the gap between the average life expectancy and healthy life expectancy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our IT and Digital strategies enable us to innovate, improve efficiency, and enhance customer experience (CX), while driving long-term growth and sustainability. We set our Vision for FY2030 and launched our mid-term management plan of which technology and digital are key elements. The plan supports our main stakeholders of employees and customers across the world with a focus on investment in new technology driven business models. Here are some examples of this.\n\nIn Japan, through our collaboration with YuLife, a UK Insurtech start-up, we rolled out an initial product to our staff and selected customers, confirming the YuLife product/market fit.\n\nIn Australia, TAL ' s Direct to Consumer products via a modern digital architecture have supported a more personalized and dynamic customer experience. This is a notable example of how we are using digital to improve the customer experience. In the US, Protective Life has created a secure and self-service website called the Velocity Purchase Portal, which is available 24/7 and accessible via mobile or tablet, that allows the customer to complete the purchase of life insurance online. In New Zealand, Partners Life has created PolicyPedia, which is funded by the internal Innovation Fund. This is an interactive AI chatbot designed to aid understanding of complex guides and rule books. User feedback has been favorable, and we aim to extend its usage. These are only some of the examples where we are applying digital to improve the customer experience.\n\nAs other initiatives progress, working together with our Finance team, we will consolidate and centralize major vendor management under the Vendor Management Office. This will enable us to use our global scale to realize efficiencies, synergy across our businesses and establish deeper, longer-term strategic relationships with our technology partners. We have already commenced this through the formation of an inaugural global strategic alliance with Microsoft. This allows us to\n\nprovide a superior CX and ensure cutting edge digital and AI tools across our Group.\n\nPreserving ' Digital Trust ' and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures is essential for preserving customer confidence. Our approach comprises of a multi-layered defense strategy that emphasizes prevention through regular employee education and keeping abreast of evolving trends, conducting ongoing assessments and using state-of-art monitoring systems.\n\nIn addition, for our Group to continue to utilize technology and generate innovation in the future, we need to internalize our digital capabilities and acquire strong digital resources. To achieve this, human capital is important to us, and we have demonstrated this through a combination of talent development and several senior appointments.\n\nFirst, Fred Stute joined us last year as the Head of Enterprise Architecture and will ensure our business-driven solutions are appropriate and support our strategic plans. Moreover, Isamu Ando was appointed this year as the Chief Executive Officer of DLTX. He will provide experienced leadership to develop cutting-edge digital solutions for our internal users and customers. Furthermore, Dr. Figen Ulgen joined us this year from an external technology company. She brings many years of experience in AI and data. As our Chief AI and Data Officer, she will lead our AI efforts and ensure we have a robust data strategy.\n\nWe will also be establishing a Global Capability Centre (GCC) to strengthen our internal Group technology capability. A specialized technical team led by Mr. Vikrant Tripathi, an experienced technology leader, has been assigned for this purpose.\n\nWe will continue to invest in technology as a critical differentiator for better serving our customers and ensuring our staff realize efficiency. It therefore forms the core of our midterm strategy and is key to us becoming a leading global insurer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPurpose\n\n\uff06\n\nValues\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n## IT and Digital strategies to enhance corporate value\n\nTechnology and digital are critical drivers in our reimagination of insurance through innovation and are therefore at the center of our Vision for FY2030.\n\nOur IT and Digital strategy focuses on four areas: CX & Digital Trust, New Business Models, Investment Value, and Talent & Organization. These support our digital mission of:\n\n- \u25cf Create a superior CX through digital transformation\n- \u25cf Pioneer new tech driven business models\n- \u25cf Maximize return on tech investments and build Group synergies globally\n- \u25cf Internalize technical capability through industry leading talent\n\n## Group IT and Digital Strategy\n\n## Digital strategy goal\n\nWin in a competitive landscape by differentiation through digital transformation. Digital as a core area for strategic investment, focusing on enhancing digital capabilities and customer engagement. Positioning digital as a key growth engine, elevating us above competitors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf Provide superior CX through advanced data and AI strategies\n- \u25cf Develop robust cybersecurity to maintain digital trust\n- \u25cf Develop more sophisticated systems to facilitate innovation\n- \u25cf Pioneer new business models that leverage technology\n- \u25cf Maximize return on IT investment \u25cf Develop strategic alliances with external companies\n- \u25cf Transform companies handling intragroup systems\n\n## Internalize digital organizational capabilities Investment Value\n\nThe key to implementing IT and Digital strategies lies in the internalization of digital capabilities. All successful high growth companies possess strong in-house digital capabilities. This empowers them to differentiate themselves from competitors by rapidly launching digital services that address business challenges and deliver superior customer experiences. Our Group is actively advancing its efforts to internalize these capabilities by developing and recruiting senior leaders with specialized expertise and extensive global experience. They are leading major projects to bolster our internal digital capabilities.\n\n- \u25cf Proactively recruit expert human resources from the outside\n- \u25cf Establish the Global Capability Centre\n- \u25cf Reskill internal human resources\n\nTalent & Organization\n\nFurthermore, this year, as part of our strategic global partnership  with Microsoft, we introduced a joint digital human resources development program. This initiative will enhance the digital skills of a wide range of employees and foster a more robust digital culture within the organization.\n\nAdditionally, organizational reforms \u0336 such as the launch of the GCC and the conversion of DLTX into a subsidiary of the holding company, will further drive the internalization of digital organizational capabilities.\n\nThe vision of digital and technology as a key driver of our business is shared by our business leaders across both Japan and globally. In collaboration, we will therefore use digital and technology to solve business and organizational issues, whilst realizing synergy across our Group. In this way we will further enhance corporate value.\n\nProactive Governance and Engagement",

In the future, the GCC will gradually take on IT development projects within the Group and accumulate the experience and capabilities to enable flexible, speedy, and highly efficient IT development.\n\n## \u00b7 Transforming companies handling intragroup systems\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDai-ichi Life Techno Cross Co., Ltd. (DLTX) was placed directly under Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc., and reorganized into a core subsidiary driving Group-wide DX. This will allow us to develop systems across the Group for domestic and overseas companies, and integrate contracts with external vendors using DLTX as a hub to standardize solutions and optimize procurement costs.\n\n## Message from the President of DLTX\n\nDai-ichi Life Information Systems Co., Ltd., which has been in charge of IT strategy as a subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life since its establishment in 1999, has been renamed Dai-ichi Life Techno Cross Co., Ltd., as a wholly owned subsidiary of Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc. to strengthen DX human resources and dramatically accelerate growth as a DX company. The term ' Techno Cross ' expresses our desire to create new value by crossing technology with business. As a core subsidiary driving the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDai-ichi Life Group ' s digital strategy, DLTX will pursue growth through dramatic transformations and challenging the status quo, contributing to the development of customers and society.\n\n## \u00b7 Concluding a strategic global partnership with Microsoft\n\nIn August 2024, our Group signed a multi-year strategic global partnership with Microsoft. Microsoft has long been a technology partner of our Group, providing products and services that support mission-critical systems and collaboration, and our Group has built a relationship of trust by being the first in the domestic life insurance industry to adopt ' Microsoft Azure ' as a standard. This partnership will take the relationship between the two companies to a new level, and by establishing a structure that can effectively utilize innovative technologies (e.g., cloud services, AI, data analytics), the two companies will provide services that will solve the challenges faced by the Group and lead to superior CX.\n\n## Development of new business models New Business Models\n\n## \u00b7 Strengthening the Innovation Fund and establishing a global community\n\nAiming to transform the insurance industry through innovation, since FY2021 we have been supporting domestic and overseas Group companies to conduct demonstration tests of innovative business ideas that will help the Group acquire new organizational capabilities over the medium to long term. In FY2023, we established a new system to support ideas in their early stages and expanded the operation of a global community to share and\n\ncollaborate on conferences, hot news, digital health, AI, and other activities of each company in each region, as part of efforts to encourage more employees to interact and take on more challenges.\n\n## \u00b7 Strengthening collaboration with YuLife and considering full-scale implementation\n\nFollowing the successful trial of the well-being business model with YuLife in Japan, which was announced in 2023, we are promoting further joint projects. This strategic partnership aims to leverage YuLife ' s strengths to provide innovative products and\n\nservices that utilize technologies. By combining the expertise of both companies, we will meet the evolving needs of our customers. This initiative symbolizes our commitment to leading innovation and becoming a leading global insurer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIsamu Ando\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPurpose\n\n\uff06\n\nValues\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n## Developing more sophisticated data & AI strategies CX & Digital Trust\n\n## \u00b7 Safe and efficient use of AI\n\nWe have appointed Figen Ulgen, who has abundant experience and a high level of expertise in the area of global companies, as Chief Data and AI Officer (CDAO) in charge of data and AI strategy \uff06 governance to support the utilization and promotion of data and AI throughout the Group. Under Dr. Ulgen ' s leadership, we will accelerate the Group ' s growth globally by utilizing technology in our business.\n\nAs a specific initiative, we are using Azure Sandbox to test Generative AI tools and evaluate various AI platforms, with the goal\n\n## \u00b7 Message from the CDAO (Figen Ulgen)\n\nWe believe that AI and data are no longer an option but rather a requirement to stay competitive and delight our customers. When doing this, we are following a sound approach to AI and data utilization that does not get distracted by market hype, and we bring our people along by continually paving the way for the core functional workflows by integrating AI and Data Democratization wherever possible.\n\nof providing an AI application sharing platform for safe and efficient use of AI throughout the Company. Our goal is to automate tasks such as report creation and document template generation while controlling the risks of using Generative AI, aiming to improve productivity. In the future, we will provide services that contribute to greater convenience for our customers, with a view to integrating various AI models in Japan and overseas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting technology-driven sales activities (transformation of sales models)\n\nCX & Digital Trust\n\n## \u00b7 Utilizing technology to ' understand customers ' and ' enhance customer consulting '\n\nWe aim to deliver the best products and services to our customers at the right time and in the right way by combining the strengths of the physical and digital approaches. In addition, by proactively incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as Generative AI and cloud computing, we will seek to improve the productivity and business efficiency of our sales reps.\n\n## \u00b7 Centralizing information to understand customers\n\nTo improve CX and channel productivity, we will build an integrated CRM infrastructure that consolidates the vast amount of information we hold and centrally manage it on a per-customer basis. We aim to achieve an understanding of our customers from all angles by sharing customer information and daily activity information among all channels that are close to the customer. In addition, the accumulated data will be used for marketing purposes to improve the productivity of our sales reps.\n\n## \u00b7 Utilizing Generative AI to strengthen consulting\n\nBy utilizing the rapid development of Generative AI in recent years, avatars will accompany our sales reps as their partners, with the aim of maximizing CX.\n\nSpecifically, by integrating data accumulated through the above-mentioned integrated CRM with Generative AI, we aim to offer and recommend products and services at the right timing for each customer through our sales reps. To strengthen consulting, we will also enhance training aspects related to sales reps, pursuing CX that combines the strengths of technology and people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The advance survey consisted of 26 questions in eight categories: ' Overall Evaluation, ' ' Structure, ' ' Discussion, ' ' Operation, ' ' Culture, ' ' Committee, ' ' Self-evaluation, ' and\n\n' Others. ' After receiving an evaluation based on the responses to the advance survey and individual interviews, as well as future issues and proposed directions for action from the third-party organization, improvement measures were considered and implemented.\n\nIn addition, for FY2023, each Director was interviewed individually for 30 minutes by a third-party organization as part of a mutual evaluation (peer review) of directors. This is intended to provide an opportunity for each director to gain insight into further enhancing their contribution toward further improvement of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.\n\n|

Plan\n\nThe succession plan of the Company including the president is discussed at meetings of the Nominations Advisory Committee as prescribed in the Company ' s Articles of Incorporation.\n\nAfter verifying the election and discharge of members of the Board of Directors from the standpoint of eligibility and reviewing and deciding on its proposals, the Committee submits them to the Board for review. As part of this, the committee also makes use of third-party candidate evaluations and takes steps to enhance its effectiveness by, for example, setting up opportunities for candidates to meet with the Committee members. The members of this Committee include the chairperson and the president as well as outside members who are selected by the Board. Moreover, to ensure the independence of this committee, more than half of its members are outside members, and to facilitate the mutual sharing of information with the Remuneration Advisory Committee and the consideration of diverse views as part of committee discussions, outside directors who are not members of the committee also participate in committee meetings as observers.\n\nBusiness\n\n## Corporate Governance Policy (Excerpt)\n\n## Nominations Advisory Committee\n\n## (1)  Roles of the Committee\n\nThe Nominations Advisory Committee, as an advisory committee to the Board of Directors, shall confirm procedures of elections and discharge of directors of the Company and The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited and Audit & Supervisory Board Members of The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited from the perspective of eligibility, and shall deliberate and determine committee proposals. The committee proposals are submitted to the Board.\n\n## (2)  Composition of the Committee\n\nThe members of the Nominations Advisory Committee shall be comprised of the Chairman of the Board, the President and outside members, and the Board of Directors shall elect outside members from the outside directors or outside experts. Moreover, to ensure the independence of this Committee, more than half of the members shall be outside members.\n\n## Major themes for deliberation by the Nominations Advisory Committee\n\n- \u25cf Proposal of director candidates\n- \u25cf Matters relating to succession plans for directors and other personnel\n\n## Remuneration of Directors and Officers\n\nWe recognize the remuneration system for directors and officers as a critical component of ' fair treatment ' for the directors and officers responsible for achieving our Group Vision. Therefore, we set up a basic policy and basic principles, as well as a decision-making process, as follows.\n\n## Basic policy\n\n- \u25cf Serves a system for realizing the sharing of value with stakeholders with a medium- to long-term perspective.\n- \u25cf Fair remuneration system and appropriate level, reflecting the magnitude of the roles and responsibilities and the degree to which capabilities were shown.\n- \u25cf Evaluates the contributions of each director and encourages the value creation on which the Group focuses by linking their remuneration with company and individual performance.\n\n## Basic principles\n\n- 1.  Appropriate remuneration design according to roles and responsibilities\n- 2. Consistency with the strategies on which the Group focuses\n- 3. Linked to the performance of the Company and individuals\n- 4. Shares interests with all stakeholders\n- 5. Proper and competitive level of remuneration\n- 6. Ensures objectivity and transparency\n\n## Process for determining remuneration\n\nRemuneration for inside directors (excluding non-executive directors such as the Chair of the Board and the directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members) is designed to provide an incentive to work toward sustainable growth and thus consists of basic remuneration, single-year performance-linked remuneration (company performance-linked and individual performance-linked remuneration), and stock remuneration (restricted stock remuneration and performance-linked stock remuneration). Outside directors and directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members receive only basic remuneration. Of the inside directors (excluding directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members), those who are non-executive directors, such as the Chair of the Board, do not receive single-year performance-linked remuneration or performance-linked stock remuneration. The amount of these remuneration portions is established with reference to third-party research on remuneration for management roles at other companies, considering the industry type and other characteristics. Moreover, the ' Policy for Determining Remuneration of Directors and Executive Officers, ' which includes the basic policy and basic principles were determined by the Board of Directors following deliberation by the Remuneration Advisory Committee where outside directors make up a majority of the committee members.",

Each line regularly reports to the Board of Directors and the Executive Management Board on the status of initiatives and monitoring in light of their respective functions.\n\nAt the same time, we implement internal control selfassessments that also cover group companies to raise the effectiveness of the Group ' s internal controls. These assessments promote appropriate business operations by identifying major risks in each business process and evaluating and analyzing the importance of each risk in terms of impact and size of losses incurred if it were to become evident as well as the effectiveness of risk control measures.\n\nThrough these endeavors, we will continue to operate our internal control system to realize an effective risk-based group internal control system based on the three lines of defense.\n\n## Compliance\n\nOur Group practices the Group purpose and values, and strives to create sustainable corporate value and meet the expectations of all stakeholders through our corporate activities and our contribution to society . We have formulated the Group Code of Conduct as a basic guideline for all officers and employees to think and act based on the principles for practicing our Group purpose and values.\n\nEven though the Code of Conduct is not confined to compliance, it is also a guideline for promoting compliance.\n\nIn promoting compliance in response to the changing business environment, including the globalization of the Group ' s business, we are taking measures to comply with laws and regulations, the Articles of Incorporation, social norms, and market rules, as well as to proactively identify potential conduct risks.\n\nThe Legal and Compliance Unit is responsible for ascertaining serious risks pertaining to compliance and for monitoring and giving guidance to each group company.

More specifically, we create management plans, capital policies, and other measures based on the situation of capital, risk and profit, and carry out business activities accordingly. As part of risk management efforts related to ERM, the Risk Management Unit verifies the appropriateness of management plans and capital policies when they are formulated. In addition, it appropriately controls capital, risk, and profit based on the location, type, and characteristics of risks by setting and managing risk tolerances and promotes stronger group risk management.\n\nIn our Group, we control financial soundness by integrating the various risks of economic value, accounting, and regulatory bases, and comparing the amount of risk to our amount of capital. In internal risk control, we practice risk management while placing a high emphasis on an economic value-based approach. For example, we are building a framework of measurement models for the calculation of capital and risk amounts on an economic value basis in consideration of the Insurance Capital Standard (ICS), scheduled for adoption in FY2025, and the discussions for economic value-based regulation in Japan. In addition, we have incorporated an economic value-based approach into our Group ' s allocation of capital and product design as we pursue management that is consistent with risk measurement principles. At the same time, when we identify and assess risk phenomena that cannot be entirely quantified with our models, we carry out stress tests using projected worst-case scenarios based on past events, such as financial market turmoil and large-scale disasters, as well as projections about the future. We then analyze the impact\n\nBusiness\n\non our financial soundness and report the findings to the Executive Management Board and to the Board of Directors. In addition, we examine the market environment and other factors, strengthen our monitoring, and consider and implement management or financial responses as appropriate.\n\nFurthermore, our Group identifies foreseeable risks that could have a major impact on our business as ' Material risks. ' In identifying material risks, we evaluate the impact* 1 and possibilities of each risk on a scale of 1 to 4, based on the results of the material risks identified by each group company. Using a heat map, important risks are identified as group-based material risks and reviewed annually. In addition, ' emerging risks* 2 ' are identified every fiscal year as risks that are not currently material but are expected to emerge. By formulating business plans based on these risks, we promote the PDCA cycle based on risk recognition and appropriately manage risks from the predictive stage. Our Group regularly reports the status of these ' Material risks ' to the Executive Management Board and the Board of Directors and, based on recognition of the status, promotes measures to avoid the occurrence of risks, while striving to respond promptly and appropriately in the event that risks do materialize.\n\n- *1  Impact is based on economic loss, reputation (impact on sales, management responsibility, and stock price), and other factors\n\n*2 Risks that are expected to emerge due to changes in the environment and other factors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information about risk management\n\nhttps://www.dai-ichi-life-hd.com/en/about/control/in\\_control/ administer.html\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *3 Risk Management Unit and other departments in charge of each type of risk\n- *4 The dotted frame shows the entities that Audit & Supervisory Committee makes instructions to and receives reporting from.\n- *5 The Audit & Supervisory Committee and the Internal Audit Unit coordinate with each other.",

We have also improved our global management structure by assigning a person with abundant knowledge and skills to management-team positions as Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Digital Officer (CDO).

In addition, we have established a ' CSIRT ' * 2 consisting mainly of dedicated personnel with advanced expertise to bolster intragroup preparation through means such as laying down rules and regulations regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents and educating employees. Furthermore, we collect the latest security updates from multiple external agencies and share this information within the Group. Through these efforts, for our information systems, we take action against new threats as needed, such as combining multiple systems to detect unauthorized access viruses, and other threats to protect from them. Through these initiatives, we are working to optimize cybersecurity measures for the entire Group.\n\nThe company has acquired ' Digital Transformation Certification ' based on the DX certification system set forth by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) as a corporation that perceives business and IT systems in a unified manner and has formulated a management vision and business model based on the changes that digital technology has brought to society and the competitive environment and is ready to realize that vision and model.\n\n## Group Tax Governance\n\nNew taxation rules, such as the global minimum tax, established by international organizations have been internationally agreed upon and are being considered for implementation by national governments around the world, and have been introduced in Japan in FY2024. Moreover, stakeholders are taking an increasing interest in taxation, and external conditions are changing drastically. In addition, as our business activities become more diverse, we are involved in an increasing range of transactions and activities on a group basis, making appropriate tax conduct increasingly important.\n\nConsidering these circumstances, to further enhance group tax governance, we have the ' Group Tax Policy ' that stipulates the core philosophies and implementation policies for tax that Group companies should adhere to, with the approval of the Board of Directors.\n\nBy adhering to the policy, we shall satisfy corporate social responsibility and achieve sustainable growth and enhancement of corporate value over the medium to long term through proper tax payments in all countries and regions of business.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nWith a view to ensuring sound and adequate business operations in our Group, the Internal Audit Unit, an independent organizational unit, performs internal audit activities on the supervision of operational execution and control to ensure satisfactory internal controls in the Group.

        "page_content": "## Equity Held for Purposes Other than Pure Investment\n\nUnder the Insurance Business Act, insurance companies are required to set aside insurance premiums and investment income as policy reserves to ensure that liabilities on long-term insurance policies are fulfilled.\n\nWe believe that we should conduct investment management from a long-term perspective with regard to the amount of policy reserves that are substantially attributable to policyholders.\n\nEach life insurance company in our Group invests assets based on ALM (Asset-Liability Management), focusing on fixed income assets. However, there is not a sufficiently developed market for super-long-term bonds that corresponds to super-longterm liabilities. Therefore, Dai-ichi Life, which has long-term stable and large-scale insurance liabilities, is focusing on the diversification effect among asset classes in the portfolio, and conducts balanced investment in which risky assets such as equities are included in the investment portfolio considering corporate analysis, diversification of industries and brands, and risk management.\n\nIn this way, holding equities in the investment portfolio at each group company engaged in the life insurance business is, in principle, conducted for pure investment purposes as part of investment management.

We will continue our efforts to deliver ' peace of mind ' through life insurance and realize ' happiness ' beyond that, so that we can stand by the side of individual customers.\n\n## Pledge to Customers and Society (Dai-ichi Life ' s ' Voluntary Declaration of Consumer Orientation ' )\n\nDai-ichi Life is working to realize activities from the customers ' and consumers ' perspective in order to realize a sales representative structure that can respond to the trust of customers and society. The ' Voluntary Declaration of Consumer Orientation, ' which was formulated in 2017, was revised to ' Pledge to Customers and Society ' in 2021, which is kept in the hearts and minds of all executives and employees as the foundation for their daily business activities.\n\nBased on this ' Pledge to Customers and Society, ' we are making company-wide efforts to strengthen initiatives to incorporate ' voices of customers ' into management and improve services, and are implementing continuous improvement initiatives based on ' voices of customers ' to enhance the quality of operations that lead to ' By your side, for life. '\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n## Strengthening the governance of the Dai-ichi Life Group\n\nThe Company (Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc.) is continuously monitoring whether the internal control system by the three defensive lines (operating divisions, indirect and administrative divisions, and an internal audit division) is sufficiently functioning at Dai-ichi Life.\n\nIn FY2023, the Company ' s Board of Directors received a total of five reports and held numerous discussions, including opportunities to exchange opinions with the Audit & Supervisory Committee and the Board. We will continue to pay close attention to initiatives aimed at further ensuring effectiveness, strengthening internal controls, and implementing prerequisite reforms of the corporate culture, to strengthen our governance together with Dai-ichi Life.\n\n## Delivering reliable peace of mind\n\nAfter the policy is signed, the ' Total Life Plan Report ' is sent to the policyholder once a year, which describes the details of the policy and other information. In conjunction with the arrival of the ' Total Life Plan Report ' and other information, sales representatives conduct the ' Regular Policy Checkup for Peace of Mind, ' in which ' three checkups ' are conducted face-to-face or non-face-to-face in accordance with customers ' wishes.\n\n## Three checkups\n\n- (1) Confirmation of contract information Checkup\n- (2)  Confirmation of insured events for payment eligibility and payment history Checkup\n- (3)  Confirmation of registered details (e.g., recipient, address information) Checkup\n\nIn addition, we have established a system to ensure that insurance claims and benefits are received reliably and promptly, and we will continue to utilize digital tools to ensure that procedures are tailored to the customer and that payments are made accurately and fairly.",

In addition, through means such as constructive dialogue with shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders to deepen their understanding of our Group, we strive to achieve a firm understanding of all stakeholders ' opinions and demands, which function as sources of invaluable feedback for our companies and their management teams, allowing us to improve management and increase corporate value.\n\n## Status of dialogue with shareholders and investors (FY2023)\n\nAt the Dai-ichi Life Group, we engage in dialogue with domestic and overseas shareholders and investors regularly through channels such as quarterly financial results conference calls and the half-year financial results conference, which are mainly conducted online. In FY2023, we conducted a theme-based conference on the topic of sustainability, at which the CSuO and outside directors answered questions regarding the Dai-ichi Life Group ' s sustainability management strategies.\n\nWe also engaged in dialogue with more than 200 individual shareholders and investors in Japan and overseas. In speaking with them, we discussed a wide variety of topics, covering not only business performance but also corporate governance, risk management, and sustainability. In FY2023, we received many valuable opinions regarding the new mid-term management plan as well as questions about the TOB for Benefit One and Dai-ichi Life Holdings ' capital efficiency-focused capital circulation management philosophy.\n\nWe report and share the opinions we receive widely within the Company, including feedback to management through the Board of Directors and the Executive Management Board, and incorporate them into management improvements.\n\nIn addition, in FY2024 we have introduced a stock compensation system. To convey messages from the capital market to a greater number of employees and promote working together as one to improve corporate value, a company internal IR briefing for all management levels was held with roughly 1,500 participants. We are conducting dialogue to improve operations while continuing to share messages from the capital market.\n\nTrack record of dialogue with shareholders and investors (FY2023) \u25cf Number of conference calls and financial results and business conferences: 9\n\n\u25cf\n\nMedia distribution for individual investors: ca. 100,000 viewers\n\n- \u25cf Total number of IR interviews (domestic and foreign shareholders): ca. 300\n\n## Participation in External Initiatives\n\nBy participating in initiatives related to sustainability within and outside Japan, we are promoting initiatives for realizing a sustainable society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrinciples for Financial Action towards a Sustainable Society (Principles for Financial Action for the 21st Century)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternational Corporate Governance Network (ICGN)\n\nWomen ' s Empowerment Principles (WEPs)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJapan Stewardship\n\nInitiative\n\nClimate Change-Related Initiatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRE100\n\nSpring\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate Action 100+\n\nInstitutional Investors Collective Engagement Forum (IICEF)\n\nTHE NET-ZERO\n\nASSET OWNER\n\nALLIANCE\n\nTHE NET-ZERO ASSET OWNER ALLIANCE\n\nUnited Nations Global\n\nCompact (UNGC)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIFRS Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrinciples for\n\nResponsible\n\nInvestment (PRI)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30% Club Japan\n\nAlliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlasgow Financial\n\nAlliance for Net Zero\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTaskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum\n\nAccess to Medicine\n\nFoundation\n\nJapan Impact-driven\n\nFinancing Initiative\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGX Acceleration\n\nAgency\n\nStrategy &\n\nBusiness\n\n## Major Awards for the Group's Initiatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlatinum Kurumin Plus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWork with Pride ' PRIDE Index ' Gold Award (2023)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployer of Choice for Gender Equality (Australia)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2023 Nadeshiko Brand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nESG Finance Award Japan Gold Prize in Investor Category (Minister of the Environment Award)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3rd Nikkei Integrated Report Award Award for Excellence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Recipient               | Organizer                             | Award                                                                         | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Protective              | Newsweek                              | America's Best  Customer Service                                              | Service ranks companies based on  independent customer feedback of those  who have used their services or requested  more information in the past three years.

the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the New Zealand Accounting Standards Board. Accordingly, figures for Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2023 are restated. In addition, total net assets and total assets as of March 31, 2022 and 2023 are also restated.\n\n## Outline of business\n\nOrdinary revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 increased by 16.0% compared to the previous fiscal year to \u00a511,028.1 billion, consisting of \u00a57,526.3 billion (13.1% increase) in premium and other income, \u00a53,033.9 billion (33.0% increase) in investment income, and \u00a5467.8 billion (18.4% decrease) in other ordinary revenues. Meanwhile, ordinary expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 increased by 18.0% compared to the previous fiscal year to \u00a510,489.1 billion, consisting of \u00a56,756.8 billion (3.2% increase) in benefits and claims, \u00a51,877.4 billion (\u00a515.3 billion at the previous fiscal year) in provision for policy reserves and others, \u00a5603.8 billion (47.3% decrease) in investment expenses, \u00a5926.3 billion (10.1% increase) in operating expenses, and \u00a5324.6 billion (43.1% decrease) in other ordinary expenses.\n\nAs a result, ordinary profit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 increased by 39.1% compared to the previous fiscal year to \u00a5539.0 billion. Net income attributable to shareholders of parent company, which is ordinary profit after extraordinary gains and losses, provision for reserve for policyholder dividends and total of corporate income taxes, increased by 84.6% to \u00a5320.7 billion. This was mainly due to rebound from temporary downside factors at the previous fiscal year such as an increase in hedging cost of foreign currency hedged bonds and COVID-19 related payments at Dai-ichi Life.\n\nSegment results were as follows:\n\nOrdinary revenues in the domestic insurance business increased by \u00a5441.8 billion compared to the previous consolidated fiscal year, amounting to \u00a58,782.9 billion (5.3% increase). This increase was mainly due to an increase in premium and other income because of strong sales resulting from a rise in domestic and overseas interest rate at Dai-ichi Frontier Life as well as significant gains on foreign exchange resulting from the depreciation of the yen.\n\nSegment profit increased by \u00a562.8 billion compared to the previous consolidated fiscal year, reaching \u00a5407.0 billion (18.3% increase). This was mainly due to a significant decrease in COVID-19 related benefit payments at Dai-ichi Life and a reduction in provision for standard policy reserves for foreign currency-denominated insurance and new contract expenses at Dai-ichi Frontier Life following changes in the financial market environment and reinsurance of new contracts.",

This increase was mainly due to a rise in premium and other income at TAL following the successful acquisition of TAL Life Insurance Services Limited (formerly Westpac Life Insurance Services Limited) in August 2022, as well as a significant improvement in gains and losses on trading securities at Protectiveduetochanges in the financial market environment.\n\nSegment profit increased by \u00a5122.6 billion compared to the previous consolidated fiscal year, reaching \u00a5127.3 billion (\u00a54.7 billion at the previous fiscal year). This increase was mainly due to profit contributions from Partners Life in New Zealand, which was acquired in November 2022, and an improvement in gains and losses on trading securities at Dai-ichi Life Reinsurance Bermuda Ltd. compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## (3) Other Business\n\nOrdinary revenues in the other business decreased by \u00a567.4 billion compared to the previous consolidated fiscal year, amounting to \u00a5226.8 billion (22.9% decrease). This decrease was mainly due to a reduction in dividend income from group companies such as Dai-ichi Life and Dai-ichi Frontier Life. Segment profit decreased by \u00a569.7 billion compared to the previous consolidated fiscal year, reaching \u00a5199.2 billion (25.9% decrease).\n\n## Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\n|

In accordancewiththeaccounting standards, PLC has omitted the test for an impairment indicator and proceeded to the quantitative impairment test described below for all or a part of reporting units. Whether or not there is any impairment indicator is comprehensively examined in consideration of the presence of deterioration in economic and market environments surrounding PLC and its reporting units, the presence of factors that have a negative impact on future profits or cash flows, the presence of deterioration in overall business performance, and other events specific to PLC and its reporting units.\n\nNext, if it is concluded that there is an impairment indicator of goodwill or it is selected not to conduct the test for impairment indicator, a comparison of the book value of the reporting units that include goodwill to its fair value (the quantitative impairment test) is performed. The key assumptions usedinthecalculation of fair value (e.g., business income and expense projections and discount rates) are subject to the uncertainty of estimation.\n\nIf there is any impairment indicator that is attributable to the deterioration of circumstances or the occurrence of events, or if the key assumptions usedinthecomparison of book value to fair value (the quantitative impairment test) change, impairment losses on goodwill may be recorded in the following fiscal year.\n\nTDLA determines whether or not to record an impairment loss on goodwill by comparing book value with recoverable amount in eachcash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated (the quantitative impairment test). Recoverable amount is calculated based on embedded values, etc.For calculating the embedded values, underlying actuarial assumptions are used such as discount rates, mortality rates, morbidity, persistency rates, and others.Ifrecoverable amount reduces due to the update of underlying actuarial assumptions, impairment losses on goodwill may be recorded in the following fiscal year.\n\nThe Company judges whether or not to record an impairment loss on goodwill in accordancewiththeaccounting standards in Japan, considering the results of the judgments made by eachsubsidiary.\n\nGoodwill arising from acquisitions of PNZ and ipet is recorded on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and is subject to judgment on recording impairment losses on goodwill to be examined by the Company in accordance with the accounting standards in Japan.\n\nFirst, the Company examines whether or not there is any impairment indicator in an asset group that includes goodwill. Whether or not there is any impairment indicator is comprehensively examined in consideration of the presence of deterioration in economic and market environments surrounding PNZ and ipet, the presence of factors that have a negative impact on future profits or cash flows, the presence of deterioration in overall business performance, the presence of a significant drop in substantivevalue in the asset group that includes goodwill, and other events specific to each asset group.\n\nNext, if it is concluded that there is an impairment indicator of goodwill, the Company estimates future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group that includes goodwill, and compares the total of cash flows with the book value. If the amount of future cash flows is less than the book value, the Company records an impairment loss.Then, the Company calculates a recoverable amount of the asset group that includes goodwill, for which an impairment loss is recorded, to recognize the difference between the book value and the recoverable amount as an impairment loss.The key assumptions usedinthecalculation of the recoverable amount (e.g., business income and expense projections, discount rates and actuarial assumptions) are subject to the uncertainty of estimation.\n\nIf there is any impairment indicator that is attributable to the deterioration of circumstances or the occurrence of events, impairment losses on goodwill may be recorded in the following fiscal year.\n\nThe Company has determined that there is no impairment indicator of goodwill, and therefore no impairment losses on goodwill are recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.\n\n## b) Evaluation of value of in-force insurancecontracts\n\ni) Amounts recognized on the consolidated financial statements in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024\n\nOther intangible fixed assets presented in the Company'sconsolidated balancesheet includes assets regarding the present value of in-force insurancecontracts, namely Value of Business Acquired ( ' VOBA ' ) or Value In-force( ' VIF ' ). The balance of VOBA as of March 31, 2023and 2024 consist of \u00a5308,608 million and \u00a5287,996 million (US$1,902 million) derived from the acquisition of PLC and the acquisition business of PLC's acquisition segment, the balance of VIF as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 consist of \u00a535,793 million and \u00a534,200 million (US$225 million) derived from the acquisitions of PNZ through DLIHD an intermediary holding company of the Company as well as \u00a524,077 million and \u00a521,608 million (US$142 million) derived from the acquisition of ipet by the Company, respectively.\n\nThe balance of VIF derived from the acquisitions of TDLA (in the amount of \u00a520,188 million) as of March 31, 2023 was fully amortized following the adoption of AASB No. 17 \"Insurance Contracts.\"\n\nii) Information on the contents of significant accounting estimates related to identified items\n\nThe value of in-force insurancecontracts arising from acquisitions is calculated as the present value of future profits to be earned from future cash flows arising from in-force insurancecontracts and investment type insurancecontracts at the acquisition date, and is recorded on the consolidated financial statements of theseconsolidated subsidiaries while the value of in-force insurancecontracts is amortized over a period during which its effect is estimated, in proportion to the manner in which its effect is realized.\n\nThe VOBA of PLC is amortized based on future gross premiums, estimated gross margins,contractual terms and/or others.\n\nWith regards to the VOBA arising from investment type insurancecontracts, PLC regularly reviews actuarial assumptions,such as interest rates, mortality rates, persistency rates, and others, updates them if necessary, and accordingly increases or decreases amortization amount of the VOBA.

Each property for rent and property not in use, which is not used for insurance business purposes, is deemed to be an independent asset group.\n\n## b) Background for Recognition of Impairment Losses\n\nAs a result of significant declines in profitability or market value of some asset groups, the consolidated subsidiaries wrote down the book value of these assets to the recoverable value, and reported such write-off as impairment losses in extraordinary losses.\n\n## c) Breakdown of Impairment Losses\n\nImpairment losses by asset group for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 were as follows:\n\n|                        | Place                                |        | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Asset Group            |                                      | Number | Land                | Leasehold rights    | Buildings           | Total               |\n|                        |                                      |        | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) |\n| Real estate for rent   | Hachioji city,Tokyo Prefecture       | 1      | -                   | -                   | 57                  | 57                  |\n| Real estate not in use | Chuo-ku, Tokyo Prefecture and others | 19     | 9,082               | 3,402               | 3,396               | 15,881              |\n| Total                  | -                                    | 20     | 9,082               | 3,402               | 3,454               | 15,939              |\n\nImpairment losses by asset group for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 were as follows:\n\n| Asset Group            | Place                                   | Number   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses   | Impairment Losses          | Impairment Losses          | Impairment Losses          |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                        |                                         |          | Land                | Buildings           | Total               | Land                       | Buildings                  | Total                      |\n|                        |                                         |          | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million yen) | (Unit: million US dollars) | (Unit: million US dollars) | (Unit: million US dollars) |\n| Real estate not in use | Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo Prefecture and others | 16       | 4,083               | 1,243               | 5,307               | 26                         | 8                          | 35                         |\n\n## d) Calculation of Recoverable Value\n\nValue in use or net sale value is used as the recoverable value of real estate for rent, and net sale value is used as the recoverable value of real estate not in use.

        "page_content": "Note 1: Description of the evaluation methods and inputs used to measure fair value\n\n## A AAAA s ss ss s ss ss e ee ee t tttt s ss ss\n\n## Monetary claims bought\n\nThe fair value of monetary claims bought is measured using the price obtained by outside contractors and counterparty financial institutions. Since significant unobservable inputs are used for the price obtained, the fair value of monetary claims bought is classified into Level 3.\n\n## Money held in trust\n\nThe fair value of money held in trust is classified into Level 1 in cases where unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets can be used. If the market is not active, the fair value of money held in trust is classified into Level 2, irrespective of whether disclosed quoted market prices are used.\n\nThe fair value of money held in trust for which quoted market prices are not used as fair value is measured using prices obtained from outside contractors and counterparty financial institutions, and classified into either Level 1 or Level 2, based on the level of the primary components of trust assets.\n\n## Securities\n\nThe fair value of securities for which unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets are available is classified into Level 1. These include stocks and government bonds, among others. If the market is not active, the fair value of securities is classified into Level 2, irrespective of whether disclosed quoted market prices are used.\n\nThe fair value of bonds for which quoted market prices are not used as fair value is measured mainly using prices obtained from outside contractors and counterparty financial institutions. The present value of these prices is calculated by discounting future cash flows at a discount rate (i.e., a risk-free interest rate that takes into account credit spread). The fair value of bonds is classified into Level 2 if observable inputs are usedinthecalculation, and Level 3 if significant unobservable inputs are used.\n\nThe fair value of mutual funds without market prices is based on net asset value unless there is no significant restriction on cancellation. The fair value is classified into either Level 2 or Level 3, mainly based on constituents held in trust.\n\nThe fair value of asset-backed securities of certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries is based on the price obtained from outside contractors.The fair value of such asset-backed securities is classified into Level 2 if observable inputs are used in the calculation, and Level 3 if significant unobservable inputs are used.\n\nNotes regarding securities by purpose of holding are described in \"X. Securities\" below.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe fair value of loans is calculated by discounting future cash flows at a discount rate (i.e., an interest rate corresponding to internal credit ratings and remaining periods which is assumed to be applied to new loans to the borrower and an interest rate assumed to be applied to new loans that take into account market risk and liquidity risk). The fair value of loans is classified into Level 3.\n\nAdditionally, for risk-monitored loans, reserve for possible loan losses is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows or the amount deemed recoverable from collateral and guarantees and the fair value is close to the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet minus reserve for possible loan losses at the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, that amount (the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet minus reserve for possible loan losses) is recorded as fair value for risk-monitored loans and classified into Level 3.\n\nAlso, loans without a due date because of their characteristics that their exposure is limited to the amount of their collaterals, are deemed to have fair value close to book value, taking into account estimated repayment period and interest rates.Therefore, their book value is recorded as the fair value and classified into Level 3.\n\n## L LLLL i ii ii a aaaa b bbbb i ii ii l ll ll i ii ii t tttt i ii ii e eeee s ssss\n\n## Bonds payable\n\nThe fair value of bonds payable for which quoted market prices can be used is based on the quoted market prices. For bonds payable for which quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows at a discount rate based on market yields for similar instruments. When quoted market prices and observable inputs are used in the calculation, the fair value of bonds payable is classified into Level 2. Otherwise, the fair value of bonds payable is classified into Level 3.\n\n## Payables under repurchase agreements\n\nThe fair value of payables under repurchase agreements is calculated by discounting future cash flows at a discount rate using an interest rate based on the remaining maturity and is classified into Level 2.\n\nPayables under repurchase agreements with short repayment terms are deemed to haveafairvalue close to book value. Therefore, their book value is recorded as the fair value, and their fair value is classified into Level 2.\n\n## Long-term borrowings\n\nThe fair value of long-term borrowings is calculated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest, using interest rates corresponding to the internal credit rating and remaining periods which are assumed to be applied to new borrowings. The fair value of long-term borrowings is classified into Level 2 when observable inputs are used in the calculation, and Level 3 when significant unobservable inputs are used. Also, certain long-term borrowings are deemed to have fair value close to book value, taking into account interest rates and other factors.Therefore, their book value is recorded as the fair value, and their fair value is classified into Level 3.\n\n## D DDDD e ee ee r rrrr i iiii v vv vv a aa aa t tttt iiiii v vv vv e ee ee T TTTT r rrrr a aa aa n nnnn s ss ss a aa aa c cc cc t tttt iiiii o oooo n nnnn s ss ss\n\nThe fair value of listed derivative transactions for which unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets are available is classified into Level 1. These mainly include stock-related transactions and bond-related transactions. If the market is not active, the fair value of listed derivative transactions is classified into Level 2, irrespective of whether disclosed quoted market prices are used.\n\nThe fair value of over-the-counter derivative transactions is mainly based on the prices calculated using discounted present values obtained from outside contractors and counterparty financial institutions and option valuation models, etc. The inputs used in the valuation method for calculating the price of over-the-counter derivative transactions are mainly interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and volatility.

The transfer was recognized\n\n## at the end of fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.\n\n(*4) Transfer from Level 3 to Level 2 due to the availability of observable inputs.The transfer was recognized at the end of fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.\n\n## c) Description of the fair value valuation process\n\nThe Group has established policies and procedures for measuring the fair value and classifying the fair value level in the accounting department. In accordance with these policies and procedures, the investment management service department selects the fair value valuation model, and then measures the fair value and classifies the fair value by level. For such fair value, the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs used in the measurement of the fair value and the appropriateness of the classification of the level of fair value are verified. In addition, when using the quoted market prices obtained from a third party as fair value, the validity is verified by appropriate methods such as confirmation of the valuation method and inputs used and comparison with the fair value of similar financial instruments.\n\nd) Explanation of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in significant unobservable input\n\n## Securities\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate is an adjustment rate to the base market interest rate and consists primarily of a liquidity premium, which adjusts the discount rate by reflecting the uncertainty of cash flows and the liquidity of financial instruments, and a risk premium, which adjusts the discount rate by reflecting the issuer ' s credit risk and the overall market risk associated with similar financial instruments. In general, a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate results in a significant decrease (increase) in the fair value.\n\n## Paydown rate\n\nThe paydown rate is the expected annual rate of principal repayment. In general, a significant increase (decrease) in the paydown rate is accompanied by a decrease (increase) in the projected weighted average life of the financial instrument, resulting in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair value.\n\n## Other (Embedded derivatives)\n\n## Mortality\n\nThe mortality is the percentage of deaths in a certain group of people in a certain period of time. In general, a significant increase (decrease) in the mortality results in a significant decrease (increase) in the fair value of the liability and affects the fair value of the embedded derivatives.\n\n## Lapse\n\nThe lapse is the percentage of people in a certain group who have surrendered insurance policies or whose insurance policies have lapsedinacertain period of time. In general, a significant increase (decrease) in the lapse results in a significant decrease (increase) in the fair value of the liability and affects the fair value of the embedded derivatives.\n\n## Withdrawal rate\n\nThe withdrawal rate is the percentage of policy reserves that are withdrawn in a certain period of time. In general, a significant increase (decrease) in the withdrawal rate results in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair value of the liability and affects the fair value of the embedded derivatives.\n\n## X.

Policy reserves include additional policy reserves for some whole life insurance policies in accordance with Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.\n\nContingency reserves included in policy reserves are set aside in accordance with Article 69, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act to cover risks that may accrue in the future in order to ensure the performance of future obligations under insurancecontracts.\n\n## 1 11 11 6 66 66 . ....

As a result of this change, an appropriate amount of reserves cannot be obtained with the calculation method set forth in the main rules in Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Notification of the Minister of Finance No.234, 1998 (\"IBNR Notification\"). The Company therefore records the amount that was calculated using the following method, pursuant to provisions in the proviso of Article 1, Paragraph 1 of IBNR Notification.\n\n## (Overview of the calculation method)\n\nThe Company first deducts an amount pertaining to deemed hospitalization of all policy holders from a required amount of reserves for incurred but not reported cases and the amount of claim payments for all the fiscal years, as set forth in the main rules in Article 1, Paragraph 1 of IBNR Notification, and then calculates in the same manner as in the main rules in Article 1, Paragraph 1 of IBNR Notification.\n\nAs of the end of the previous fiscal year, the company deducted an amount pertaining to deemed hospitalization of policy holders other than those with high risk of severity, however, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, the payment of hospitalization benefits with respect to \"deemed hospitalization\" was terminated. Therefore, the company has revised its calculation method to deducting the amount pertaining to deemed hospitalization of all policy holders.\n\n## 1 11 11 7 77 77 . ....

With this strategy, the Company holds fixed income investments, including bonds and loans, as the core of its asset portfolio. While placing its financial soundness first, the Company also holds stocks and foreign securities within its tolerable risk to enhance its profitability and facilitate diversification of investment risks.\n\nThe Company uses derivatives primarily to hedge market risks associated with its existing asset portfolio and supplement its investment objectives to the extent necessary, taking into account the exposure of underlying assets.\n\nWith respect to financing, the Company has raised capital directly from the capital markets by issuing subordinated bonds as well as indirectly from banks in order to strengthen its capital base. To avoid impact from interest-rate fluctuations, the Company utilizes derivative transactions in hedging some of such financial liabilities and adopts hedge accounting.\n\n## b) Financial Instruments Used and Their Risks\n\nSecurities included in financial assets of the Company, mainly stocks and bonds, are categorized by its investment objectives such as held-to-maturity, policy-reserve-matching securities and available-for-sale securities.Thosesecurities are exposed to market fluctuation risk,credit risk and interest rate risk and some of the securities denominated in foreign currency are exposed to foreign currency risk. Also, loans are exposedtocredit risk arising from the defaults of obligors.\n\nThe Company might be exposed to liquidity risk in certain circumstances in which it cannot make timely payments of principal, interest or other amounts due to unpredictable cash outflows or is forced to raisecapital with interest rates substantially higher than usual. Also, some of its loans payable and bonds payable which are floating interest rate based and denominated in foreign currency are exposed to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.\n\nThe Company utilizes i) interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk associated with certain loans receivable and payable, ii) equity forward contracts to hedge market fluctuation risks associated with certain domestic stocks, and iii) foreign currency forward contracts,currency options and foreign currencyswaps to hedge foreign currency risks associated with certain foreign currency-denominated bonds, foreign currency-denominated short-term deposits and foreign currency-denominated debts, etc. and adopt hedge accounting.\n\nIn addition, the Company utilizes iv) interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk associated with certain insurance liabilities, under the \"Accounting and Auditing Treatment of Application of Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments to Insurance Operators\" (Industry-specific Committee Practical Guidelines No. 26 issued by JICPA).\n\nIn applying the hedge accounting, in order to fulfill requirements stipulated in the \"Accounting standards for financial instruments\" (ASBJ Statement No. 10 issued on March 10, 2008), the Company has established investment policy and procedure guidelines and clarified the transactions to be hedged, the risk of underlying assets to be hedged and derivative instruments to be used, and conducted pre- and post-effectiveness tests of the transactions.\n\n## c) Risk Management\n\nThe risk management system of the Company is as follows:\n\n## i) Market Risk Management\n\nUnder the internal investment policy and market risk management policy, the Company manages market risk by conducting mid- to long-term asset allocation in a manner appropriate to its liabilities.Therefore, it categorizes its portfolio into sub-groups, based on their investment purpose, and manages them taking into account each of their risk characteristics.\n\n## (a) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company keeps track of interest rates and durations of its assets and liabilities, monitors its internal analyses on duration gap and interest rate sensitivity, and periodically reports its findings to the board of directors, etc.\n\n## (b) Currency risk\n\nThe Company keeps track of currencycomposition of its financial assets and liabilities,conducts sensitivity analyses, and periodically reports its findings to the board of directors, etc.\n\n## (c)Fluctuation in market values\n\nThe Company defines risk management policies and management procedures for eachcomponent of its overall portfolio, including securities, based on the riskcharacteristics of the categories,sets and manages upper limits of each asset balance and asset allocation weight.\n\nSuch management conditions are periodically reported by its risk management sections to the board of directors,\n\n## etc.\n\n## (d) Derivative transactions\n\nFor derivative transactions, the Company has established internal checksystem by segregating i) executing department, ii) the department which engages in assessment of hedge effectiveness, and iii) the back-office. Additionally, in order to limit speculative use of derivatives, the Company has put restrictions on utilization purpose, such as hedging, and establishes position limits for each asset class.\n\n## ii) Credit Risk Management\n\nIn accordance with the internal investment policy and credit risk management procedure guidelines, the Company has established a credit management system related to loans,such as preliminary reviews on individual transactions,\n\ncredit limit setting, credit information management, internal credit rating, attachment of guarantees and collateral, and follow-ups on problem loans.For corporate bond investment, the credit section sets investment caps on individual issuers taking into account internal credit ratings and other factors. Excessive risk-taking is restricted since front offices make investment within thosecaps. Policies and framework for large-lot borrowers have been formulated in order to prevent credit concentration by monitoring compliance, etc.That credit management has been conducted by the credit and risk management sections, and has been periodically reported to the board of directors, etc. Additionally, the internal audit section has alsochecked credit management status.\n\nCredit risk of security issuers and counterparty risk with respect to derivative transactions are managed by the credit section, whichsets upper limits for eachcounterparty and financial instrument and periodically monitors credit information, and by the risk management section, which periodically monitors current exposures.\n\n## d) Supplementary Explanation for Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nAs the calculation of thosevalues adopts certain assumptions, thosevalues may vary in case different assumptions are applied.\n\n## (2) Fair Values of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount on the consolidated balancesheet, fair value and differences between carrying amount and fair value as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 were as follows.\n\n|                                       | As of March 31, 2023   | As of March 31, 2023   | As of March 31, 2023   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                       | Carrying amount        | Fair value             | Gains(Losses)          |\n|                                       | (Unit: million yen)    | (Unit: million yen)    | (Unit: million yen)    |\n| (1) Monetary claims bought            | 224,555                | 224,555                | -                      |\n| (2) Money held in trust               | 6,727                  | 6,727                  | -                      |\n| (3) Securities(*2) (*3)               |                        |                        |                        |\n| a.

Sincesignificant unobservable inputs are used for the price obtained, the fair value of monetary claims bought is classified into Level 3.\n\n## Money held in trust\n\nThe fair value of money held in trust is based on the price presented by counterparty financial institutions. Money held in trust is classified into either Level 1 or Level 2, mainly based on constituents held in trust.\n\n## Securities\n\nThe fair value of securities for which unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets are available is classified into Level\n\n- 1. These include stocks and government bonds, among others. If the market is not active, the fair value of securities is classified into Level 2, irrespective of whether disclosed quoted market prices are used.\n\nThe fair value of bonds for which quoted market prices are not used as fair value is measured mainly using prices obtained from outside contractors and counterparty financial institutions.The present value of these pricesiscalculated by discounting future cash flows at a discount rate (i.e., a risk-free interest rate that takes into account credit spread). The fair value of bonds is classified into Level 2 if observable inputs are usedinthecalculation, and Level 3 if significant unobservable\n\n## inputs are used.\n\nThe fair value of mutual funds without market prices is based on net asset value unless there is no significant restriction on cancellation. The fair value is classified into either Level 2 or Level 3, mainly based on constituents held in trust.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe fair value of loans is calculated by discounting future cash flows of the subject loan, using interest rates corresponding to the internal credit rating and remaining periods which are assumed to be applied to new loans to the subject borrower. Loans are classified into Level 3.\n\nAdditionally, for risk-monitored loans, reserve for possible loan lossesiscalculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows or the amount deemed recoverable from collateral and guarantees and the fair value is closetothecarrying amount on the consolidated balancesheet minus reserve for possible loan losses at the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, that amount (the carrying amount on the consolidated balancesheet minus reserve for possible loan losses) is recorded as fair value for risk-monitored loans and classified into Level 3.\n\nAlso, loans without a due date because of their characteristics that their exposure is limited to the amount of their collaterals, are deemed to have fair value close to book value, taking into account estimated repayment period and interest rates.Therefore, their book value is recorded as the fair value and classified into Level 3.\n\n## Liabilities\n\n## Bonds payable\n\nThe fair value of bonds payable for which quoted market prices can be used is based on the quoted market prices. Bonds payable are classified into Level 2.\n\n## Payables under repurchase agreements\n\nThe fair value of payables under repurchase agreements is calculated by discounting future cash flows at a discount rate using an interest rate based on the remaining maturity and is classified into Level 2.\n\nPayables under repurchase agreements with short repayment terms are deemed to haveafairvalue close to book value. Therefore, their book value is recorded as the fair value, and their fair value is classified into Level 2.\n\n## Long-term borrowings\n\nThe fair value of long-term borrowings is calculated by discounting future cash flows, using interest rates corresponding to the internal credit rating and remaining periods which are assumed to be applied to new borrowings. Long-term borrowings are classified into Level 3.\n\n## DerivativeTransactions\n\nThe fair value of listed derivative transactions for which unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets are available is classified into Level 1. These mainly include stock-related transactions and bond-related transactions. If the market is not active, the fair value of listed derivative transactions is classified into Level 2, irrespective of whether disclosed quoted market prices are used.\n\nThe fair value of over-the-counter derivative transactions is mainly based on the prices calculated using discounted present values obtained from outside contractors and counterparty financial institutions and option valuation models, etc.The inputs used in the valuation method for calculating the price of over-the-counter derivative transactions are mainly interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and volatility. Sincenosignificant unobservable inputs are used or their effects are not significant, the fair value of over-the-counter derivative transactions is classified into Level 2.",

To deepen understanding about the story of the Group ' s medium- to long-term value creation among all our stakeholders, we have issued an integrated report since FY2016, when we shifted to a holding company structure following our demutualization as a company limited. Based on the opinions of institutional investors and those involved in the capital markets, evaluations by external organizations, and guidelines set by the government and other organizations, we have made a series of improvements in order to communicate our ideas in an easier-to-understand manner.\n\nThere are two major points that we would like to emphasize. The first is about the value-creation process. In addition to the Group ' s newly formulated corporate philosophy, which coincides with the start of the new mid-term management plan, we have redefined ' Core Materiality ' as a key issue to be addressed by the Group on a priority basis and have reviewed the organizational structure to clarify the Group ' s Vision for FY2030 and the link to management strategies to achieve this vision.\n\nThe second point relates to Benefit One, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in May 2024. The process from the release of the TOB notice in December 2023 to the acquisition of the company as a wholly owned subsidiary involved a series of twists and turns, and in this year ' s integrated report, we asked the directors to talk about what went on behind the scenes of the deal, focusing on discussions at the board meetings, in the ' Roundtable Discussion by the Directors ' section. Also, as of the time of the publication of this report, we are amid conducting PMI, but I have asked Mr. Shiraishi, the president of Benefit One, to discuss his vision for the future toward the realization of synergies in the discussion section of the report. The contents of each of these sections are presented in their original form with minimal editing by the secretariat. We hope you will enjoy reading them.\n\nLastly, as the executive officer responsible for editing this report, I would like to state that the process used to prepare the integrated report is legitimate and the information contained in it is accurate. We will continue to use this report to deepen our understanding with as many of our stakeholders as possible through ongoing dialogue with them.\n\nWe will continue to consider the question of what information investors, shareholders and other stakeholders are seeking and what kind of expectations they have of us. We will strive to make further progress and improvements in the content of our disclosures. We appreciate your honest feedback and suggestions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability Data/Third-Party Warranty\n\nPlease visit our website for detailed sustainability data and third-party guarantees.\n\n## Sustainability data\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhttps://www.dai-ichi-life-hd.com/en/sustainability/data/index.htm\n\n## Third-party warranty\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7Japan Quality Assurance Organization https://www.dai-ichi-life-hd.com/en/sustainability/data/pdf/index\\_002.pdf\n\n\u00b7The Association for NFI-Assurance\n\nhttps://www.dai-ichi-life-hd.com/en/sustainability/data/pdf/index\\_003.pdf\n\n## Inquiries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Forward-Looking Statements\n\n## Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc.\n\nIR Group, Corporate Planning Unit, 13-1, Yurakucho 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-8411, Japan +81-(0)3-3216-1222 (representative)\n\nhttps://www.dai-ichi-life-hd.com/en/contact.html\n\nStatements contained herein that relate to the future operating performance of the Company are forward-looking statements.
