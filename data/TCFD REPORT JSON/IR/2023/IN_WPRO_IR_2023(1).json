Clients continued to prioritize digital transformation, leveraging AI to reduce costs, enhance operational efficiency, and drive future growth.'\n\n## Dear Stakeholders\n\nI hope this letter finds you well.\n\nBefore we dive into the financial updates, I'm delighted to welcome Srini Pallia, our new CEO and MD. Srini took over in April 2024, and we are all incredibly excited to have him on board. Under his leadership, we are in for a bright future together.\n\nFY24 has undoubtedly been one of the most challenging years in our Company's history. The global economic climate has been quite volatile, affecting the technology spends of our clients. These headwinds, however, have only strengthened our resolve. We remain committed to innovation and are dedicated to investing in our future.\n\nFor FY24, we reported revenue of $10.8 billion, a decrease of 4.4%, while net income stood at $1.3 billion. IT services operating margin for the year was at 16.1%, an expansion of 50 bps over FY23. Earnings per share for the year was at H 20.89 ($0.25), an 0.8% increase YoY. Our operating cash flow was the highest in recent years, H 176.2 billion ($2.1 billion), an increase of 34.9% YoY and at 159% of the net income for the year.\n\nDespite some short-term challenges, the fundamentals of our business remain unchanged. Clients continued to prioritise digital transformation, leveraging AI to reduce costs, enhance operational efficiency, and drive future growth. Despite subdued discretionary spending in the first half, we saw green shoots in our consulting business in the second half of the year, a positive early indicator.\n\nAs in the past years, we persisted in investing for our future. We took a majority share in Aggne, a leading consulting and managed services company, serving the insurance and insure tech industry. This strengthens our value proposition in a fast-growing part of the insurance vertical.\n\nOver the past year, there has been a dramatic shift in how businesses view AI, particularly Generative AI. From being a topic of curiosity, it is now a core component of long-term strategies for value creation. AI offers a unique opportunity to reshape industries, drive efficiencies, and unlock innovation, and we aim to be at the forefront of this transformation.",

Building on our decade-long investments, and with responsible AI the core of ai360, we are creating an end-to-end innovation ecosystem integrating AI into every platform, tool, and solution used both internally and with our clients.\n\nUnder this, we are investing in expanding our strategic partnerships with key players, such as AWS, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and NVIDIA and our own platforms through our innovation arm Lab45, as well as the Wipro Enterprise Generative AI (WeGA) studio.\n\nTalent development is an essential part of our AI strategy. We have partnered with leading universities like the Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Science to fuel research, strengthen the AI talent pipeline, and upskill our workforce in cuttingedge AI technologies. We have imparted training in basic GenAI fundamentals to over 225,000 employees, and 30,000 of them have received advanced training tailored to their specific roles.\n\nWe have actively deployed GenAI across internal processes driving hundreds of use cases. For example, WiNow, our AI-powered enterprise chatbot for self-service, is currently being used by nearly all our employees and has served about 6.5 million queries. On an average WiNow responds to employees in 6 seconds, significantly improving productivity in critical tasks like approvals and onboarding, as well as reducing cost to serve.\n\nWidespread AI adoption demands strong change management. Equipping our workforce to collaborate with AI through training and clear communication is crucial. This human-centered approach bridges the gap, builds trust and maximizes AI's potential.\n\nAt the core of our Company is the Spirit of Wipro, uniting our employees, clients, shareholders, partners, and communities. We abide by our cultural framework that embraces five key principles: leading with purpose, prioritizing associate wellbeing, sustaining communities, fostering inclusivity, and nurturing a mindset that propels us toward our ambitious goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are a responsible corporate citizen, on track to achieve our Net Zero goals by 2030, with a footprint of 76% renewable energy and a 80% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions as of March 31, 2024. We are helping our clients achieve similar goals through our sustainability solutions.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion is a core value across our Company and communities. We have increased women in senior leadership by 240%, reaching 18.7% in three years. Our initiatives to support our employees with disabilities and our LGBTQ+ employees have led to a significant increase in membership within our employee resource group.\n\nOur community initiatives reach 17 countries, supporting 225 projects in education, primary healthcare, digital skilling, and urban ecology, and have impacted 4.5 million people, including a significant proportion of vulnerable populations. The Wipro Foundation has empowered nearly 420,000 women in underserved communities, offering them gender and maternal care programs.\n\nOur achievements would not be possible without our dedicated employees. I thank you for your passion and commitment. I extend a heartfelt thanks to our shareholders. Your support and confidence in our vision have been instrumental, especially during these challenging times.\n\nAs we look ahead with optimism and determination, I am confident that our best days lie ahead. We will continue to innovate, inspire, and create value for all stakeholders, charting a course towards a more prosperous tomorrow.\n\nThank you.\n\nRishad A. Premji\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman",

It has been about two months since I assumed this role, and I am deeply humbled by the opportunity to lead the Company, where I began my career 32 years ago.\n\nSince taking over, I have connected with every facet of the organization, including clients, colleagues, and partners and gained valuable insights into their perspectives. This has led to a strategic plan that focuses on leveraging our Company's strengths to serve our clients better and embrace the ongoing advancements in AI, positioning us for renewed growth.\n\nThe past year presented significant challenges across our industry, impacting our performance as well. We were tested by a tough and volatile macroeconomic environment. But as they say, adversity reveals true strength and I am proud of the resilience we displayed. I am confident we will emerge even stronger.\n\nFor FY24, the Company reported gross revenue of $10.8 billion achieving an operating margin of 16.1%. I am pleased to share that we recorded large deal bookings with a total contract value (TCV) of $4.6 billion. This represents a 17.4% growth from the previous year. For the full year, the TCV reached $14.9 billion. Furthermore, we have not only boosted the revenue share from our top five and top ten clients but also welcomed three more clients into this 100 million plus dollar bracket.\n\nWe've consistently enhanced our expertise through significant investments in a domain-focused consultative approach for our engagements. Over the years, we have built a strong, global and diverse team. We have made bold moves in M&A, acquiring companies like Capco and Rizing, thereby boosting our consulting capabilities. We have also streamlined our operating model for greater efficiency. Continuous investments in talent and strategic acquisitions will fuel our growth as we move ahead.\n\nFor FY25, we have defined five key strategic areas designed to revitalize our Company. I am confident by rigorously executing these priorities, we will deliver tangible outcomes.\n\nWhile the core tenets of our strategy remain unchanged, we will continue to identify how we can build on these five priorities and adapt to accommodate technological shifts and market conditions.",

Strengthen relationships with large clients and partners, and invest early on the next set of accounts that have the potential to grow into large accounts.\n- 3.

Build talent at scale around industry solutions with an AI-first approach, ensuring that every associate is trained on specific industry and client context.\n- 5.   Drive client centricity and delivery excellence with execution rigor and speed.\n\nWe are at the threshold of a significant technological transformation, with clients across industries eager to harness the power of AI to reshape their businesses. At Wipro, we have been strategically preparing for this very moment. Last year, we launched Wipro ai360, a comprehensive, AI-first ecosystem backed by a significant investment. I am pleased to report that our strategy is unlocking significant business value for our clients and us. So far, we have trained over 225,000 associates on basic GenAI fundamentals and more than 30,000 associates on more advanced levels of AI based on roles and personas.\n\nWe also hold 470 AI patents, and our Lab45 AI platform is ready to use. Additionally, we have established robust guardrails to ensure compliance and safety for both us and our clients in our AI journey.\n\nCollaborating with our partners, we provide a suite of AI-powered industry solutions to enhance and expedite customer service, elevate patient care quality, customize content for sales effectiveness, optimize factory operations, recommend portfolio strategies, enable intelligent decision making, provide context-aware recommendations and conduct thorough anomaly and fraud detection. A few examples of this include:\n\n- 1. GenAI unlocks insights from unstructured data (notes, images, charts) and streamlines operations. Imagine AI-powered contact centres that improve\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nefficiency, reduce costs, and enhance service. Wipro's collaboration with Nvidia focuses on just that, using GenAI to streamline healthcare contact centres. This includes processing complex documents, optimizing call processing with real-time transcriptions, and integrating speech and translation for a truly holistic solution.\n\n- 2. Our GenAI solution, powered by Microsoft, empowers financial advisors and bankers with faster market and product intelligence. This translates to personalised client service and streamlined onboarding and loan origination processes, freeing up valuable time for human interaction.\n\nOur consulting led approach empowers clients to unlock value from AI, enabling them to achieve both short-term and long-term goals. As the benefits of AI - enhanced stakeholder experience, revenue insights, and cost optimization - become apparent, we anticipate a significant acceleration in this space.\n\nWe are investing in skill-building initiatives for a futureready workforce. This includes partnerships with leading universities like IISc for formal degree programs in AIrelated fields like our online MTech course. Our iAspire AI-based learning and development platform offers personalized learning journeys to our associates.\n\nWipro Ventures, our corporate investment arm, is actively investing in cutting edge startups. In May, we invested in Kognitos, which uses Gen AI to automate business processes and drive productivity across large transformation engagements.\n\nAs we enter a new era fueled by rapid technological progress, I am energized by the possibilities it presents for Wipro. Together, with our committed associates, we will leverage this momentum to unlock the next stage of growth. Our guiding light will be our clear vision, our defined priorities, commitment to our values, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. We will continue to invest in our people, process, and technology to deliver superior value to our clients and shareholders.\n\nI am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to working closely with all of you. Together, we will write the next chapter in Wipro's success story.\n\nThank you for your continued trust and support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Srini Pallia\n\nChief Executive Officer & Managing Director",

Digital transformation and infrastructure modernization continue to be a global priority, with a particular focus on cloud and cybersecurity. We expect that increased interest and adoption of technologies such as automation, intelligent applications, and AI including responsible AI, GenAI-enabled virtual assistants, Edge computing, 5G, and industrial IoT will create opportunities for the services industry.\n\nGlobal IT service providers are equipped to support enterprises across various industries to overcome the current challenges, with a wide range of offerings for digital transformation cutting across consulting, application development, maintenance and support, R&D, technology infrastructure and business process services. We expect the IT services industry to accelerate and drive decisions in fiscal year 2025 based on investments made by clients in key areas such as AI, GenAI implementation,\n\ncost optimization, operational excellence, digital transformation, vendor consolidation, productivity improvement, customer experience programs, innovation in products and services, talent management, future of workplace and workforce, and ESG initiatives.\n\nAccording to the NASSCOM Report, revenue for the Indian IT services' sector is expected to witness growth of 2% year-over-year in fiscal year 2024, led by infrastructure management and networking services in distributed environments, cloud-based software testing services, and consulting services. It is expected that there will be an increase in foundational spend across cloud, IT modernization, digital customer experience, and digital engineering projects.\n\nAccording to the NASSCOM Report, AI-related activities have witnessed a significant uptick with 2.7x growth in activities related to industry collaborations and partnerships, product/service launches and enterprise GenAI strategies. We expect that GenAI will be a key priority for IT service providers, with the legal and regulatory landscape expected to evolve rapidly, setting the stage for greater adoption in the second half of calendar year 2024 and into 2025. Governments across the world are expected to implement regulations which prioritize data protection, breach detection and containment, and responsible use of AI.",

        "page_content": "The NASSCOM Report estimates that the engineering services ('ER&D') will grow at 7.4% year-over-year. With digital imperatives and the resurgence of AI, ER&D maintains its concentration on digital engineering, leading to development of new products and service categories. Data analytics capabilities are enabling constant reinvention of services and aiding the launch of personalized products. Digital testing, virtual twins and increasing reliance on software and coding have led to reduced costs and accelerated timelines for R&D and entering the market.\n\nEnterprises continue to prioritize cost takeout and operational excellence initiatives, with spending expected to gradually improve in fiscal year 2025. Enterprises are also prioritizing sustainability and resilience, aiming to globalise their operations to take advantage of cost arbitrage, greater access to talent, and faster innovation. The Financial Services, Hi-Tech and Telecom sectors continue to be soft with the Healthcare and Automotive sectors being bright spots. Consumer goods and Manufacturing sector clients are investing cautiously due to cost takeouts and weak consumer spending.\n\nWe believe focus on ESG parameters is now a key business imperative driving innovation, efficiency and lowering risks. Enterprises expect providers to not only meet the global standards on ESG, but also help them make progress on their ESG goals across key focuses such as climate change, diversity and inclusion, corporate governance and cybersecurity.\n\n## IT Products\n\nAccording to the NASSCOM Report, the domestic market in India for hardware is estimated to be $17.7 billion in fiscal year 2024, compared to $17.4 billion in fiscal year 2023, and overall revenue for the hardware industry is expected to be $18.2 billion in fiscal year 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Overview\n\nCelebrating over 75 years of innovation, Wipro is a purpose-driven, global technology services and consulting firm with over 230,000 employees across six continents helping our customers, colleagues and communities thrive in an ever-changing world.\n\nWe are recognized globally for our strong commitment to sustainability.

Our goal is to fast-track capability building in emerging areas and accelerate our access and footprint in identified markets. With a strong post-merger integration focus, we are committed to driving synergies and effectively integrating acquisitions. In the last few years, we have closed several acquisitions in the US, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and India, including our acquisition of a majority equity interest in Aggne during the fiscal year 2024. These acquisitions have strengthened our local presence, enhanced our capabilities, and significantly improved our positioning in key markets and segments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It plays a pivotal role as a driver for value creation in the business.\n\nThe purpose of impact valuation is to identify the intended and unintended effects of business activities, across products and/or services, operations, and the supply chain. The process of accounting for positive and negative externalities systematically and thoroughly can help businesses make decisions that create value for all stakeholders - not just shareholders.\n\nAt Wipro, we have been calculating our Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) since 2016. Also referred to as Natural Capital Valuation, this exercise helps us assign a financial value to our natural capital. Building on this, last year, we also computed our Human Capital Valuation, which assesses the financial value of our impact on our employees, and our Social Capital Valuation, which evaluates the financial value of our influence on our communities.\n\n## Factors Considered for Impact Accounting:\n\n## Environmental Parameters\n\nIncludes GHG emissions, air pollution, water consumption, waste generation, water and land pollution, and land use change. This was done for our Company as well as our suppliers (Purchased Goods and Services).\n\n## Social Parameters\n\nIncludes labor practices, community engagement, human rights and health and safety.\n\n## Economic Parameters\n\nIncludes financial performance, economic impact and value chain analysis.\n\n## Wipro's Natural Capital Valuation Program\n\nNatural Capital Valuation is a rigorous framework that assesses and quantifies both positive and negative impacts on nature or natural capital on account of a company's operations and value chain. Natural Capital Impacts are calculated across the six key performance indicators (KPIs) that are part of Environmental factors. The methodology uses a value for the social cost of carbon that varies with country, sector, and geography. Typically, it uses a higher discount rate for developing countries as compared to developed countries, given that the former needs more 'ecological space' and time to fulfil their developmental imperatives.\n\n## Methodology\n\nTo calculate the impact of air pollution, only human health impacts were considered as they contribute to 95% of the total impact. Land use valuation is based on net change in economic value due to loss of ecosystem service and is calculated only for the electricity procured from the grid mix, since for direct operations, land use change is not considered to be material. For calculating the impact of water consumption, the impact on human health, the incidence of infectious diseases, and the impact of energy consumption were considered.\n\nIn FY24, total environmental costs of Wipro's operations and supply chain were quantified at $0.27 billion ($0.28 billion in FY23), of which operational and supply chain impacts contribute 3% ($8 million) and 97% ($262 million), respectively. Two main reasons contributed to the decrease in the valuation this year - consolidation of our suppliers and decreased business travel. Of the operational impacts, the highest contribution was from electricity consumption at 66% ($5 million). This has reduced significantly from last year ($9.3 million) due to the transition to RE. Within Wipro's upstream supply chain, purchased goods and services across all tiers of suppliers (85%; $230 million) and fuel and energy-related activities (5%; $14 million) are the top two impact categories. In terms of the sources of impact, air pollution (66%; $180 million) and GHG emissions (19%; $51 million) are the top two contributors. The source of air pollution is primarily during flight landing and take-off and employee commute.",

        "page_content": "Revenue: Our revenue decreased by 1.25%.\n\nOur IT Services segment revenue decreased by 1.05%. The decline was largely due to challenges in the macroeconomic environment and the resulting impact on customers' discretionary spending and lower foreign exchange gains during the year ended March 31, 2024. During fiscal 2024, the revenue for Americas 1 grew, while revenue from all other SMUs declined.\n\nRevenue of the IT Products segment declined by 31.75%, which was primarily due to our focus on providing IT products as a complement to our IT services offerings, rather than selling standalone IT products and our adoption of a more selective approach in bidding for system integration engagements.\n\nCost of Revenues: In absolute terms, cost of revenues decreased by 2.16%, primarily due to a decrease in sub-contracting costs as a percentage of IT Services revenue from 12.50% for the year ended March 31, 2023 to 11.32% for the year ended March 31, 2024 and enhanced operational efficiencies, and a decrease in the depreciation charge for our property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets. Further improvement in key operational parameters, such as utilization rates for our employees and higher offshoring also contributed to the decrease in cost of revenues. These decreases have been partially offset by an increase in employee compensation due to the impact of salary increases and the employee restructuring, and an increase in facility expenses as an increased number of employees return to office.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our gross profit as a percentage of our total revenue increased by 65 basis points (' bps ').\n\nSelling and Marketing Expenses: Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased from 7.17% for the year ended March 31, 2023 to 7.79% for the year ended March 31, 2024. In absolute terms, selling and marketing expenses increased by 7.39% primarily because of the increase in employee compensation due to the impact of salary increases and the employee restructuring. Amortization of intangibles during the year ended March 31, 2024 increased due to a change in our useful life estimate for customer-related intangibles in an earlier business combination, which was partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles due to their useful life ending in fiscal year 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses: Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 6.50% for the year ended March 31, 2023 to 6.72% for the year ended March 31, 2024. In absolute terms, general and administrative expenses increased by 2.09%, primarily due to the increase in employee compensation due to the impact of salary increases, one-time costs related to outgoing CEO and employee restructuring, an increase in lifetime expected credit loss, and an increase in travel expenses. These increases have been partially offset by the gain on sale of immovable property and the decrease in staff recruitment fees due to a lower number of employees hired during the year ended March 31, 2024.\n\nOperating income: As a result of the foregoing factors, our operating income decreased by 2.51%, from C 139,606 million for the year ended March 31, 2023 to C 136,099 million for the year ended March 31, 2024, and our results from operating activities as a percentage of revenue (operating margin) decreased by 19 bps from 15.35% to 15.16%.\n\nFinance Expenses: Our finance expenses increased from C 10,077 million for the year ended March 31, 2023 to C 12,552 million for the year ended March 31, 2024. The increase in interest rates and incremental borrowings during the year ended March 31, 2024 primarily resulted in higher finance expense.\n\nFinance and Other Income: Our finance and other income increased from C 18,185 million for the year ended March 31, 2023 to C 23,896 million for the year ended March 31, 2024. The increase is primarily due to an increase in net gain from investments by C 3,122 million and an increase in interest income by C 2,589 million during the year ended March 31, 2024 compared to the year ended March 31, 2023.\n\nIncome Taxes: Our income taxes increased by C 2,097 million from C 33,992 million for the year ended March 31, 2023 to C 36,089 million for the year ended March 31, 2024. Our effective tax rate has increased from 23.02% for the year ended March 31, 2023 to 24.52% for the year ended March 31, 2024. This increase is primarily due to a reduction in tax benefits in India for the year ended March 31, 2024.\n\nProfit Attributable to Equity Holders: As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit attributable to equity holders decreased by C 3,048 million or 2.69%, from C 113,500 million for the year ended March 31, 2023 to C 110,452 million for the year ended March 31, 2024.",

During fiscal 2024, the revenue for Americas 1 grew, while revenue from all other SMUs declined.\n\nOur gross profit as a percentage of our revenue from our IT Services segment increased by 95 bps, primarily due to decrease in sub-contracting costs as a percentage of IT Services revenue from 12.50% for the year ended March 31, 2023 to 11.32% for the year ended March 31, 2024 and enhanced operational efficiencies, and a decrease in the depreciation charge for our property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets of C 1,388 million. Further improvement in key operational parameters, such as utilization rates for our employees and higher offshoring also contributed to a decline in cost of revenues. These decreases have been partially offset by an increase in employee compensation due to the impact of salary increases, and an increase in facility expenses of C 1,294 million as an increased number of employees return to office.\n\n- (1) For the purpose of segment reporting, we have included the impact of exchange rate fluctuations gains/(losses), net amounting to C 4,472 million and C 340 million for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, in revenue.\n\nSelling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue from our IT Services segment increased from 7.14% for the year ended March 31, 2023 to 7.65% for the year ended March 31, 2024. In absolute terms, selling and marketing expenses increased by C 3,876 million primarily because of the increase in employee compensation of C 3,455 million due to the impact of salary increases. Amortization of intangibles increased by C 2,807 million during the year ended March 31, 2024, due to a change in our useful life estimate of customer-related intangibles in an earlier business combination, which was partially offset by the lower amortization of intangibles by C 1,391 million due to their useful life ending in fiscal year 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To utilize these lines of credit, we require the consent of the lender and compliance with certain financial covenants.

Further, income taxes paid, net of refund decreased by C 14,858 million during the year ended March 31, 2024.\n\nCash generated from investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2024 was C 11,680 million. Cash is primarily generated from interest received amounting to C 20,111 million, sale of property, plant and equipment amounting to C 4,022 million and sale of investments (net of purchase) amounting to C 3,529 million. We also purchased property, plant and equipment amounting to C 10,510 million, which was primarily driven by the growth strategy of the Company. This was partially offset by outflow of C 5,291 million for business acquisitions consummated during the year ended March 31, 2024.",

This is primarily on account of outflow for an equity share buyback (including tax on buyback and transactions costs related to buyback) amounting to C 145,173 million, payment of dividend of C 5,218 million, payment of lease liabilities of C 10,060 million, interest and finance expenses of C 10,456 million and net outflow on repayment of loans and borrowings of C 10,057 million.\n\nWe maintain a debt/borrowing level that we have established through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations, cash required for operations and investment plans. We continually monitor our funding requirements, and strategies are executed to maintain sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources, as needed.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had contractual commitments of C 10,322 million ($123.85 million) related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of software development facilities and C 35,438 million ($425.22 million) related to other purchase obligations. Plans to construct or expand our software development facilities are determined by our business requirements.\n\nAs discussed above, cash generated from operations is our primary source of liquidity. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents along with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements as well as repayment obligations with\n\nrespect to debt and borrowings. Our choices of sources of funding will be driven with the objective of maintaining an optimal capital structure.\n\nWe will rely on funds generated from operations and external debt to fund potential acquisitions. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, investments in shortterm mutual funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from our operations in the future will generally be sufficient to fund the growth aspirations, as applicable.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we transfer certain accounts receivables, unbilled receivables and net investment in finance lease (financial assets) to banks on a non-recourse basis. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2024 is not material.\n\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our businesses and some of which arise from uncertainties related to global economies and the markets that we target for our services.

The management of the environmental and social impact of the supply chain is tied to long-term economic results. Effective management is crucial as it can aid businesses in navigating disruptions, adapting to evolving customer and business partner needs, promoting innovation, and safeguarding the Company's reputation and brand value. Furthermore, it helps businesses achieve their objectives of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and resilience in the supply chain.\n\nAt Wipro, we recognize that our sustainable journey is intertwined with that of our suppliers and they plan an active role in us achieving our Net Zero goals. Therefore, we collaborate closely with our supply chain partners to advance our shared goals of sustainability.\n\nDue to the complex nature of the supply chain, managing and regulating the intricacies of its impacts can be challenging. Our supply chain management program is shaped by our comprehension of these numerous factors and the challenges.\n\n## Management Approach\n\nThe responsibility of our managing procurement-related activities rests with multiple functions within our Company, with Procurement, Facilities, and Delivery, being some of them. The goal of the Procurement team is to provide high-quality products and services on a timely basis, consistent with organizational objectives and policies, and maintain the highest ethical standards. The responsibility is divided among multiple buyer groups who handle different procurement categories. The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team works closely with the Procurement team to identify and proactively manage risks in the supply chain.\n\n## Policy and Guiding Principles\n\nWe have a Global Procurement Policy that details the principles that the Global Procurement Group is expected to adhere to and also covers other aspects of procurement like supplier selection, and supplier diversity. Our supply chain governance program is informed by four guiding principles.",

        "page_content": "## Understanding the Socio-Economic Context\n\nWhile ambitious policies and Codes of Conduct are essential, it is also important to consider the complex socio-economic realities in which they are operationalized. We have built systems and processes to ensure adherence to leading procurement practices, including the assurance of human rights, corruption-free business practices, and transparent processes while prioritising environmentally sustainable business operations. Before onboarding suppliers, we conduct a thorough examination of their regulatory and financial information. We utilize a thirdparty screening tool (Refinitiv) to check for adverse media reports, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations and Politically Exposed Personnel. Vendors registering online are expected to provide declarations on Wipro's Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, and Modern Slavery Policy. For vendors providing services in identified sensitive sectors and geographies, we conduct an intensive due diligence process, while those with adverse media reports undergo a stringent internal review before determining the potential engagement.\n\n## Ability to Monitor, Influence, and Control\n\nThe 'secondary supply chain' extends across multiple tiers, and due to the complexities, claiming compliance across all tiers is impractical. Visibility is often limited to the first one or two tiers. For non-critical supply chain entities, where suppliers are not a core part of our business or where our spending has minimal impact on their revenue or market share, we have a limited ability to drive positive change. In this case, industry bodies and large government procurement programs play a larger role in influencing change.\n\n## Regulatory Compliance\n\nWe follow a Vendor Risk Assessment policy, managed by the Vendor Risk Assessment (VRA) team, to align information security assessments of critical suppliers/ vendors with applicable policies, procedures, standards, and baselines. A security questionnaire, based on industry frameworks like ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53, is used to evaluate vendor security controls. Assessment reports, approved by relevant stakeholders, highlight non-conformances and observations. These observations are tracked and addressed to achieve effective closure. Comprehensive audits are conducted to assess labor practices such as working hours, child labor, and workplace safety.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Integrating Best Practices in Supply Chain Engagement\n\nManaging supply chain externalities is crucial due to the complexities in the supply chain and the resultant risks. Customers and investors consider compliance levels and ethics as key differentiators in their decision-making process. Industry forums like the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, and EcoVadis, constantly strive to implement change in ethical and responsible business practices across global supply chains. Industry ratings such as S&P Global CSA (formally known as DJSI), Eco Vadis and CDP are increasingly focusing on the supply chain performance of organizations. We aim to adopt and integrate best practices from all these sources to drive sustainability in our supply chain.\n\nWipro is the first India-based company to join the CDP supply chain program. Through this platform, we engaged with 200+ of our top carbon intensive suppliers and encouraged the measurement and disclosure of their environmental data.\n\n## Pillars of our Supplier Sustainability Program\n\nBased on our understanding of risks in our supply chain, our supply-chain approach is based on the 3E principle: Ethical procurement practices, Equitable and open to diversity, and Ecological sustainability.\n\n## Ethical\n\nWe expect our partners to adhere to ethical procurement practices in accordance with Wipro's core values, the Code of Business Conduct (CoBC), Spirit of Wipro Values, and Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC). We use systemenabled database checks for vendors across geographies, third-party tools for monthly labor compliance tracking in certain regions, and category-specific credit scoring of suppliers. Annual sessions on anti-bribery and anticorruption are conducted to identify high-risk geographies and social compliance programs for manpower services providers.",

This is paramount to us as it enables us to create equitable opportunity for all our users, especially for persons with disability. At present, we have a voluntary declaration provision for suppliers to illustrate how their products or services are accessible to all users with different abilities.\n\nIn FY24, our supplier diversity initiatives enabled us to register 14.06% of our global spend with certified diverse suppliers and 5.67% of our global spend with MSME suppliers. Our target is to achieve global diverse spend of over 15% by 2025.\n\n## Ecological\n\nWe expect suppliers to establish an ecological sustainability program in their operations, and supply products and services that exceed environmental standards. At Wipro, we are committed to promoting environment-friendly practices across all aspects of our operations, including the procurement of materials and services for cleaning, cooling, landscaping, and safety practices.\n\n## Case Study\n\nFor seven years, Wipro has been consistently recognized with the EPEAT (Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool) Purchaser Award that celebrates leaders in sustainable electronics procurement. We have also been awarded a 5-STAR EPEAT rating since 2022, by the Global Electronics Council (GEC), the non-profit organization that manages the EPEAT ecolabel. EPEAT allows our Company to efficiently address the lifecycle impacts of the electronics we purchase. The categories covered in the 5-STAR rating are Computers and Displays, Imaging Equipment, Television, Mobile Phones, and Servers (Television has been added as a new category).\n\nThe procurement of EPEAT-certified products in 2022 was estimated to lead to a GHG reduction of 9,372 tons CO 2 equivalent, 36,142 MWh of energy savings and 53.4 million liters of water over the lifetime of products. We will receive the assessment report for 2023 in July 2024.\n\n## Program Highlights\n\n## Social Audit Program\n\nVendor compliance audit is carried out monthly to monitor their compliance with labor practices. The audit process plays a crucial role in identifying gaps and assessing the readiness of compliance requirements, as per Statespecific regulatory requirements. Third-party audit tools are used for the monthly compliance check.\n\nThrough a strategic partnership with DASRA, a philanthropic foundation, and the Social Compact platform, we aim to enhance the social and wellbeing practices within our supplier network. The Social Compact platform focuses on six areas of informal labor procedures: wages, health, access to entitlements, safety for all genders, and the future of work. Tier 1 and Tier 2 vendors who provide on-site services such as security and housekeeping were assessed based on these critical topics. The assessment results are reviewed by our Board, with the goal of creating a favorable workplace that exceeds compliance standards for all employees and contract workers.\n\n## Diversity Program\n\nAligned with the certified norms of diversity, Wipro has instituted two flagship programs for new as well as existing suppliers, the 'Wipro Inclusion & Diversity Opportunity for Vendors (WINDOV)' series of virtual conclaves that enable direct access for small suppliers to present their capabilities to the global procurement team and the 'Wipro Inclusive Supplier Development and Mentorship (WISDOM)' program to strengthen these businesses by providing management and technical support to the participating suppliers. WINDOV Conclaves have enabled us to source goods from remotely located Indian tribal women and American businesses located in Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUB) zones. WISDOM interactions have helped us identify the addressable barriers to increase our spend with existing Wipro diverse suppliers.",

Based on the disclosed emission allocations to Wipro, we carried out one-on-one discussions with a few suppliers to understand their methodology and approach towards reporting emissions data on the platform. This year we aim to reach out to over 200 suppliers and engage with them to ensure greater participation.\n\n## Supply Chain Transparency\n\nWe rely on complex global supply chains, which can be challenging to monitor and ensure responsible sourcing practices. The extraction of raw materials for electronics, such as rare earth metals, can have significant environmental impacts, including habitat destruction and water pollution.\n\n## Packaging Waste\n\nThe packaging used for shipping IT equipment and components can generate substantial amounts of waste. Excessive packaging materials, such as plastic and foam, contribute to pollution and waste management challenges.\n\n## Carbon Footprint\n\nTransportation of goods and services within the supply chain expands the carbon footprint of IT services companies. This includes the transportation of raw materials, components, and finished products. Longdistance shipping and air freight can have particularly high carbon emissions.\n\n## Navigating Challenges\n\nThe key challenges we face with vendors include a lack of awareness regarding labor compliance, the need to reassign tasks frequently due to changes in the vendor's Single Point of Contacts (SPOCs), and the delayed resolution of non-compliance issues. These issues can be addressed by streamlining communication and enhancing awareness among vendors to expedite the resolution of non-compliance issues.\n\n## The Path Ahead\n\n## Wipro Initiative for Supplier Engagement (WISE)\n\nWe launched a pilot program to collaborate with suppliers to make progress in our Net Zero journey. This engagement involves regular capacity-building sessions on topics like Net Zero and greenhouse gas accounting, tailored to specific categories. Data collection will be facilitated through circulated questionnaires and instructions. The program will begin and end with an assessment of sustainability maturity, and the path to higher maturity levels will be outlined based on the required capacity building. For the current year's engagement, we have refined our selection and shortlisted around 50 of our strategic suppliers to work with on a sustained engagement program to measure, attribute and manage emissions.\n\n## Sustainable Procurement\n\nOur Green Building program follows an integrated approach across design, engineering services, materials and equipment procurement that meets stringent environmental criteria, at the construction and the operational stages. In addition, we continue to procure Renewable Energy (RE) through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) from RE generators across three states in India. In the previous reporting year, we completed an assessment of RE generators in two states based on the principles of the 'Responsible Energy Initiative' set up by Forum for the Future. This assessment covers the various social and environmental aspects of the setup and the maintenance of power plants as well as its impact on local communities. We also annually assess our electronic waste recyclers to ensure they adhere to the recycling standards.\n\nFY25 is specially marked for Women-owned enterprise inclusion with specific program drives.\n\nWe are the first major Indian business to join EV100, a global initiative by the Climate Group, in our commitment to transition our global fleet to Electric Vehicles (EVs) by 2030.\n\nRE purchase contributed to approximately 148 million kWh or 76% of our total India energy consumption.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The new buildings also use rotary UPS instead of UPS batteries, eliminating the environmental impact associated with battery manufacturing and disposal.\n\nFor our older campuses, we have implemented various measures to improve energy efficiency:\n\n- \u00b7 Retrofit technologies to improve Chiller and Air Handling Units (AHUs)\n- \u00b7 UPS optimization\n- \u00b7 Integrated design, bringing together the architectural concept, building physics, envelope design, MEP design etc. to achieve energy efficiency\n- \u00b7 Monitoring platforms, such as the Global Energy Command Centre (GECC)\n\nOur GECC platform integrates Building Management System (BMS) inputs on a common platform to optimize operational control and improve energy efficiency. It 'integrates for optimization' every energy-consuming system within Wipro facilities across India. The platform connects to individual IoT-enabled devices and sensors that are capable of running subsystems optimally and uses the data for deep analytics to ensure the systems function true to the efficiency curves stated by the manufacturer.\n\nAny deviation is tracked and rectified with in-house or Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) support. Key Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) are tied to outcomes in terms of energy efficiency and system availability.\n\nApproximately 15.2 million sq ft across India are connected to the BMS, contributing to 68% of total office space. As of date, 4.6 million units per annum of electricity have been saved on a cumulative basis since FY18, with a net resultant savings of H 38.6 million per annum.\n\nWe have adopted ISO 50001 EMS across our campuses. Three campuses (Kodathi, Chennai, and Sarjapur 2) received certifications in August 2022, accounting for 35% of the total operational office space.",

However, we plan to analyze the issue in-depth and try to maximize the footprint of clean energy to the extent possible at the leased facilities most material to us.\n\nA fundamental principle we are committed to for all our RE procurement is to ensure that its upstream environmental and social footprint is minimal. We are part of the Renewable Energy Initiative (REI) led by the Forum for the Future. The initiative aims to create awareness regarding the possible social impacts of setting up RE plants and to adopt business models and value chains with justice, equity, universal rights and resilient ecological systems at their core.\n\n## GHG Emissions\n\nAddressing GHG Emissions is a critical component of our sustainability strategy. We use the methodologies outlined in the GHG Protocol as a guide to measure and track our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Being one of the first 7 companies to get their targets approved by the ScienceBased Targets Initiative (SBTi), our journey towards Net Zero began very early. Our strategy for reducing our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions has been primarily decarbonization - reducing or eliminating the amount of greenhouse gases from our operations. Our decarbonization strategy is centered on two key pillars: transitioning to renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency. To achieve this, we have focused on improving the measurement of our Scope 3 baseline emissions and establishing processes to mitigate emissions. Our mitigation efforts involve integrating sustainable practices into our business operations to achieve long-term results.\n\n29",

        "page_content": "## Scope 3 Emissions (percentage basis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scope 3 Mitigation Plan\n\nThe overall GHG emissions across all categories of Scope 3 amounted to 172,188 tons. The main contributors are Upstream Fuel and Energy (31.27%), Purchased Goods and Services (19.73%), Business Travel (21.04%) and Employee Commute (15.19%).\n\nWe have been working consistently to calibrate and improve the measurement of our GHG emissions from Scope 3 categories, to mitigate them. While this is a challenging task, it is crucial to meet our goals, considering that more than 80% of our GHG emissions are from Scope 3. Each category warrants a different mitigation strategy and we have highlighted plans for 3 of our top contributing categories.\n\n## Upstream Fuel and Energy Emissions\n\nOur transition to renewable energy brings down this number substantially. We are also exploring the possibility of in-house renewable energy production to reduce transportation and distribution costs further. However, the feasibility of installing large-scale units within the campus needs to be evaluated.\n\n## Business Travel\n\nPost-pandemic, business travel took time to recover. However, the first half of FY24 saw a spike in business travel which moderated down in the second half, driven by internal cost-efficiency targets. With this new normal, new strategies need to be instituted to achieve a reduction in high-carbon travel. We are looking to address this through:\n\n- \u00b7 Alternate modes of travel, such as trains and buses, wherever possible, especially in specific regions in India and the EU\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Employee awareness programs and incentives\n- \u00b7 Focused awareness building in our top delivery accounts to promote voluntary low-carbon travel choices\n\n## Employee Commute\n\nWith people returning to work, GHG emissions from employee commutes saw a concomitant increase. Our multi-pronged approach to address this includes the more conscious adoption of low-footprint choices such as buses, trains, and carpooling. We were the first major Indian business to join EV100, a global initiative by the Climate Group to promote electric mobility. Our commitment is to transition our entire global fleet (not including employee-owned vehicles) to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Currently, we have formal EV contracts in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Kochi. Notably, our Kochi campus has already achieved 100% EV deployment. Combined EV and CNG commuting accounts for nearly 43% of the total commuted distance by our owned fleet. However, employee private transport forms a significant portion of our emissions. We are exploring the option of employee incentives and tying up with public transport providers to address this issue.\n\n## Purchased Goods and Services\n\nWe collaborate with suppliers committed to sustainability across their value chain. Our engagement includes working with hardware procurement and indirect services suppliers to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions among other environmental and social commitments. Our 'Supplier Code of Conduct' mandates these efforts. We have received the prestigious EPEAT award for excellence in sustainable technology procurement 7 times consecutively and a 5-star rating for the third time. We actively engage with our suppliers through the CDP supply chain platform, making us the first India-based company to formally and actively use the platform. Additionally, we launched the Wipro Initiative for Supplier Engagement (WISE) program to engage with our suppliers on measuring emissions as well as setting targets for reduction. Read more in the 'Supplier Synergies' section on page 60.\n\nWe consistently monitor our upstream assets and fuel emissions, while establishing benchmarks and setting targets. This is achieved through regular energy audits and performance reviews of these sites. We are also making significant strides in minimizing our waste generation and associated emissions.

We are working towards achieving more granularity and accuracy in our measurement of Scope 3 emissions of the Purchased Goods and Services, Business Travel and Employee Commute categories. As our office occupancy and travel numbers steadily increase, it becomes imperative that we introduce new processes and policies to lead to lower emission levels. To decarbonize our supply chain, we follow an inside-out approach to set the right processes and policies.\n\n## Water Stewardship\n\nAt Wipro, we have adopted an integrated water management approach at our facilities. This includes water conservation, re-use of treated water and rainwater harvesting to minimize the amount of freshwater usage in our operations. In addition, we consider urban water as a boundaryless issue and extend our work to focus on urban water management at the community and city levels.\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 To improve the efficiency of freshwater use by 60% in all owned facilities, aiming for a year-on-year improvement of 10% in water efficiency per employee on a compounded basis\n- \u00b7 Increase the proportion of recycled water to 60% by FY30, with an interim target of 50% by FY26\n- \u00b7 Achieve zero discharge\n\nAdditionally, we are committed to contributing to a deeper understanding of the systemic challenges of urban water management in the major cities in India where we operate.\n\n## PERFORMANCE AGAINST TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 20% reduction in water intensity from around 150 lts/pax/day to 120 lts/pax/day\n- \u00b7 Reused/treated water forms 35% of our total water consumption\n\n## Program Highlights\n\n## Water Consumption\n\nOur freshwater use involves water drawn from four sources: private water, municipal water, in-situ groundwater, and third-party purchases. Private water and municipal water account for nearly 94% of our total water consumption. Water purchased from private sources is primarily extracted from groundwater. The water supplied by municipal bodies is primarily sourced from river or lake systems. In-situ groundwater contributes to nearly 4% of our total freshwater consumption across cities in India. Apart from this, we are also sourcing water from our industry associations producing water as their by-product, forming around 2% of our total water consumption. We are also focused on harvesting rainwater to reduce our reliance on conventional freshwater sources and promote a more sustainable future.\n\n## Water drawn from different sources during the reporting year FY24\n\n| Privately  Sourced   | Municipal  Utility   | In-situ  Ground Water   | Industrial   Associations   | 3rd Party  Purchase of  treated water   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| 440.63               | 533.56               | 37.75                   | 21.08                       | 0.80                                    |\n| 43%                  | 52%                  | 4%                      | 2%                          | ~0%                                     |\n\n## Water E/fficiency\n\nWe are focused on reducing our per capita water consumption through recycling and reuse, while also raising awareness among our employees about responsible water usage. Our per capita water consumption came down by around 20% YoY from 150 ltr/pax/day in FY23 to 120 ltr/pax/day in FY24. All our consumption and discharge points are metered, and all our new facilities have a smart metering system where the data is collected directly into our BMS. Water audits are conducted regularly, and water balance sheets give us an indication of our water usage as well as efficiency.\n\n## Wastewater Treatment and Reuse\n\nRecycled water consists of water treated at in-house Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and harvested rainwater. In FY24, 566.34KL of water was recycled. We have stateof-the-art sewage treatment facilities that enable us to use the treated water effectively. Some treatment plants are equipped with nanofiltration to obtain good-quality water for our HVAC chillers. All our consumed water gets treated, and all our treated water gets reused.",

All our campuses have rainwater harvesting systems and the water is either stored and used or is sent to the ground through recharge wells. In FY24, we commissioned a 2,000KL rainwater harvesting project at the Chennai campus, reinforcing our commitment towards overall environmental sustainability.\n\n## Navigating Challenges and the Way Ahead\n\nAs occupancy increases, there will be an increase in water use. With climate change impacting monsoons, it becomes challenging to ensure there is no water scarcity on our campuses. Procurement of treated water is an important step in this context but has challenges like practical availability of transport infrastructure and consistency of quality. However, we are exploring partnerships with organizations to procure treated water for our campuses to offset the use of freshwater.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nWipro is known for its unique and vibrant biodiversity. Our campus urban biodiversity program has two primary goals: (a) transforming our campus into biodiversity zones and, (b) using them as platforms for education and advocacy, both within and outside the organization. The program offers a wide range of benefits, including water conservation, ambient temperature reduction, air pollution mitigation and enhanced employee engagement. Our first campus biodiversity program was a Butterfly Park in 2013, in Bengaluru. The park witnesses hundreds of migratory butterflies every year. Since then, we have expanded our efforts. In 2019, we completed two major projects: a Wetland Park in Bengaluru, and a multithematic biodiversity project in Pune. Currently, we are developing a unique 40-acre reserve in Hyderabad dedicated to the endemic species of Eastern Ghats, with a focus on ex-situ conservation - a method for preserving threatened species and maintaining genetic diversity.\n\n## Waste Management\n\nAt Wipro, waste is seen not so much as a problem but an opportunity to pave a path into the circular ecosystem. Combining a well-thought-out strategy and steady commitment, we are transforming waste into valuable resources while minimizing our environmental footprint.\n\n## Our Waste Management Strategy\n\n- \u00b7 We regularly monitor air, water, and noise pollution to ensure they are well within regulatory and industry norms. We also monitor closely the waste generated and disposed of\n- \u00b7 We are committed to reducing materials impact on the environment through recycling and reuse\n- \u00b7 We arrange for the safe disposal of waste that goes outside our organizational boundaries. To operationalize our strategy, we segregate and monitor waste processing across 8 broad categories and 45 subcategories.",

Employees are encouraged to segregate waste into different categories at the source to streamline disposal and treatment. The total weight of waste generated is 5,913 metric tons (including waste from construction and demolition), which is an increase of 1,352 metric tons compared to the previous year. This could be due to increased occupancy levels over the past year. Of this, 5,559 metric tons were disposed as of March 31, 2024.\n\n## Monitoring, Tracking and Reporting\n\nOur proactive approach to waste management ensures compliance and sustainability. Regular inspections and audits, independent consultation and digital tracking help to identify and address any case of non-compliance. From meticulous documentation related to waste generation, segregation, collection, and disposal to vendor vetting, we maintain a robust record system to track waste data and generate reports on waste management performance. These reports help assess the effectiveness of waste reduction initiatives and identify areas for further improvement.\n\n## Below are some Highlights for this Year:\n\n- \u00b7 Nearly 45% of the waste generated (3673 metric tons excluding construction and demolition waste), i.e. around 1,676 metric tons is organic waste. Out of this, 98% is successfully composted, reflecting our commitment to eco-friendly practices.\n- \u00b7 Construction debris has seen an increase of 688 metric tons compared to the previous year, primarily due to construction activities in some of our locations.\n- \u00b7 Waste generated per employee for the current reporting year is 0.25 tons/pax which marks a slight increase from the previous year's figure of 0.23 tones/pax.\n- \u00b7 Biomedical and hazardous waste is incinerated as per approved methods\n- \u00b7 Responsible electronic end-of-life recycling is ensured through approved vendors\n\nWe assess potential vendors' waste management capabilities and compliance history, including any past violations or penalties. Vendor selections are made based on the commitment they demonstrate towards sustainable waste management practices and the evidence they provide of proper waste disposal procedures.\n\n## Reuse, Recycling and Disposal\n\nFor the reporting year, our recycling rate is 94% (excluding construction and demolition debris).\n\n## Waste Disposed through Di/fferent Methods\n\n| Method of Waste Disposal   |   FY23 (%) |   FY24 (%) |\n|----------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Incinerated                |          2 |          4 |\n| Recycled                   |         42 |         44 |\n| Landfilled (Excluding C&D) |          1 |          2 |\n| Composted                  |         53 |         47 |\n| Other Methods              |          2 |          3 |\n\n## Navigating Challenges and the Way Ahead\n\nIncreased amounts of C&D waste due to renovation projects and waste going to landfills due to an increase in other waste such as mixed solid waste and scrap or wet and dry garbage pose a serious risk to the environment.

Our commitment to our Five Habits and the Spirit of Wipro forms the foundation for transformation and evolution. We believe that people are our greatest asset, and strive to make a difference in the lives of our employees, customers, partners, and the communities in which we live and work.\n\nAs we undergo a fundamental transformation journey, our priority is to nurture what makes Wipro, Wipro: our employees. The world is changing, and with it, so is the way we work. Over the course of the year, as we aim to build a workplace that more accurately reflects our diverse society, we have transformed our policies and processes to ensure they are more people-centric.\n\nAround the world, Wiproites have returned to the office to build networks, celebrate successes, and access learning opportunities together. Our hybrid work model offers the flexibility of remote work combined with the collaboration and advantages of working together in the office. We have launched initiatives to promote in-person connections, networking, collaboration, learning, celebration, and growth. Our employee engagement activities aim to cultivate a positive work culture, uplift morale, and boost productivity.\n\n## Culture and Values\n\nSince our inception in 1945, Wipro has been guided by the belief that purpose drives business, and business drives purpose. Wipro's founder, Chairman Azim Premji, has been instrumental in laying this foundation, ensuring that our values serve as the moral compass guiding us to do the right thing. This has further strengthened our commitment and encouraged us to create a more inclusive workplace for our employees, vendors, and clients, as well as contribute to the creation of a more equitable, humane, and sustainable society. While our company has transformed through the years, our core principles, the Wipro Spirit, have remained constant. In early 2020, Chairman Rishad Premji introduced the Five Habits of Wipro, which are our values in action, to promote a growth mindset. The Five Habits encourage us to be reflective, supportive, and collaborative. Over 36,000 leaders from around the world have participated in 120 immersive and interactive workshops, and over 165,000 colleagues across accounts have been introduced to the Five Habits thus far. As a next step, we have also introduced the Wipro Leadership Mindset for our leaders, which is a set of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstrategic attributes to help build future leaders at Wipro. Our recently introduced culture framework helps connect the dots between different key spaces like purpose, mindset, learning, recognition, wellbeing, and DEI, and plays a role in our culture transformation journey. As each Wiproite demonstrates the organization's culture, it truly impacts how we experience Wipro.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)\n\nInclusion is a way of life at Wipro. We integrate diversity into everyday work, encouraging all Wiproites to be their authentic selves, at all times. We are committed to equitable practices, to offering equal opportunities to all, and embracing all forms of differences. This core value of inclusion and equity allows us to be an employer of choice that attracts, and grows, diverse talent.\n\nAt Wipro, we are committed to fostering a workplace where individuals, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, racial or ethnic background, and generations, are valued not in silos but as unique intersections of multifaceted identities. Through this approach, we aim to promote equity, respect, and a sense of belonging for all.\n\n## Unconscious Bias Learning Module\n\nOur e-learning module on Unconscious Bias with workplace scenarios empower associates to recognize and manage biases that may exist in the workplace. It also highlights individual actions that can be taken to consciously address, combat, and minimize unconscious bias at work. Over 182,500 associates have completed the module.\n\n## Women\n\nOur approach towards women is based on the unique lifestage philosophy inherent in our Women of Wipro (WoW) framework. These WoW programs have been tailored and customized to cater to the needs of women at every stage of their life and work; they are not a one-size-fitsall approach. The framework structures Wipro's internal policies, processes, and initiatives to promote inclusion and empowerment of women. Focused training and mentoring programs for women, networking opportunities with women leaders from across the industry, and inclusive policies and practices foster an inclusive work environment at Wipro.\n\nBelow are some of the initiatives that underscore our commitment to Women:",

Our structured governance, continued commitment, and drive from leaders have resulted in women's representation at the senior leadership level increasing from 17.0% in FY23 to 18.7% in FY24.\n\nWe are actively working to increase women's representation in decision-making roles. Currently, 22.2% of our Board of Directors, 20.0% of the Wipro Executive Board , and 22.6% of the Wipro Executive Committee are women.\n\n## Key Programs and Initiatives\n\n## Enrich\n\nA sponsorship program for high-potential senior women leaders, to strengthen the talent pipeline and create an ecosystem of enablement. Two cohorts of the program have already graduated. Following the success of the program, the next cohort has seen a two-fold increase in participation.\n\n## Begin Again\n\nA program for women who want to restart their career after a hiatus, whether it's due to a sabbatical, parenthood, senior care, travel, pursuing a passion, or any other cause.\n\n## WoW Mom\n\nA program that aims to support women employees proceeding for or returning from maternity leave. It comprizes policies to support employees, encourage pre-maternity connections and HR connections with mothers returning from maternity leave. We also offer a WoW Mom handbook, information on day care facilities, lactation facilities and more.\n\nOur holistic policy ensures a smoother integration for our returning mothers and supports them as they take on new responsibilities and new adjustments in their life. We also run a quarterly survey for returning mothers to solicit their input. We have Leadership Connects and sessions for returning mothers on various topics. This program is customized based on geographies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have implemented e-learning modules to support maternity management in the workplace. One module is designed for women associates, while the other is tailored for managers. These modules provide step-by-step guidance from the announcement of pregnancy, through the maternity leave period, the transition back to work, and beyond.\n\n## Other Programs\n\nOur flagship capability programs - such as Your Career Your Choice and She Leads - help women stay competitive and tackle workplace challenges. The voices of women leaders are heard through quarterly discussions with our CEO and the Wipro Executive Board through a W-Connect Forum.\n\n## Disability Inclusion\n\nAt Wipro, we are committed to creating an inclusive and accessible workplace for all colleagues, including those with disabilities, chronic medical conditions, and primary caregivers to dependants with disabilities. We align our efforts with the CREATE framework (Career, Recruit, Engage, Accessibility, Train, and Enable) to implement initiatives such as hiring, redeployment, engagement through accessibility improvements. Our efforts have led to increased self-identification among colleagues with disabilities, participation in observances and campaigns",

We've enabled over 1200+ reasonable accommodation requests and enhanced policies and benefits to ensure inclusion of our colleagues. Our external advocacy includes participation in roundtables with leading organizations, demonstrating our commitment to holistic diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n## LGBTQ+ Inclusion\n\nOur priority is to create a safe, welcoming workplace for LGBTQ+ employees. We do so through raising awareness, developing a strong network of allies, and implementing policy reforms. We constantly examine, amend, and add new features to our policies and processes to make them more inclusive.\n\nWipro Pride is an employee resource group (ERG) that helps employees share important information and best practices, network with other LGBTQ+ colleagues and allies, start conversations, and more. We have a Global Prevention of LGBTQ+ Discrimination Policy to protect our employees from bias and discrimination based on their gender identity or sexual orientation. In many countries, Wipro's insurance policy covers gender-affirming or transition surgery and related medical procedures.\n\nIn addition, we have inclusive/gender-neutral restrooms available at most offices in India and in other countries Recently, we introduced a dedicated e-module for Championing LGBTQ+ Inclusion in the workplace, and pronouns were also included in Office 365.\n\n## Race and Ethnicity\n\nThe Black Alliance ERG strives to promote a diverse and inclusive work environment, with a focus on Black and African - American employees. We established and observed an additional holiday in the US on Martin Luther King Day. Efforts to raise awareness about Wipro with students attending historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) by partnering with a local fraternity are also ongoing. Our first Juneteenth event focuses on increasing knowledge about Juneteenth. We commemorate Black History Month throughout February.\n\nThere are also regional and country specific chapters along with affinity groups for Hispanic & Latin/o/a/x employees and allies, Asian & Pacific Islander employees and allies, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People Processes: Key Highlights FY24\n\n## Hiring and Onboarding\n\nOur legacy, culture, and values have always provided a strong foundation for an industry-leading Talent Attraction Model. We have leveraged this to attract, identify and hire diverse top talent across the organization at all levels. Early career hires are provided with a sustainable platform to grow into technology leaders of tomorrow. We have also focused on creating and launching an Employer Value Proposition (EVP) this year to market the right jobs to the right lateral hires to build strength in the organization and to find the best leaders for experienced roles.\n\nImproving candidate experience has also been a priority. This focus has paid off in our Glassdoor ratings, where 70% have voted to recommend Wipro to a friend. Diversity and inclusion have been rated as the highest quality for Wipro at Glassdoor.\n\nWe have also seen our highest-ever rating on Indeed where we have been rated 3.8 out of 16,000+ reviews. Technology and automation have been at the forefront of our hiring practices and this has helped us make quick and data-backed hiring decisions. We have also created flagship programs such as 'Begin Again' to further our commitments to diversity and inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Leaders play a key role in setting ambitious business plans and leading their teams to meet those goals. They demonstrate accountability towards outcomes for themselves and their teams.\n\nOur talent differentiation is sharp and based on outcomes. Performance differentiation is enabled by clear rating definitions, which require high performance. Rewards are closely linked to performance outcomes. Career growth is based on sustained high performance.\n\nWe believe values and performance must go hand in hand. We have a bi-annual appraisal process and encourage real-time feedback throughout the year to make job growth and learning an ongoing process, not a once-a-year meeting. The annual review process enables fairness and objectivity by considering holistic feedback throughout the year. There is also an annual 360-degree feedback survey where employees in senior-level roles receive feedback from their teams, peers, internal customers, managers, and external customers.\n\nCareer building is an important pillar of our employee value proposition. Our promotion and rotation policies have been strengthened to ensure more employees can take on new roles and build the career they seek. To ensure talented and capable employees have adequate growth opportunities, we have doubled and sustained the frequency of promotions at junior and mid-career levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Wipro, succession planning is a bi-annual exercise. Talent is grouped in terms of performance and potential; successors are identified for critical roles and development actions are framed. Executive coaching is provided to senior leaders to facilitate their holistic development. The process helps identify top talent across the organization, with a clear focus on diverse talent that we can engage and train to assume leadership roles in the future, creating a robust and agile leadership pipeline delivering improved business results.\n\n## Learning and Development\n\nLearning & Development at Wipro dovetails with the strategic imperatives to build capabilities aligned to business priorities. Some of our key initiatives:\n\nDigital & On-demand Learning: Associates encouraged to acquire at least one new high demand skill annually through an initiative called MySkill- Z, including knowledge acquisition, assessment (leveraging global platforms like Codility) and sandbox projects.\n\nWipro invests into building capability in Cloud technologies through Hyper-scaler certifications from our Cloud and AI Academy. We have partnership with key IT industry bodies for providing 'FutureSkills' platform, enabling upskilling of employees in technologies like AI-ML, Big data, Analytics, Cloud, Mobility etc.\n\nTo enable behavioral learning on demand, Wiproites have access to SPARK an enterprise digital learning platform offered by Harvard Business Publishing which hosts 27,900+ learning assets.\n\nInitiatives for Leadership Development: Wipro's flagship programs are designed to shape mindsets, foster personal growth, and recalibrate strategic focus, and were delivered in-person to 262 leaders. Our senior leaders in key roles are assigned personal coaches; and participated in executive leadership programs at Ivy League and equivalent institutes.\n\nEnhancing Capabilities for Critical Role-holders to drive a High-Performance Culture - Over 13438 role holders across delivery, consulting and people management were upskilled through combination of Virtual Instructor-led Trainings (VILT), self-paced learning and learning journeys around specific role based behavioral competencies.",

We are advocates of wellbeing and focus on the holistic wellbeing and good health of our people. Beyond providing for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprofessional growth, we believe every individual must invest in personal fulfilment and fun.\n\nWipro Wellbeing is a journey to help each of us feel well and have the energy to live the life we want by connecting the three important aspects of our lives: Mind, Body, and Community. We adopted a data-driven approach to healthcare that made it sustainable, scalable, and unique. This also includes a holistic wellbeing platform with offerings for health and wellness across geographies aligned to the three-point plan towards employees' wellbeing, connecting mind, body, and community.\n\nLeaders define the ecosystem within which their teams operate. Hence leadership involvement in Wellbeing is a key area of focus. A leader sponsor has been identified for Wellbeing at Wipro.

When our communities are supported and sustainable, so is our planet. And it all begins with feeling well.

Most of our taxes paid in countries other than India can be applied as a credit against our Indian tax liability to the extent that the same income is subject to taxation in India.\n\nCurrently, we benefit from certain tax incentives under Indian tax laws. These tax incentives include a tax holiday from payment of Indian corporate income taxes for our businesses operating from specially designated SEZs.\n\n## Wage Pressure\n\nOur wage costs in India have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the U.S. and Europe for comparably skilled professionals, and this has been one of our competitive advantages. However, wage increases in India may prevent us from sustaining this competitive advantage and may negatively affect our profit margins.\n\nWe have historically experienced significant competition for employees from large multinational companies that have established and continue to establish offshore operations in India, as well as from companies within India. We may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent. Once the effective date is notified by the GoI, we may also experience increased costs in future years for employment and post-employment benefits in India as a result of the issuance of The Code on Social Security, 2020. Unless we are able to continue to increase the efficiency and productivity of our employees over the long term, wage increases may reduce our profit margins. Furthermore, any inability to increase the proportion of employees with less experience, or source talent from other low-cost locations, like Eastern Europe, China or Southeast Asia could also negatively affect our profits.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, we periodically assess the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial condition, current economic trends, forward-looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of\n\naccounts receivable. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as of March 31, 2024 or revenues for the year ended March 31, 2024. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nWe operate internationally and a major portion of our business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies.\n\nThe exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of our revenue is in U.S. Dollars, Pound Sterling, Euros, Australian Dollars and Canadian Dollars while a large portion of our costs are in Indian Rupees.\n\nThe exchange rates between the rupee and these currencies have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the Indian Rupee against these currencies can adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nInterest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate investments and borrowings, including various revolving and other lines of credit.\n\nThe Company's investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates.\n\n## Counterparty Risk\n\nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities in India which are at least AA rated by Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into",

Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that we will not be able to settle or meet our obligations on time or at a reasonable price. Our corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company's net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows. As of March 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.\n\n## Climate and ESG Risk Assessment\n\nThere has been an increasing recognition that climate and ESG risks can affect a company's operational strength and continuity. This has compelled us to take a proactive stance to assess our risks periodically. We have embedded climate and ESG-related risk assessment into our Enterprise Risk Management and Sustainability functions, to identify and assess the relevant risks and their associated impacts. These risks are integrated in our Business Resilience program to maintain business continuity.\n\nAssessing ESG risks is not merely understanding the problem but also shaping solutions and building the first step towards resilience.\n\n## Program Highlights\n\nWipro's Business Resilience Policy is built on a robust Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) that anticipates and prepares for any contingencies. Climaterelated disruptions are a part of the business risks, and the BCMS takes into consideration the potential impact of these disruptions to our operations and supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe process followed by the Business Resilience team is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Identification and rating of risk\n- \u00b7 Assessing the impact of the risk on business continuity\n- \u00b7 Formulating a Business Continuity Plan/Business Resilience Plan\n\n## Climate Risk Assessment Process and Findings\n\nIn addition to our ongoing process of risk assessment, a comprehensive climate risk assessment exercise was conducted in 2020, including both physical and transitional risk. At the very core of the risk assessment is an assessment of double materiality - understanding our impact on the climate and the impact of climate change on business. The impact on the climate is addressed through Wipro's Net Zero goals that drive us to progressively reduce our carbon footprint. The latter is described in this section.\n\nLeveraging the IPCC-defined RCP 4.5 (The Optimistic Scenario) and RCP 8.5 (The Business-As-Usual Scenario), a scenario-based assessment was conducted to evaluate medium to long term effects (2030-2050) of acute",

Countries like India and Philippines were more prone to physical risks, whereas Germany was most exposed to transitional risks.\n\n## Indian Scenario\n\nIn India, under RCP 4.5, eight cities where Wipro has operations are projected to experience water scarcity, and five cities are expected to be severely impacted by heatwaves. A case in point is the extreme heat and water crisis that plagued Bengaluru in March-April 2024. Under RCP 8.5, in addition to water stress and heatwaves, Wipro is likely to face extreme rainfall events and urban flooding in most cities.\n\nList of cities and regions where we see an increase in the frequency of climate change risks under the RCP 4.5 scenario (increase of global temperatures between 1.1 to 2.6 degrees Celsius relative to 1986-2005).\n\nTable 1.

The impacts are identified as having a significant financial effect and are categorized under three key criteria:\n\n## People's Safety\n\nThe possible safety risk of 1,000 or more of our personnel at any given time, in any area. We have estimated this to be 0.5% of staff in specific cities.\n\n## Wipro Infrastructure\n\nThe need for relocation of more than 25% of personnel to other sites, and a 10% increase in infrastructure costs due to possible damage.\n\n## Customer Delivery\n\nAny possible impact on customer engagement by over 25% of the relationship value. Furthermore, any missioncritical service would have to be restored within the time frame agreed upon with clients.",

This also accounts for the cost of managing risks through increased insurance premiums, water recycling, and rainwater management infrastructure, energy efficiency programs, increased cooling costs, and employee relocation costs.\n\nFurther information can be found on our website at Sustainability Services - Transform Business with Wipro.\n\n## Integration of ESG Risks with Business Functions\n\nIn addition to climate-related risks, we also assess our ESG risks in terms of the social and governance factors most material to Wipro. These risks are evident across the business, and everybody has a role to play in the mitigation as well as in building resilience. A true assessment of ESG-related risks is conducted in consultation with key business functions such as Facilities Management, Human Resources, Data Privacy and Business Resilience, to name a few. These risks are then integrated into every business function to enable the planning of resources and allow for contingencies.\n\n## Threat Management and Environmental Risk Monitoring\n\nWipro's Threat Management Program is designed to monitor climate risks and enhance our BCMS to proactively monitor environmental risks to ensure our operational continuity.\n\n## Navigating Challenges and Making Progress\n\nOne of the challenges we face as we develop our risk assessment exercise is assessing how environment or climate change impacts employee health, absenteeism, and employee productivity. While there are some existing assumptions to quantify the impacts of these factors, the research is limited, with a scarcity of relevant studies specific to the Indian context.\n\nMoving forward, we plan to initiate an academic exercise to understand the impacts of climate and environmental risks on our employees and, in turn, our business. We strongly believe that the proactive monitoring of employee health and productivity is essential for building resilience against climate and environmental-related threats.",

Inflation  and interest rates both stayed high along with geopolitical volatility. This resulted in customers  rigorously reviewing  their  technology  investments  and  cutting down or deferring discretionary spends. Global macroeconomic  measures  to  rein  in  inflation  may  have reached the tail end of the cycle. There are expectations of rate cuts towards the second half of the calendar year 2024, and this is expected to drive overall growth in  the  calendar  year  2024.  Further  escalation  in geopolitical conflicts can potentially lead to spikes in energy prices, disrupt supply chains and create trade barriers.\n\nAdditional  information  regarding  your  Company's business operations and  financial position are provided  as  part  of  the  MD  &  A  Report  from  page no. 32 onwards.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAccording to the Strategic Review 2024 published by NASSCOM (the 'NASSCOM Report' ), revenue for the Indian IT services' sector is expected to witness growth of  2%  year-over-year  in  fiscal  year  2024,  led  by infrastructure management and networking services in  distributed  environments,  cloud-based  software testing services, and consulting services. It is expected that there will be an increase in foundational spend across  cloud,  IT  modernization,  digital  customer experience, and digital engineering projects.\n\nAccording to the NASSCOM Report, AI-related activities  have  witnessed  a  significant  uptick  with  2.7x growth in activities related to industry collaborations and  partnerships,  product/service  launches  and enterprise  GenAI  strategies.  Your  Company  expects that GenAI will be a key priority for IT service providers, with the legal and regulatory landscape expected to evolve rapidly, setting the stage for greater adoption in the second half of calendar year 2024 and into 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernments  across  the  world  are  expected  to implement regulations which prioritize data protection, breach  detection  and  containment,  and  responsible use of AI.\n\nThe  NASSCOM Report estimates that the engineering services  ( 'ER&D' )  will  grow  at  7.4%  year-over-year. With  digital  imperatives  and  the  resurgence  of  AI, ER&D maintains its concentration on digital engineering, leading to development of new products and service categories.\n\nCompanies  continue  to  prioritize  cost  takeout  and operational excellence initiatives, with spending expected  to  gradually  improve  in  fiscal  year  2025. Companies  are  also  prioritizing  sustainability  and resilience, aiming to globalize their operations to take advantage of cost arbitrage, greater access to talent, and  faster  innovation.  The  financial  services,  hi-tech and telecom sectors continue to remain soft, with the healthcare and automotive sectors being bright spots. Consumer goods and manufacturing sector clients are investing  cautiously  due  to  cost  takeouts  and  weak consumer spending.\n\nDigital transformation and infrastructure modernization continue to be a global priority, with a particular  focus  on  cloud  and  cybersecurity.  Your Company expects that increased interest and adoption of technologies  such  as  automation,  intelligent applications, and AI including responsible AI, GenAIenabled virtual assistants, Edge computing, 5G, and industrial IoT will create opportunities for the services industry.\n\nYour  Company  expects  the  IT  services  industry  to accelerate  and  drive  decisions  in  fiscal  year  2025 based on investments made by clients in key areas such as AI, GenAI implementation, cost optimization, operational excellence, digital transformation, vendor consolidation,  productivity  improvement,  customer experience  programs,  innovation  in  products  and services, talent management, future of workplace and workforce, and ESG initiatives.\n\n## Acquisitions, Divestments,  Investments and Mergers\n\nMergers and acquisitions are an integral part of your Company's  business  strategy  because  acquisitions help  it  leapfrog  in  strategic  areas  and  capture high-demand  high-potential  market  opportunities.",

The aggregate increase in salary for WTDs and other KMPs was 75.55% in financial year 2023-24 over financial year 2022-23, on account of the following:\n- a) In recognition of Mr. Thierry Delaporte's contributions in driving significant transformation at the Company during his tenure as CEO and Managing Director, and with a view to enable a smooth transition, ensure business continuity and to ensure adherence to post-engagement obligations (including, but not limited to, confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-disparagement, and other obligations), his compensation for the year ended March 31, 2024 includes, inter alia, cost of accelerated vesting of 989,130 unvested stock options and cash compensation in the amount of US$ 4.33 Million and applicable social security contributions, subject to appropriate deductions.\n- b)   Computation of remuneration to Ms. Aparna C. Iyer is on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of Restricted Stock Units (RSU), granted to her, which will vest over a period of time. This also includes RSUs that will vest based on performance parameters of the Company.\n- 5. Company affirms that the remuneration is paid as per the remuneration policy of the Company.\n\n## Variable Pay Compensation\n\nThe variable pay of executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, is based on clearly laid out criteria and measures, which are linked to the desired performance and business objectives of the organization. The criteria for variable pay, which is paid out quarterly/annually, includes financial parameters like revenue, profit achievement, operating margin achievement and other strategic goals as decided by the Board, from time to time.\n\nApart from the variable pay component, long term (typically greater than one year) incentives granted to executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, includes both time-based stock units (RSUs) and performancebased stock units (PSUs).\n\nThe vesting of PSUs is based on performance parameters of the Company over a defined performance period and is linked to predefined financial goals. Time-based stock units typically vest over a defined period. The vesting pattern and schedule for both these types of stock units are as determined by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.",

WIPRO'S  PHILOSOPHY  ON  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nWipro's governance philosophy flows from the 'Spirit of  Wipro'  that  represents  the  core  values  by  which policies and practices of the organization are guided. The spirit is deeply rooted in the unchanging essence of Wipro. But it also embraces what we must aspire to be. It gives us direction and a clear sense of purpose. Our brand identity reflects the Spirit of Wipro. Our core values have remained constant, though our Company has transformed many times over the years.\n\nIn addition, our Chairman introduced the Five Habits essential  to  drive  a  Growth  Mindset  in  early  2020, which  are  our  values  in  action.  Five  Habits  is  our culture transformation initiative.\n\nWith  this  initiative,  your  Company  encourages  its leaders  to  exemplify  the  fundamental  behaviours aligned  to  each  of  the  Five  Habits.  Your  Company is  relentlessly  driving  a  cultural  transformation  to build an organization that is bold, that drives a highperformance  mindset,  and  nurtures  diverse  ideas and  teams.  Your  Company's  Five  Habits  fuel  this transformation  and  provide  the  foundation  for  who we are, how we act and how we grow. Your Company believes  that  its  leaders  will  be  the  most  visible examples  of  its  culture.  They  are  encouraged  to  be great  role  models  for  their  teams,  as  the  Company cascades  this  message  further.  Your  Company believes  that  this  change  is  intrinsically  personal and greatly driven by an individual's will to be open to learning through life.\n\nThe values encapsulated in the 'Spirit of Wipro' and 'Five Habits' are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncorporate  social  responsibilities.  We  also  strive  to ensure balance between our aims and minority rights in  all  our  business  decisions.  We  have  implemented various  codes  and  policies  to  ensure  best  corporate governance practices at all levels. Efficient corporate governance  requires  a  clear  understanding  of  the respective roles of the Board and Senior Management and  their  relationships  with  others  in  the  corporate\n\nSo  far,  over  36,000  leaders  and  165,000  employees globally  have  been  part  of  120  immersive  and interactive  sessions  hosted by our senior leadership team on the Five Habits.\n\nWipro's  governance  framework  is  driven  by  the objective  of  enhancing  long  term  stakeholder  value without  compromising  on  ethical  standards  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sincerity,  fairness,  good  citizenship  and commitment  to  compliance  are  key  characteristics that  drive  relationships  of  the  Board  and  Senior Management with other stakeholders.\n\nCorporate  governance  at  Wipro  is  implemented through robust board governance processes, internal control  systems  and  processes,  and  strong  audit mechanisms.  These  are  articulated  through  the Company's  Code  of  Business  Conduct,  Corporate Governance  Guidelines,  and  charters  of  various Committees  of  the  Board  and  the  Company's Disclosure Policy. Wipro's corporate  governance practices  can  be  described  through  the  following four layers:\n\n- a) Governance by Shareholders\n- b) Governance by Board of Directors\n- c) Governance by Committees of Board\n- d) Governance through management process\n\nIn  this  report,  we  have  provided  details  on  how  the corporate governance principles are put into practice within Wipro.\n\n## II. SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe Companies  Act, 2013, Listing Regulations and  NYSE  Listed  Company  Manual  prescribes  the governance  mechanism  by  shareholders  in  terms  of passing  of  ordinary  and  special  resolutions,  voting rights,  participation  in  the  corporate  actions  such as  bonus  issue,  buyback  of  shares,  declaration  of dividend, etc. Your Company follows a robust process to  ensure that the shareholders of the Company are well  informed  of  Board  decisions  both  on  financial and non-financial matters and adequate notice with a detailed explanation is sent to the shareholders well in advance to obtain necessary approvals.\n\nThe  Company  seeks  approval  of  shareholders  on various  resolutions  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting held every year. In addition, approval of shareholders is also sought through postal ballot in case of urgency of the matter as per the applicable regulations.\n\n## III. BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n## Composition of Board\n\nAs  of  March  31,  2024,  our  Board  had  two  Executive Directors,  six  Non-Executive  Independent  Directors and  one  Non-Executive,  Non-Independent  Director. The  Executive  Chairman  and  Whole-Time  Director, and  the  Non-Executive,  Non-Independent  Director are  Promoter  Directors.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer ( 'CEO' )  and Managing Director is a professional CEO who  is  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  operations  of the Company. Of the seven Non-Executive Directors, six are Independent Directors, free from any business or  other  relationship  that  could  materially  influence their  judgment.  In  the  opinion  of  the  Board,  all  the Independent  Directors are independent  of the management and satisfy the criteria of independence as defined under the Companies Act, 2013, the Listing Regulations and the NYSE Listed Company Manual.\n\nThe  Board  is  well  diversified  and  consists  of  two women Independent Directors and five Directors who are foreign nationals. The profiles of our Directors are available  on  our  website  at  https://www.wipro.com/ leadership .\n\n## Board Meetings\n\nThe Board meeting dates are decided in consultation with the Board members. The schedule of the Board meetings  as  well  as  Board  Committee  meetings  are communicated in advance to the Directors to enable them to attend the meetings.\n\nThe  Board  meetings  are  normally  scheduled  over two  days.  In  addition,  every  quarter,  Independent Directors  meet  amongst  themselves  exclusively.  In line with Para 4 of Schedule B of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015, it is the endeavour of the Company that the gap between the clearance of accounts by Audit Committee and B oard Meeting is as narrow as possible.\n\n## Information flow to the Board Members\n\nInformation  is  provided  to  the  Board  Members  on  a continuous basis for their review, inputs, and approval from  time  to  time.  More  specifically,  we  present our  annual  strategic  plan  and  operating  plan  of  our business  to  the  Board  for  their  review,  inputs,  and approval. Likewise, our quarterly financial statements\n\n.",

We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.\n\nRevenue from fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method - Refer Notes 2 (iii)(a), 3(xiii)B and 22 to the financial statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matter Description\n\nRevenue  from  fixed-price  contracts,  including  software development,  and  integration  contracts,  where  the performance  obligations  are  satisfied  over  time,  is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\n\nUse  of  the  percentage-of-completion  method  requires the Company to determine the project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project costs at completion. The estimation of total project costs involves significant  judgement  and  is  assessed  throughout  the period  of  the  contract  to  reflect  any  changes  based  on the  latest  available  information.  In  addition,  provisions for  estimated  losses,  if  any,  on  uncompleted  contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the total estimated project costs.\n\nWe  identified  the  revenue  recognition  for  fixed-price contracts  where  the  percentage-of-completion  method is  used  as  a  key  audit  matter  because of the significant judgement involved in estimating the efforts to complete such contracts.\n\nThis estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred to-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the remaining performance obligations.\n\nThis  required  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  in evaluating  the  audit  evidence  supporting  estimated efforts to complete and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated efforts used to recognise revenue from fixed-price contracts.",

The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board's Report including Annexures to Board's report, Business  Responsibility  and  Sustainability Report  and  Corporate  Governance  Report,  but  does\n\nnot  include  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements, the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\n- \u00b7 Our  opinion  on  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements does  not  cover  the  other  information  and  we  do  not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n- \u00b7 In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other information  and,  in  doing  so,  consider  whether  the other  information  is  materially  inconsistent  with  the Standalone  Financial  Statements  or  our  knowledge obtained  during  the  course  of  our  audit  or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n- \u00b7 If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that  there  is  a  material  misstatement  of  this  other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  financial  position, financial  performance  including  other  comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in  accordance  with  the  Ind  AS  and  other  accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also  includes  maintenance  of  adequate  accounting records  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Act for  safeguarding  the  assets  of  the  Company  and  for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection  and  application  of  appropriate  accounting policies;  making  judgments  and  estimates  that  are reasonable  and  prudent;  and  design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the  preparation  and  presentation  of  these  Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements, management  and  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  for assessing  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to going  concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing  our  opinion  on  whether  the  Company  has adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to  Standalone  Financial  Statements  in  place  and  the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\n\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the  Company's  ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements  or,  if  such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures,  and  whether  the  Standalone  Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nMateriality  is  the  magnitude  of  misstatements  in  the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or  in  aggregate,  makes  it  probable  that  the  economic decisions  of  a  reasonably  knowledgeable  user  of  the Standalone  Financial  Statements  may  be  influenced. We  consider  quantitative  materiality  and  qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nWe  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance regarding,  among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope and  timing  of  the  audit  and  significant  audit  findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with a statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant ethical  requirements  regarding  independence,  and  to communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and  other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements  of  the  current  period  and  are  therefore the  key  audit  matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in our  auditor's  report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes",

Our audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.\n\n## MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nA  company's  internal  financial  control  with  reference  to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles.

Hence,  reporting  on  the  quarterly returns  or  statements  filed  by  the  Company with such banks or financial institutions is not applicable to the Company.\n- (iii) The Company has made investments in companies during the year, in respect of which:\n- (a) The  Company  has  not  provided  any  loans or  advances  in  the  nature  of  loans  or  stood guarantee,  or  provided  security  to  any  other entity  during  the  year,  and  hence  reporting under clause (iii)(a) of the Order is not applicable to the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hence, reporting under clause  (xvi)(a),  (b)  and  (c)  of  the  Order  is  not applicable to the Company.\n- (b)  The Group does not have any Core Investment Company as part of the group and accordingly reporting under clause (xvi)(d) of the Order is not applicable to the Company.\n- (xvii) The  Company  has  not  incurred  cash  losses  during the  financial  year  covered  by  our  audit  and  the immediately preceding financial year.\n- (xviii) There  has  been  no  resignation  of  the  statutory auditors of the Company during the year.\n- (xix) On  the  basis  of the financial ratios, ageing and  expected  dates  of  realisation  of  financial\n\nassets  and  payment  of  financial  liabilities,  other information accompanying the financial statements and  our  knowledge  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and Management plans and based on our examination of the  evidence  supporting  the  assumptions,  nothing has come to our attention, which causes us to believe that any material uncertainty exists as on the date of  the  audit  report  indicating  that  Company  is  not capable of meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We further state that our reporting is based on the facts up to the date of the audit report and we neither give any guarantee nor  any  assurance  that  all  liabilities  falling  due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date,  will  get  discharged  by  the  Company  as  and when they fall due.\n\n- (xx) (a) There is no unspent amount towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on other than ongoing projects requiring a transfer to a Fund specified in Schedule VII to the Companies Act or special account in compliance with the provision of sub-section (6) of section 135 of the said Act.

Due to rounding off, the  numbers  presented  throughout  the document may not add up precisely to the totals and  percentages  may  not  precisely  reflect  the absolute figures. Previous year figures have been regrouped/rearranged, wherever necessary.\n\n## (ii)  Basis of measurement\n\nThe standalone financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items, which have been measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind AS:\n\n- a)  Derivative financial instruments;\n- b)  Financial instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss;\n- c) The defined benefit liability/(asset) is recognised  as  the  present  value  of  defined benefit  obligation  less  fair  value  of  plan assets; and\n- d)  Contingent consideration.\n\n## (iii)  Use of estimates and judgment\n\nThe  preparation  of  these  standalone  financial statements  in  conformity  with  Ind  AS  requires the management to make judgments, accounting estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the application of accounting  policies  and  the reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  income and expenses. Accounting estimates are monetary  amounts  in  the  standalone  financial statements  that  are  subject  to  measurement uncertainty.  An  accounting  policy  may  require items  in  standalone  financial  statements  to  be measured  at  monetary  amounts  that  cannot be  observed  directly  and  must  instead  be estimated. In such a case, management develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set  out  by  the  accounting  policy.  Developing accounting estimates involves the use of judgments or assumptions based on the latest available and reliable information. Actual results may differ from those accounting estimates.\n\n## 1. THE COMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nWipro  Limited  (' Wipro '  or  ' Company '  or  ' we '  or ' our '  or  ' us '),  is  a  global  information  technology (' IT '), consulting  and  business  process  services (' BPS ') company.\n\nWipro is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled  in  India.  The  address  of  its  registered office  is  Wipro  Limited,  Doddakannelli,  Sarjapur Road,  Bengaluru  -  560  035,  Karnataka,  India.

The Company's  American  Depository  Shares  (' ADS ') representing equity shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors authorised these standalone  financial  statements  for  issue  on  May 22, 2024.\n\n## 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## (i) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation\n\nThe standalone financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Indian Accounting Standards (' Ind AS '), the provisions of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013 (' the Companies Act '), as applicable and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (' SEBI '). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian  Accounting  Standards)  Rules,  2015  and amendments  issued thereafter. Accounting policies have  been  applied  consistently  to all periods  presented  in  these  standalone financial statements, except for the adoption of new  accounting  standards,  amendments  and interpretations effective from April 1, 2023.\n\nThe standalone financial statements correspond to  the  classification  provisions  contained  in  Ind AS  1,  'Presentation  of  Financial  Statements'.

Changes to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are changed and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about material areas of estimation, uncertainty  and  critical  judgments  in  applying accounting policies that have the material effect on  the  amounts  recognised  in  the  standalone financial statements are included in the following notes:\n\n- a)  Revenue  recognition: The Company applies judgement to determine whether each product  or  service  promised  to  a  customer is  capable  of  being  distinct,  and  is  distinct in  the  context  of  the  contract,  if  not,  the promised  product  or  service  is  combined and  accounted  as  a  single  performance obligation. The Company allocates the Transaction  Price  (as  defined  below  in  Note 3(xiii)) to separately identifiable performance obligation deliverables based on their relative  stand-alone  selling  price.  In  cases where  the  Company  is  unable  to  determine the  stand-alone  selling  price  the  Company uses expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the stand-alone selling price. The Company uses the percentage of completion method  using  the  input  (cost  expended) method to measure progress towards completion in respect of fixed price contracts. Percentage of completion method accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue  and  costs.  This  method  is  followed when  reasonably  dependable  estimates  of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors  that  are  reviewed  in  estimating  the future  costs  to  complete  include  estimates of future labor costs and productivity efficiencies.  Because  the  financial  reporting of  these  contracts  depends  on  estimates that  are  assessed  continually  during  the term of these contracts, revenue recognised, profit  and  timing  of  revenue  for  remaining performance  obligations are subject to revisions  as  the  contract  progresses  to completion.  When  estimates  indicate  that\n\n- a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes probable. Volume discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. When the amount of discount  varies  with  the  levels  of  revenue, volume  discount  is  recorded  based  on estimate of future revenue from the customer.\n- b)  Impairment  testing: Goodwill  recognised on business combination is tested for impairment at least annually and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that  the  recoverable  amount  of  goodwill  or a  cash  generating  unit  to  which  goodwill pertains,  is  less  than  the  carrying  value. The  Company  assesses  acquired  intangible assets  with  finite  useful  life  for  impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not be  recoverable.  The  recoverable  amount  of an asset or a cash generating unit is higher of  value  in  use  and  fair  value  less  cost  of disposal.  The  calculation  of  value  in  use  of an asset or a cash generating unit involves use of significant estimates and assumptions which include turnover, growth rates and net margins  used  to  calculate  projected  future cash flows, risk-adj usted discount rate, future economic and market conditions.\n- c) Impairment  of  investment  in  subsidiaries: The  Company  reviews  its  carrying  value  of investments carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount, the impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss.\n- d)  Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the Company are India and the United States of America.\n- Significant judgments are involved in determining  the  provision  for  income  taxes including judgment on whether tax positions are  probable  of  being  sustained  in  tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  ultimate  realisation  of  deferred  tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future  taxable  profits  during  the  periods  in which  those  temporary  differences  and  tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company  considers  expected  reversal  of deferred  tax  liabilities  and  projected  future taxable  income  in  making  this  assessment. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realisable, however, could reduce in the near term  if  estimates  of  future  taxable  income during the carry-forward period are reduced.\n\n- e)  Business combinations: In accounting for business  combinations,  judgment  is required  to  assess  whether  an  identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (including useful  life  estimates),  liabilities  assumed, and contingent consideration assumed involves management judgment. These measurements  are  based  on  information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been  deemed  reasonable  by  management. Changes in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially affect the results of operations.\n- f) Defined  benefit  plans  and  compensated absences: The  cost  of  the  defined  benefit plans, compensated  absences  and  the present value of the defined benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuation using  the  projected  unit  credit  method.  An actuarial  valuation  involves  making  various assumptions  that  may  differ  from  actual developments  in  the  future.  These  include the determination of the discount rate, future salary  increases  and  mortality  rates.  Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and  its  long-term  nature,  a  defined  benefit obligation  is  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in\n\nthese  assumptions.  All  assumptions  are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\n- g)  Expected credit losses on financial assets: The impairment provisions of financial assets are  based  on  assumptions  about  risk  of default  and  expected  timing  of  collection. The Company uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the expected credit loss calculation based on the Company's history of collections, customer's creditworthiness, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n- h)  Useful lives of property, plant and equipment: The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives of the assets.  The  charge  in  respect  of  periodic depreciation is derived based on an estimate of  an  asset's  expected  useful  life  and  the expected residual value at the end of its life. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future  events,  which  may  impact  their  life, such as changes in technology. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- i) Useful  lives of intangible assets : The Company  amortises  intangible  assets  on  a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of  the  assets.  The  useful  life  is  estimated based  on  a  number  of  factors  including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors such as  the  stability  of  the  industry  and  known technological  advances  and  the  level  of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the  expected  future  cash  flows  from  the assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- j) Provisions  and  contingent  liabilities: The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events, and  it  is  probable  that  outflow  of  resources will  be  required  to  settle  the  obligations. These  provisions  are  reviewed  at  the  end of  each  reporting  date  and  are  adjusted  to reflect the current best estimates.\n\n.",

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\n\n## (i) Functional and presentation currency\n\nThese  standalone  financial  statements  are presented  in  Indian  rupees,  which  is  the functional currency of the Company.\n\n## (ii)   Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates  prevailing  at  the  date  of  the  transaction. Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting from  the  settlement  of  such  transactions  and from translation at the exchange rates prevailing at  the  reporting  date  of  monetary  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit and loss and reported  within  foreign  exchange  gains/(losses), net, within results of operating activities except when  deferred  in  other  comprehensive  income as  qualifying  cash  flow  hedges  and  qualifying net  investment  hedges.  Net  loss  relating  to translation or settlement of borrowings denominated  in  foreign  currency  are  reported within finance  costs.  Net  gain  relating  to translation or settlement of borrowings denominated  in  foreign  currency  are  reported within Other  income.  Non-monetary  assets and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currency and measured at historical cost are translated at  the  exchange  rate  prevalent  at  the  date  of transaction.  Translation  differences  on  non-\n\nmonetary  financial  assets  measured  at  fair value  at  the  reporting  date,  such  as  equities classified as financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are included in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\n## (iii)  Financial instruments\n\n## a) Non-derivative financial instruments:\n\nNon derivative financial instruments consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 financial  assets,  which  include  cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee and other advances, investments in equity and debt securities  and  eligible  current  and  noncurrent assets; and\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities, which include borrowings, trade payables, lease liabilities,  and  eligible  current  and  noncurrent liabilities.\n\nNon-  derivative financial instruments other than trade receivables and unbilled receivables are recognised initially at fair value.  However,  trade  receivables  and unbilled  receivables  that  do  not  contain a  significant  financing  component  are measured at the Transaction Price. Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  nonderivative financial instruments are measured as described below:\n\n## A.  Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents  consist  of  cash  on  hand and  in  banks  and  demand  deposits with  banks,  which  can  be  withdrawn at  any  time,  without  prior  notice  or penalty on the principal.\n\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include  cash  on  hand,  in  banks  and demand  deposits  with  banks,  net of  outstanding  bank  overdrafts  that are  repayable  on  demand  and  are considered part of the Company's cash\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  the  balance sheet, bank overdrafts are presented under borrowings within current financial liabilities.\n\n## B.  Investments\n\n## Financial instruments measured at amortised cost:\n\nDebt instruments that meet the following  criteria  are  measured  at amortised cost (except for debt instruments that are designated at fair value  through  Profit  or  Loss  on  initial recognition):\n\n- \u00b7 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold  assets  in  order  to  collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the instrument  give  rise  on  specified dates  to  cash  flows  that  are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVTOCI'):\n\nDebt instruments that meet the following  criteria  are  measured  at FVTOCI  (except  for  debt  instruments that  are  designated  at  fair  value through  Profit or Loss on initial recognition):\n\n- \u00b7 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial asset; and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the instrument  give  rise  on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nInterest income is recognised in statement of profit and loss for FVTOCI debt  instruments.  Other  changes  in\n\nfair  value  of  FVTOCI  financial  assets are recognised in other comprehensive income. When  the  investment is disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously  accumulated  in  reserves is  transferred  to  statement  of  profit and loss.\n\n## Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'):\n\nInstruments  that  do  not  meet  the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets at  FVTPL  are  measured  at  fair  value at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period, with  any  gains  or  losses  arising  on re-measurement  recognised  in  the statement of profit and loss. The gain or loss on disposal is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nInterest income is recognised in the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  for FVTPL debt instruments. Dividends on financial assets at FVTPL is recognised when  the  Company's  right  to  receive dividends is established.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments:\n\nThe  Company  carries  certain  equity instruments  which  are  not  held  for trading. At initial recognition, the Company  may  make  an  irrevocable election to present subsequent changes  in  the  fair  value  of  an investment in an equity instrument in other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or through statement of profit and loss (FVTPL).  For  investments  designated to be classified as FVTOCI, movements in fair value of investments  are recognised  in  other  comprehensive income  and  the  gain  or  loss  is  not transferred  to  statement  of  profit and loss on disposal of investments. For  investments  designated  to  be classified as FVTPL, both movements in fair value of investments and gain or loss on disposal of investments are\n\n.",

These  investments  are measured  at  fair  value  at  the  end  of each reporting period, with any gains or  losses  arising  on  re-measurement recognised  in  statement  of  profit and loss. The gain or loss on disposal is  recognised  in  statement  of  profit and loss.\n\n## C. Other financial assets\n\nOther financial assets are nonderivative  financial  assets  with  fixed or determinable payments that are  not  quoted  in  an  active  market. These  comprise  trade  receivables, unbilled  receivables,  finance  lease receivables, employee and other advances and eligible current and noncurrent assets. They are presented as current assets, except for those expected  to  be  realised  later  than twelve  months  after  the  reporting date  which  are  presented  as  noncurrent  assets.  All  financial  assets are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value and subsequently measured at amortised  cost  using  the  effective interest method, less any impairment losses. However, trade receivables and unbilled receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at the Transaction Price.\n\n## D. Trade payables and other liabilities\n\nTrade  payables  and  other  liabilities are initially recognised at transaction\n\nprice,  and  subsequently  carried  at amortised  cost  using  the  effective interest  method.  For  these  financial instruments,  the  carrying  amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term  maturity  of  these instruments. Contingent consideration recognised in a business combination is initially recognised at fair value and subsequently  measured  at  fair  value through profit or loss.\n\n## b) Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in foreign  operations  and  forecasted  cash flows denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe Company limits the effect of foreign exchange  rate  fluctuations  by  following established  risk  management  policies including  the  use  of  derivatives.  The Company  enters  into  derivative  financial instruments  where  the  counterparty  is primarily a bank.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised  and  measured  at  fair  value. Attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as cost.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured as described below:\n\n## A. Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  the derivative hedging instruments designated  as  a  cash  flow  hedge  are recognised  in  other  comprehensive income and held in cash flow hedging reserve, net of taxes, a component of equity,  to  the  extent  that  the  hedge is  effective.  To  the  extent  that  the hedge  is  ineffective,  changes  in  fair value are recognised in the statement of profit and loss and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net,  within  results  from  operating\n\n<!-- image -->",

The cumulative  gain  or  loss  previously recognised  in  the  cash  flow  hedging reserve is transferred to the statement of profit and loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected  to  occur,  such  cumulative balance is immediately recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## B. Others\n\nChanges  in  fair value of foreign currency  derivative  instruments  not designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  are recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit and  loss  and  reported  within  foreign exchange  gains/(losses),  net,  within results from operating activities.\n\nChanges  in  fair  value  and  gains/ (losses), net, on settlement of foreign currency derivative instruments relating  to  borrowings,  which  have not  been  designated  as  hedges  are recorded in finance costs.\n\n## c) Derecognition of financial instruments\n\nThe  Company  derecognises  a  financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or  it  transfers  the  financial  asset  and the  transfer  qualifies  for  derecognition under Ind AS 109.

The  estimated  useful  lives  of  assets  are as follows:\n\n| Category                                    | Useful life    |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                                   | 28 to 40 years |\n| Plant and equipment                         | 5 to 21 years  |\n| Computer equipment and                      | 2 to 7 years   |\n| software  Furniture, fixtures and equipment | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Vehicles                                    | 4 to 5 years   |\n\nWhen  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant and  equipment  have  different  useful  lives, they  are  accounted  for  as  separate  items (major components) of property, plant and  equipment.  Subsequent  expenditure relating  to  property,  plant  and  equipment is  capitalised  only  when  it  is  probable  that future  economic  benefits  associated  with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nDeposits  and  advances  paid  towards  the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding  as  at  each  reporting  date  is classified  as  capital  advances  under  other non-current assets and the cost of property, plant  and  equipment  not  available  for  use\n\nbefore such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress.\n\n## (vi)  Business combinations, Goodwill and Intangible assets\n\n## a)  Business combinations\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for using the purchase (acquisition) method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value  of  the  assets  transferred,  liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued  at  the  date  of  exchange  by  the Compan y.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in  a  business  combination  are  measured initially at fair value at the date of acquisition. Transaction  costs  incurred  in  connection with  a  business  acquisition  are  expensed as incurred.\n\nThe cost of an acquisition also includes the fair  value  of  any  contingent  consideration measured  as  at  the  date  of  acquisition. Any  subsequent  changes  to  the  fair  value of contingent  consideration  classified  as liabilities,  other  than  measurement  period adjustments, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## Common Control business combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations involving entities or businesses under  common  control  using  the  pooling  of interests  method.  The  assets  and  liabilities of  the  combining  entities  are  reflected  at their  carrying  amounts.  The  identity  of  the reserves shall be preserved and shall appear in the financial statements of the transferee in the same form in which they appeared in the  financial  statements  of  the  transferor. The  difference,  if  any,  between  the  amount recorded  as  share  capital  issued  plus  any additional consideration in the form of cash or  other  assets  and  the  amount  of  share capital of the transferor shall be transferred to capital reserve and should be presented separately as Common Control Transactions Capital reserve.\n\n.",

If  the excess  is  negative,  a  bargain  purchase gain  is  recognised  in  equity  as  capital reserve.  Goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less accumulated impairment (if any).\n\nGoodwill  associated  with  disposal  of  an operation that is part of cash-generating unit is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the  cash-generating  unit  retained,  unless some  other  method  better  reflects  the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.\n\n## c)  Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  acquired  separately  are measured  at  cost  of  acquisition.  Intangible assets  acquired  in  a  business  combination are measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible  assets  are  carried  at  cost  less accumulated  amortisation  and  impairment losses, if any.\n\nThe amortisation of an intangible asset with a  finite  useful  life  reflects  the  manner  in which  the  economic  benefit  is  expected  to be generated.\n\nThe  estimated  useful  life  of  amortisable intangibles is reviewed and where appropriate is  adjusted,  annually.  The  estimated  useful lives of the amortisable intangible assets are as follows:\n\n| Category                      | Useful life   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| Customer-related intangibles  | 5 to 10 years |\n| Marketing-related intangibles | 7 years       |\n\nCustomer-related intangibles includes customer contracts and customer relationships acquired as a part of Business combinations. Marketing-related intangibles includes non-compete acquired as a part of Business combinations.\n\n## (vii) Leases\n\n## The Company as a lessee\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  an  arrangement  for lease  of  land,  buildings,  plant  and  equipment including  computer  equipment  and  vehicles. Such  arrangements  are  generally  for  a  fixed period  but  may  have  extension  or  termination options.  The  Company  assesses,  whether  the contract is, or contains, a lease, at its inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to:\n\n- a) control use of an identified asset,\n- b) obtain substantially all the economic benefits from use of the identified asset, and\n- c) direct the use of the identified asset\n\nThe  Company  determines  the  lease  term  as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with periods covered by an option to extend the lease, where the Company is reasonably certain to  exercise  that  option.  The  Company  makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a  lease-by-lease  basis  and  thereby  assesses whether  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised.\n\nAt the commencement of the lease, the Company recognises a Right of Use (' RoU ') asset at cost and  corresponding  lease  liability,  except  for leases  with  term  of  less  than  twelve  months (short-term  leases)  and  low-value  assets.  For these  short-term  and  low  value  leases,  the Company recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe  cost  of  the  RoU  assets  comprises  the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the inception date of the lease, plus any initial direct costs, less any lease incentives received. Subsequently,  the  RoU  assets  are  measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment  losses,  if  any.  The RoU assets are depreciated using the straightline method from the commencement date over the  shorter  of  lease  term  or  useful  life  of  RoU\n\n<!-- image -->",

The estimated useful lives of RoU assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe  Company  applies  Ind  AS  36  to  determine whether a RoU asset is impaired and accounts for  any  identified  impairment  loss  as  described in the impairment of non-financial assets below.\n\nFor lease liabilities at the commencement of the lease, the Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow funds, including the consideration of factors such as the nature of the asset and location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as applicable in a similar economic environment.\n\nAfter  the  commencement  date,  the  amount of  lease  liabilities  is  increased  to  reflect  the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n\nThe  lease  liability  is  subsequently  remeasured by  increasing  the  carrying  amount  to  reflect interest  on  the  lease  liability,  reducing  the carrying  amount  to  reflect  the  lease  payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect  any  lease  modifications.  The  Company recognises  the  amount  of  the  re-measurement of  lease  liability  due  to  modification  as  an adjustment  to  the  RoU  asset  or  in  statement of profit and loss, depending upon the modification.  Where  the  carrying  amount  of the  RoU  asset  is  reduced  to  zero  and  there  is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease  liability,  the  Company  recognises  any remaining amount of the re-measurement in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nPayment of lease liabilities are classified as cash used  in  financing  activities  in  the  statement  of cash flows.\n\n## The Company as a lessor\n\nLeases  under  which  the  Company  is  a  lessor are  classified  as  a  finance  or  operating  lease. Lease contracts where all the risks and rewards are  substantially  transferred  to  the  lessee  are classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating lease.\n\nFor  leases  under  which  the  Company  is  an intermediate lessor, the Company accounts for the head-lease and the sub-lease as two separate contracts.  The  sub-lease  is  further  classified either as a finance lease or an operating lease by reference to the RoU asset arising from the headlease.\n\n## (viii) Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable  value,  including  necessary  provision for obsolescence. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.\n\n## (ix) Impairment\n\n## A)  Financial assets\n\nThe  Company  applies  the  expected  credit loss  model  for  recognising  impairment  loss on  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised cost, debt instruments classified as FVTOCI, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract  assets,  finance  lease  receivables and  other  financial  assets.  Expected  credit loss is the difference between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows that the entity expects  to  receive  discounted  using  the effective interest rate.\n\nLoss allowances for trade receivables, unbilled  receivables,  contract  assets  and finance  lease  receivables  are  measured  at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss. Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected  credit  losses  that  result  from  all possible  default  events  over  the  expected life of a financial instrument. Lifetime expected  credit  loss  is  computed  based  on a provision matrix which takes in to account, risk  profiling  of  customers  and  historical credit  loss  experience  adjusted  for  forward looking information.

If any such indication exists, the Company  estimates  the  recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary. The recoverable amount of such investment is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (' FVLCD ') and its value-in-use (' VIU '). The VIU of the investment is calculated using projected future cash flows. If the recoverable amount of  the  investment  is  less  than  its  carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## C)  Non-financial assets\n\nThe  Company  assesses  long-lived  assets such as property, plant and equipment, RoU assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. If  any  such  indication  exists,  the  Company estimates  the  recoverable  amount  of  the asset or group of assets.\n\nGoodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  at  least annually at the same time and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  cash generating unit is less than its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating  units  which  represents  the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value\n\nless cost of disposal (' FVLCD ') and its valuein-use (' VIU '). The VIU of long-lived assets is calculated using projected future cash flows. FVLCD of a cash generating unit is computed using  turnover  and  earnings  multiples.  If the recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable  amount  of  the  cash  generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its  carrying  amount,  the  carrying  amount is  reduced  to  its  recoverable  amount.  The reduction  is  treated  as  an  impairment  loss and  is  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit and loss.\n\nIf at the reporting date, there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss on  property,  plant  and  equipment,  RoU assets  and  intangible  assets,  no  longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the impairment losses previously recognised are reversed such that the asset is recognised at its recoverable amount but not  exceeding  written  down  value  which would have been reported if the impairment losses had not been recognised initially. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed subsequently.\n\n## (x)  Employee benefits\n\n## a)  Post-employment plans\n\nThe Company participates in various employee benefit  plans.  Pensions  and  other post-employment  benefits  are  classified  as either  defined  contribution  plans  or  defined benefit  plans.  Under  a  defined  contribution plan,  the  Company's  sole  obligation  is  to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits. The related actuarial and investment risks are borne by the employee. The expenditure for defined contribution plans is recognised as an expense during the period when the employee provides  service.  Under  a  defined  benefit plan, it is the Company's obligation to provide agreed benefits to the employees. The related actuarial  and  investment  risks  are  borne by  the  Company.  The  present  value  of  the defined benefit obligations is calculated by an\n\n<!-- image -->",

The actual  return  on  the  plan  assets  above  or below the discount rate is recognised as part of  remeasurements  of  the  defined  benefit plans through other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\nThe  Company  has  the  following  employee benefit plans:\n\n## A.  Provident fund\n\nEligible employees receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employer  and  employees  make  periodic contributions  to  the  approved  provident fund  trust  managed  by  the  Company.  A portion of the employer's contribution is made  to  the  government  administered pension fund. The contributions to the  trust  managed  by  the  Company  is accounted for as a defined benefit plan as the Company is liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return.\n\nCertain employees receive benefits under  the  provident  fund  plan  in  which both the employer and employees make periodic contributions to the government administered  provident  fund.  A  portion of  the  employer's  contribution  is  made to the government administered pension fund.  This  is  accounted  as  a  defined contribution plan as the obligation of the Company  is  limited  to  the  contributions made to the fund.\n\n## B.  Gratuity and foreign pension\n\nIn accordance  with  the  Payment  of Gratuity  Act,  1972,  applicable  for  Indian companies, the Company provides for a lump  sum  payment  to  eligible employees,  at  retirement  or  termination of employment based on the last drawn salary and years of employment with the Company. The gratuity fund is managed by the third-party fund managers.\n\nThe Company also maintains pension and similar plans for employees outside India, based  on  country  specific  regulations. These plans are partially funded, and the funds  are  managed  by  third  party  fund managers. The plans provide for monthly payout  after  retirement  as  per  salary drawn and service period or for a lump sum payment as set out in rules of each fund.\n\nThe  Company's  obligations  in  respect of  the  above  plans,  which  are  defined benefit  plans,  are  provided  for  based  on actuarial  valuation  using  the  projected unit credit method.\n\n## C.  Superannuation\n\nSuperannuation plan, a defined contribution  scheme  is  administered  by third party fund managers. The Company makes  annual  contributions  based  on a  specified  percentage  of  each  eligible employee's salary.\n\n## b)  Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are expensed when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\n## c)  Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term employee  benefit obligations such as cash bonus, management incentive plans  or  profit  sharing  plans  are  measured on an undiscounted basis and are recorded as expense as the related service is provided. A  liability  is  recognised  for  the  amount expected  to  be  paid  under  short-term  cash bonus, management incentive plans or profit-\n\n.",

The  employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilised accumulating  compensated  absences  and utilise it in future periods or receive cash at retirement  or  termination  of  employment. The  Company  records  an  obligation  for compensated  absences  in  the  period  in which  the  employee  renders  the  services that increases this entitlement. The Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company  expects  to  pay  as  a  result  of  the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The Company recognises accumulated compensated absences based on actuarial valuation using  the  projected  unit  credit  method. Non-accumulating  compensated  absences are  recognised  in  the  period  in  which  the absences occur.\n\n## (xi)  Share-based payment transactions\n\nSelected  employees  of  the  Company  receive remuneration  in  the  form  of  equity  settled instruments or cash settled instruments, for  rendering  services  over  a  defined  vesting period  and  for  Company's  performance-based stock  options  over  the  defined  period.  Equity instruments granted are measured by reference to  the  fair  value  of  the  instrument  at  the  date of  grant.  In  cases,  where  equity  instruments are  granted  at  a  nominal  exercise  price,  the intrinsic value on the date of grant approximates the fair value. The  expense  is  recognised in  the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  with  a corresponding  increase  to  the  share  options outstanding account, a component of equity.\n\nThe equity instruments or cash settled instruments generally vest in a graded manner over the vesting period. The fair value determined\n\nat  the  grant  date  is  expensed  over  the  vesting period  of  the  respective  tranches  of  such grants  (accelerated  amortisation).  The  stock compensation expense is determined based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments or cash settled instruments that will eventually vest.\n\nCash Settled instruments granted are re-measured  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  at the end of each reporting period and at the time of  vesting.  The  expense  is  recognised  in  the statement of profit and loss with a corresponding increase to the financial liability.\n\n## (xii) Provisions\n\nProvisions  are  recognised  when  the  Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow  of  economic  benefits  will  be  required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the  obligation.\n\nThe  amount  recognised  as  a  provision  is  the best  estimate  of  the  consideration  required to  settle  the  present  obligation  at  the  end  of the reporting  period,  considering  the  risks and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  obligation.\n\nWhen  some  or  all  of  the  economic  benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered  from  a  third  party,  the  receivable  is recognised as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of  the  receivable  can  be  measured  reliably.\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognised when  the  expected  benefits  to  be  derived  by the  Company  from  a  contract  are  lower  than the  unavoidable  costs  of  meeting  the  future obligations  under  the  contract.  Provisions  for onerous contracts are measured at the present value  of  lower  of  the  expected  net  cost  of fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of terminating the contract.\n\n## (xiii) Revenue\n\nThe Company derives revenue primarily from  software  development,  maintenance  of software/hardware and related services, consulting  services,  business  process  services and sale of IT products.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenue  is  recognised upon  transfer  of  control  of  promised  products or  services  to  customers  in  an  amount  that reflects the consideration the Company expects to  receive  (the  'Transaction  Price').  Revenue towards satisfaction of the performance obligation  is  measured  at  the  amount  of  the Transaction Price (net of variable consideration on account of discounts and allowances) allocated  to  that  performance  obligation.  To recognise revenues, the Company applies the  following  five  step  approach:  (1)  identify the  contract  with  a  customer,  (2)  identify  the performance  obligations  in  the  contract,  (3) determine the Transaction Price, (4) allocate the Transaction Price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognise revenues when a  performance  obligation  is  satisfied.  When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\n\nAt  contract  inception,  the  Company  assesses its  promise  to  transfer  products  or  services  to a  customer  to  identify  separate  performance obligations.  The  Company  applies  judgement to  determine  whether  each  product  or  service promised  to  a  customer  is  capable  of  being distinct,  and  are  distinct  in  the  context  of  the contract,  if  not,  the  promised  products  or services  are  combined  and  accounted  as  a single  performance  obligation.  The  Company allocates  the  Transaction  Price  to  separately identifiable petrformance  obligations based on  their  relative  stand-alone  selling  price  or residual  method.  Stand-alone  selling  prices are  determined  based  on  sale  prices  for  the components when it is regularly sold separately, in cases  where  the  Company  is  unable  to determine  the  stand-alone  selling  price,  the Company  uses  third-party  prices  for  similar deliverables  or  the  Company  uses  expected cost-plus  margin  approach  in  estimating  the stand-alone selling price.\n\nFor  performance  obligations  where  control  is transferred over time, revenues are recognised by  measuring  progress  towards  completion  of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the promised products or services to be provided.\n\nThe  method  for  recognising  revenues  and costs depends on the nature of contracts with customers as given below:\n\n## A.  Time and materials contracts\n\nRevenues  and  costs  relating  to  time  and materials  contracts  are  recognised  as  the related services are rendered.\n\n## B.  Fixed-price contracts\n\n## i) Fixed-price development contracts\n\nRevenues  from  fixed-price  development contracts, including software development,  and  integration  contracts, where  the  performance  obligations  are satisfied  over  time,  are  recognised  using the  'percentage-of-completion'  method. The performance obligations are satisfied as  and  when  the  services  are  rendered since  the  customer  generally  obtains control  of  the  work  as  it  progresses. Percentage  of  completion  is  determined based  on  project  costs  incurred  to  date as a percentage of total estimated project costs  required  to  complete  the  project. The cost expended (or input) method has been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between  input  and  productivity.  This method  is  followed  when  reasonably dependable  estimates  of  the  revenues and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the future costs  to  complete  include  estimates of  future  labor  costs  and  productivity efficiencies. Because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  that  are  assessed  continually during  the  term  of  these  contracts, revenue  recognised,  profit  and  timing\n\n.",

If the Company is not able to reasonably measure  the  progress  of  completion, revenue is recognised only to the extent of costs incurred for which recoverability is  probable.

Contract assets primarily relate to unbilled amounts on fixed-price development contracts and are classified as non-financial asset as the contractual right  to  consideration  is  dependent  on completion of contractual milestones.\n\nA contract liability is an entity's obligation  to  transfer  goods  or  services to  a  customer  for  which  the  entity  has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer.\n\n## ii)  Maintenance contracts\n\nRevenues related to fixed-price maintenance  contracts  are  recognised on a straight-line basis when services are performed  through  an  indefinite  number of  repetitive  acts  over  a  specified  period or ratably using percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the  services  rendered  to  the  customers and  the  cost  to  fulfil  the  contract  is  not even  through  the  period  of  contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive.\n\nRevenue  for  contracts  in  which  the invoicing  is  representative  of  the  value being delivered is recognised based on  our  right  to  invoice.  If  our  invoicing is  not  consistent  with  value  delivered,\n\nrevenues  are  recognised  as  the  service is  performed  using  the  percentage  of completion method.\n\nIn  certain  projects,  a  fixed  quantum  of service or output units is agreed at a fixed price  for  a  fixed  term.  In  such  contracts, revenue  is  recognised  with  respect  to the actual output achieved till date as a percentage  of  total  contractual  output. Any  residual  service  unutilised  by  the customer  is  recognised  as  revenue  on completion of the term.\n\n## iii)  Element or Volume based contracts\n\nRevenues and costs are recognised as the related services are rendered.\n\n## C.  Products\n\nRevenue  on  product  sales  are  recognised when  the  customer  obtains  control  of  the specified product.\n\n## D.  Others\n\n- \u00b7 Any change in scope or price is considered as a contract modification. The Company accounts  for  modifications  to  existing contracts by assessing whether  the services added are distinct and whether the  pricing  is  at  the  stand-alone  selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted  for  prospectively,  either  as  a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the stand-alone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the stand-alone selling price.\n- \u00b7 The Company  accounts  for variable considerations  like,  volume  discounts, rebates and pricing incentives to customers  and  penalties  as  reduction of  revenue  on  a  systematic  and  rational basis  over  the  period  of  the  contract. The Company  estimates  an  amount of such  variable consideration using expected  value  method  or  the  single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration depending on which\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  such cases,  the  Company  evaluates  whether the  Company  is  the  principal  (i.e.  report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e. report revenues on a net basis). In doing so,  the  Company  first  evaluates  whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it has the primary  obligation  to  fulfill  the  contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the  goods  or  services  and  therefore,  is acting  as  a  principal  or  an  agent.  If  the Company  controls  the  good  or  service before it is transferred to the customer, the  Company  is  the  principal;  if  not,  the Company is the agent.\n- \u00b7 Estimates  of  the  Transaction  Price  and total  costs  or  efforts  are  continuously monitored over the term of the contract and  are  recognised  in  net  profit  in  the period  when  these  estimates  change or when  the  estimates  are  revised. Revenues  and  the  estimated  total  costs or  efforts  are  subject  to  revision  as  the contract progresses.\n- \u00b7 The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties at the time when the revenue is recognised. The accruals are based on the  Company's  historical  experience  of material usage and service delivery costs.\n- \u00b7 Incremental  costs  that  relate  directly to a contract and incurred in securing a contract with a customer are recognised\n\nas an asset when the Company expects to recover these costs.\n\n- \u00b7 The Company recognises contract fulfilment cost as an asset if those costs specifically  relate  to  a  contract  or  to  an anticipated contract, the costs generate or  enhance  resources  that  will  be  used in satisfying performance  obligations in  future;  and  the  costs  are  expected  to be recovered.\n- \u00b7 Costs  to  obtain  contract  relating  to upfront payments  to  customers  are amortised to revenue and other costs to obtain contract and costs to fulfill contract are  amortised  to  cost  of  sales  over  the respective  contract  life  on  a  systematic basis  consistent  with  the  transfer  of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates.\n- \u00b7 The  Company  assesses  the  timing  of the  transfer  of  goods  or  services  to  the customer  as  compared  to  the  timing of  payments  to  determine  whether  a significant  financing  component  exists. As  a  practical  expedient,  the  Company does  not  assess  the  existence  of  a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is twelve months or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other  than  the  provision  of  finance  to either  the  customer  or  us,  no  financing component is deemed to exist.\n- \u00b7 Unbilled  receivables  are  classified  as a  financial  asset  where  the  right  to consideration  is  unconditional  and  only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.\n\n## (xiv)  Finance costs\n\nFinance costs comprises interest on borrowings, interest  on  lease  liabilities,  interest  on  tax matters, interest on net defined benefit liability, net loss on translation or settlement of foreign currency  borrowings,  changes  in  fair  value  of derivative  instruments  and  gains/(losses)  of settlement of borrowing related derivative instruments.

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## (xvi) Income tax\n\nIncome  tax  comprises  current  and  deferred tax.  Income  tax  expense  is  recognised  in  the statement  of  profit  and  loss  except  to  the extent  it  relates  to  a  business  combination,  or items  directly  recognised  in  equity  or  in  other comprehensive income.\n\n## a)  Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities based on the taxable income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date and applicable for the period. While determining the tax provisions, the Company assesses whether each uncertain  tax  position  is  to  be  considered separately  or  together  with  one  or  more uncertain tax positions depending upon the nature and circumstances of each uncertain tax  position.  The  Company  offsets  current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it  has  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off the recognised amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and liability simultaneously.\n\n## b)  Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is recognised using the balance  sheet  approach.  Deferred  income\n\ntax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in these standalone financial statements, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor  taxable  profits  or  loss  at  the  time  of the transaction.\n\nDeferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences that  is  expected  to  reverse  within  the  tax holiday period, taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and  foreign branches  where the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary difference can  be  controlled  and  it  is probable  that  the  temporary  difference  will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets  is  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to  apply  in  the  period  when  the  asset  is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nThe  Company  offsets  deferred  income  tax assets and liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against  current  tax  liabilities, and  they relate  to  taxes  levied  by  the  same  taxation authority on either the same taxable entity,\n\n<!-- image -->",

Diluted  earnings  per share  is  computed  using  the  weighted-average number of equity and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock  method  for  options,  except  where  the results would be anti-dilutive.\n\nThe  number  of  equity  shares  and  potentially dilutive  equity  shares  are  adjusted  retrospectively  for  all  periods  presented  for  any  splits and  bonus  shares  issues  including  for  change effected prior to the approval of the standalone financial statements by the Board of Directors.\n\n## (xviii) Statement of cash flows\n\nCash  flows  are  reported  using  the  indirect method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for  the  effects  of  transactions  of  a  non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income  or  expenses  associated  with  investing or  financing  cash  flows.  The  cash  generated from/(used in) operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.\n\n## NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY EFFECTIVE FROM APRIL 1, 2023:\n\n## i. Amendments to Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment  Rules,  2023  effective  from  April  1, 2023.  The  amendments  to  Ind  AS  12  clarify  how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such  as  leases  and  decommissioning  obligations. In  specified  circumstances,  companies  are  exempt from  recognising  deferred  tax  when  they  recognise\n\n.\n\nassets or liabilities for the first time. The amendments clarify that this exemption  does  not  apply  to transactions  such  as  leases  and  decommissioning obligations and companies are required to recognise  deferred  tax  on  such  transactions.  The adoption  of  these  amendments  to  Ind  AS  12  did not  have  any  material  impact  on  the  standalone financial statements.\n\n## ii. Amendments to Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment  Rules,  2023  effective  from  April  1, 2023.  This  amendment  requires  the  companies  to disclose  their  material  accounting  policies  rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy  information,  together  with  other  information, is  material  when  it  can  reasonably  be  expected to  influence  decisions  of  primary  users  of  general purpose  financial statements.  The  adoption  of these  amendments  to  Ind  AS  1  did  not  have  any material impact on the standalone financial statements.\n\n## iii. Amendments to Ind AS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 effective from April 1, 2023. This  amendment  has  introduced  a  definition  of 'accounting  estimates'  and  included  amendments to  Ind  AS  8  to  help  companies  distinguish  changes in  accounting  policies  from  changes  in  accounting estimates.  The  adoption  of  these  amendments  to Ind  AS  8  did  not  have  any  material  impact  on  the standalone financial statements.\n\n## NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY:\n\nMinistry of Corporate Affairs ('MCA') notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to the Company.",

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe movement in goodwill balance is given below:\n\n|                                        | Year ended   March 31, 2024   | Year ended   March 31, 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Balance at the beginning of the year   | '   4,604                     | '   4,604                     |\n| Additions through Business combination | -                             | -                             |\n| Balance at the end of the year         | '   4,604                     | '   4,604                     |\n\nThe Company is organised by two operating segments: IT Services and IT Products. Goodwill as at March 31, 2024 and 2023 has been allocated to the IT Services operating segment.\n\nEffective  April  1,  2023,  the  Company  has  reorganised  its  segments  by  merging  India  State  Run  Enterprises (' ISRE ')  segment  as  part  of  its  Asia  Pacific  Middle  East  and  Africa  (' APMEA ')  within  IT  Services  segment. Comparative period information has been restated to give effect to this change.\n\nGoodwill recognised on business combinations is allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGUs), within the IT Services operating segment, which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisitions.\n\n|            | As at March 31, 2024   | As at March 31, 2023   |\n|------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| CGUs       |                        |                        |\n| Americas 1 | '   7                  | '   7                  |\n| Americas 2 | 3,902                  | 3,902                  |\n| Europe     | 5                      | 5                      |\n| APMEA      | 690                    | 690                    |\n| Total      | '   4,604              | '   4,604              |\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a CGU representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the Company's procedure for determining the recoverable value of each CGU.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on FVLCD. The FVLCD of the CGU is determined based on the market capitalisation approach, using the turnover and earnings multiples derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is categorised as a level 2 fair value based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nBased on the above testing, no impairment was identified as at March 31, 2024 and 2023 as the recoverable value of the CGUs exceeded the carrying value. A sensitivity analysis to the change in the key parameters (turnover and earnings multiples), did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU's recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.\n\nThe movement in other intangible assets is given below:\n\n|                                         | Other intangible assets   | Other intangible assets   | Other intangible assets   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                         | Customer-related          | Marketing-related         | Total                     |\n| Gross carrying value:                   |                           |                           |                           |\n| As at April 1, 2023                     | '   2,295                 | '   32                    | '   2,327                 |\n| As at March 31, 2024                    | '   2,295                 | '   32                    | '   2,327                 |\n| Accumulated amortisation/impairment:    |                           |                           |                           |\n| As at April 1, 2023                     | '   1,006                 | '   16                    | '   1,022                 |\n| Amortisation                            | 287                       | 5                         | 292                       |\n| As at March 31, 2024                    | '   1,293                 | '   21                    | '   1,314                 |\n| Net carrying value as at March 31, 2024 | '   1,002                 | '   11                    | '   1,013                 |\n\n.",

In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis and hence are not offset.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease  receivables,  employee  and  other  advances,  loans  to  subsidiaries,  eligible  current  and  non-current  assets, borrowings, lease liabilities, trade payables, and eligible current liabilities and non-current liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, short-term borrowings, lease liabilities, trade payables, other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amount largely due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Finance lease receivables are periodically evaluated based on individual credit worthiness of customers. Based on this evaluation, the Company records allowance for estimated credit losses on these receivables. As at March 31, 2024, and 2023 the carrying value of such financial assets, net of allowances, and liabilities approximates the fair value.\n\nInvestments in short-term mutual funds and fixed maturity plan mutual funds, which are classified as FVTPL are measured using net asset values at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held. Fair value of investments in non-convertible debentures, government securities, commercial papers, certificate of deposit and bonds classified as FVTOCI is determined based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market at the reporting date. Fair value of investments in equity instruments classified as FVTOCI or FVTPL is determined using market approach primarily based on market multiples method.\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable market inputs including currency spot and forward rates, yield curves and currency volatility.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in the statement of profit and loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\nThe  following  table  summarises  activity  in  the  cash  flow  hedging  reserve  within  equity  related  to  all  derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges:\n\n|                                                                                                        | As at   March 31, 2024   | As at   March 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Balance as at the beginning of the year                                                                | '  (1,762)               | '  1,943                 |\n| Changes in fair value of effective portion of derivatives                                              | 1,063                    | (4,839)                  |\n| Deferred cancellation gain/(loss), net                                                                 | 40                       | -                        |\n| Net (gain)/loss reclassified to statement of profit and loss on occurrence of hedged  transactions (1) | 1,183                    | 1,134                    |\n| Gain/(loss) on cash flow hedging derivatives, net                                                      | '  2,286                 | '  (3,705)               |\n| Balance as at the end of the year                                                                      | '  524                   | '  (1,762)               |\n| Deferred tax asset/(liability) thereon                                                                 | (125)                    | 359                      |\n| Balance as at the end of the year, net of deferred taxes                                               | '  399                   | '  (1,403)               |\n\nThe related hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedging reserves as at March 31, 2024 are expected to occur and be reclassified to the statement of profit and loss over a period of one year.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material gains or losses on derivative transactions or portions thereof that have become ineffective as hedges or associated with an underlying exposure that did not occur.\n\n## Sale of financial assets\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  in  the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Company  transfers  accounts  receivables,  unbilled receivables,  net  investment  in  finance  lease  receivables  (financial  assets)  to  banks.  Under  the  terms  of  the arrangements,  the  Company  either  substantially  transfers  its  risks  and  rewards  or  surrenders  control  over the  financial  assets  and  transfer  is  without  recourse.  Accordingly,  on  such  transfers  the  financial  assets  are derecognised  and  considered  as  sale  of  financial  assets.  Gains  and  losses  on  sale  of  financial  assets  without recourse  are  recorded  at  the  time  of  sale  based  on  the  carrying  value  of  the  financial  assets  and  fair  value  of servicing liability. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 is not material.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  value  of  a  financial  instrument  may  change  as  a  result  of  changes  in the  interest  rates,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  other  market  changes  that  affect  market  risk  sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.\n\nThe Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities  in  foreign  currency.  The  objective  of  market  risk  management  is  to  avoid  excessive  exposure  of  the Company's earnings and equity to losses.\n\n## Risk Management Procedures\n\nThe  Company  manages  market  risk  through  a  corporate  treasury  department,  which  evaluates  and  exercises independent  control  over  the  entire  process  of  market  risk  management.  The  corporate  treasury  department recommends risk management objectives and policies, which are approved by our senior management and Audit Committee.  The  activities  of  this  department  include  management  of  cash  resources,  implementing  hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe  Company  operates  internationally,  and  a  major  portion  of  its  business  is  transacted  in  several  currencies. Consequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States of America and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies.  The  exchange  rate  risk  primarily  arises  from  foreign  exchange  revenue,  receivables,  cash  balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large  portion  of  costs  are  in  Indian  rupees.  The  exchange  rate  between  the  rupee  and  these  currencies  has fluctuated  significantly  in  recent  years  and  may  continue  to  fluctuate  in  the  future.  Appreciation  of  the  rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative  instruments  to  mitigate  such  exposure.  The  Company  follows  established  risk  management  policies, including  the  use  of  derivatives  like  foreign  exchange  forward/option  contracts  to  hedge  forecasted  cash  flows denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, a ' 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the US dollar would result in approximately ' 2,801  (statement of profit and loss ' 987  and  other  comprehensive income ' 1,814)  decrease in the fair value, and a ' 1 decrease would result in approximately ' 2,877 (statement of profit and loss ' 987 and other comprehensive income ' 1,890) increase in the fair value of foreign currency dollar denominated derivative instruments (forward and option contracts).\n\n.",

Refer to Note 9 for changes in allowance for lifetime expected credit loss.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty  risk  encompasses  issuer  risk  on  marketable  securities,  settlement  risk  on  derivative  and  money market contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimised by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at  a  reasonable  price.  The  Company's  corporate  treasury  department  is  responsible  for  liquidity  and  funding as  well  as  settlement  management.  In  addition,  processes  and  policies  related  to  such  risks  are  overseen  by senior management. Management monitors the Company's net liquidity position through rolling forecasts based on  the  expected  cash  flows.  As  at  March  31,  2024,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  held  with  major  banks  and financial institutions.\n\nThe table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities at  the  reporting  date.  The  amounts  include  estimated  interest  payments  and  exclude  the  impact  of  netting agreements, if any.\n\n|                             | As at March 31, 2024   | As at March 31, 2024   | As at March 31, 2024   | As at March 31, 2024   | As at March 31, 2024   | As at March 31, 2024                     | As at March 31, 2024   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                             | Less than   1 year     | 1-2 years              | 2-4 years              | Beyond   4 years       | Total cash  flows      | Interest  included in  total cash  flows | Carrying  value        |\n| Borrowings  (1)             | '  42,685              | '  -                   | '  -                   | '  -                   | '  42,685              | '  (935)                                 | '  41,750              |\n| Lease liabilities  (1)      | 4,020                  | 2,861                  | 2,149                  | 1,256                  | 10,286                 | (1,041)                                  | 9,245                  |\n| Trade payables              | 58,394                 | -                      | -                      | -                      | 58,394                 | -                                        | 58,394                 |\n| Other financial liabilities | 22,403                 | -                      | -                      | -                      | 22,403                 | -                                        | 22,403                 |\n| Derivative liabilities      | 532                    | -                      | -                      | -                      | 532                    | -                                        | 532                    |\n\n.",

Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nIn assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards become deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realise the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.\n\nThe Company has recognised deferred tax assets of ' 766 and ' 1,011 as at March 31, 2024 and 2023 primarily in respect of  capital  loss  incurred  on  account  of  liquidation  of  an  investment.  Management's  projections  of  future taxable capital gain support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilise this deferred tax asset.\n\nWe have calculated our domestic tax liability under normal provisions. Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recognised towards MAT in the balance sheet for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The effective MAT rate is 17.47%. The excess tax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward for a period of fifteen years and set-off against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions.\n\nA substantial portion of the profits of the Company's India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits  attributable  to  export  operations  and  profits  from  units  established  under  Special  Economic  Zone  Act, 2005 scheme. Units in designated special economic zones providing service on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction of 100 percent of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of provision of services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years. 50% tax deduction is available for a further five years subject to the unit meeting certain defined conditions. Profits from certain other undertakings are also eligible for preferential tax treatment. New SEZ units set up on or after April 1,  2021  are  not  eligible  for  aforesaid  deduction.  The  tax  holiday  period  being  currently  available  to  the  Company expires in various years through fiscal 2034-35. The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of ' 14,308 and ' 16,718 for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we estimate the Company would have been required to pay if these incentives had not\n\n<!-- image -->",

The per share effect of these tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was ' 2.71 and ' 3.05, respectively.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences  associated  with  US  branch  profit  tax  where  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, deferred income tax liabilities on branch profit tax @ 15% of the US branch profits have not been recognised. Further, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.\n\n## 22.  REVENUE FROM OPERATIONS\n\n## A.

Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based.\n\n.",

Some of the claims involve complex issues and it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of such proceedings. However, the resolution of these legal proceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n\nThe Company's assessments are completed for the years up to March 31, 2019. The Company has received demands on multiple tax issues. These claims are primarily arising out of denial of deduction under section 10A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of profit earned by the Company's undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bengaluru, the appeals filed against the said demand before the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by the second Appellate authority for the years up to March 31, 2008 which either has been or may be contested by the Income tax authorities before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Other claims relate to disallowance of tax benefits\n\n.",

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  section  of  our report.  We  are  independent  of  the  Group  in  accordance with  the  Code  of  Ethics  issued  by  the  Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India ('ICAI') together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  under  the  provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities  in  accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbelieve that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\nKey  audit  matter  is  a  matter  that,  in  our  professional judgment, is of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter. We have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.\n\n## Revenue from fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method - Refer Notes 2 (iii)(a), 3(xiv)B and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matter Description\n\nRevenue  from  fixed-price  contracts,  including  software development, and integration contracts, where the performance  obligations  are  satisfied  over  time,  is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\n\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project costs at completion. The  estimation  of  total  project  costs  involves  significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. In addition, provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the total estimated project costs.\n\nWe  identified  the  revenue  recognition  for  fixed-price contracts  where  the  percentage-of-completion  method is used as a key audit matter because of the significant judgement involved in estimating the efforts to complete such contracts.\n\nThis  estimate  has  a  high  inherent  uncertainty  and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred to-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the remaining performance obligations.\n\nThis  required  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  in evaluating  the  audit  evidence  supporting  estimated efforts to complete and a higher extent of audit effort to",

Reasonable assurance is  a  high  level  of  assurance  but  is  not  a  guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  SAs  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or the override of internal control.\n\n- \u00b7 Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing  our  opinion  on  whether  the  Company  and its  subsidiary  companies  incorporated  in  India,  has adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  place  and  the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt  on  the  ability  of  the  Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  or,  if  such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures,  and  whether  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nMateriality  is  the  magnitude  of  misstatements  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial  Statements  may  be  influenced.  We  consider quantitative  materiality  and  qualitative  factors  in  (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the  results  of  our  work;  and  (ii)  to  evaluate  the  effect of  any  identified  misstatements  in  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance of the Company and such other entities included in the\n\n<!-- image -->",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  orderly  and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the  respective  company's  policies,  the  safeguarding  of its  assets,  the  prevention  and  detection  of  frauds  and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,  and  the  timely  preparation  of  reliable  financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITY\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, and its subsidiary\n\ncompanies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with  the  Guidance  Note  on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal  financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements  and  their  operating  effectiveness.  Our audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  obtaining an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists, and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor's judgement,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  the  Company, and  its  subsidiary  companies,  which  are  companies incorporated in India.\n\n## MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nA  company's internal  financial  control  with  reference  to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles.

Due to rounding off, the numbers presented throughout the  document  may  not  add  up  precisely  to the  totals  and  percentages  may  not  precisely reflect the absolute  figures.  Previous  year figures have been regrouped/rearranged, wherever necessary.\n\n## (ii)  Basis of measurement\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items which have been measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind AS:\n\n- a. Derivative financial instruments;\n- b. Financial instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss;\n- c. The defined benefit liability/(asset) is recognised  as  the  present  value  of  defined benefit  obligation  less  fair  value  of  plan assets; and\n- d. Contingent  consideration  and  liability  on written put options.\n\n## (iii)  Use of estimates and judgment\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial statements  in  conformity  with  Ind  AS  requires the management to make judgments, accounting estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the application of accounting  policies  and  the reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  income and expenses. Accounting estimates are monetary amounts in the consolidated financial statements  that  are  subject  to  measurement uncertainty.  An  accounting  policy  may  require items  in  consolidated  financial  statements  to be measured at monetary amounts that cannot be  observed  directly  and  must  instead  be estimated. In such a case, management develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set  out  by  the  accounting  policy.  Developing accounting estimates involves the use of judgments or assumptions based on the latest available and reliable information. Actual results may differ from those accounting estimates.\n\n## 1.   THE COMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nWipro  Limited  (' Wipro '  or  the  ' Parent  Company '), together  with  its  subsidiaries  and  controlled  trusts (collectively,  ' we ', ' us ', ' our ', ' the  Company ' or the  ' Group ') is a  global  information  technology (' IT '), consulting  and  business  process  services (' BPS ') company.\n\nWipro is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. The address of its registered office is Wipro  Limited,  Doddakannelli,  Sarjapur  Road, Bengaluru - 560 035, Karnataka, India. The Company has its primary listing with BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company's American Depository Shares (' ADS ') representing equity shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors authorised these consolidated  financial statements  for  issue  on May 22, 2024.\n\n## 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## (i) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been prepared  in  compliance  with  Indian  Accounting Standards (' Ind AS '), the provisions of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 (' the Companies Act '), as applicable and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (' SEBI '). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules,  2015  and  amendments  issued thereafter.  The  accounting  policies  have  been consistently  applied  to  all  periods  presented  in these financial statements, except for the adoption of  new  accounting  standards,  amendments  and interpretations effective from April 1, 2023.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements correspond  to the classification provisions contained in Ind AS 1, 'Presentation of Financial Statements'.  For  clarity,  various  items  are aggregated  in  the  consolidated  statement  of profit and loss and consolidated balance sheet. These items are disaggregated separately in the notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements, where applicable.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Changes to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are changed and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about material areas of estimation, uncertainty  and  critical  judgments  in  applying accounting policies that have the material effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are included in the following notes:\n\n- a) Revenue recognition: The Company applies judgement  to  determine  whether  each product or service promised to a customer is capable of being distinct, and is distinct in  the  context  of  the  contract,  if  not,  the promised  product  or  service  is  combined and  accounted  as  a  single  performance obligation. The  Company  allocates  the Transaction  Price  (as  defined  below  in Note 3(xiv)) to separately identifiable performance obligation deliverables based on  their  relative  stand-alone  selling  price. In  cases  where  the  Company  is  unable  to determine  the  stand-alone  selling  price the Company  uses  expected  cost-plus margin  approach  in  estimating  the  standalone  selling  price.  The  Company  uses the percentage of completion method using the input (cost expended) method to measure  progress  towards  completion  in respect of fixed price contracts. Percentage of  completion  method  accounting  relies on  estimates  of  total  expected  contract revenue and costs. This method is followed when  reasonably  dependable  estimates  of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the future costs to complete include estimates of future  labor  costs  and  productivity efficiencies. Because the financial reporting  of  these  contracts  depends  on estimates  that  are  assessed  continually during the term of these contracts, revenue recognised,  profit  and  timing  of  revenue for remaining performance obligations are  subject  to  revisions  as  the  contract\n\nprogresses to completion. When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes  probable.  Volume  discounts  are recorded as a reduction of revenue. When the amount of discount varies with the levels of  revenue,  volume  discount  is  recorded based on estimate of future revenue from the customer.\n\n- b) Impairment  testing: Goodwill  recognised on  business  combination  is  tested  for impairment  at  least  annually  and  when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate  that  the  recoverable  amount  of goodwill or a cash generating unit to which goodwill pertains, is less than the carrying value.  The  Company  assesses  acquired intangible  assets  with  finite  useful  life  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating  unit  is  higher  of  value-in-use and  fair  value  less  cost  of  disposal.  The calculation  of  value-in-use  of  an  asset or  a  cash  generating  unit  involves  use  of significant estimates and assumptions which include turnover, growth rates and net margins used to calculate projected future cash  flows,  risk-adjusted  discount  rate, future economic and market conditions.\n- c) Income  taxes: The  major  tax  jurisdictions for  the  Company  are  India  and  the  United States of America.\n- Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes including judgment on whether tax positions are  probable  of  being  sustained  in  tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods.\n\nDeferred  tax  is  recorded  on  temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts, at  the  rates  that  have  been  enacted  or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The  ultimate  realisation  of  deferred  tax\n\n.",

The  Company  considers  expected  reversal of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  projected future taxable income  in  making  this assessment.  The  amount  of  deferred  tax assets considered realisable, however, could reduce in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.\n\n- d) Business combinations: In accounting for  business  combinations,  judgment  is required  to  assess  whether  an  identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating the  acquisition  date  fair  value  of  the identifiable assets acquired (including useful  life  estimates),  liabilities  assumed, and contingent consideration assumed involves management  judgment.  These measurements  are  based  on  information available  at  the  acquisition  date  and  are based  on  expectations  and  assumptions that  have  been  deemed  reasonable  by management. Changes in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially affect the results of operations.\n- e) Defined  benefit  plans  and  compensated absences: The  cost  of  the  defined  benefit plans,  compensated  absences  and  the present value of the defined benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions  that  may  differ  from  actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities  involved  in  the  valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these  assumptions.  All  assumptions  are reviewed at each reporting date.\n- f) Expected credit losses on financial assets: The  impairment  provisions  of  financial assets  are  based  on  assumptions  about\n\n- risk  of  default  and  expected  timing  of collection. The Company uses judgment in making  these  assumptions  and  selecting the  inputs  to  the  expected  credit  loss calculation based on the Company's history of collections, customer's creditworthiness, existing market  conditions  as  well  as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n- g) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment: The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives of the assets.  The  charge  in  respect  of  periodic depreciation is derived based on an estimate of  an  asset's  expected  useful  life  and  the expected residual value at the end of its life. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of  future  events,  which  may  impact  their life, such as changes in technology. The  estimated  useful  life  is  reviewed  at least annually.\n- h) Useful  lives  of  intangible  assets: The Company amortises intangible assets on  a  straight-line  basis  over  estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful life is estimated  based  on  a  number  of  factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand,  competition  and  other  economic factors such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances and the level of maintenance expenditures required to  obtain  the  expected  future  cash  flows from the assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- i) Provisions  and  contingent  liabilities :  The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events, and it is probable that outflow of resources will  be  required  to  settle  the  obligations. These  provisions  are  reviewed  at  the  end of each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n\nThe Company uses significant judgement to disclose  contingent  liabilities.

Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the financial statements.\n\n## 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\n\n## (i) Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries and controlled trusts\n\nThe  Company  determines  the  basis  of  control in line with the requirements  of Ind  AS 110, Consolidated Financial Statements . Subsidiaries  and  controlled  trusts  are  entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the parent has power over the entity, it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over  the  entity.  The  financial  statements  of subsidiaries and controlled trusts are included in the  consolidated  financial  statements  from  the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\n\nThe financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling  interests  in  the  net  assets (excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are  identified  separately  from  the  Company's equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders  may  be  initially  measured  either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate  share  of  the  fair  value  of  the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement  basis  is  made  on  an  acquisition to acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests\n\nis the  amount  of  those  interests  at  initial recognition  plus  the  non-controlling  interest's share  of  subsequent  changes  in  equity.  Total comprehensive  income  is  attributed  to  noncontrolling interests even if it results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.\n\n## Liability for written put options to noncontrolling interests\n\nAt initial recognition, the liability for put options issued to non-controlling interests, to be settled in  cash  by  the  Company,  which  do  not  grant present  access  to  ownership  interest  to  the Company  is  recognised  as  financial  liability  at present  value  of  the  redemption  amount  with a  corresponding  debit  in  other  components of equity.\n\n## Investments  accounted  for  using  the equity method\n\nInvestments  accounted  for  using  the  equity method  are  entities  in  respect  of  which,  the Company  has  significant  influence,  but  not control, over the financial and operating policies. Generally, a company has a significant influence if  it  holds  between  20  and  50  percent  of  the voting  power  of  another  entity.  Investments  in such entities are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying  amount  of  investment  is  increased/ decreased to recognise investors share of profit or loss of the investee after the acquisition date.\n\n## (ii) Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems  included  in  the  financial  statements  of each  of  the  Company's  entities  are  measured using  the  currency  of  the  primary  economic environment in which these entities operate (i.e. the  'functional  currency').  These  consolidated financial  statements  are  presented  in  Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company.\n\n## (iii) Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\n## a) Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currency are translated  into  the  respective  functional currencies using the exchange rates\n\n.",

Net  gain  relating  to  translation  or settlement  of  borrowings  denominated  in foreign  currency  are  reported  within  Other income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and measured  at  historical  cost  are  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction. Translation differences on nonmonetary financial assets measured at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as financial instruments measured at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income are included in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\n## b) Foreign operations\n\nFor the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations that have a functional currency other  than  Indian  rupees  are  translated into  Indian  rupees  using  exchange  rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange  rates  for  the  period.  Exchange differences  arising,  if  any,  are  recognised in  other  comprehensive  income  and  held in foreign currency translation reserve (' FCTR '), a component of equity, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to non-controlling interest. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant\n\namount  recognised  in  FCTR  is  transferred to  the  consolidated statement of profit and loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation  and  translated  at  the  exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.\n\n## c) Others\n\nForeign  currency  differences  arising  on  the translation or settlement of a financial liability designated  as  a  hedge  of  a  net  investment in  a  foreign  operation  are  recognised  in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the FCTR to the extent the hedge is effective. To the extent the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognised in the consolidated  statement  of  profit and loss.\n\nWhen the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the relevant amount recognised in  FCTR  is  transferred  to  the  consolidated statement  of  profit  and  loss  as  part  of  the profit  or  loss  on  disposal.  Foreign  currency differences arising from translation of intercompany receivables or payables relating to foreign operations, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of net investment in foreign operation and are recognised in FCTR.\n\n## (iv)   Financial instruments\n\n## A) Non-derivative financial instruments:\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets, which include cash and cash  equivalents,  trade  receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee and other advances,  investments  in  equity  and debt securities and eligible current and non-current assets; and\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities, which include borrowings, trade payables, lease liabilities and eligible current and noncurrent liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Trade  receivables  and  unbilled receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at the Transaction Price. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial  instruments  are  measured  as described below:\n\n## a. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents  consist  of  cash  on  hand and in banks and demand deposits with banks, which can be withdrawn at any time, without prior notice or penalty on the principal.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  consolidated statement  of  cash  flows,  cash  and cash equivalents include cash on hand,  in  banks  and  demand  deposits with  banks,  net  of  outstanding  bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand  and  are  considered  part  of the Company's cash management system.  In  the  consolidated  balance sheet,  bank  overdrafts  are  presented under borrowings within current financial liabilities.\n\n## b. Investments\n\nFinancial  instruments  measured  at amortised cost:\n\nDebt instruments that meet the following criteria are measured  at amortised cost (except for debt instruments that are designated at fair value  through  Profit  or  Loss  on  initial recognition):\n\n- \u00b7 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold  assets  in  order  to  collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the instrument  give  rise  on  specified dates to  cash  flows  that  are  solely\n\npayment of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nFinancial  instruments  measured  at  fair value through other comprehensive income ( 'FVTOCI' ):\n\nDebt  instruments  that  meet  the  following criteria are measured at FVTOCI (except for debt  instruments  that  are  designated  at fair  value  through  Profit  or  Loss  on  initial recognition):\n\n- \u00b7 the  asset  is  held  within  a  business model whose objective is achieved both by  collecting  contractual  cash  flows and selling the financial asset; and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nInterest income is recognised in the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss for FVTOCI debt instruments. Other changes in  fair  value  of  FVTOCI  financial  assets are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive income.  When  the  investment  is  disposed of,  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss  previously accumulated  in  reserves  is  transferred to  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit and loss.\n\nFinancial  instruments  measured  at  fair value through profit or loss ( 'FVTPL' ):\n\nInstruments that do not meet the amortised cost  or  FVTOCI  criteria  are  measured  at FVTPL.  Financial  assets  at  FVTPL  are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting  period,  with  any  gains  or  losses arising  on  re-measurement  recognised  in consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss. The gain or loss on disposal is recognised in  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit and loss.\n\nInterest income is recognised in the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss for FVTPL debt instruments.

At  initial  recognition,  the  Company  may make  an  irrevocable  election  to  present subsequent  changes  in  the  fair  value  of an  investment  in  an  equity  instrument  in other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or  through  statement  of  profit  and  loss (FVTPL).  For  investments  designated  to be  classified  as  FVTOCI,  movements  in fair value of investments are recognised in other comprehensive income and the gain or  loss  is  not  transferred  to  consolidated statement of profit and loss on disposal of investments.  For  investments  designated to be classified as FVTPL, both movements in fair value of investments and gain or loss on disposal of investments are recognised in  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit and loss.\n\nDividends  from  these  investments  are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company's right to receive dividends is established.\n\n## c. Other financial assets:\n\nOther financial assets are nonderivative  financial  assets  with  fixed or  determinable  payments  that  are not quoted in an active market. These comprise  trade  receivables,  unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee  and  other  advances  and eligible current and non-current assets. They are presented as current assets, except for those expected to be realised later than twelve months after the reporting date which are presented as  non-current  assets.  All  financial assets  are  initially  recognised  at  fair value and  subsequently  measured at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective interest method, less any impairment losses.  However, trade receivables and unbilled receivables that do not contain\n\na  significant  financing  component  are measured at the Transaction Price.\n\n## d. Trade payables and other liabilities:\n\nTrade  payables  and  other  liabilities are initially recognised at transaction price,  and  subsequently  carried  at amortised  cost  using  the  effective interest  method.  For  these  financial instruments,  the  carrying  amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. Contingent consideration recognised in a business combination is initially recognised at fair value and subsequently  measured  at  fair  value through profit or loss.\n\n## B)    Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency  fluctuations  on  foreign  currency assets, liabilities, net investment in foreign operations and  forecasted  cash  flows denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe  Company  limits  the  effect  of  foreign exchange  rate  fluctuations  by  following established risk management policies including the use of derivatives. The Company  enters  into  derivative  financial instruments  where  the  counterparty  is primarily a bank.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised  and  measured  at  fair  value. Attributable transaction costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as cost.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial  instruments  are  measured  as described below:\n\n## a. Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative hedging  instruments  designated  as a  cash  flow  hedge  are  recognised  in other comprehensive income and held in  cash  flow  hedging  reserve,  net  of taxes,  a  component  of  equity,  to  the extent  that  the  hedge  is  effective.

If the hedging  instrument  no  longer  meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated  or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in cash  flow  hedging  reserve  till the  period  the  hedge  was  effective remains  in  cash  flow  hedging  reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs.  The  cumulative  gain  or  loss previously recognised  in  the  cash flow  hedging  reserve  is  transferred  to the  consolidated  statement  of  profit and  loss  upon  the  occurrence  of  the related  forecasted  transaction.  If  the forecasted  transaction  is  no  longer expected  to  occur,  such  cumulative balance  is  immediately  recognised  in the  consolidated  statement  of  profit and loss.\n\n## b. Hedges of net investment in foreign operations\n\nThe  Company  designates  derivative financial  instruments  as  hedges  of net investments in foreign operations. The Company also designates foreign currency  denominated  borrowing  as a  hedge  of  net  investment  in  foreign operations.  Changes  in  the  fair  value of the derivative hedging instruments and gains/(losses) on translation or settlement  of  foreign  currency denominated  borrowings  designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations  are  recognised  in  other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the FCTR to the extent that  the  hedge  is  effective.  To  the extent  that  the  hedge  is  ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in\n\nthe  consolidated  statement  of  profit and  loss  and  reported  within  foreign exchange  gains/(losses),  net  within results from operating activities.\n\n## c. Others\n\nChanges in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments neither designated as cash flow hedges  nor  hedges  of  net  investment in foreign operations are recognised in the  consolidated  statement  of  profit and  loss  and  reported  within  foreign exchange  gains/(losses),  net  within results from operating activities. Changes in fair value and gains/(losses), net, on settlement of foreign currency derivative instruments relating to borrowings, which have not been designated as hedges are recorded in finance costs.\n\n## C) Derecognition of financial instruments\n\nThe  Company  derecognises  a  financial asset  when  the  contractual  rights  to  the cash  flows  from  the  financial  asset  expire or  it  transfers  the  financial  asset  and the  transfer  qualifies  for  derecognition under  Ind  AS  109.  If  the  Company  retains substantially all the risks and rewards of a transferred  financial  asset,  the  Company continues  to  recognise  the  financial  asset and recognises a borrowing for the proceeds received. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability)  is  derecognised  from  the Company's  consolidated  balance  sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\n## (v)  Equity and share capital\n\n## a) Share capital and Securities premium\n\nThe authorised share capital of the Company as at March 31, 2024 is ' 25,274 divided  into  12,504,500,000  equity  shares of ' 2 each, 25,000,000 preference shares of ' 10  each  and  150,000  10%  optionally convertible  cumulative  preference  shares of ' 100 each.

Cost  includes  expenditures  directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost till all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are substantially completed. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are derecognised upon sale and disposition of  the  asset  and  the  resultant  gains  and losses  are  recognised  in  the  consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nCapital  work-in-progress  are  measured  at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n## b) Depreciation\n\nThe  Company  depreciates  property,  plant and  equipment  over  the  estimated  useful life  on  a  straight-line  basis  from  the  date the assets are available for use. Leasehold improvements  are  amortised  over  the shorter of estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term. Term licenses are amortised  over  their  respective  contract term. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful life of assets is reviewed and where appropriate are adjusted, annually.  The  estimated  useful  lives  of assets are as follows:\n\n| Category                          | Useful life    |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                         | 28 to 40 years |\n| Plant and equipment               | 5 to 21 years  |\n| Computer equipment and software   | 2 to 7 years   |\n| Furniture, fixtures and equipment | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Vehicles                          | 4 to 5 years   |\n\nWhen  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant and equipment have different useful lives, they  are  accounted  for  as  separate  items (major components)  of  property,  plant and  equipment.  Subsequent  expenditure relating  to  property,  plant  and  equipment is capitalised only when it is probable that future  economic  benefits  associated  with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nDeposits and advances paid towards the  acquisition  of  property,  plant  and equipment outstanding as at each reporting date is classified as capital advances under other  non-current  assets  and  the  cost  of property, plant and equipment not available for use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress.\n\n## (vii)  Business combinations, Goodwill and Intangible assets\n\n## a) Business combinations\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for using  the  purchase  (acquisition)  method.\n\n.",

Identifiable assets acquired and  liabilities and  contingent  liabilities assumed  in  a  business  combination  are measured initially at fair value at the date of acquisition. Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe cost of an acquisition also includes the fair  value  of  any  contingent  consideration measured  as  at  the  date  of  acquisition. Any  subsequent  changes  to  the  fair  value of contingent consideration classified as liabilities, other than measurement period  adjustments,  are  recognised  in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\n## b)   Goodwill\n\nThe  excess  of  the  cost  of  an  acquisition over the Company's share in the fair value of  the  acquiree's  identifiable  assets  and liabilities  is  recognised  as  goodwill.  If  the excess  is  negative,  a  bargain  purchase gain  is  recognised  in  equity  as  capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment (if any).\n\nGoodwill  associated  with  disposal  of  an operation  that  is  part  of  cash-generating unit  is  measured  based  on  the  relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained, unless  some  other  method  better  reflects the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.\n\n## c) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  acquired  separately  are measured at cost of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.  Following  initial  recognition, intangible  assets  are  carried  at  cost  less accumulated  amortisation  and  impairment losses, if any.\n\nThe amortisation of an intangible asset with a  finite  useful  life  reflects  the  manner  in which  the  economic  benefit  is  expected  to be generated.\n\nThe  estimated  useful  life  of  amortisable intangibles is reviewed and where appropriate is adjusted, annually. The estimated  useful  lives  of  the  amortisable intangible assets are as follows:\n\n| Category                      | Useful life      |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| Customer-related intangibles  | 1  to  10  years |\n| Marketing-related intangibles | 2.5  to 10 years |\n\nCustomer-related intangibles includes customer contracts and customer relationships acquired as a part of Business combinations. Marketing-related intangibles includes  vendor  relationships  and  brand acquired as a part of Business combinations.\n\n## (viii)  Leases\n\n## The Company as a lessee\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  an  arrangement  for lease  of  land,  buildings,  plant  and  equipment including  computer  equipment  and  vehicles. Such  arrangements  are  generally  for  a  fixed period  but  may  have  extension  or  termination options.  The  Company  assesses,  whether  the contract is, or contains, a lease, at its inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to -\n\n- (a)  control use of an identified asset,\n- (b)  obtain substantially all the economic benefits from use of the identified asset, and\n- (c) direct the use of the identified asset.\n\nThe  Company  determines  the  lease  term  as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with periods covered by an option to extend the lease, where the Company is reasonably certain to  exercise  that  option.  The  Company  makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a  lease-by-lease  basis  and  thereby  assesses whether  it  is reasonably  certain  that  any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For these  short-term  and  low-value  leases,  the Company recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe  cost  of  the  RoU  assets  comprises  the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the inception date of the lease plus any initial direct costs, less any lease incentives received. Subsequently,  the  RoU  assets  are  measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment  losses,  if  any.  The RoU assets are depreciated using the straightline  method  from  the  commencement  date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of RoU assets. The estimated useful lives of RoU assets  are  determined  on  the  same  basis  as those of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Company applies Ind AS 36 to determine whether a RoU asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the impairment of non-financial assets below.\n\nFor lease liabilities at the commencement of the lease, the Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are  discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow funds, including the consideration of factors such as the nature of the asset and location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as applicable in a similar economic environment.\n\nAfter  the  commencement  date,  the  amount of  lease  liabilities  is  increased  to  reflect  the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently remeasured by  increasing  the  carrying  amount  to  reflect interest  on  the  lease  liability,  reducing  the\n\ncarrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect  any  lease  modifications.  The  Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of  lease  liability  due  to  modification  as  an adjustment to the RoU asset or in consolidated statement  of  profit  and  loss,  depending  upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the RoU asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nPayment  of  lease  liabilities  are  classified as  cash  used  in  financing  activities  in  the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## The Company as a lessor\n\nLeases  under  which  the  Company  is  a  lessor are  classified  as  a  finance  or  operating  lease. Lease contracts where all the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the lessee, are classified  as  a  finance  lease.  All  other  leases are classified as operating lease.\n\nFor  leases  under  which  the  Company  is  an intermediate  lessor,  the  Company  accounts for  the  head-lease  and  the  sub-lease  as  two separate  contracts.  The  sub-lease  is  further classified  either  as  a  finance  lease  or  an operating lease by reference to the RoU asset arising from the head-lease.\n\n## (ix) Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable  value,  including  necessary  provision for obsolescence. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.\n\n## (x)  Impairment\n\n## a) Financial assets\n\nThe  Company  applies  the  expected  credit loss model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortised cost, debt instruments classified as FVTOCI, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets, finance lease receivables, and other financial assets.

Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from  all  possible  default  events  over  the expected  life  of  a  financial  instrument. Lifetime expected credit loss is computed based on a provision matrix which takes in to account, risk profiling of customers and historical  credit  loss  experience  adjusted for  forward  looking  information.  For  other financial  assets,  expected  credit  loss  is measured  at  the  amount  equal  to  twelve months  expected  credit  loss  unless  there has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit risk from initial recognition, in which case those  are  measured  at  lifetime  expected credit loss.\n\n## b) Non-financial assets\n\nThe  Company  assesses  long-lived  assets such  as  property,  plant  and  equipment, RoU  assets  and  intangible  assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not  be  recoverable.  If  any  such  indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group of assets.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the same time and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  cash generating  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying value.  The  goodwill  impairment  test  is performed at the level of cash-generating unit  or  groups  of  cash-generating  units which  represents  the  lowest  level  at which  goodwill  is  monitored  for  internal management purposes.\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  or cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (' FVLCD ') and its value-in-use  (' VIU ').  The  VIU  of  long-lived assets is calculated using projected future cash flows. FVLCD of a cash generating unit is  computed  using  turnover  and  earnings multiples. If the recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  is  reduced  to  its  recoverable amount.  The  reduction  is  treated  as  an impairment  loss  and  is  recognised  in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nIf at the reporting date, there is an indication that  a  previously  assessed  impairment loss  on  property,  plant  and  equipment and RoU assets and intangible assets, no longer  exists,  the  recoverable  amount  is reassessed  and  the  impairment  losses previously recognised are reversed such that the asset is recognised at its recoverable amount  but  not  exceeding  written  down value which would have been reported if the impairment losses had not been recognised initially.  An  impairment  loss  in  respect  of goodwill is not reversed subsequently.\n\n## (xi)   Employee benefits\n\n## a)   Post-employment plans\n\nThe Group participates in various employee benefit  plans.  Pensions  and  other  postemployment benefits are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution plan, the Company's  sole  obligation  is  to  pay  a  fixed amount  with  no  obligation  to  pay  further contributions  if  the  fund  does  not  hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits. The  related  actuarial  and  investment  risks are borne by the employee. The expenditure for defined contribution plans is recognised as an expense during the period when the employee provides service. Under a defined benefit  plan,  it  is  the  Company's  obligation to provide agreed benefits to the employees. The  related  actuarial  and  investment  risks\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  present value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligations  is calculated by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\nRemeasurements  of  the  defined  benefit plans, comprising actuarial gains or losses, the  effect  of  changes  to  the  asset  ceiling, and  the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding interest) are immediately  recognised  in other  comprehensive  income,  net  of  taxes and  not  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  in subsequent period.\n\nNet  interest  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  is calculated by applying the discount rate used to  measure  the  defined  benefit  obligation to  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  or  asset. The actual return on the plan assets above or  below  the  discount  rate,  is  recognised as  part  of  remeasurements  of  the  defined benefit  plans  through  other  comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\nThe  Company  has  the  following  employee benefit plans:\n\n## A.   Provident fund\n\nEligible employees receive benefits under  the  Company's  provident  fund plan, into which both the employer and employees make periodic contributions to  the  approved  provident  fund  trust managed by the Company. A portion of the  employer's  contribution  is  made  to the  government  administered  pension fund.  The  contributions  to  the  trust managed by the Company is accounted for  as  a  defined  benefit  plan  as  the Company is liable for any shortfall in the fund  assets  based  on  the  government specified minimum rates of return.\n\nCertain employees receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employer and employees make periodic contributions to the government administered  provident  fund.  A  portion of  the  employer's  contribution  is  made to the government administered pension fund.  This  is  accounted  as  a  defined contribution plan as the obligation of the\n\nCompany is limited to the contributions made to the fund.\n\n## B.   Gratuity and foreign pension\n\nIn accordance  with  the  Payment  of Gratuity Act, 1972, applicable for Indian companies, the Company provides for  a  lump  sum  payment  to  eligible employees, at retirement or termination of employment based on the last drawn salary and years of employment with the Company. The gratuity fund is managed by third party fund managers.\n\nThe Company also maintains pension and similar plans for employees outside India, based  on  country  specific  regulations. These  plans  are  partially  funded,  and the  funds  are  managed  by  third  party fund  managers.  The  plans  provide  for monthly payout after retirement as per salary drawn and service period or for a lump sum payment as set out in rules of each fund.\n\nThe  Company's  obligations  in  respect of these plans, which  are  defined benefit plans, are provided for based on actuarial  valuation  using  the  projected unit credit method.\n\n## C.   Superannuation\n\nSuperannuation plan, a defined contribution scheme is administered by third party fund managers. The Company makes  annual  contributions  based  on a  specified  percentage  of  each  eligible employee's salary.\n\n## b)  Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are expensed when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\n## c)   Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term  employee  benefit  obligations such as cash bonus, management incentive plans  or  profit-sharing  plans  are  measured on an undiscounted basis and are recorded as expense as the related service is provided.\n\n.",

The  employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilised accumulating  compensated  absences  and utilise it in future periods or receive cash at retirement  or  termination  of  employment. The  Company  records  an  obligation  for compensated  absences  in  the  period  in which the employee renders the services that increases  this  entitlement.  The  Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The Company recognises accumulated compensated absences  based  on  actuarial  valuation using  the  projected  unit  credit  method. Non-accumulating  compensated  absences are  recognised  in  the  period  in  which  the absences occur.\n\n## (xii)  Share-based payment transactions\n\nSelected  employees  of  the  Company  receive remuneration  in  the  form  of  equity  settled instruments or cash settled instruments, for  rendering  services  over  a  defined  vesting period  and  for  Company's  performance-based stock  options  over  the  defined  period.  Equity instruments granted are measured by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date of  grant.  In  cases,  where  equity  instruments are  granted  at  a  nominal  exercise  price,  the intrinsic value on the date of grant approximates the fair value. The expense is recognised in the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss  with a  corresponding  increase  to  the  share  options outstanding account, a component of equity.\n\nThe equity instruments or cash settled instruments generally vest in a graded manner over the vesting period. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period  of  the  respective  tranches  of  such grants  (accelerated  amortisation).  The  stock compensation expense is determined based on the  Company's  estimate  of  equity  instruments or cash settled instruments that will eventually vest.\n\nCash  Settled  instruments  granted  are  remeasured by reference to the fair value at the end  of  each  reporting  period  and  at  the  time of  vesting.  The  expense  is  recognised  in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss with a corresponding increase to financial liability.\n\n## (xiii) Provisions\n\nProvisions  are  recognised  when  the  Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen  some  or  all  of  the  economic  benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered  from  a  third  party,  the  receivable  is recognised as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognised when  the  expected  benefits  to  be  derived  by the  Company  from  a  contract  are  lower  than the  unavoidable  costs  of  meeting  the  future obligations  under  the  contract.  Provisions  for onerous contracts are measured at the present value of lower of the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of terminating the contract.\n\n## (xiv) Revenue\n\nThe Company derives revenue primarily from software development, maintenance\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenue  is  recognised upon  transfer  of  control  of  promised  products or  services  to  customers  in  an  amount  that reflects the consideration the Company expects to  receive  (the  'Transaction  Price').  Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is  measured  at  the  amount  of  the  Transaction Price (net of variable consideration on account of discounts  and  allowances)  allocated  to that performance obligation. To recognise revenues,  the  Company  applies  the  following five  step  approach:  (1)  identify  the  contract with  a  customer,  (2)  identify  the  performance obligations  in  the  contract,  (3)  determine  the Transaction  Price,  (4)  allocate  the  Transaction Price  to  the  performance  obligations  in  the contract,  and  (5)  recognise  revenues  when a  performance  obligation  is  satisfied.  When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\n\nAt  contract  inception,  the  Company  assesses its promise to transfer products or services to a  customer  to  identify  separate  performance obligations.  The  Company  applies  judgement to  determine  whether  each  product  or  service promised  to  a  customer  is  capable  of  being distinct,  and  are  distinct  in  the  context  of  the contract,  if  not,  the  promised  products  or services are combined and accounted as a single performance obligation. The Company allocates the  Transaction  Price  to  separately  identifiable performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone  selling  price  or  residual  method. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on sale prices for the components when it  is  regularly  sold  separately,  in  cases  where the Company is unable to determine the standalone selling price, the Company uses third-party\n\nprices  for  similar  deliverables  or  the  Company uses  expected  cost-plus  margin  approach  in estimating the stand-alone selling price.\n\nFor  performance  obligations  where  control  is transferred over time, revenues are recognised by  measuring  progress  towards  completion  of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the promised products or services to be provided.\n\nThe  method  for  recognising  revenues  and costs depends on the nature of contracts with customers as given below:\n\n## A. Time and materials contracts\n\nRevenues  and  costs  relating  to  time  and materials  contracts  are  recognised  as  the related services are rendered.\n\n## B. Fixed-price contracts\n\n## i. Fixed-price development contracts\n\nRevenues from fixed-price development contracts, including software development, and integration contracts, where the performance obligations are  satisfied  over  time,  are  recognised using  the  'percentage-of-completion' method.  The  performance  obligations are  satisfied  as  and  when  the  services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses. Percentage of completion is  determined  based  on  project  costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated  project  costs  required  to complete the project. The cost expended (or  input)  method  has  been  used  to measure  progress  towards  completion as there is a direct relationship between input  and  productivity.  This  method  is followed  when  reasonably  dependable estimates  of  the  revenues  and  costs applicable  to  various  elements  of  the contract can be made. Key factors that are  reviewed  in  estimating  the  future costs  to  complete  include  estimates of  future  labor  costs  and  productivity\n\n.",

Because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during  the  term  of  these  contracts, revenue  recognised,  profit  and  timing of  revenue  for  remaining  performance obligations  are  subject  to  revisions  as the contract progresses to completion. If the Company is not able to reasonably measure  the  progress  of  completion, revenue is recognised only to the extent of costs incurred for which recoverability is probable. When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement, the estimated losses are recognised in the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and loss in the period in which such losses become probable based on the current contract estimates as an onerous contract provision.\n\nA contract asset is a right to consideration that  is  conditional  upon  factors  other than  the  passage  of  time.  Contract assets primarily relate to unbilled amounts  on  fixed-price  development contracts  and  are  classified  as  nonfinancial asset as the contractual right  to  consideration  is  dependent  on completion of contractual milestones.\n\nA contract liability is an entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer.\n\n## ii.   Maintenance contracts\n\nRevenues related to fixed-price maintenance  contracts  are  recognised on  a  straight-line  basis  when  services are  performed  through  an  indefinite number  of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customers and the cost to fulfil the contract is not even through the  period  of  contract  because  the services are generally discrete in nature\n\nand not repetitive.\n\nRevenue  for  contracts  in  which  the invoicing is representative of the value being  delivered  is  recognised  based on  our  right  to  invoice.  If  our  invoicing is  not  consistent  with  value  delivered, revenues are recognised as the service is  performed  using  the  percentage  of completion method.\n\nIn  certain  projects,  a  fixed  quantum of service or output units is agreed at a  fixed  price  for  a  fixed  term.  In  such contracts,  revenue  is  recognised  with respect  to  the  actual  output  achieved till date  as  a  percentage  of  total contractual output. Any residual service unutilised by the customer is recognised as revenue on completion of the term.\n\n## iii.   Element or Volume based contracts\n\nRevenues and costs are recognised as the related services are rendered.\n\n## C. Products\n\nRevenue  on  product  sales  are  recognised when  the  customer  obtains  control  of  the specified product.\n\n## D. Others\n\n- \u00b7 Any change in scope or price is considered to be a contract modification. The Company accounts for modifications to existing contracts by assessing whether the services added are distinct and whether the pricing is at the stand-alone selling price. Services added  that  are  not  distinct  are  accounted for  on  a  cumulative  catch  up  basis,  while those  that  are  distinct  are  accounted  for prospectively, either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the stand-alone selling price, or as a termination of  the  existing  contract  and  creation  of  a new contract if not priced at the stand-alone selling price.\n- \u00b7 The Company accounts for variable considerations like, volume discounts, rebates and pricing incentives to customers\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Company  estimates an  amount  of  such  variable  consideration using expected value method or the single most  likely  amount  in  a  range  of  possible consideration  depending  on  which  method better predicts the amount of consideration to which the Company may be entitled and when it is probable that a significant reversal of  cumulative  revenue  recognised  will  not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenues  are  shown  net  of  allowances/ returns,  sales  tax,  value  added  tax,  goods and services tax and applicable discounts.\n- \u00b7 The Company may enter into arrangements with third party suppliers to resell products or  services.  In  such  cases,  the  Company evaluates  whether  the  Company  is  the principal  (i.e.  report  revenues  on  a  gross basis)  or  agent  (i.e.  report  revenues  on  a net  basis).  In  doing  so,  the  Company  first evaluates  whether  the  Company  controls the good or service before it is transferred to  the  customer.  The  Company  considers whether  it  has  the  primary  obligation  to fulfil  the  contract,  inventory  risk,  pricing discretion  and  other  factors  to  determine whether it controls the goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or agent. If the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, the Company is the principal; if not, the Company is the agent.\n- \u00b7 Estimates  of  the  Transaction  Price  and total costs  or  efforts  are  continuously monitored over the term of the contract and are  recognised  in  net  profit  in  the  period when these estimates change or when the estimates  are  revised.  Revenues  and  the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses.\n- \u00b7 The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties at the time when the revenue is recognised. The accruals are based on the Company's historical experience of material usage and service delivery costs.\n- \u00b7 Incremental  costs  that  relate  directly  to  a contract and incurred in securing a contract with a customer are recognised as an asset when  the  Company  expects  to  recover these costs.\n- \u00b7 The Company recognises contract fulfilment cost  as  an  asset  if  those  costs  specifically relate  to  a  contract  or  to  an  anticipated contract,  the  costs  generate  or  enhance resources  that  will  be  used  in  satisfying performance  obligations  in  future;  and  the costs are expected to be recovered.\n- \u00b7 Costs to obtain contract relating to upfront payments  to  customers  are  amortised  to revenue and other costs to obtain and costs to  fulfill  contract  are  amortised  to  cost  of sales over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates.\n- \u00b7 The  Company  assesses  the  timing  of  the transfer of goods or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine  whether  a  significant  financing component exists. As a practical expedient, the Company does not assess the existence of  a  significant  financing  component  when the difference between payment and transfer  of  deliverables  is  twelve  months or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to  either  the  customer  or  us,  no  financing component is deemed to exist.\n- \u00b7 Unbilled receivables are classified as a financial asset where the right to consideration is unconditional and  only the  passage  of  time  is  required  before  the payment is due.\n\n## (xv)  Finance costs\n\nFinance costs comprises interest on borrowings, interest  on  lease  liabilities,  interest  on  tax matters, interest on net defined benefit liability, net loss on translation or settlement of foreign currency  borrowings,  changes  in  fair  value  of derivative  instruments  and  gains/(losses)  of settlement of borrowing related derivative instruments.

The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date and applicable for the period. While determining the tax provisions, the Company assesses whether each uncertain  tax  position  is  to  be  considered separately  or  together  with  one  or  more uncertain tax positions depending upon the nature and circumstances of each uncertain tax  position.  The  Company  offsets  current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it  has  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off the recognised amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and liability simultaneously.\n\n## b)  Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is recognised using the balance  sheet  approach.  Deferred  income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences\n\narising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in these consolidated  financial  statements,  except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable  profits  or  loss  at  the  time  of the transaction.\n\nDeferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences that  is  expected  to  reverse  within  the  tax holiday period, taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and  foreign branches  where the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets  is  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to  apply  in  the  period  when  the  asset  is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nThe Company  offsets deferred income tax  assets  and  liabilities,  where  it  has  a legally  enforceable  right  to  offset  current tax  assets  against  current  tax  liabilities, and they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities where there is a right and an intention to settle the current  tax  liabilities and  assets  on  a  net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Diluted  earnings  per share is computed using the weighted average number of equity and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock  method  for  options,  except  where  the results would be anti-dilutive.\n\nThe  number  of  equity  shares  and  potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively  for  all  periods  presented  for any  splits  and  bonus  shares  issues  including for change effected prior to the approval of the consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors.\n\n## (xix)  Statement of cash flows\n\nCash  flows  are  reported  using  the  indirect method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for  the  effects  of  transactions  of  a  non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income  or  expenses  associated  with  investing or  financing  cash  flows.  The  cash  generated from/(used in) operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.\n\n## New  Accounting  standards,  amendments and interpretations adopted by the Company effective from April 1, 2023:\n\n## (i) Amendments to Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules,  2023  effective  from  April  1,  2023. The  amendments  to  Ind  AS  12  clarify how companies account for deferred tax  on  transactions  such  as  leases  and decommissioning  obligations.  In  specified circumstances, companies are exempt from  recognising  deferred  tax  when  they recognise  assets  or  liabilities  for  the  first time.  The  amendments  clarify  that  this exemption  does  not  apply  to  transactions such as leases and decommissioning\n\nobligations  and  companies  are  required  to recognise deferred tax on such transactions. The adoption of amendments to Ind AS 12 is not expected to have any material impact in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (ii) Amendments to Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified the Companies  (Indian Accounting  Standards)  Amendment  Rules, 2023  effective  from  April  1,  2023.  This amendment  requires  the  companies  to disclose  their  material  accounting  policies rather  than  their  significant  accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when  it  can  reasonably  be  expected  to influence  decisions  of  primary  users  of general  purpose  financial  statements.  The adoption of amendments to Ind AS 1 did not have any material impact in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (iii)  Amendments  to  Ind  AS  8  -  Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified the Companies  (Indian Accounting  Standards)  Amendment  Rules, 2023  effective  from  April  1,  2023.  This amendment  has  introduced  a  definition of 'accounting estimates' and  included amendments to Ind AS 8 to help companies distinguish  changes  in  accounting  policies from changes in accounting estimates. The adoption of amendments to Ind AS 8 did not have any material impact in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## New Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted:\n\nMinistry  of  Corporate  Affairs  ('MCA')  notifies new  standards  or  amendments  to  the  existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules  as  issued  from  time  to  time. For the year ended March 31, 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to the Company.\n\n.",

Goodwill as at March 31, 2024 and 2023 has been allocated to the IT Services operating segment.\n\nGoodwill recognised on business combinations is allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGUs), within the IT Services operating segment, which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisitions.\n\n|                                      | Year ended   March 31, 2024   | Year ended   March 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| CGUs                                 |                               |                               |\n| Americas 1                           | '  104,190                    | '  103,466                    |\n| Americas 2                           | 102,005                       | 95,984                        |\n| Europe                               | 77,670                        | 76,561                        |\n| Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa | 27,584                        | 27,474                        |\n|                                      | '  311,449                    | '  303,485                    |\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a CGU representing the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the Company's procedure for determining the recoverable value of each CGU.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on FVLCD. The FVLCD of the CGU is determined based on the market capitalisation approach, using the turnover and earnings multiples derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is categorised as a level 2 fair value based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nBased on the above testing, no impairment was identified as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, as the recoverable value of the CGUs exceeded the carrying value. A sensitivity analysis to the change in the key parameters (turnover and earnings multiples) did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU's recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.\n\nThe movement in other intangible assets is given below:\n\n|                                                            | Other intangible assets   | Other intangible assets   | Other intangible assets   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                            | Customer-related          | Marketing-related         | Total                     |\n| Gross carrying value:                                      |                           |                           |                           |\n| As at April 1, 2023                                        | '  49,813                 | '  11,924                 | '  61,737                 |\n| Acquisition through Business combination (Refer to Note 8) | 556                       | 390                       | 946                       |\n| Deductions/adjustments                                     | (7,306)                   | (505)                     | (7,811)                   |\n| Translation adjustment                                     | 609                       | 163                       | 772                       |\n| As at March 31, 2024                                       | '  43,672                 | '  11,972                 | '  55,644                 |\n\n.",

In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis and hence are not offset.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease  receivables,  employee  and  other  advances,  eligible  current  and  non-current  assets,  borrowings,  lease liabilities, trade payables, eligible current liabilities and non-current liabilities.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  trade  receivables,  unbilled  receivables,  short-term  borrowings, employee and other advances, eligible current and non-current assets, borrowings, trade payables, lease liabilities, other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amount largely due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Finance lease receivables are periodically evaluated based on individual credit worthiness of  customers.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  the  Company  records  allowance  for  estimated  credit  losses  on  these receivables.  As  at  March  31,  2024  and  2023,  the  carrying  value  of  such  financial  assets,  net  of  allowances,  and liabilities approximates the fair value.\n\nThe Company's Unsecured Notes 2026 are contracted at fixed coupon rate of 1.50% and market yield on these loans as of 31 st March 2024 is 5.23%.\n\nInvestments in short-term mutual funds and fixed maturity plan mutual funds, which are classified as FVTPL are measured using net asset values at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held. Fair value of investments in non-convertible debentures, government securities, commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds classified as FVTOCI is determined based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market at the reporting date.  Fair  value  of  investments  in  equity  instruments  classified  as  FVTOCI  or  FVTPL  is  determined  using  market approach primarily based on market multiples method.\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable market inputs including currency spot and forward rates, yield curves and currency volatility.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n\n- Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\nLevel 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3 during the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n.",

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in consolidated statement of profit and loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\nThe  following  table  summarises  activity  in  the  cash  flow  hedging  reserve  within  equity  related  to  all  derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges:\n\n|                                                                                                                      | As at   March 31, 2024   | As at   March 31, 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Balance as at the beginning of the year                                                                              | '  (1,762)               | '  1,943                 |\n| Changes in fair value of effective portion of derivatives                                                            | 1,461                    | (4,839)                  |\n| Deferred cancellation gain/(loss), net                                                                               | 40                       | -                        |\n| Net (gain)/loss reclassified to consolidated statement of profit and loss on occurrence  of hedged transactions  (1) | 1,016                    | -                        |\n| Ineffective portion of derivative instruments classified to consolidated statement of  profit and loss               | 18                       | 1,134                    |\n| Gain/(loss) on cash flow hedging derivatives, net                                                                    | '  2,535                 | '  (3,705)               |\n| Balance as at the end of the year                                                                                    | '  773                   | '  (1,762)               |\n| Deferred tax asset/(liability) thereon                                                                               | (195)                    | 359                      |\n| Balance as at the end of the year, net of deferred taxes                                                             | '  578                   | '  (1,403)               |\n\n(1) Includes net (gain)/loss reclassified to revenue of ' 898 and ' 2,471 for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively; net (gain)/ loss reclassified to expense of ' 221 and ' (1,337) for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively; net (gain)/loss reclassified to finance costs of ' (167) and ' Nil for the year ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively and net (gain)/loss reclassified to other income of ' 64 and ' Nil for the year ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n\n.",

Under the terms of the arrangements, the Company either substantially transfers its risks and rewards or surrenders control over the financial assets and transfer is without recourse. Accordingly, on such transfers the financial assets are derecognised and considered as sale of financial assets. Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the time of sale based on the carrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 is not material.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in  the  price  of  a  financial  instrument.  The  value  of  a  financial  instrument  may  change  as  a  result  of  changes  in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\n\nThe Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities  in  foreign  currency.  The  objective  of  market  risk  management  is  to  avoid  excessive  exposure  of  the Company's earnings and equity to losses.\n\n## Risk Management Procedures\n\nThe  Company  manages  market  risk  through  a  corporate  treasury  department,  which  evaluates  and  exercises independent  control  over  the  entire  process  of  market  risk  management.  The  corporate  treasury  department recommends risk management objectives and policies, which are approved by our senior management and Audit Committee.  The  activities  of  this  department  include  management  of  cash  resources,  implementing  hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States of America and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies,\n\n<!-- image -->",

has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, a ' 1 increase in the

The Company has taken certain interest rate swaps against its investments in floating rate instruments and if interest rates were to increase/(decrease) by 100 bps as on March 31, 2024, it would result in (decrease)/increase in fair value of interest rate swaps by approximately ' (26) and ' 26 respectively, in other comprehensive income.\n\nFrom time to time the Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates. If interest rates were to increase/(decrease) by 100 bps as on March 31, 2024, it would result in increase/(decrease) in fair value of interest rate swaps by approximately ' 207 and ' ( 211) respectively, in other comprehensive income. If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps as on March 31, 2024, additional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately ' 792. Certain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this,  the  Company  periodically  assesses  the  credit  rating  and  financial  reliability  of  customers,  considering  the financial condition, current economic trends, forward looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, and revenues for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Company.\n\nRefer to Note 11 for changes in the allowances for lifetime expected credit loss.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty  risk  encompasses  issuer  risk  on  marketable  securities,  settlement  risk  on  derivative  and  money market contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimised by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure to these risks is closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Company's corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company's net liquidity position through rolling forecasts based on the expected cash flows. As of March 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reconciliation of revenue\n\nReconciliation of revenue recognised with the contracted price as follows:\n\n|                                                                     | As at  March 31, 2024   | As at March 31, 2023   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| Contracted price                                                    | '  914,308              | ' 918,348              |\n| Reductions towards variable consideration components  (1)           | (16,705)                | (13,472)               |\n| Revenue recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss | '  897,603              | '  904,876             |\n\n## C. Remaining performance obligations\n\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognised, which includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognised as revenue in future periods. Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024and 2023, the aggregate amount of the Transaction Price allocated to remaining performance obligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ' 318,756 and ' 317,612, respectively, of which approximately 66% and 66%, respectively, is expected to be recognised as revenues within two years, and the remainder thereafter. This includes contracts with a substantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause by the customer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time of inception. Historically, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.\n\n## D. Disaggregation of revenue\n\nThe tables below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment (refer to  Note  35  'Segment  Information'),  sector  and  nature  of  contract.  The  Company  believes  that  the  below disaggregation  best  depicts  the  nature,  amount,  timing  and  uncertainty  of  revenue  and  cash  flows  from economic factors.\n\nEffective April 1, 2023, the Company has reorganised its segment by merging India State Run Enterprises ('ISRE') segment as part of its APMEA SMU within its IT Services segment. Comparative period disaggregated revenue information has been restated to give effect to this change.\n\n.",

The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realise the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.\n\nDeferred tax asset amounting to ' 10,676 and ' 9,321 as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively in respect of unused tax losses have not been recognised by the Company. The tax loss carry-forwards of ' 43,785 and ' 38,564 as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on which deferred tax asset has not been recognised by the Company, because it is probable that future taxable profits will not be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised in the foreseeable future. Approximately, ' 40,409 and ' 35,621 as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of these tax loss carry-forwards is not currently subject to expiration dates. The remaining tax loss carry-forwards of approximately ' 3,376 and ' 2,943 as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, expires in various years through fiscal year 2043.\n\nThe Company has recognised deferred tax assets of ' 1,254 and ' 2,624 primarily in respect of carry forward losses including certain subsidiaries as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Management's projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilise these deferred tax assets.\n\nWe have calculated our domestic tax liability under normal provisions. Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recognised towards MAT in the consolidated balance sheet for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The effective MAT rate is 17.47%. The excess tax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward for a period of fifteen years and set-off against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions.\n\nA substantial portion of the profits of the Company's India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits attributable to export operations and profits from units established under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme. Units in designated special economic zones providing service on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for  a  deduction  of  100  percent  of  profits  or  gains  derived  from  the  export  of  services  for  the  first  five  years  from commencement of provision of services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years. 50% tax deduction is available for a further five years subject to the unit meeting certain defined conditions. Profits from certain other undertakings are also eligible for preferential tax treatment. New special economic zone units set up on or after April 1, 2021 are not eligible for the aforesaid deduction. The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal 2034-35. The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of ' 14,308 and ' 16,718 for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we estimate the Company would have been required to pay if these incentives had not been available. The per share effect of these tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was ' 2.71 and ' 3.05, respectively.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, deferred income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of subsidiaries amounting to ' 88,742 and ' 108,274 as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively and branch profit tax @ 15% of the US branch profit have not been recognised. Further, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

EARNINGS PER EQUITY SHARE\n\nA reconciliation of profit for the year and equity shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per equity share is set out below:\n\nBasic: Basic earnings per equity share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year, excluding equity shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.\n\n|                                                      | Year ended   March 31, 2024   | Year ended   March 31, 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company | '  110,452                    | '  113,500                    |\n| Weighted average number of equity shares outstanding | 5,288,285,555                 | 5,477,466,573                 |\n| Basic earnings per equity share                      | '  20.89                      | '  20.73                      |\n\nDiluted: Diluted earnings per equity share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year for assumed conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Employee share options are dilutive potential equity shares for the Company.\n\nThe calculation is performed in respect of share options to determine the number of equity shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average market price of the Company's equity shares during the year). The number of equity shares calculated as above is compared with the number of equity shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.\n\n|                                                                         | Year ended   March 31, 2024   | Year ended   March 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company                    | '  110,452                    | '  113,500                    |\n| Weighted average number of equity shares outstanding                    | 5,288,285,555                 | 5,477,466,573                 |\n| Effect of dilutive equivalent share options                             | 17,426,759                    | 11,524,602                    |\n| Weighted average number of equity shares for diluted earnings per share | 5,305,712,314                 | 5,488,991,175                 |\n| Diluted earnings per equity share                                       | '  20.82                      | '  20.68                      |\n\n.",

The weighted average share price of options exercised during the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was ' 422.87 and ' 421.06 for each option, respectively.\n\n## 32.  DIVIDENDS AND BUYBACK OF EQUITY SHARES\n\nThe Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees. According to the Companies Act, 2013 any dividend should be declared out of accumulated distributable profits. A Company may, before the declaration of any dividend, transfer a percentage of its profits for that financial year as it may consider appropriate to the reserves.\n\nThe cash dividends paid per equity share were ' 1 and ' 6 (including ' 5 declared on March 25, 2022), during the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company concluded the buyback of 269,662,921 equity shares (at a price of ' 445 per equity share) as approved by the Board of Directors on April 27, 2023. This has resulted in a total cash outflow of ' 145,173 (including tax on buyback of ' 24,783 and transaction costs related to buyback of ' 390). In line with the requirement of the Companies Act, 2013, an amount of ' 3,768 and ' 141,405 has been utilised from securities premium and retained earnings respectively. Further, capital redemption reserve of ' 539 (representing the nominal value of the shares bought back) has been created as an apportionment from retained earnings. Consequent to such buyback, the paid-up equity share capital has reduced by ' 539.\n\n## 33.  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL DISCLOSURES\n\nThe key objective of the Company's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the focus on total equity to uphold investor, creditor, and customer confidence and to ensure future development of its business. The Company's focus is to keep strong total equity base to ensure independence, security, as well as a high financial flexibility for potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the risk profile of the Company.\n\nThe Company's goal is to continue to be able to return excess liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual dividends in future periods. The amount of future dividends/ buyback of equity shares will be balanced with efforts to continue to maintain an adequate liquidity status.\n\n.",

The Company is not subjected to any externally imposed capital requirements.\n\n## 34.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nCapital commitments: As at March 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company had committed to spend approximately ' 10,322 and ' 7,675 respectively, under agreements to purchase/construct property and equipment. These amounts are net of capital advances paid in respect of these purchases. Refer to Note 9 for uncalled capital commitments on investment in equity instruments.\n\nGuarantees: As at March 31, 2024 and 2023, guarantees provided by banks on behalf of the Company to the Indian Government, customers and certain other agencies amount to approximately ' 13,455 and ' 16,076 respectively, as part of the bank line of credit.\n\nContingencies and lawsuits: The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims resulting from tax assessment orders/ penalty notices issued under the Income tax Act, 1961, which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business. Some of the claims involve complex issues and it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of such proceedings. However, the resolution of these legal  proceedings is  not  likely  to  have  a  material  and  adverse  effect  on  the  results  of  operations  or  the  financial position of the Company.\n\nThe Company's assessments are completed for the years up to March 31, 2019. The Company has received demands on multiple tax issues. These claims are primarily arising out of denial of deduction under section 10A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of profit earned by the Company's undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bengaluru, the appeals filed against the said demand before the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by the second Appellate authority for the years up to March 31, 2008 which either has been or may be contested by the Income tax authorities before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Other claims relate to disallowance of tax benefits on profits earned from Software Technology Park and special economic zone units, capitalisation of research and development expenses, transfer pricing adjustments on intercompany / inter unit transactions and other issues.\n\nIncome tax claims against the Company amounting to ' 95,520 and ' 91,465 are not acknowledged as debt as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These matters are pending before various Appellate authorities and the management expects its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, the resolution of these disputed demands is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n\n## 35.  SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nEffective April 1, 2023, the Company has reorganised its segments by merging ISRE segment as part of its APMEA SMU within IT Services segment. Comparative period segment information has been restated to give effect to this change.\n\nThe Company is now organised into the following operating segments: IT Services and IT Products.\n\nIT Services: During the year ended March 31, 2021, in order to broad base our growth, the Company re-organised IT Services segment to four Strategic Market Units (' SMUs ') - Americas 1, Americas 2, Europe and Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (' APMEA ').\n\nAmericas 1 and Americas 2 are primarily organised by industry sector, while Europe and APMEA are organised by countries.\n\nAmericas 1 includes the entire business of Latin America (' LATAM' ) and the following industry sectors in the United States of America: communications, retail connectivity and services, consumer goods, healthcare, and technology products and platforms. Americas 2 includes the entire business in Canada and the following industry sectors in the United States of America: banking and financial services, energy, manufacturing and resources, capital markets and insurance, and hi-tech. Europe consists of the United Kingdom and Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, Benelux, the Nordics and Southern Europe. APMEA consists of Australia and New Zealand, India, Middle East, South East Asia, Japan and Africa.\n\nRevenue from each customer is attributed to the respective SMUs based on the location of the customer's primary buying center of such services. With respect to certain strategic global customers, revenue may be generated from multiple countries based on such customer's buying centers, but the total revenue related to these strategic global customers are attributed to a single SMU based on the geographical location of key decision makers.\n\nOur IT Services segment provides a range of IT and IT enabled services which include digital strategy advisory, customer centric design, technology consulting, IT consulting, custom application design, development, re-engineering and maintenance, systems integration, package implementation, cloud and infrastructure services, business process services, cloud, mobility and analytics services, research and development and hardware and software design.\n\nIT Products: The Company is a value-added reseller of security, packaged and SaaS software for leading international brands. In certain total outsourcing contracts of the IT Services segment, the Company delivers hardware, software products and other related deliverables. Revenue relating to these items is reported as revenue from the sale of IT Products.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (' CEO ') and Managing Director of the Company has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by Ind AS 108, 'Operating Segments'. The CEO of the Company evaluates the segments based on their revenue growth and operating income.\n\nAssets and liabilities used in the Company's business are not identified to any of the operating segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.\n\n.",

On December 21, 2022, the Company sold 100% membership interests in Wipro Opus Risk Solutions LLC for a cash consideration of ' 52 and recognised a loss of ' 6 on disposal.\n- 39. The Indian Parliament has approved the Code on Social Security, 2020 which would impact the contributions by the Company towards Provident Fund and Gratuity. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has released draft rules for the Code on Social Security, 2020 on November 13, 2020, and has invited suggestions from stake holders which are under active consideration by the Ministry. Based on an initial assessment by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries, the additional impact on Provident Fund contributions by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is not expected to be material, whereas, the likely additional impact on Gratuity liability/contributions by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries could be material. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries will complete their evaluation once the subject rules are notified and will give appropriate impact in the financial statements in the period in which, the Code becomes effective and the related rules to determine the financial impact are published.\n\nAs per our Report of even date attached\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board of Directors\n\nFor Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP Chartered Accountants Firm's Registration No.: 117366W/W- 100018\n\n## Anand Subramanian\n\n## Aparna C.

In  our  opinion,  the  financial statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2024, in  conformity  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting Standards  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards of the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the  Company's  internal  control over  financial  reporting  as  of  March  31,  2024,  based  on criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 22, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\nThese  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of  the  PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud.  Our  audits included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\n\n.\n\nthat  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management, as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## CRITICAL AUDIT MATTER\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising  from  the  current-period  audit  of  the  financial statements  that  were  communicated  or  required  to  be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matter  below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nRevenue  from  fixed-price  contracts  using  the percentage-of-completion method - Refer Notes 2 (iv)(a), 3(xiv)B and 24 to the financial statements.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nRevenue  from  fixed-price  contracts,  including  software development,  and  integration contracts, where  the performance  obligations  are  satisfied  over  time,  is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\n\nUse  of  the  percentage-of-completion  method  requires the  Company  to  determine  the  project  costs  incurred  to date  as  a  percentage  of  total  estimated  project  costs  at completion. The estimation of total project costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. In addition, provisions for estimated losses,  if  any,  on  uncompleted  contracts  are  recorded  in the period in which such losses become probable based on the total estimated project costs.\n\nWe  identified  the  revenue  recognition  for  fixed-price contracts where the percentage-of-completion method is used as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment  involved  in  estimating  the  efforts  to  complete such contracts.",

The address of its registered office is Wipro  Limited,  Doddakannelli,  Sarjapur  Road, Bengaluru - 560 035, Karnataka, India. The Company has its primary listing with BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company's American Depository Shares (' ADS ') representing equity shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe  Company's  Board  of  Directors  authorized  these consolidated  financial  statements  for  issue  on  May 22, 2024.\n\n## 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## (i) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards and  its  interpretations  (' IFRS '),  as  issued  by the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board (' IASB '). All accounting  policies  have  been applied  consistently  to  all  periods  presented in these  consolidated  financial  statements, except for new accounting standards adopted by the Company.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements correspond  to the classification provisions contained  in  IAS  1(revised),  'Presentation  of Financial  Statements'. For clarity, various items are aggregated in the consolidated statement  of  income,  consolidated  statement of comprehensive  income  and  consolidated statement  of  financial  position.  These  items are disaggregated  separately  in  the  notes to the consolidated financial statements, where applicable.\n\nAll amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  are  reported  in  millions  of  Indian\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accounting estimates are monetary amounts in the consolidated financial statements  that  are  subject  to  measurement uncertainty.  An  accounting  policy  may  require items in consolidated financial statements to  be  measured  at  monetary  amounts  that cannot  be  observed  directly  and  must  instead be  estimated.  In  such  a  case,  management develops  an  accounting  estimate  to  achieve the  objective  set  out  by  the  accounting  policy. Developing accounting estimates involves the use of judgments or assumptions based on the latest available and reliable information. Actual results may differ from those accounting estimates.\n\nAccounting estimates and underlying assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis. Changes to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed and in any future periods affected. In particular, information  about  material  areas  of  estimation, uncertainty  and  critical  judgments  in  applying accounting policies that have the material effect on  the  amounts  recognized  in  the  consolidated financial statements are included in the following notes:\n\n- a) Revenue recognition: The Company applies judgment to determine whether each product  or  service  promised  to  a  customer is  capable  of  being  distinct,  and  is  distinct in  the  context  of  the  contract,  if  not,  the promised  product  or  service  is  combined and  accounted  as  a  single  performance obligation. The Company  allocates  the Transaction Price (as defined below in Note 3(xiv)) to separately identifiable performance obligation deliverables based on their relative  stand-alone  selling  price.  In  cases where the Company is unable to determine the  stand-alone  selling  price,  the  Company uses  expected  cost-plus  margin  approach in  estimating  the  stand-alone  selling  price. The  Company  uses  the  percentage  of completion  method  using  the  input  (cost expended)  method  to  measure  progress\n\ntowards  completion  in  respect  of  fixedprice  contracts.  Percentage  of  completion method  accounting  relies  on  estimates  of total  expected  contract  revenue  and  costs. This  method  is  followed  when  reasonably dependable  estimates  of  the  revenues  and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed  in  estimating  the  future  costs  to complete  include  estimates  of  future  labor costs and productivity efficiencies. Because the  financial  reporting  of  these  contracts depends  on  estimates  that  are  assessed continually during the term of these contracts,  revenue  recognized,  profit  and timing of revenue for remaining performance obligations  are  subject  to  revisions  as the contract progresses  to  completion. When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes probable. Volume discounts  are  recorded  as  a  reduction  of revenue. When the amount of discount varies with the levels of revenue, volume discount is  recorded  based  on  estimate  of  future revenue from the customer.\n\n- b) Impairment  testing: Goodwill  recognized on  business  combination  is  tested  for impairment  at  least  annually  and  when events  occur  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate  that  the  recoverable  amount  of goodwill or a cash generating unit to which goodwill  pertains,  is  less  than  the  carrying value.  The  Company  assesses  acquired intangible  assets  with  finite  useful  life  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  The recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  or  a  cash generating  unit  is  higher  of  value-in-use and  fair  value  less  cost  of  disposal.  The calculation  of  value  in  use  of  an  asset or  a  cash  generating  unit  involves  use  of significant estimates and assumptions which include turnover, growth rates and net margins  used  to  calculate  projected  future cash  flows,  risk-adjusted  discount  rate, future economic and market conditions.\n\n.",

A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods.\n\nDeferred  tax  is  recorded  on  temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts, at  the  rates  that  have  been  enacted  or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The  ultimate  realization  of  deferred  tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future  taxable  profits  during  the  periods  in which  those  temporary  differences  and  tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company  considers  expected  reversal  of deferred  tax  liabilities  and  projected  future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could reduce in the near term  if  estimates  of  future  taxable  income during the carry-forward period are reduced.\n\n- d) Business combinations: In accounting for business  combinations,  judgment  is required  to  assess  whether  an  identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating the acquisition  date  fair  value  of  the identifiable assets acquired (including useful  life  estimates),  liabilities  assumed, and contingent consideration assumed involves management  judgment. These measurements  are  based  on  information available  at  the  acquisition  date  and  are based  on  expectations  and  assumptions that  have  been  deemed  reasonable  by management. Changes in these judgments, estimates,  and  assumptions  can  materially affect the results of operations.\n- e) Defined  benefit  plans  and  compensated absences: The  cost  of  the  defined  benefit plans, compensated  absences  and  the\n\n- present value of the defined benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuation using  the  projected  unit  credit  method.  An actuarial  valuation  involves  making  various assumptions  that  may  differ  from  actual developments  in  the  future.  These  include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities  involved  in  the  valuation and  its  long-term  nature,  a  defined  benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these  assumptions.  All  assumptions  are reviewed at each reporting date.\n- f) Expected credit losses on financial assets: The  impairment  provisions  of  financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected timing of collection. The Company uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the expected credit loss calculation based on the Company's history of collections, customer's creditworthiness, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n- g) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment: The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives of the assets.  The  charge  in  respect  of  periodic depreciation is derived based on an estimate of  an  asset's  expected  useful  life  and  the expected residual value at the end of its life. The lives are based on historical experience with  similar  assets  as  well  as  anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- h) Useful  lives  of  intangible  assets: The Company amortizes intangible assets on  a  straight-line  basis  over  estimated useful  lives  of  the  assets.  The  useful  life  is estimated  based  on  a  number  of  factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand,  competition  and  other  economic factors such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances and the level  of  maintenance expenditures required\n\n<!-- image -->",

The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n\n- i) Provisions  and  contingent  liabilities: The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will  be  required  to  settle  the  obligations. These  provisions  are  reviewed  at  the  end of  each  reporting  date  and  are  adjusted  to reflect the current best estimates.\n\nThe  Company  uses  significant  judgment  to disclose  contingent  liabilities.  Contingent liabilities  are  disclosed  when  there  is  a possible obligation arising from past events, the  existence  of  which  will  be  confirmed only  by  the  occurrence  or  non-occurrence of  one  or  more  uncertain  future  events  not wholly within the control of the Company or a  present  obligation  that  arises  from  past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligation  or  a  reliable  estimate  of  the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are  neither  recognized  nor  disclosed  in  the financial statements.\n\n## 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\n\n## (i) Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries and controlled trusts\n\nThe  Company  determines  the  basis  of  control in line with  the  requirements  of  IFRS  10, Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsidiaries and  controlled  trusts  are  entities  controlled by  the  Group.  The  Group  controls  an  entity when the parent has power over the entity, it is exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over  the  entity.  The  financial  statements  of subsidiaries and controlled trusts are included in the  consolidated  financial  statements  from  the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\n\nThe financial statements of the Group companies are  consolidated  on  a  line-by-line  basis  and  all intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling  interests  in  the  net  assets (excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are  identified  separately  from  the  Company's equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders  may  be  initially  measured  either at  fair  value  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest's proportionate  share  of  the  fair  value  of  the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement  basis  is  made  on  an  acquisition to  acquisition  basis.  Subsequent  to  acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the  amount  of  those  interests  at  initial recognition  plus  the  non-controlling  interest's share  of  subsequent  changes  in  equity.  Total comprehensive  income  is  attributed  to  noncontrolling  interests  even  if  it  results  in  the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\n## Liability for written put options to noncontrolling interests\n\nAt initial recognition, the liability for put options issued to non-controlling interests, to be settled in cash by the Company, which do not grant present access to ownership interest to the Company is recognized as financial liability at present value of the redemption amount with a corresponding debit in other reserves within equity.\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nInvestments  accounted  for  using  the  equity method  are  entities  in  respect  of  which,  the Company  has  significant  influence,  but  not control, over the financial and operating policies. Generally, a company has a significant influence if  it  holds  between  20  and  50  percent  of  the voting  power  of  another  entity.  Investments  in such entities are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The carrying  amount  of  investment  is  increased/\n\n.",

These  consolidated financial  statements  are  presented  in  Indian rupees,  which  is  the  functional  currency  of  the Parent Company.\n\n## (iii)   Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\n## a) Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currency are translated  into  the  respective  functional currencies using the exchange rates prevailing  at  the  date  of  the  transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from  the  settlement  of  such  transactions and from translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies  are  recognized  in  the consolidated  statement  of  income  and reported  within  foreign  exchange  gains/ (losses),  net,  within  results  of  operating activities  except  when  deferred  in  other comprehensive  income  as  qualifying  cash flow  hedges  and  qualifying  net  investment hedges.  Net  loss  relating  to  translation  or settlement  of  borrowings  denominated  in foreign currency are reported within finance expense.  Net  gain  relating  to  translation or  settlement  of  borrowings  denominated in foreign  currency  are  reported  within finance  and  other  income.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated  at  the  exchange  rate  prevalent at the  date  of  transaction.  Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as financial instruments measured at fair value through\n\nother comprehensive income are included in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\n## b) Foreign operations\n\nFor the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations  that  have  a  functional  currency other  than  Indian  rupees  are  translated into  Indian  rupees  using  exchange  rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange  rates  for  the  period.  Exchange differences  arising,  if  any,  are  recognized in  other  comprehensive  income  and  held in foreign currency  translation  reserve (' FCTR' ),  a  component  of  equity,  except  to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to non-controlling interest. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount  recognized  in  FCTR  is  transferred to  the  consolidated  statement  of  income as  part  of  the  profit  or  loss  on  disposal. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation  and  translated  at  the  exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.\n\n## c) Others\n\nForeign currency differences arising on  the  translation  or  settlement  of  a financial  liability  designated  as  a  hedge of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive income  and  presented  within  equity  in  the FCTR  to  the  extent  the  hedge  is  effective. To  the  extent  the  hedge  is  ineffective, such  differences  are  recognized  in  the consolidated statement of income.\n\nWhen the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the relevant amount recognized in  FCTR  is  transferred  to  the  consolidated statement  of  income  as  part  of  the  profit or loss on disposal.

Trade  receivables  and unbilled receivables that do not contain a  significant  financing  component  are measured  at  the  Transaction  Price. Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  nonderivative financial instruments are measured as described below:\n\n## a.   Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents  consist  of  cash  on  hand and  in  banks  and  demand  deposits with banks, which can be withdrawn at  any  time,  without  prior  notice  or penalty on the principal.\n\nFor the purposes of the consolidated statement  of  cash  flows,  cash  and cash  equivalents  include  cash  on hand, in banks and demand deposits with banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts  that  are  repayable  on\n\ndemand  and  are  considered  part  of the  Company's  cash  management system.

The Company  enters  into  derivative  financial instruments  where  the  counterparty  is primarily a bank.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized  and  measured  at  fair  value. Attributable transaction costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as cost.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial  instruments  are  measured  as described below:\n\n## a.  Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative hedging  instruments  designated  as  a cash flow hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income and held in cash flow  hedging  reserve,  net  of  taxes,  a component of equity,  to  the  extent  that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the  hedge  is  ineffective,  changes  in  fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement of income and reported within foreign exchange  gains/(losses), net, within  results  from  operating  activities. If the  hedging  instrument  no  longer\n\nmeets the criteria for hedge accounting, then  hedge  accounting  is  discontinued prospectively.  If  the  hedging  instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised,  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the consolidated statement of income upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is  no  longer  expected  to  occur,  such cumulative balance is immediately recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## b.   Hedges of net investment in foreign operations\n\nThe Company designates derivative financial instruments as hedges  of net  investments  in  foreign  operations. The  Company  also  designates  foreign currency denominated borrowing as a  hedge  of  net  investment  in  foreign operations.  Changes  in  the  fair  value of  the  derivative  hedging  instruments and gains/(losses) on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as  a  hedge  of  net  investment  in  foreign operations are recognized in other comprehensive  income  and  presented within equity in the FCTR to the extent that the hedge is effective.

Changes in fair value and gains/(losses), net, on settlement of foreign  currency  derivative  instruments relating  to  borrowings,  which  have  not been designated as hedges are recorded in finance expenses.\n\n## C) Derecognition of financial instruments\n\nThe  Company  derecognizes  a  financial asset  when  the  contractual  rights  to  the cash  flows  from  the  financial  asset  expire or  it  transfers  the  financial  asset  and  the transfer  qualifies  for  derecognition  under IFRS 9. If the Company retains substantially all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  a  transferred financial  asset,  the  Company  continues to recognize the financial asset and recognizes  a  borrowing  for  the  proceeds received. A financial liability  (or  a  part  of  a financial  liability)  is  derecognized  from  the Company's  statement  of  financial  position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\n## (v)  Equity and share capital\n\n## a) Share capital and Share premium\n\nThe authorized share capital of the Company as at March 31, 2024 is ' 25,274 divided into 12,504,500,000  equity  shares  of ' 2  each, 25,000,000 preference shares of ' 10 each and  150,000  10%  optionally  convertible cumulative preference shares of ' 100 each.

The  cost and  related  accumulated  depreciation  are derecognized upon sale or disposition of the asset and the resultant gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nCapital  work-in-progress  are  measured  at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n## b) Depreciation\n\nThe  Company  depreciates  property,  plant and  equipment  over  the  estimated  useful\n\n.\n\n## f) Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe exchange  differences arising from the  translation  of  financial  statements  of foreign subsidiaries, differences arising from translation of long-term inter-company receivables  or  payables  relating  to  foreign operations,  settlement  of  which  is  neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, changes  in  fair  value  of  the  derivative hedging  instruments  and  gains/losses  on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated  borrowings  designated  as hedge of net investment in foreign operations are recognized  in  other  comprehensive income,  net  of  taxes  and  presented  within equity in the FCTR.\n\n## g) Cash flow hedging reserve\n\nChanges  in  fair  value  of  derivative  hedging instruments  designated  and  effective  as a  cash  flow  hedge  are  recognized  in  other comprehensive  income,  net  of  taxes  and presented within equity as cash flow hedging reserve.\n\n## h) Other reserves\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  financial instruments measured at fair value through other  comprehensive  income  and  actuarial gains and losses on remeasurements of the defined benefit plans are recognized in other comprehensive  income,  net  of  taxes  and presented within equity in other reserves.\n\nOther reserves also include Capital redemption  reserve,  which  is  not  freely available for distribution. As per the Companies  Act,  2013,  Capital  redemption reserve is created when a company purchases its own shares out of free reserves or share premium. A sum equal to the nominal value of the shares so purchased is transferred to capital redemption reserve. The reserve can be utilized in accordance with the provisions of section 69 of the Companies Act, 2013. As at  March  31,  2022,  2023  and  2024,  Capital redemption  reserve  amounting  to ' 1,122, ' 1,122 and ' 1,661 respectively is not freely available for distribution.",

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term. Term licenses are amortized  over  their  respective  contract term.  Freehold  land  is  not  depreciated. The estimated  useful  life  of  assets  is  reviewed and where appropriate are adjusted, annually. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:\n\n| Category                          | Useful life    |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                         | 28 to 40 years |\n| Plant and equipment               | 5 to 21 years  |\n| Computer equipment and software   | 2 to 7 years   |\n| Furniture, fixtures and equipment | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Vehicles                          | 4 to 5 years   |\n\nWhen  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant and  equipment  have  different  useful  lives, they  are  accounted  for  as  separate  items (major components) of property, plant and  equipment.  Subsequent  expenditure relating  to  property,  plant  and  equipment is  capitalized  only  when  it  is  probable  that future  economic  benefits  associated  with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nDeposits  and  advances  paid  towards  the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding  as  at  each  reporting  date  and the  cost  of  property,  plant  and  equipment not  available  for  use  before  such  date  are disclosed under capital work-in-progress.\n\n## (vii)   Business combinations, Goodwill, and Intangible assets\n\n## a) Business combinations\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for using  the  purchase  (acquisition)  method. The  cost  of  an  acquisition  is  measured  as the  fair  value  of  the  assets  transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity  instruments  issued  at  the  date  of exchange  by  the  Company.  Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business\n\ncombination  are  measured  initially  at  fair value at the date of acquisition. Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe cost of an acquisition also includes the fair  value  of  any  contingent  consideration measured  as  at  the  date  of  acquisition. Any  subsequent  changes  to  the  fair  value of contingent consideration classified as liabilities, other than  measurement period  adjustments,  are  recognized  in  the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## b) Goodwill\n\nThe excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Company's share in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities is  recognized  as  goodwill.  If  the  excess is  negative,  a  bargain  purchase  gain  is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment (if any).\n\nGoodwill  associated  with  disposal  of  an operation  that  is  part  of  cash-generating unit  is  measured  based  on  the  relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained, unless  some  other  method  better  reflects the  goodwill  associated  with  the  operation disposed of.\n\n## c) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  acquired  separately  are measured at cost of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.  Following  initial  recognition, intangible  assets  are  carried  at  cost  less accumulated  amortization  and  impairment losses, if any.\n\nThe amortization of an intangible asset with a  finite  useful  life  reflects  the  manner  in which  the  economic  benefit  is  expected  to be generated and is included in selling and marketing  expenses  in  the  consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe  estimated  useful  life  of  amortizable intangibles is reviewed and where\n\n<!-- image -->",

Marketing-related intangibles includes  vendor  relationships  and  brand acquired as a part of Business combinations.\n\n## (viii) Leases\n\nThe Company  evaluates each contract or arrangement,  whether  it  qualifies  as  lease  as defined under IFRS 16.\n\n## The Company as a lessee\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  an  arrangement  for lease  of  land,  buildings,  plant  and  equipment including computer equipment and vehicles. Such arrangements are generally for a fixed period but may  have  extension  or  termination  options.  The Company  assesses,  whether  the  contract  is,  or contains, a lease, at its inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to -\n\n- (a)  control use of an identified asset,\n- (b)  obtain substantially all the economic benefits from use of the identified asset, and\n- (c) direct the use of the identified asset.\n\nThe  Company  determines  the  lease  term  as the  non-cancellable  period  of  a  lease,  together with periods covered by an option to extend the lease,  where  the  Company is  reasonably  certain to  exercise  that  option.  The  Company  makes  an assessment on the expected lease term on a leaseby-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised.\n\nAt the commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a Right of Use (' RoU ') asset at cost and corresponding  lease  liability,  except  for  leases with  term  of  less  than  twelve  months  (shortterm  leases)  and  low-value  assets.  For  these\n\nshort-term  and  low-value  leases,  the  Company recognizes  the  lease  payments  as  an  operating expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  lease term.\n\nThe cost of the RoU assets comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the inception date  of  the  lease  plus  any  initial  direct  costs, less any lease incentives received. Subsequently, the  RoU  assets  are  measured  at  cost  less  any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment  losses,  if  any.  The  RoU  assets  are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of RoU assets. The estimated useful  lives  of  RoU  assets  are  determined  on the  same  basis  as  those  of  property,  plant  and equipment.\n\nThe  Company  applies  IAS  36  to  determine whether a RoU asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the impairment of non-financial assets below.\n\nFor lease liabilities at the commencement of the lease,  the  Company  measures the lease liability at  the  present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate that  the  Company  would  have  to  pay  to  borrow funds, including the consideration of factors such as the nature of the asset and location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as applicable in a similar economic environment.\n\nAfter  the  commencement  date,  the  amount of  lease  liabilities  is  increased  to  reflect  the accretion  of  interest  and  reduced  for  the  lease payments made.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on  the  lease  liability,  reducing  the  carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring  the  carrying  amount  to  reflect  any lease modifications. The Company recognizes the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability\n\n.",

Where  the  carrying  amount  of  the  RoU  asset  is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in  the  measurement  of  the  lease  liability,  the Company recognizes any remaining amount of the re-measurement  in  the  consolidated  statement of income.\n\nPayment of lease liabilities are classified as cash used  in  financing  activities  in  the  consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## The Company as a lessor\n\nLeases  under  which  the  Company  is  a  lessor are  classified  as  a  finance  or  operating  lease. Lease contracts where all the risks and rewards are  substantially  transferred  to  the  lessee  are classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating lease.\n\nFor  leases  under  which  the  Company  is  an intermediate  lessor,  the  Company  accounts  for the head-lease and the sub-lease as two separate contracts.  The  sub-lease  is  further  classified either as a finance lease or an operating lease by reference to the RoU asset arising from the headlease.\n\n## (ix)  Inventories\n\nInventories  are  valued  at  lower  of  cost  and  net realizable  value,  including  necessary  provision for  obsolescence.  Cost  is  determined  using  the weighted average method.\n\n## (x)  Impairment\n\n## a) Financial assets\n\nThe  Company  applies  the  expected  credit loss  model  for  recognizing  impairment  loss on  financial  assets  measured  at  amortized cost, debt instruments classified as FVTOCI, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract  assets,  finance  lease  receivables, and other financial assets. Expected credit  loss  is  the  difference  between  the contractual  cash  flows  and  the  cash  flows that the entity expects to receive, discounted using the effective interest rate.\n\nLoss allowances for trade receivables, unbilled  receivables,  contract  assets  and finance  lease  receivables  are  measured  at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss. Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected  credit  losses  that  result  from  all possible  default  events  over  the  expected life of a financial instrument.  Lifetime expected credit  loss  is  computed  based  on a provision matrix which takes in to account, risk  profiling  of  customers  and  historical credit  loss  experience  adjusted  for  forward looking  information.  For  other  financial assets, expected credit loss is measured at the amount equal to twelve months expected credit loss unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition, in which case those are measured at lifetime expected credit loss.\n\n## b) Non-financial assets\n\nThe  Company  assesses  long-lived  assets such as property, plant and equipment, RoU assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or  group  of  assets  may  not  be  recoverable. If  any  such  indication  exists,  the  Company estimates  the  recoverable  amount  of  the asset or group of assets.\n\nGoodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  at  least annually at the same time and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  cash generating unit is less than its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of cash -generating units which represents the lowest  level  at  which  goodwill  is  monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (' FVLCD ') and its valuein-use (' VIU '). The VIU of long-lived assets is calculated using projected future cash flows. FVLCD of a cash generating unit is computed using  turnover  and  earnings  multiples.  If\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reduction  is  treated  as  an  impairment loss  and  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated statement of income.\n\nIf at the reporting date, there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss on property, plant and equipment, RoU assets and  intangible  assets,  no  longer  exists,  the recoverable  amount  is  reassessed  and  the impairment losses previously recognized are reversed  such  that  the  asset  is  recognized at its recoverable amount but not exceeding written  down value which would have been reported  if  the  impairment  losses  had  not been  recognized  initially.  An  impairment loss  in  respect  of  goodwill  is  not  reversed subsequently.\n\n## (xi)  Employee benefits\n\n## a) Post-employment plans\n\nThe Group participates in various employee benefit  plans.  Pensions  and  other  postemployment  benefits  are  classified  as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution plan,  the  Company's  sole  obligation  is  to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further  contributions  if  the  fund  does  not hold  sufficient  assets  to  pay  all  employee benefits. The related actuarial and investment risks are borne by the employee. The  expenditure  for  defined  contribution plans  is  recognized  as  an  expense  during the  period  when  the  employee  provides service.  Under  a  defined  benefit  plan,  it  is the Company's obligation to provide agreed benefits  to  the  employees.  The  related actuarial  and  investment  risks  are  borne by  the  Company.  The  present  value  of  the defined benefit obligations is calculated by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\nRemeasurements  of  the  defined  benefit plans, comprising actuarial gains or losses, the  effect  of  changes  to  the  asset  ceiling, and  the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding interest)  are  immediately  recognized  in other  comprehensive  income,  net  of  taxes and  not  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  in subsequent period.\n\nNet  interest  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  is calculated by applying the discount rate used to  measure  the  defined  benefit  obligation to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The actual return on the plan assets above or  below  the  discount  rate,  is  recognized as  part  of  remeasurements  of  the  defined benefit plans through other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\nThe  Company  has  the  following  employee benefit plans:\n\n## A. Provident fund\n\nEligible employees  receive  benefits under  the  Company's  provident  fund plan, into which both the employer and employees make periodic contributions to  the  approved  provident  fund  trust managed by the Company. A portion of the employer's contribution is made to the  government  administered  pension fund.  The  contributions  to  the  trust managed by the Company is accounted for  as  a  defined  benefit  plan  as  the Company is liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return.\n\nCertain  employees  receive  benefits under the provident fund plan in which both  the  employer  and  employees make  periodic  contributions  to  the government administered provident fund.  A  portion  of  the  employer's contribution is made to the government administered  pension  fund.  This  is accounted  as  a  defined  contribution plan as the obligation of the Company is limited to the contributions made to the fund.",

Gratuity and foreign pension\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Payment  of Gratuity Act, 1972, applicable for Indian companies, the Company  provides for  a  lump  sum  payment  to  eligible employees, at retirement or termination of employment based on the last drawn salary  and  years  of  employment  with the  Company.  The  gratuity  fund  is managed by third party fund managers.\n\nThe  Company  also  maintains  pension and similar plans for employees outside India, based on country specific  regulations.  These  plans  are partially  funded,  and  the  funds  are managed by third party fund managers. The  plans  provide  for  monthly  payout after  retirement  as  per  salary  drawn and  service  period  or  for  a  lump  sum payment as set out in rules of each fund.\n\nThe  Company's  obligations  in  respect of these  plans,  which  are  defined benefit plans, are provided for based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.\n\n## C. Superannuation\n\nSuperannuation plan, a defined contribution scheme is administered by third party  fund  managers.  The  Company makes  annual  contributions  based  on a specified percentage of each eligible employee's salary.\n\n## b) Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are expensed when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\n## c) Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term  employee  benefit  obligations such as cash bonus, management incentive plans or profit-sharing plans are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recorded as expense as the related service is provided. A  liability  is  recognized  for  the  amount expected to be paid under short-term cash\n\nbonus  or  management  incentive  plans  or profit-sharing  plans,  if  the  Company  has  a present  legal  or  constructive  obligation  to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## d) Compensated absences\n\nThe employees of the Company are entitled  to  compensated  absences.  The employees  can  carry  forward  a  portion  of the  unutilized  accumulating  compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive  cash  at  retirement  or  termination of  employment.  The  Company  records  an obligation for compensated absences in the period  in  which  the  employee  renders  the services  that  increases  this  entitlement. The  Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences as the additional amount  that  the  Company  expects  to pay  as  a  result  of  the  unused  entitlement that  has  accumulated  at  the  end  of  the reporting  period.  The  Company  recognizes accumulated compensated absences based on  actuarial  valuation  using  the  projected unit credit method. Non-accumulating compensated  absences  are  recognized  in the period in which the absences occur.\n\n## (xii)  Share-based payment transactions\n\nSelected  employees  of  the  Company  receive remuneration  in  the  form  of  equity  settled instruments or cash settled instruments, for  rendering  services  over  a  defined  vesting period  and  for  Company's  performance-based stock  options  over  the  defined  period.  Equity instruments granted are measured by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date of grant. In  cases,  where  equity  instruments  are  granted at  a  nominal  exercise  price,  the  intrinsic  value on the date of grant approximates the fair value. The  expense  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated statement  of  income  with  a  corresponding increase to the share-based payment reserve, a component of equity.\n\nThe equity instruments or cash settled instruments generally vest in a graded manner over the vesting\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  fair  value  determined  at  the  grant date  is  expensed  over  the  vesting  period  of  the respective  tranches  of  such  grants  (accelerated amortization).  The  stock  compensation  expense is  determined based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments or cash settled instruments that will eventually vest.\n\nCash Settled instruments granted are remeasured by reference to the fair value at the end of each reporting period and at the time of vesting. The  expense  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated statement  of  income  with  a  corresponding increase to financial liability.\n\n## (xiii)  Provisions\n\nProvisions  are  recognized  when  the  Company has  a  present  obligation  (legal  or  constructive), as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate  of  the  consideration  required  to  settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period,  considering  the  risks  and  uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen  some  or  all  of  the  economic  benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered  from  a  third  party,  the  receivable  is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received, and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.\n\nProvisions  for  onerous  contracts  are  recognized when  the  expected  benefits  to  be  derived  by the  Company  from  a  contract  are  lower  than the  unavoidable  costs  of  meeting  the  future obligations  under  the  contract.  Provisions  for onerous  contracts  are  measured  at  the  present value of lower of the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of terminating the contract.\n\n## (xiv)  Revenue\n\nThe  Company  derives  revenue  primarily  from software development, maintenance of software/ hardware and related services, consulting\n\nservices, business process services and sale of IT products.\n\nRevenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition  and  measurement  when  the contract has been approved by the parties to the contract,  the  parties  to  contract  are  committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue  is  recognized  upon  transfer  of  control of  promised  products  or  services  to  customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company  expects  to  receive  (the  'Transaction Price'). Revenue  towards  satisfaction of a performance  obligation  is  measured  at  the amount of the Transaction Price (net of variable consideration  on  account  of  discounts  and allowances) allocated to that performance obligation.  To  recognize  revenues,  the  Company applies  the  following  five  step  approach:  (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the  performance  obligations  in  the  contract,  (3) determine the Transaction Price, (4) allocate the Transaction Price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenues when a  performance  obligation  is  satisfied.  When there  is  uncertainty  as  to  collectability,  revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\n\nAt  contract  inception,  the  Company  assesses its  promise  to  transfer  products  or  services  to a  customer  to  identify  separate  performance obligations. The  Company  applies  judgment to  determine  whether  each  product  or  service promised  to  a  customer  is  capable  of  being distinct,  and  are  distinct  in  the  context  of  the contract, if not, the promised  products  or services are combined and accounted as a single performance  obligation.  The  Company  allocates the  Transaction  Price  to  separately  identifiable performance  obligations  based  on  their  relative stand-alone  selling  price  or  residual  method. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based  on  sale  prices  for  the  components  when it  is  regularly  sold  separately,  in  cases  where the  Company is unable to determine the standalone selling price, the Company uses third-party prices  for  similar  deliverables  or  the  Company",

The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the promised products or services to be provided.\n\nThe method  for recognizing revenues and costs  depends  on  the  nature  of  contracts  with customers as given below:\n\n## A. Time and materials contracts\n\nRevenues and costs relating to time and materials contracts are recognized as the related services are rendered.\n\n## B. Fixed-price contracts\n\n## i. Fixed-price development contracts\n\nRevenues from fixed-price development contracts, including software development, and integration contracts, where  the  performance  obligations are  satisfied  over  time,  are  recognized using  the  'percentage-of-completion' method.  The  performance  obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses. Percentage of completion is  determined  based  on  project  costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated  project  costs  required  to complete the project. The cost expended (or  input)  method  has  been  used  to measure  progress  towards  completion as there is a direct relationship between input  and  productivity.  This  method  is followed  when  reasonably  dependable estimates  of  the  revenues  and  costs applicable  to  various  elements  of  the contract can be made. Key factors that are  reviewed  in  estimating  the  future costs  to  complete  include  estimates of  future  labor  costs  and  productivity efficiencies. Because the financial reporting  of  these  contracts  depends\n\non estimates that are assessed continually  during  the  term  of  these contracts,  revenue  recognized,  profit and  timing  of  revenue  for  remaining performance obligations are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. If the Company is not able to  reasonably  measure  the  progress of  completion,  revenue  is  recognized only to the extent of costs incurred, for which  recoverability  is  probable.  When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an  arrangement,  the  estimated  losses are  recognized  in  the  consolidated statement  of  income  in  the  period  in which  such  losses  become  probable based on the current contract estimates as an onerous contract provision.\n\nA contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon  factors  other  than  the  passage of time. Contract assets primarily relate  to  unbilled  amounts  on  fixedprice  development  contracts  and  are classified as non-financial asset as the contractual  right  to  consideration  is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.\n\nA contract liability is an entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to  a  customer for which the entity has received  consideration  (or  the  amount is due) from the customer.\n\n## ii. Maintenance contracts\n\nRevenues related to fixed-price maintenance  contracts  are  recognized on  a  straight-line  basis  when  services are  performed  through  an  indefinite number  of  repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using percentage of completion method when the  pattern  of  benefits  from  the services rendered to the customers and the cost to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the  services  are  generally  discrete  in nature and not repetitive.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If  our  invoicing is  not  consistent  with  value  delivered, revenues are recognized as the service is  performed  using  the  percentage  of completion method.\n\nIn  certain  projects,  a  fixed  quantum of  service  or  output  units  is  agreed  at a  fixed-price  for  a  fixed  term.  In  such contracts,  revenue  is  recognized  with respect  to  the  actual  output  achieved till date  as  a  percentage  of  total contractual output. Any residual service unutilized by the customer is recognized as revenue on completion of the term.\n\n## iii. Element or Volume based contracts\n\nRevenues and costs are recognized as the related services are rendered.\n\n## C. Products\n\nRevenue  on  product  sales  are  recognized when  the  customer  obtains  control  of  the specified product.\n\n## D. Others\n\n- \u00b7 Any change  in scope or price is considered to be a contract modification. The Company accounts for modifications to existing contracts by assessing whether the services added are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that  are  not  distinct  are  accounted  for on  a  cumulative  catch  up  basis,  while those  that  are  distinct  are  accounted for  prospectively,  either  as  a  separate contract  if  the  additional  services  are priced at the stand-alone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and  creation  of  a  new  contract  if  not priced at the stand-alone selling price.\n- \u00b7 The  Company  accounts  for  variable considerations  like  volume  discounts, rebates and pricing incentives to customers  and  penalties  as  reduction of revenue on a systematic and rational\n\nbasis  over  the  period  of  the  contract. The  Company  estimates  an  amount of  such  variable  consideration  using expected  value  method  or  the  single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration depending on which method  better  predicts  the  amount  of consideration  to  which  the  Company may be entitled and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the  uncertainty  associated  with  the variable consideration is resolved.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenues are shown net of allowances/ returns,  sales  tax,  value  added  tax, goods  and  services  tax  and  applicable discounts.\n- \u00b7 The Company may enter into arrangements with third-party suppliers to  resell  products  or  services.  In  such cases,  the  Company  evaluates  whether the Company is the principal (i.e., report revenues  on  a  gross  basis)  or  agent (i.e.,  report  revenues  on  a  net  basis).  In doing  so,  the  Company  first  evaluates whether the Company controls the good or  service  before  it  is  transferred  to the  customer.  The  Company  considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an  agent.  If  the  Company  controls  the good  or  service  before  it  is  transferred to  the  customer,  the  Company  is  the principal;  if  not,  the  Company  is  the agent.\n- \u00b7 Estimates  of  the  Transaction  Price  and total  costs  or  efforts  are  continuously monitored over the term of the contract and  are  recognized  in  net  profit  in  the period  when  these  estimates  change or  when  the  estimates  are  revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or  efforts  are  subject  to  revision  as  the contract progresses.\n\n.",

Deferred  income tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized for deductible and taxable temporary differences  arising  between  the  tax  base of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying amount in financial statements, except when the  deferred  income  tax  arises  from  the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profits or loss at the time of the transaction.\n\nDeferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognized to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except in  respect  of  taxable  temporary differences that  is  expected  to  reverse  within  the  tax holiday period, taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates  and  foreign  branches  where the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary difference  can  be  controlled  and  it  is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets  is  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.\n\nDeferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities are  measured  at  the  tax  rates  that  are expected  to  apply  in  the  period  when  the asset  is  realized,  or  the  liability  is  settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nThe  Company  offsets  deferred  income  tax assets and liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against  current  tax  liabilities,  and  they relate  to  taxes  levied  by  the  same  taxation authority on either the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities where there is a right and an intention to settle the current tax  liabilities  and  assets  on  a  net  basis  or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.\n\n## (xviii) Earnings per share\n\nBasic  earnings  per  share  is  computed  using the  weighted  average  number  of  equity  shares outstanding  during  the  period  adjusted  for treasury shares held. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of equity and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method for  options,  except  where  the  results  would  be anti-dilutive.\n\nThe  number  of  equity  shares  and  potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any splits and bonus shares issues including for change effected prior to  the  approval  of  the  consolidated  financial statements by the Board of Directors.\n\n## (xix)  Statement of cash flows\n\nCash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing  or  financing cash  flows.  The  cash  generated  from/(used  in) operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.",

The  amendments  aim  to promote  consistency  in  applying  the  requirements  by helping companies to determine whether, in the statement of  financial  position,  debt  and  other  liabilities  with  an uncertain settlement date should be classified as current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or noncurrent.  The  amendments  also  clarified  the  classification requirements for debt a company might settle by converting it  into  equity.  These  amendments  are  effective  for  annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and are  to  be  applied  retrospectively,  with  earlier  application permitted.  The  adoption  of  amendments  to  IAS  1  did  not have  any  material  impact  on  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nOn  October  31,  2022,  IASB  issued 'Non-current  Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)'. The amendments specify  that  covenants  to  be  complied  with  after  the reporting  date  do  not  affect  the  classification  of  debt  as current  or  non-current  at  the  reporting  date.  Instead,  the amendments  require  a  company  to  disclose  information about  these  covenants  in  the  notes  to  the  financial statements.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with earlier application permitted. The adoption of these amendments to IAS 1 did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes\n\nOn May 7, 2021, the IASB amended IAS 12 'Income Taxes' and published 'Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising  from  a  Single  Transaction  (Amendments  to  IAS 12)'  that  clarify  how  companies  account  for  deferred  tax on  transactions  such  as  leases  and  decommissioning obligations.  In  specified  circumstances,  companies  are exempt from recognizing deferred tax when they recognize\n\nassets  or  liabilities  for  the  first  time.  The  amendments clarify  that  this  exemption does not apply to transactions such  as  leases  and  decommissioning  obligations  and companies are required to recognize deferred tax on such transactions. These  amendments  are  effective  for  annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and are  to  be  applied  retrospectively,  with  earlier  application permitted. The adoption of these amendments to IAS 12 did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes\n\nOn May 23, 2023, the IASB issued International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules - Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' to clarify the application of IAS 12 to income taxes arising  from  tax  law  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  to implement  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion  and  Profit  Shifting  (BEPS)  Pillar  Two  model  rules (Pillar Two income taxes). The Amendments introduced:\n\n- \u00b7 a  mandatory  temporary  exception  to  the  accounting for deferred  taxes  arising  from  the  jurisdictional implementation of the Pillar Two model rules; and\n- \u00b7 disclosure  requirements  for  affected  entities  to  help users of the financial statements better understand an entity's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes arising from that legislation, particularly before its effective date.\n\nThe  Company  has  applied  the  temporary  exception  from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12. Accordingly, the Company neither recognized, nor disclosed information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. Since the Pillar Two legislations is not effective at the reporting date in jurisdictions where the  Company  is  operating,  the  Company  has  no  related current tax exposure.\n\nThe  Pillar  Two  legislations  are  neither  enacted  nor substantively  enacted  by  Government  of  India,  where  the Parent company is incorporated. The Company is continuing to  assess  the  impact,  if  any,  of  Pillar  Two  income  taxes legislation on future financial performance.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 16 - Leases\n\nOn  September  22,  2022,  IASB  issued  'Lease  Liability  in a  Sale  and  Leaseback  (Amendments  to  IFRS  16)'  that specifies  the  requirements  that  a  seller-lessee  uses  in measuring the lease liability arising in a sale and leaseback transaction, to ensure the seller-lessee does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amendment is intended to improve the requirements for sale and leaseback transactions in IFRS 16 and will not change the accounting for leases unrelated to  sale  and  leaseback  transactions.  These  amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and are to be applied retrospectively, with  earlier  application  permitted.  The  adoption  of  these amendments to IFRS 16 did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 7 - Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments\n\nOn May  25, 2023, IASB issued 'Supplier Finance Arrangements  (Amendments  to  IAS  7  and  IFRS  7)',  that require companies to disclose information about its supplier finance  arrangements  that  enables  users  of  financial statements  to  assess  the  effects  of  those  arrangements on  the  companies  liabilities  and  cash  flows  and  on  the companies  exposure  to  liquidity  risk.  These  amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after  January  1,  2024,  with  earlier  application  permitted. The adoption of these amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NEW AMENDMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED:\n\nCertain  new  standards,  amendments  to  standards  and interpretations  are  not  yet  effective  for  annual  periods beginning after April 1, 2023 and have not been applied in preparing  these  consolidated  financial  statements.  New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that  could  have  potential  impact  on  the  consolidated financial statements of the Company are:\n\n## Amendments to IAS 21 - The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates\n\nOn August 15, 2023, IASB issued 'Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments  to  IAS  21)'  that  clarifies  how  an  entity should  assess  whether  a  currency  is  exchangeable  and how  it  should  determine  a  spot  exchange  rate  when exchangeability is lacking, as well as require the disclosure of  information that enables users of financial statements to understand  the  impact  of  a  currency  not  being exchangeable. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025, with earlier application permitted. The adoption of amendments to IAS 21 is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n.\n\n## IFRS 18 - Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\n\nOn  April  9,  2024,  IASB  issued  IFRS  18  'Presentation  and Disclosure in Financial Statements' which supersedes IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements', aimed at improving comparability  and  transparency  of  communication  in financial statements. IFRS 18 requires an entity to classify all  income  and  expenses  within  its  statement  of  profit or  loss  into  one  of  five  categories:  operating,  investing, financing, income taxes and discontinued operations. These categories are complemented by the requirement to present specified totals and subtotals for 'operating profit or loss', 'profit or loss before financing and income taxes' and 'profit or loss'. It also requires disclosure of management-defined performance measures and includes new requirements for aggregation  and  disaggregation  of  financials  information based  on  the  identified  'roles'  of  the  primary  financial statements and the notes.\n\nConsequent  to  above,  a  narrow-scope  amendments  have been made to IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows', which include changing the starting point for determining cash flows from operations  under  the  indirect  method  from 'profit  or  loss' to  'operating  profit  or  loss'.  Further,  some  requirements previously  included  within  IAS  1  have  been  moved  to  IAS 8  'Accounting  Policies,  Changes  in  Accounting  Estimates and  Errors'  which  has  also  been  renamed  IAS  8  'Basis of  Preparation  of  Financial  Statements'.  IAS  34  '  Interim Financial  Reporting'  was  amended  to  require  disclosure of  management  defined  performance  measures.  Minor consequential amendments to other standards were also made.\n\nAn  entity  that  prepares  condensed  interim  financial statements  in  accordance  with  IAS  34  in  the  first  year of  adoption  of  IFRS  18,  must  present  the  heading  and mandatory subtotals it expects to use in its annual financial statement.  Comparative  period  in  both  the  interim  and annual financial statements will need to be restated and a reconciliation of the statement of profit or loss previously published  will  be  required  for  the  immediately  preceding comparative  period.  IFRS  18  and  the  amendments  to the  other  standards,  is  effective  for  reporting  period beginning on or after January 1, 2027 and are to be applied retrospectively, with earlier application permitted.\n\nThe Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS  18  and  the  amendments  to  other  standards,  on  the consolidated financial statements.",

In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis and hence are not offset.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee and other advances, eligible current and non-current assets, loans, borrowings and bank overdrafts, lease liabilities, trade payables and accrued expenses, and eligible current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, short-term loans, borrowings and  bank  overdrafts,  lease  liabilities,  trade  payables  and  accrued  expenses,  other  current  financial  assets  and liabilities approximate their carrying amount largely due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Finance lease receivables are periodically evaluated based on individual credit worthiness of customers. Based on this evaluation, the Company records allowance for estimated credit losses on these receivables. As at March 31, 2023 and 2024, the carrying value of such financial assets, net of allowances, and liabilities approximates the fair value.\n\nThe Company's Unsecured Notes 2026 are contracted at fixed coupon rate of 1.50% and market yield on these loans as of 31 st March 2024 is 5.23%.\n\nInvestments in short-term mutual funds and fixed maturity plan mutual funds, which are classified as FVTPL are measured using net asset values at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held. Fair value of investments in non-convertible debentures, government securities, commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds classified as FVTOCI is determined based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market at the reporting\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fair value of investments in equity instruments classified as FVTOCI or FVTPL is determined using market approach primarily based on market multiples method.\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable market inputs including currency spot and forward rates, yield curves and currency volatility.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\nLevel 3 -

The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.\n\nIf  the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in consolidated statement of income at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  activity  in  the  cash  flow  hedging  reserve  within  equity  related  to  all  derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges:\n\n|                                                                                               | As at  March 31, 2023   | As at   March 31, 2024   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Balance as at the beginning of the year                                                       | '  1,943                | '  (1,762)               |\n| Changes in fair value of effective portion of derivatives                                     | (4,839)                 | 1,461                    |\n| Deferred cancellation gain/(loss), net                                                        | -                       | 40                       |\n| Net (gain)/loss reclassified to statement of income on occurrence of hedged transactions  (1) | 1,134                   | 1,016                    |\n| Ineffective portion of derivative instruments classified to consolidated statement of income  | -                       | 18                       |\n| Gain/(loss) on cash flow hedging derivatives, net                                             | '  (3,705)              | '  2,535                 |\n| Balance as at the end of the year                                                             | '  (1,762)              | '  773                   |\n| Deferred tax asset/(liability) thereon                                                        | 359                     | (195)                    |\n| Balance as at the end of the year, net of deferred taxes                                      | '  (1,403)              | '  578                   |\n\n(1) Includes net (gain)/loss reclassified to revenue of ' 2,471 and ' 898 for the year ended March 31, 2023, and 2024, respectively; net (gain)/loss reclassified to cost of revenues of ' (1,337) and ' 221 for the year ended March 31, 2023, and 2024, respectively; net (gain)/ loss reclassified to finance expenses of ' Nil and ' (167) for the year ended March 31, 2023, and 2024, respectively and net (gain)/loss reclassified to finance and other income of ' Nil and ' 64 for the year ended March 31, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\n\nThe related hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedging reserves as at March 31, 2024 are expected to occur and be reclassified to the statement of income over a period of fifteen months.\n\nAs at March 31, 2023 and 2024, there were no material gains or losses on derivative transactions or portions thereof that have become ineffective as hedges or associated with an underlying exposure that did not occur.\n\n## Sale of financial assets\n\nFrom  time  to  time,  in  the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Company  transfers  accounts  receivables,  unbilled receivables  and  net  investment  in  finance  lease  receivables  (financial  assets)  to  banks.

The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.\n\nThe Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities  in  foreign  currency.  The  objective  of  market  risk  management  is  to  avoid  excessive  exposure  of  the Company's earnings and equity to losses.\n\n## Risk Management Procedures\n\nThe  Company  manages  market  risk  through  a  corporate  treasury  department,  which  evaluates  and  exercises independent  control  over  the  entire  process  of  market  risk  management.  The  corporate  treasury  department recommends risk management objectives and policies, which are approved by our senior management and Audit Committee.  The  activities  of  this  department  include  management  of  cash  resources,  implementing  hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States of America and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including  the  use  of  derivatives  like  foreign  exchange  forward/option  contracts  to  hedge  forecasted  cash  flows denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, a ' 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the U.S. dollar would result in approximately ' 2,801 (consolidated statement of income ' 987 and other comprehensive income ' 1,814) decrease in the fair value, and a ' 1 decrease would result in approximately ' 2,877 (consolidated statement of income ' 987 and other comprehensive income ' 1,890) increase in the fair value of foreign currency dollar denominated derivative instruments (forward and option contracts).\n\n<!-- image -->",

increase/decrease  our  profits  by  approximately ' 1,305 and ' 909, respectively.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate investments and borrowings, including various revolving and other lines of credit.\n\nThe Company's investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk. The Company has taken certain interest rate swaps against its investments in floating rate instruments and if interest rates were to increase/(decrease) by 100 bps as on March 31, 2024, it would result in (decrease)/increase in fair value of interest rate swaps by approximately ' (26) and ' 26 respectively, in other comprehensive income.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates. If interest rates were to increase/(decrease) by 100 bps as on March 31, 2024, it would result in increase/(decrease) in fair value of interest rate swaps by approximately ' 207 and ' ( 211)\n\n.",

If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps as on March 31, 2024, additional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately ' 792. Certain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this,  the  Company  periodically  assesses  the  credit  rating  and  financial  reliability  of  customers,  considering  the financial  condition,  current  economic  trends,  forward  looking  macroeconomic  information,  analysis  of  historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as at March 31, 2023 and 2024, or revenues for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Company.\n\nRefer to Note 9 for changes in the allowance for lifetime expected credit loss.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Company's corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company's net liquidity position through rolling forecasts based on the expected cash flows. As at March 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts include estimated interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements, if any.\n\n## As at March 31, 2023\n\n|                                             | Less than 1  year   | 1-2 years   | 2-4 years   | Beyond 4  years   | Total  Cashflows   | Interest  included in  total cash  flows   | Carrying  value   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Loans, borrowings and bank  overdrafts  (1) | '  91,743           | '  924      | '  63,015   | '  -              | '  155,682         | '  (5,589)                                 | '  150,093        |\n| Lease Liabilities  (1)                      | 9,620               | 7,130       | 7,233       | 3,087             | 27,070             | (2,497)                                    | 24,573            |\n| Trade payables and accrued  expenses        | 89,054              | -           | -           | -                 | 89,054             | -                                          | 89,054            |\n| Derivative liabilities                      | 2,825               | 153         | 26          | -                 | 3,004              | -                                          | 3,004             |\n| Other financial liabilities  (2)            | 4,192               | 1,587       | 951         | 410               | 7,140              | (350)                                      | 6,790             |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred tax liability on the intangible assets identified and carry forward losses on acquisitions is recorded by an adjustment to goodwill. Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.\n\nDeferred tax asset amounting to ' 9,321 and ' 10,676 as at March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively in respect of unused tax losses have not been recognized by the Company.

Approximately, ' 35,621, and ' 40,409 as at March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, of these tax loss carry-forwards is not currently subject to expiration dates. The remaining tax loss carry-forwards of approximately ' 2,943 and ' 3,376 as at March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, expires in various years through fiscal year 2043.\n\nThe Company has recognized deferred tax assets of ' 2,624 and ' 1,254 primarily in respect of carry forward losses including certain subsidiaries as at March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Management's projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilize these deferred tax assets.\n\n.",

Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recognized towards MAT in the statement of financial position for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2024. The effective MAT rate is 17.47%. The excess tax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward for a period of fifteen years and set-off against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions.\n\nA substantial portion of the profits of the Company's India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits attributable to export operations and profits from units established under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme. Units in designated special economic zones providing service on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction of 100 percent of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of provision of services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years. 50% tax deduction is available for a further five years subject to the unit meeting certain defined conditions. Profits from certain other undertakings are also eligible for preferential tax treatment. New Special Economic Zone units set up on or after April 1, 2021 are not eligible for the aforesaid deduction. The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal 2034-35. The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of ' 16,483, ' 16,718 and ' 14,308 for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we estimate the Company would have been required to pay if these incentives had not been available. The per share effect of these tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 was ' 3.02, ' 3.05, and ' 2.71, respectively.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries  where  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, deferred income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of subsidiaries amounting to ' 108,724 and ' 88,742 as at March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively and branch profit tax @ 15% of the US branch profit have not been recognized. Further, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.\n\n## 22.  DIVIDENDS AND BUYBACK OF EQUITY SHARES\n\nThe Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees. According to the Companies Act, 2013 any dividend should  be  declared  out  of  accumulated  distributable  profits.  A  Company  may,  before  the  declaration  of  any dividend, transfer a percentage of its profits for that financial year as it may consider appropriate to the reserves.\n\nThe cash dividends paid per equity share were ' 1, ' 6 (including ' 5 declared on March 25, 2022) and ' 1, during the years ended March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company concluded the buyback of 269,662,921 equity shares (at a price of ' 445 per equity share) as approved by the Board of Directors on April 27, 2023. This has resulted in a total cash outflow of ' 145,173 (including tax on buyback of ' 24,783 and transaction costs related to buyback of ' 390). In line with the requirement of the Companies Act, 2013, an amount of ' 3,768 and ' 141,405 has been utilized from share premium and retained earnings respectively. Further, capital redemption reserve (included in other reserves) of ' 539 (representing the nominal value of the shares bought back) has been created as an apportionment from retained earnings. Consequent to such buyback, the paid-up equity share capital has reduced by ' 539.\n\n## 23.  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL DISCLOSURES\n\nThe key objective of the Company's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the focus on total equity to uphold investor, creditor, and customer confidence and to ensure future development of its business. The Company's focus is to keep strong total equity base to ensure independence, security, as well as a high financial flexibility for potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the risk profile of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Remaining performance obligations\n\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based.\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the aggregate amount of the Transaction Price allocated to remaining performance obligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ' 328,191, ' 317,612 and ' 318,756, respectively of which approximately 59%, 66% and 66%, respectively is expected to be recognized as revenues within two years, and the remainder thereafter. This includes contracts with a substantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause by the customer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time of inception. Historically, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.\n\n## C.  Disaggregation of revenue\n\nThe tables below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment (refer to  Note  34  'Segment  Information'),  sector  and  nature  of  contract.  The  Company  believes  that  the  below disaggregation  best  depicts  the  nature,  amount,  timing  and  uncertainty  of  revenue  and  cash  flows  from economic factors.\n\nEffective April 1, 2023, the Company has reorganized its segments by merging India State Run Enterprises ('ISRE') segment as part of its APMEA SMU within IT Services segment.

EARNINGS PER EQUITY SHARE\n\nA reconciliation of profit for the year and equity shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per equity share is set out below:\n\nBasic: Basic earnings per equity share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year, excluding equity shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.\n\n|                                                      | Year ended   March 31, 2022   | Year ended   March 31, 2023   | Year ended   March 31, 2024   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company | ' 122,191                     | '  113,500                    | '  110,452                    |\n| Weighted average number of equity shares outstanding | 5,466,705,840                 | 5,477,466,573                 | 5,288,285,555                 |\n| Basic earnings per equity share                      | '  22.35                      | '  20.73                      | '  20.89                      |\n\nDiluted: Diluted earnings per equity share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year for assumed conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Employee share options are dilutive potential equity shares for the Company.\n\nThe calculation is performed in respect of share options to determine the number of equity shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average market price of the Company's equity shares during the year).

This also includes RSU's that will vest based on performance parameters of the Company.\n\nRefer to Note 31 for information on transactions with post-employment benefit plans mentioned above.\n\nAll related party transactions were entered at an arm's length basis and in the ordinary course of business. There are  no  materially  significant  related  party  transactions  made  by  the  Company  with  Promoters,  Directors  or  Key Management Personnel, which may have a potential conflict with the interests of the Company at large.\n\n## 33.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nCapital commitments: As at March 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company had committed to spend approximately ' 7, 6 7 5 and ' 10,322 respectively, under agreements to purchase/construct property and equipment. These amounts are net of capital advances paid in respect of these purchases. Refer to Note 8 for uncalled capital commitments on investment in equity instruments.\n\nGuarantees: As at March 31, 2023 and 2024, guarantees provided by banks on behalf of the Company to the Indian Government, customers and certain other agencies amount to approximately ' 16,076 and ' 13,455 respectively, as part of the bank line of credit.\n\nContingencies and lawsuits: The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims resulting from tax assessment orders/  penalty  notices  issued  under  the  Income-tax  Act,  1961,  which  have  arisen  in  the  ordinary  course  of  its business. Some of the claims involve complex issues and it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of such proceedings. However, the resolution of these legal proceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n\nThe Company's assessments are completed for the years up to March 31, 2019. The Company has received demands on multiple tax issues. These claims are primarily arising out of denial of deduction under section 10A of the Incometax Act, 1961 in respect of profit earned by the Company's undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bengaluru, the appeals filed against the said demand before the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by the second appellate authority for the years up to March 31, 2008 which either has been or may be contested by the Income tax authorities before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Other claims relate to disallowance of tax benefits on profits earned from Software Technology Park and Special Economic Zone units, capitalization of research and development expenses, transfer pricing adjustments on intercompany / inter unit transactions and other issues.\n\nIncome tax claims against the Company amounting to ' 91,465 and ' 95,520 are not acknowledged as debt as at March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. These matters are pending before various Appellate authorities and the management expects its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.\n\nThe contingent liability in respect of disputed demands for excise duty, custom duty, sales tax and other matters amounting to ' 15,240 and ' 18,799 as of March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. However, the resolution of these disputed demands is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nEffective April 1, 2023, the Company has reorganized its segments by merging ISRE segment as part of its APMEA SMU within IT Services segment. Comparative period segment information has been restated to give effect to this change.\n\nThe Company is now organized into the following operating segments: IT Services and IT Products.\n\nIT Services: The  IT  Services  segment  primarily  consists  of  IT  services  offerings  to  customers  organized  by  four Strategic Market Units ('SMUs') - Americas 1, Americas 2, Europe and Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa ('APMEA').\n\nAmericas 1 and Americas 2 are primarily organized by industry sector, while Europe and APMEA are organized by countries.\n\nAmericas 1 includes the entire business of Latin America (' LATAM' ) and the following industry sectors in the United States of America: communications, retail connectivity and services, consumer goods, healthcare, and technology products and platforms. Americas 2 includes the entire business in Canada and the following industry sectors in the United States of America: banking and financial services, energy, manufacturing and resources, capital markets and insurance, and hi-tech. Europe consists of the United Kingdom and Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, Benelux, the Nordics and Southern Europe. APMEA consists of Australia and New Zealand, India, Middle East, South East Asia, Japan and Africa.\n\nRevenue from each customer is attributed to the respective SMUs based on the location of the customer's primary buying center of such services. With respect to certain strategic global customers, revenue may be generated from multiple countries based on such customer's buying centers, but the total revenue related to these strategic global customers are attributed to a single SMU based on the geographical location of key decision makers.\n\nOur IT Services segment provides a range of IT and IT enabled services which include digital strategy advisory, customer centric design, technology consulting, IT consulting, custom application design, development, re-engineering and maintenance, systems integration, package implementation, cloud and infrastructure services, business process services, cloud, mobility and analytics services, research and development and hardware and software design.\n\nIT Products: The Company is a value-added reseller of security, packaged and SaaS software for leading international brands. In certain total outsourcing contracts of the IT Services segment, the Company delivers hardware, software products and other related deliverables. Revenue relating to these items is reported as revenue from the sale of IT Products.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') and Managing Director of the Company has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8, 'Operating Segments'. The CEO of the Company evaluates the segments based on their revenue growth and operating income.\n\nAssets and liabilities used in the Company's business are not identified to any of the operating segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.\n\n.",

The Ministry of Labour and Employment has released draft rules for the Code on Social Security, 2020 on November 13, 2020, and has invited suggestions from stake holders which are under active consideration by the Ministry. Based on an initial assessment by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries, the additional impact on Provident Fund contributions by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is not expected to be material, whereas, the likely additional impact on Gratuity liability/contributions by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries could be material. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries will complete their evaluation once the subject rules are notified and will give appropriate impact in the financial statements in the period in which, the Code becomes effective and the related rules to determine the financial impact are published.\n\nAs per our Report of even date attached\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board of Directors\n\nFor Deloitte\tHaskins\t&\tSells\tLLP Chartered Accountants\n\nFirm's Registration No.: 117366W/W- 100018\n\n## Rishad A.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.\n\nThe consultation with the Board on key stakeholder concerns is largely mediated by different organizational functions which are responsible for the respective stakeholders. Periodic Board reviews are held at least once a quarter, during which  the  Board  holds  extensive  discussions  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  ( 'CEO' ) and other senior leaders representing these functions. For example, feedback on customer trends and issues is provided by the Heads of Businesses and Market Units, that on investors by the Chief Financial Officer ( 'CFO' ) and his team, on employees by the Chief Human Resources Officer ( 'CHRO' ) and his team, on sustainability issues by the Chief Sustainability Officer, etc. Please refer to 'Engagement Mode and Frequency' and 'Topics of Engagement' in the 'Stakeholder Engagement' Section of Wipro Annual Report for FY 2023-24.\n\n- 2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.\n\nYes, stakeholder engagement covers key material issues driven by strategic objectives through various modes of engagements. There is a primary internal custodian for each stakeholder group. For example, feedback from employees involve certain informed steps which are taken leading to enhanced communications and collaboration forums. For suppliers, this has improved the ease of doing business and ability to address environmental and social aspects. For communities, under the community ecology initiative, we focus on striking an ecological balance in our proximate communities  by  taking  up  projects  that  have  direct  and  tangible  benefits  and  strengthening  our  urban  primary healthcare system is a focus area for us. This is because vulnerable communities still lack adequate personnel and amenities for their healthcare needs. Similarly, for employees, at Wipro, the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees is of paramount importance. We look at wellbeing holistically, connecting mind, body, and community to help us focus on being healthy, feeling happy, and living our life's purpose. Our employee wellness programs encompass three  areas  of  employee  wellbeing:  Physical,  emotional,  and  financial.  Inputs  are  received  through  the  employee feedback mechanism. Customer surveys are conducted periodically to get customer inputs. Additionally, Quarterly reviews are held with customers where inputs are sought.",

Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.\n\nWipro engages with communities and civil society networks to work on systemic issues that can act as force multipliers for social transformation and sustainable development. Within this ambit, we deliberatively focus on disadvantaged groups in a significant  majority  of  our  social  initiatives  e.g.  Children  with  Disability,  the  Urban  Poor,  Women  from disadvantaged communities, Suppliers from under-represented groups (e.g. Women owned enterprises), Employees with disability or from LGBTQ+ groups. Boosting and strengthening our urban primary healthcare system is a focus area for us. For example, enhancing education facilities for children with disabilities in marginalized communities , providing healthcare to migrant workers.\n\n## PRINCIPLE 5: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n## ESSENTIAL INDICATORS\n\n- 1.

We have undertaken to perform reasonable assurance engagement, for WIPRO LIMITED (the 'Company') vide our engagement letter dated April 8, 2024 in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed below (the 'Identified Sustainability Information' or 'BRSR Core indicators') in accordance with the Criteria stated in paragraph 3 below. This Sustainability Information is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (the 'BRSR' or the 'Report') within  the Integrated Annual Report (the 'IAR') of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2024. This engagement was conducted by our multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, environmental engineers and specialists.\n\n## 2. Identified Sustainability Information\n\nOur scope of reasonable assurance consists of the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to our report. The reporting boundary of the Report is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosure of the BRSR with exceptions disclosed by way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, where applicable.\n\nOur reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2024 information only and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods, and any elements thereto, and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon.\n\n## 3. Criteria\n\nThe Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the 'SEBI') (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended;\n- \u00b7 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Requirements for listed entities per Master Circular No. SEBI/ HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/2023/120 dated July 11, 2023; and\n- \u00b7 SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023 and clarifications thereto issued by SEBI.\n\n## 4.

This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Report and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## 5. Inherent limitations\n\nThe absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between companies.\n\n## 6. Our Independence and Quality Control\n\nWe have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 'ICAI') and the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/ CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023, and its clarifications thereto and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.\n\nWe apply Standard on Quality Control (the 'SQC') 1, 'Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements', and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n.",

We  have  undertaken  to  perform  limited  assurance  engagement,  for WIPRO  LIMITED (the  'Company')  vide  our engagement letter dated April 8, 2024 in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed below (the 'Identified Sustainability  Information')  in  accordance  with  the  Criteria  stated  in  paragraph  3  below.  This  Sustainability Information is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (the 'BRSR' or the 'Report') within the Integrated Annual Report (the 'IAR') of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2024. This engagement was conducted by our multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, environmental engineers, and specialists.\n\n## 2. Identified Sustainability Information\n\nOur scope of limited assurance consists of the Sustainability Information listed in the Appendix I to our report. The reporting boundary of the Report is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosure of the BRSR with exceptions disclosed by way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, where applicable.\n\nOur limited assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2024 information and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the Report and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.\n\n## 3. Criteria\n\nThe Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the 'SEBI') (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended;\n- \u00b7 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Requirements for listed entities per Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/2023/120 dated July 11, 2023; and\n- \u00b7 SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023 and clarifications thereto issued by SEBI.\n\n## 4. Management's Responsibility\n\nThe  Company's  management  is  responsible  for  selecting  or  establishing  suitable  criteria  for  preparing  the Sustainability Information including the reporting boundary of the Report, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Report and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## 5. Inherent limitations\n\nThe absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between companies.\n\n## 6. Our Independence and Quality Control\n\nWe have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 'ICAI') and the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/ CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023, and its clarifications thereto and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.\n\nWe apply Standard on Quality Control ('SQC') 1, 'Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements', and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## 7. Our Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.\n\n.",

Limited Assurance\n\nA limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company's use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information as listed in Appendix I, assessing the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  Identified  Sustainability  Information  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents and evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies and agreeing with underlying records.\n\nGiven the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures;\n- \u00b7 Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements of the Identified Sustainability Information;\n- \u00b7 Made inquiries of Company's management, including Sustainability team, Facilities Management Group, Human Resource team amongst others and those with the responsibility for preparation of the Report;\n- \u00b7 Obtained  an  understanding  of  the  key  systems  and  processes  for  recording,  processing  and  reporting  on  the Identified Sustainability Information at locations /offices on a sample basis;\n- \u00b7 Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures; and\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the Company's process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Identified Sustainability  Information  have  been  prepared,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  Criteria. has context menu\n\nWe  believe  that  the  evidence  we  have  obtained  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  limited assurance conclusion.\n\n## 9. Exclusions\n\nOur assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express a conclusion on:\n\n- \u00b7 Aspects of the Report and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability Information; and\n- \u00b7 The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided by the Company.\n\n## 10. Limited Assurance Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention",
