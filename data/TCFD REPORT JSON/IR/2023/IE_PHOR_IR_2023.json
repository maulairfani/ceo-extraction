AI has been instrumental in preparing this Report, with some of the images generated using neural networks. However, just like in agriculture, the smartest technology excels when guided by human intuition, creative vision, and professional expertise.\n\nThis is the kind of future we eagerly embrace.\n\n(corresponds to the scope of disclosure in IFRS consolidated financial statements).\n\nBoundary 2 - Apatit, including its branches and standalone business units.\n\n- For more. information on specific disclosures and their boundaries used in this Report, see the GRI Content Index section on page 357.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Report was pre-approved by the Board of Directors of PhosAgro on 26 April 2024 (Minutes w/o No. dated 27 April 2024).",

What milestones has the Company reached in the reporting year?\n\nIN 2023, PHOSAGRO STAYED TRUE TO THE PRIORITIES SET OUT IN ITS LONG/uniF6BATERM DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. WITH AN ONGOING FOCUS ON PRODUCTION EXPANSION AND SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO DELIVER DYNAMIC GROWTH, CONSISTENT IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY, AND STRONG OPERATING RESULTS, ALL WHILE MAINTAINING A STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.\n\nOur performance in 2023 has yet again given us ample reasons to be proud. We raised our agrochemical output to an all-time high of 11.3 mt, an increase of 2% from 2022. For DAP/ MAP, production rose by 8.4% to over 4.5 mt, for ammonium nitrate by 4.4%, for urea by 1.6%, and for phosphoric and sulphuric acids by 4.6% and 2.5% respectively. Our record of solid performance over the years attests to the effectiveness of the chosen path of organic growth as our preferred development strategy. PhosAgro persistently upgrades its production using the best available techniques, enhances its vertical integration, and maintains a focus on sustainable development. All this enables us to remain the largest supplier of all types of fertilizers to Russian farmers and to strengthen our standing in the global market.\n\nIn 2023, the Company celebrated several more key accomplishments. We reached a milestone of 900 mt in apatite-nepheline ore supplies from the Kirovsky mine of Apatit's Kirovsk branch. At the Cherepovets facility of Apatit, our output hit a mark of 100 mt of phosphatebased mineral fertilizers and 1 mt of ammonium sulphate. Production of phosphoric acid across PhosAgro's sites surpassed 3.3 mtpa for the first time ever. These are all important landmarks in PhosAgro's journey.\n\nOur production achievements have laid a solid foundation for robust financial results. Revenue went above RUB 440 bln, EBITDA reached RUB 183 bln, and adjusted net profit came in at RUB 104 bln. We also delivered impressive profitability, with a 41.6% EBITDA margin in 2023.\n\nHow is the Company performing in the area of corporate governance?\n\nNow that we have discussed the G component of your ESG practices, what are the achievements in the E and S domains?\n\nAs the Chairman of the Board of Directors, I assume full responsibility for the quality and effectiveness of our corporate governance system. I firmly believe that all members of the Board of Directors share my dedication to acting in the best interest of the Company's wide range of stakeholders and making well-informed, balanced decisions.\n\nWe are consistently improving our practices and aim to strengthen the composition of the Board of Directors. With the inclusion of Vladimir Trukhachev in 2023, the Board saw an increase in the count of independent directors to five out of ten members. We are committed to maintaining the Company's utmost openness and transparency, aiming to meet the interests of all stakeholders. I am proud to emphasise the pace and quality of our development and the improvements that we bring to our corporate practices.\n\nEvery year, PhosAgro forges ahead with its investment programme, which yields positive results and ensures steady growth in both production and financial metrics. This enables us to maintain a decent level of employee remuneration and fulfil all our social obligations.\n\nIn 2023, payments of taxes and duties to budgets at all levels reached a record high of RUB 69 bln. We are actively expanding our social and charity projects, with total support increasing sevenfold over the past decade and exceeding RUB 25 bln in 2022-2023.\n\nPhosAgro employs over 23,000 people, and I deeply appreciate their contribution to both the Company's development and national food security. Our employees are our most valuable asset, so we strive to create a comfortable and safe working environment while offering competitive and fair remuneration. Over the past three years, the average monthly pay at PhosAgro increased by 60%, and in February 2024, we raised salaries by an additional 15%. In 2023, new collective bargaining agreements were signed by all of the Group's production facilities as we increased the size of social benefits and\n\nI am confident that the current Board of Directors consists of highly skilled professionals from diverse backgrounds, whose contributions considerably enhance the quality of strategic planning and our focus on sustainable growth requirements.\n\nMy opinion is also supported by external experts. In 2023, PhosAgro ranked first in the ESG rating of 160 companies compiled by RAEX, the largest independent agency specialising in non-credit ratings. We were awarded the highest rating (AA) among the rated companies. Additionally, we attained the top position in sub-rankings for the effectiveness of our social policy and the quality of corporate governance, earning us the highest score possible.\n\nallowances for our teams in Volkhov, Cherepovets, Kirovsk, and Balakovo. This is a landmark event both for the mineral fertilizer industry and the Russian chemical sector at large. In addition, a new apartment block for PhosAgro employees was successfully commissioned in Volkhov during the year. To date, our corporate housing programme has improved the living conditions of nearly 3,000 families.\n\nOur consistent long-term efforts have won us accolades from external experts as in 2023 PhosAgro was named among the best employers by Forbes and RBC.\n\nIt is important to remember that PhosAgro's responsibilities extend beyond its direct employees to a much wider range of stakeholders. To that end, in 2023 we went ahead with our Mine to Plate educational programme designed to train personnel for the agricultural industry. The programme already covers 47 universities, with students benefitting from an impressive portfolio of more than 370 digital video lectures. A total of 17 PhosAgro educational centres opened their doors at Russia's leading agricultural universities.",

We also implemented and launched a digital educational platform for farmers from Africa.\n\nIn addition to promoting basic sciences, we help train engineers at the schools and colleges that we support. Last year, our school-college/ university-facility corporate educational programme celebrated its tenth anniversary.\n\nPhosAgro joined the UN Global Compact's Forward Faster initiative calling for an accelerated achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As a participant in the Water Resilience Coalition, a UN Global Compact platform, PhosAgro will contribute to a faster achievement of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) covered by the Forward Faster initiative, by advancing sustainable water resource management.\n\nI can confidently say that we plan to maintain our momentum. In 2024, we will be increasing our CAPEX further, investing a record of RUB 73 bln in business development (including capitalised repairs). As a result, we expect our agrochemical output to continue growing. This will make an important contribution to strengthening Russia's food security for years to come.\n\nI am convinced that in 2024, we will continue to make steady progress towards our strategic objectives, propelled by our professional team and a sustainable and flexible business model that drivers continuous improvements in efficiency and profitability. With these strengths, we are well-positioned to achieve our goals and solidify our market presence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVictor Cherepov, Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nof PJSC PhosAgro\n\nI appreciate your trust in our business, and we look forward to reaching new heights together.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that in 2023, our Company received its third Grand Prix at the Russian Business Leaders: Dynamics and Responsibility Awards held by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. This is a testament that our achievements in corporate social responsibility have been recognised by Russia's leading businesses and organisations.\n\nWe also solidified our standing as a company with the best social and charitable programmes in the Russian Leaders in Corporate Philanthropy 2023 competition. These long-standing awards for socially responsible businesses are organised by the Donors Forum and its partners, including the Ministry of Economic Development, Accounts Chamber, Presidential Grant Foundation, and Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In 2023, a total of 43 companies enrolled in the competition, with 15 making it to the A+ Leaders category. PhosAgro was the only mineral fertilizer producer to do so.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023 was a year of transformation for many companies as they continued to revamp operational processes and reconsider business models. What was the year like for PhosAgro?\n\nIn 2023, we once again saw very clearly that our business model and development strategy are the right choice and fit. With them, we can stay an effective and robust business even in turbulent macro environments and without compromising our resilience. The year 2023 marked another set of accomplishments and achievements for PhosAgro. We were able to ramp up fertilizer output levels and increase our self-sufficiency in key types of feedstock.\n\nIn 2023, PhosAgro hit yet another record in agrochemical output, taking it to 11.3 mt. For MAP, there was a 12.9% increase, driven among other things by the new production facility in Volkhov, which was built as part of the Company's longterm development programme. The upward trajectory in the output of phosphate fertilizers was underpinned by higher volumes of phosphoric and sulphuric acids that we produced, as well as consistently high levels of ammonia output. In particular, production of sulphuric acid added 2.5% to exceed 8.1 mt. This was fuelled by greater efficiency of the sulphuric acid production unit in Cherepovets and the launch of a new sulphuric acid facility in Balakovo in late 2023.\n\nIN 2023, DESPITE THE CONTINUED EXTERNAL TURBULENCE, PHOSAGRO ONCE AGAIN DEMONSTRATED RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES AND THE ABILITY TO SET NEW OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RECORDS. THIS WAS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE CONCERTED TEAMWORK OF OUR SKILLED PROFESSIONALS, OUR FLEXIBLE BUSINESS MODEL, AND A WELL/uniF6BATHOUGHT/uniF6BAOUT COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY.\n\nDuring the year, we went ahead with our development plans, upgraded and constructed production facilities, tapped into new markets, and unveiled new products. In all our endeavours, we remained committed to supplying the Russian market, which is our unchanging priority, as well as some 100 countries globally with high-quality, efficient, and eco-friendly mineral fertilizers.\n\nWe also enhanced our leadership standing in terms of total supplies of all types of mineral fertilizers to our priority market of Russia. During the year, domestic supplies surged by 12.0% and reached 3.3 mt.\n\nThe stabilisation of global fertilizer prices after they spiked to all-time highs in 2022 was the key driver of our financial performance in 2023. For the full year, we posted revenue in excess of RUB 440 bln, EBITDA of over RUB 183 bln, and adjusted net profit of more than RUB 104 bln. Thanks to the well-coordinated efforts of the management, we were able to effectively control production costs while achieving growth in sales of highmargin products. As a result, we delivered a strong EBITDA margin of 41.6%. Despite a certain reduction in our free cash flow from the record high of 2022, the 2023 level of RUB 70.2 bln is still one of our best results over the past decade. We also completed the year with a comfortable level of net debt (RUB 223.2 bln) and a net  debt/ EBITDA ratio of 1.2x.",

Over this period, we have invested over RUB 390 bln in developing our business. The output of core products has expanded by over 80%, from 6.1 mt in 2013 to 11.3 mt in 2023. Last year, the Company made a record investment of more than RUB 64 bln (including capitalised repairs). In 2024, the plan is to reach a level of RUB 73 bln.\n\nEfforts to create new and upgrade existing production capacities across the Group's sites progress smoothly in line with our Strategy to 2025. One of the key achievements has been the successful completion of an investment project in Volkhov to build a mineral fertilizer plant with a capacity of more than 1 mt. With total investments of RUB 34 bln, it will be the industry's trailblazer in innovations for years to come. Thanks to the plant's complete overhaul and new construction, the annual output of mineral fertilizers and other chemical products will be in excess of 1 mt.\n\nIn Cherepovets, in addition to upgrading ammonia and phosphoric and sulphuric acid production capacities, we are running\n\na project to ramp up the processing of phosphate rock and to build a conveyor belt for phosphogypsum. In Balakovo, phase 3 of our production site saw the completion of projects to ramp up output of feed phosphates and sulphuric acid.\n\nPhosAgro is a vertically integrated company, and we take active steps to develop our raw material base. In 2023, we came close to finalising a project for the construction of a new +10 m level at the Kirovsky mine. In Q4 2023, the level's second start-up facility was launched.\n\nPhosAgro's accomplishments in financial, investment, and social responsibility domains have garnered strong recognition from both Russian and international business and investment communities. In 2023, the Company ranked among Russia's top 10 companies in terms of net profit according to Forbes and among the top 10 Russian companies included on the list of the 500 largest companies in Europe by revenue as assessed by the renowned Fortune magazine.\n\nHow has the Company's product portfolio been evolving?\n\nHow did the geography of the Company's sales change in 2023?\n\nIn 2023, we expanded our portfolio to include 58 fertilizer grades, with plans to increase this number to 100 by 2030. This expansion will include innovative products such as biologised fertilizers, fertilizers with a prolonged effect, plant growth enhancers, and new ameliorants.\n\nIn 2023, in collaboration with Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology, PhosAgro embarked on the development of a new line of biologised mineral fertilizers. We also started the production of water soluble MAP at our Volkhov facility. This is an eco-friendly product that can be effectively applied on all major crops without requiring special equipment. In February 2023, the Company completed the shipment of the first batch of ApaSil, a new product made by Apatit's Cherepovets site. ApaSil serves to boost plant growth, induce its\n\nOur primary and unwavering focus remains the supply of mineral fertilizers to the crucial Russian market, where we aim to maintain and strengthen our leading position.\n\nDespite the constant volatility of the international market, PhosAgro has been able to hold its ground over the recent years, demonstrating unprecedented flexibility and adaptability. We have continued to increase supplies, primarily to emerging markets, with friendly countries accounting for almost as much as 75% of total exports (compared to 70% in 2022).\n\nnatural immunity, and help unlock biological potential even under severe stress conditions. Additionally, we expanded our portfolio of products for animal farming, placing on the market a new phosphogypsum-based product used as bedding in farms and poultry houses.\n\nTogether with Innopraktika, PhosAgro is implementing a project titled Innagro designed to create seven innovative products. Three of them have successfully passed all tests and are now in production. AgroGard, a leading Russian agricultural holding company, and other partners are already making active use of innovative biofungicide Metabacterin, Enzymesporin probiotic, and Fermasil biological preservative, all with exceptionally positive feedback.\n\nIn 2023, Latin America became one of our priority export markets, as supplies surged 1.5-fold to 3.2 mt.\n\nPhosAgro has maintained its position as Russia's leading fertilizer exporter to African countries, ramping up deliveries to the continent to over 550 kt. The Company accounts for 33% of all Russian fertilizer supplies to Africa, where our eco-friendly products, free from dangerous concentrations of cadmium and other toxic substances capable of harming the health of people and soils, are made available to more than 20 countries. We also have ambitious plans for the future, aiming to double our supplies to Africa in the next three years.",

What were the primary accomplishments here in 2023?\n\nGRI 2-22\n\nIn 2023, the Company made its debut offering of RUB-denominated exchange-traded bonds for RUB 20 bln on the Moscow Exchange. These were assigned credit ratings of ru\u0410\u0410\u0410 (EXP) and e\u0410\u0410\u0410(RU) respectively from the Expert RA and ACRA agencies. With more than two-fold oversubscription for the bonds, the Company was able to revise its coupon rate guidance downwards three times, achieving the minimum spread to the yield of Russian federal bonds among corporate issuers: 89 bps. The coupon yield was 9.4% p.a., payable semi-annually.\n\nAlso in 2023, PhosAgro made its debut offering of CNY 2 bln exchange-traded bonds on the Moscow Exchange. The variable coupon is linked to the China Loan Prime Rate (LPR 1Y) + 1.2%, and we were able to achieve a reduction from the initial level of 1.3% on the back of strong investor demand.\n\nOur commitment to sustainability lies at the core of our operations. All investment projects and programmes, along with new product lines, rely on the best available techniques, keeping the welfare of society and the environment in mind. The Company continues to uphold all its social commitments, preserving and expanding initiatives in the realm of corporate social responsibility.\n\nThis year, I would like to highlight the social dimension of sustainable development. Our employees have always been our most valuable asset. In August 2023, PhosAgro Group facilities signed new collective bargaining agreements, effective until 2026. We successfully expanded the list of benefits and their financial value while preserving and ramping up all widely used healthcare and recreation programmes, as well as our subsidised corporate housing programme. Support for veterans' organisations was also bolstered, with all that done taking into account the expectations and needs of our employees.\n\nPhosAgro remains committed to raising the level of employee remuneration: between 2021 and 2023, the average pay went up by 60%, and at the start of 2024, we introduced an additional increase of 15%. With our social and financial support programmes, we work to improve the well-being of the employees, which I believe\n\nIn August 2023, we were the first Russian issuer to offer replacement bonds worth USD 740 mln.\n\nOne of the major developments related to our debt management was the successful redemption of the USD 500 mln Eurobond issue in late April 2023. We had the issue refinanced, among other things using part of the proceeds from the two exchange-traded bond issues (for CNY 2 bln and RUB 20 bln) that we previously offered on the Moscow Exchange.\n\nThese deals enabled PhosAgro to secure available market financing under the best conditions to go ahead with its development programmes and loan portfolio refinancing. PhosAgro acts in the interests of its existing and potential investors, honours all its obligations in full, and continues its active efforts in this domain.\n\nis a crucial incentive for further productivity enhancements following its 2.6x increase over the past decade.\n\nWe continued to develop our corporate system for training engineering personnel and fostering education and science in agriculture through projects such as School-College/UniversityFacility, From Mine to Plate, and Pro Agro Lectorium. Last year marked the 20th anniversary of PhosAgro's key social initiative DROZD (Educated and Healthy Children of Russia), which has benefited over 150,000 students to date.\n\nWe are also advancing projects related to soil fertility preservation on a global scale in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, as well as implementing green energy at our facilities. In 2023, the Company joined the UN Global Compact's new initiative that calls for an accelerated achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As part of that commitment, we will be contributing to a faster achievement of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) by advancing sustainable water resource management. Finally, Tashkent hosted the seventh round of the grant awards ceremony for the best young scientists from all over the world as part of Green Chemistry for Life, a joint grant programme by PhosAgro, UNESCO and IUPAC.\n\n## What are your forecasts for 2024?\n\nIn 2024, we will carry on our with our objectives as outlined in the Strategy to 2025. We have a record CAPEX of RUB 73 bln 1 planned for the upcoming year. Our focus remains on the development of our raw material base, with plans to start underground mining within the Gakman block of the Kirovsky mine's Yukspor deposit. In Cherepovets and Volkhov, we aim to complete a project to increase the processing of phosphate rock by a combined total of nearly 400 kt. In Balakovo, phase 3 of our production site development will continue, involving a flexible MAP/DAP/NPS/NPK fertilizer production scheme and delivering an increase in total output. We also anticipate reaching the target capacity for feed phosphate production, increasing by 14% to 443 ktpa. Furthermore, we plan to achieve the design capacity of the upgraded SK-20 technological system. As a result, the facility's sulphuric acid production is set to expand by 13% to 3 mtpa.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Including capitalised repairs.\n\nAt the same time, as PhosAgro continues to grow, safety and environmental protection will remain our top priorities.\n\nI would like to express my gratitude to all PhosAgro employees for their dedication and great performance in achieving our strategic goals. I also extend my thanks to our broad range of stakeholders, including investors, shareholders, customers, contractors, and suppliers. Our 2023 results clearly demonstrate that together we have chosen the right path to pursue, with our team's efforts paving the way for the Company's unprecedented achievements.",

Thus, by mid-May, domestic fertilizer producers secured more than 60% of the sector's forecast procurement volume for the entire 2023.\n\n## USA notified banks that the export of Russian fertilizers was permitted\n\nThe US Department of State said that it regularly communicated with US and foreign banks to remind them that transactions with Russian food and fertilizers are exempt from sanctions. The statement was made after Russia had long insisted that the prohibition on imposing sanctions on Russian agricultural commodities and fertilizers must be respected.\n\n## JUNE\n\n## Russia extended domestic price threshold for mineral fertilizers\n\nThe price threshold set for mineral fertilizers was extended for the entire year of 2023 and remained at the 2022 level.

The quotas are aimed at keeping sufficient volumes of fertilizers on the domestic market.\n\nLater on, in November 2023, the government raised the total export quota to more than 18.5 mt, thus ensuring that producers would be able to export the remaining finished products, provided that domestic demand was fully met.\n\nIn late November 2023, the government resolved to extend the fertilizer export quotas until 31 May 2024. The quota totalled 16.9 mt, including around 9.8 mt of nitrogen-based and 7.1 mt of complex fertilizers.\n\nin December 2021, the threshold was intended to keep mineral fertilizers affordable to Russian farmers. Later on, this measure was prolonged until the end of May 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## G7 adopted action statement for resilient global food security\n\nAt the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, the leaders of the member countries adopted an action statement for resilient global food security.

Africa, North America, and South America experienced growth rates of approximately 4-5%, while markets in South and Southeast Asia demonstrated relatively slower demand resurgence.\n\nThe primary driver of fertilizer demand recovery in global markets was the enhanced affordability of fertilizers, particularly following a decline in prices during 2H 2023.\n\n## Estimate of changes in consumption by region in 2023,\n\nmt nutrient\n\nEast Asia\n\nSouth Asia\n\nMiddle East\n\nLatin America\n\nNorth America\n\nAfrica\n\nCIS\n\nEurope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNitrogen-based\n\nfertilizers, N\n\nPhosphate-based\n\nfertilizers, P\u2082\u041e\u2085\n\nPotash\n\nfertilizers, K\u2082\u041e\n\n- 1 Hereinafter based on data by CRU, Argusmedia, Profercy; expert estimates of industry analysts in Russian and international media.\n\n0",

The most notable increase in phosphate rock production was seen in North Africa (Morocco and Egypt, with a combined growth of 7.0 mt) and China (+0.8 mt). At the same time, there was a decrease in production in the USA (-1.2 mt) and Jordan (-0.7 mt).\n\nPricing in the phosphate rock market has the traditional time lag associated with changes in price indices in phosphatebased fertilizer markets. In 1H 2023, prices for key types of phosphate rock remained relatively high before price correction kicked in during the second half of the year, following the trend for phosphate-based fertilizers.\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, global production of complex phosphate-based fertilizers (DAP + MAP) in 2023 reached 62 mt, a 3 mt (+5%) increase y-o-y that reflects temporary recovery of demand for phosphate fertilizers in general in 2023. The growth in production of these fertilizers came primarily from China, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nGlobal trade in DAP/MAP in 2023 was up by 3.2 mt, or 12%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDec\n\nGlobal DAP/MAP prices in 2023, FOB Baltic, USD/t\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNoticeable import growth was recorded in Latin America, where MAP imports increased by 25% to 5.5 mt. While India maintained a stable level of DAP imports and North America posted an import growth, in Europe a recovery in phosphate fertilizer imports was still not happening.\n\nDuring 1H 2023, prices in the phosphate-based fertilizer market faced downward pressure due to weak\n\ndemand from major sales markets and an increase in supply, partly attributed to the easing of export restrictions in China. However, prices gradually began to recover in the second half of the year, stabilising at above USD 500/t, FOB Baltic (for DAP/MAP) by Q4 2023. The price rebound in 2H 2023 was primarily driven by the seasonal demand uptick in India, Brazil, and North America.\n\n## NITROGEN/uniF6BABASED FERTILIZER MARKET\n\nIn 2023, the global nitrogen-based fertilizer market remained highly volatile, with prices experiencing significant fluctuations of up to 30-50% in both ways within short timeframes. This volatility was attributed to various factors, including continued uncertainty and high prices in energy markets, supply chain disruptions in key regions, trade restrictions, and unscheduled technical shutdowns at major production facilities.\n\nPreliminary estimates indicate a 3.5% or 6.3 mt increase in global urea production in 2023, reaching a total of 182 mt. India and China saw the strongest production growth, driven by increased utilisation of new capacities commissioned between 2021 and 2022. Conversely, countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia faced production reductions due to technical shutdowns. After a considerable\n\n## POTASH FERTILIZER MARKET\n\nUnlike the phosphate and nitrogenbased fertilizer markets, the global market of potash fertilizers saw no recovery in demand in 2023. The increase in potassium chloride imports to China and Brazil was offset by weak demand and reduced imports in other key consumption markets, including Southeast Asia, South Asia, Europe, and other regions.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, exports from Russia and Belarus exceeded forecasts by a significant margin. Coupled with increased production and exports from Laos following the launch of new capacities in 2021 and 2022, this resulted in an oversupply in the global market and a downward price pressure throughout 2023.\n\n## Global urea prices in 2023, FOB Baltic, USD/t\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndecline in 2022, European urea production only managed to recover by a quarter.\n\nGlobal urea trade volumes in 2023 stayed virtually flat at some\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Potassium chloride prices in 2023, FOB Baltic, USD/t\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0",

Over the last three years (2021-2023), revenue from fertilizers developed in\n\n2019-2023 was more than RUB 60.3 bln, or 5.2% of total sales of the Company's chemical products 1 . The Company's ability to maintain a substantial share of new grades is underpinned by the strong R&D capabilities of NIUIF and PhosAgro Innovation Centre.\n\n- For more information on our innovative fertilizer grades, see the Research and Education section.\n\n## PhosAgro is actively developing the following premium products:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfertilizers with micronutrients are considered one of the most potent ways to combat malnutrition and reduce nutrient deficiencies, as the micronutrients can be accumulated by plants and thus benefit the human diet;\n\nbiological and biomineral fertilizers are expected to become one of the most effective solutions to ensuring global food security by boosting agrochemical efficiency of plant nutrition systems without damaging the ecosystem;\n\ncoated fertilizers provide increased environmental and agrochemical efficiency due to coating with a mixture of monocalcium and dicalcium phosphates.\n\n- 1 Due to certain aspects of accounting, the revenue does not include the margin.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTargets 2.4, 12.4, 13.1, 13.2.\n\nExpanding sales of efficient and eco-friendly mineral fertilizers and developing innovative plant nutrition systems, including those that limit greenhouse gas emissions and help adapt to climate change\n\nus to respond swiftly to changes in the market demand, while maintaining full capacity utilisation.\n\n## BOOSTING LOGISTICS EFFICIENCY\n\nRail transport accounts for the most part of the Company's domestic shipments (ca. 99%). In 2023, freight turnover totalled 29.3 mt, up 1.0% against 2022, with further growth to 31.0 mt expected in 2024.\n\nRail shipments are also a focus area of key initiatives aimed at improving the reliability of product deliveries and reducing transportation costs. Ensuring a secure supply is a top priority for us.\n\n## REDUCTION OF TRANSPORTATION COSTS\n\nAs part of implementing the Strategy to 2025, we have significantly increased reliance on our own rolling stock, buying mostly innovative railcars with a higher capacity and longer run life. Increased reliance on PhosAgro's own rolling stock means:\n\n- \u00b7  enhanced safety of operation and more reliable supplies, as PhosAgro Group's production and logistics processes are less dependent on third-party services;\n- \u00b7  higher cost efficiency, as corporate railcars are cheaper in use than third-party rolling stock;\n- \u00b7  a positive environmental effect, as the use of innovative rolling stock with higher cargo tonnage per railcar and train reduces the negative impact on the environment per tonne of cargo.\n\nOther areas of focus to ensure transportation security and optimise transportation costs in 2023 included:\n\n- \u00b7  developing mutually beneficial terms and entering into agreements with Russian Railways to co-finance the development of transport infrastructure at railway stations adjacent to Apatit's production sites: Volkhov branch - final stage, Balakovo branch - planning stage;\n- \u00b7  securing tariff preferences for the shipment of liquid sulphur and sulphuric acid;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Target 12.4.\n\nManaging chemicals and wastes wisely throughout their life cycle, including transportation\n\n- \u00b7  verifying the possibility of receiving subsidies for export transportation of industrial products by rail in the period from 2022 to 2024 according to Decree of the Government of Russia No. 1347 On State Support of Russian Industrial Organisations in Order to Compensate Expenses for Transportation of Industrial Products dated 28 July 2022.\n\n## Increased reliance on corporate rolling stock, railcars\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of the fleet renewal programme in 2023, we procured\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6,000 containers, 402 mineral hoppers and 165 tank cars for\n\nmolten sulphur.",

Throughput capacity depends on a number of factors, such as availability of rolling stock, length of railways, combination of rolling stock types, and quality of traffic organisation. Thanks to our comprehensive investment programmes, we have been able to expand the throughput capacity of our key production facilities' railway infrastructure to or above target levels over the last three years.\n\nIn particular, in order to achieve the target, the Company launched a rolling stock renewal programme to 2034 in November 2022. As part of the programme, we plan to procure 392 ore dump cars and 11 electric locomotives for the Kirovsk branch, as\n\nwell as 23 shunting locomotives for the Cherepovets facility and the Balakovo branch.\n\nAs at the end of the reporting year, the construction of a container yard and the installation of the required equipment at the phosphate facility in Cherepovets was practically completed, which will allow for a significant increase in future container shipments.\n\nAs part of a four-party agreement between Apatit, Severstal, Russian Railways and Lengiprotrans, we are modelling the operation of Cherepovets railway hub, with a list of measures to be drawn up to handle both current and future freight turnover.\n\nIn 2023, as part of a comprehensive Volkhov branch development project, rail infrastructure throughput at the Volkhov site was ramped up to 4.0 mtpa from 3.8 mtpa as at the end of 2022, which exceeds the target set\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Target 9.1.\n\nDeveloping rail infrastructure and contributing to the development of local communities through our value chain\n\nin the Strategy to 2025. The project implementation continues. We have reached an agreement with Russian Railways to co-finance the construction of public infrastructure as part of the second stage. Freight turnover in 2025 is expected to reach 4.5 mtpa, which exceeds the targets of Strategy to 2025.\n\nWe continued to work on expanding the transport infrastructure at the Balakovo branch to support the planned increase in finished product shipments and acceptance of new raw materials potassium chloride and ammonium sulphate. The Company plans to increase the throughput capacity of railway infrastructure in Balakovo from the current 7.2 mtpa to 8.9 mtpa by 2025 (which also exceeds the Strategy to 2025 target). To that end, more than 12 km of railway tracks are currently being laid in addition to the existing 51 km.\n\n## Progress towards our targets, mtpa\n\n| Freight turnover of chemical facilities' railway infrastructure   |   2021  (actual) |   2022  (actual) | 2023  (actual)   |   Strategy to 2025 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| Cherepovets site                                                  |             15.2 |             15.4 | 15.3             |               16.5 |\n| Balakovo branch                                                   |              6.7 |              6.7 | 7. 2             |                8   |\n| Volkhov branch                                                    |              2.6 |              3.8 | 4.0              |                3.8 |\n| Total                                                             |             24.5 |             25.9 | 26.5             |               28.3 |\n\n## DEVELOPING PORT INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nIn addition to developing logistics and sales infrastructure across Russia, our priority market, we are working to increase the reliability and efficiency of our exports by both reducing transhipment costs and providing stateof-the-art transhipment capacities.\n\nOur strategic aim is to develop and maintain a balanced port sales infrastructure in terms of costs and reliability, capable of handling at least 8 mtpa of fertilizer exports. To achieve this target, in 2023 the Company revised a number of existing transhipment contracts and entered into new ones covering the required export volumes and effective through 2028. As of today,\n\nwe have basically secured the required transhipment capacities in line with the 8 mtpa target. Given our plans to expand production capacities, the work is underway to consider the measures that would increase the available transshipment capacity to 9-10 mtpa.\n\nThe ports key to PhosAgro Group's operations are located in the NorthWest of Russia. In the Leningrad region and St Petersburg: European Sulphur Terminal, Petrolesport, First Container Terminal, and St Petersburg Port, in Murmansk: Murmansk Bulk Terminal. The Company also uses its own terminal at the HaminaKotka port in Finland. We rely on specialised terminals and their equipment designed to mitigate the environmental impact.\n\n## OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTION GROWTH\n\n## CAPACITY EXPANSION\n\nThe long-term growth in demand for mineral fertilizers has been steady. In order to respond to stronger demand, PhosAgro focuses on expanding capacities to produce its key products, which is one of our key strategic goals for 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Delivery on production targets, mt\n\n|   Item |   2021 (actual) |   2022 (actual) |   2023 (plan) 1 |   2023 (actual) |   2024 (plan) | Strategy to 2025                                        |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|    2.4 |             2.5 |             2.5 |             2.6 |             2.5 |           2.6 | Production of nitrogen-based  fertilizers               |\n|    7.9 |             8.2 |             8.4 |             8.4 |             8.7 |           8.9 | Production of phosphate  fertilizers and feed-grade MCP |\n|    8   |             8.7 |             9   |             9.1 |             9.3 |           8.4 | In-house processing  of phosphate rock                  |\n\n- 1 The Board of Directors approved an updated plan on 30 August 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## S172 STATEMENT\n\nAccording to Section 172 'Duty to promote the success of the company' of the UK Companies Act 2006, PhosAgro's Board of Directors acts in good faith for the benefit of the Company to promote its success, taking into account possible long-term consequences of its decisions for society and the environment, as well as the interests of the Company's employees and other stakeholders.\n\nFor the members of PhosAgro's Board of Directors, these standards mean that the Group's stakeholders should be interacted with responsibly and that their interests should be respected to the maximum extent possible when making decisions within the Board of Directors' scope of authority.\n\nAt least once a year, the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee of the Board of Directors reviews feedback from stakeholders on aspects of the Company's operations that are material to them.\n\nSuch feedback is used both to identify topics and indicators to be disclosed in the Company's non-financial reporting and to determine mechanisms for engagement with the Company's stakeholders, including at the Board level.\n\n- For more information on the Company's stakeholders and engagement with them, see the Stakeholder Engagement section of this Report on page 28, which also contains references to related Performance Review subsections describing approaches to opinion surveys of relevant stakeholders and collecting data on their interests to be taken into account by the Company's governance bodies when making decisions.\n\nAs the Company's key governance body, the Board of Directors aligns its decision with their understanding of stakeholder interests shaped as part of management communications, Board and committee meetings, approval of non-financial reporting, and study of other information sources.\n\nThe reporting year saw the resumption of on-site Board meetings at the Company's production facilities. These meeting help the Board of Directors reach a completely new level in engaging with the whole range of stakeholders - regional and municipal governments, key management of PhosAgro's subsidiaries, production teams, and local communities.\n\nIn August 2023, such meeting took place at the Volkhov production site which completed a major investment project in the reporting year. The project culminated in the construction of a unique mineral fertilizer plant with a capacity of more than 1 mt. The Board of Directors made a tour of the facility, held meetings with key employees, and took part in the opening of renovated social facilities and commissioning of another apartment block for Volkhov branch employees.\n\nOn-site meetings are a vital element of feedback which helps the Board of Directors gain a thorough understanding of the Company's economic, social and environmental impact and make decisions taking into account the interests of a very wide range of stakeholders to the fullest extent possible.\n\nOur employees have a special place among the Company's stakeholders. Their welfare, including fair remuneration along with successful development and effective social\n\nsupport, is an area of focus for the Board of Directors, especially its Remuneration and Human Resources Committee, the chairman of which regularly reports to the Board of Directors on relevant progress. Although at the moment we do not apply such practices as appointing directors from among the employees or appointing a non-executive director responsible for interaction with employees for considering their standpoint when managing the Company, we consider it effective and are actively involved in a dialogue on all major management issues with the trade union organisation (Minudobreniya Association), which has historically been an equal partner for PhosAgro Group's management and an authorised representative of employees in collective bargaining, review and resolution of labour disputes. The Board of Directors can acquaint itself with the opinion of the Minudobreniya Association and take it into account when making decisions on the key matters of the Company's development both during personal meetings, in particular when visiting production sites, and indirectly from management reports at the meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees.\n\nOn top of that, the Audit Committee reviews reports submitted by PhosAgro's and its counterparties' employees to the PhosAgro hot line as well as management response to such reports on a quarterly basis. The Board of Directors and its Remuneration and Human Resources Committee also discuss the results of an annual employee satisfaction and loyalty survey launched in 2013.\n\n## PROSPECTS\n\nPhosAgro Group's development scenarios are reviewed by the Board of Directors when approving its Strategy. The strategic planning cycle adopted by the Company is five years, with the current approved strategy effective from 2021 to 2025. Despite increasing uncertainty as regards the Company's growth prospects and external factors, the Board of Directors decided to stick to a five-year planning horizon in line with existing practices.\n\nSince 2019, the Board of Directors has been considering a contingency plan to prepare for critical changes in the external operating environment, such as possible restrictions on our supplies to key markets.\n\nFor PhosAgro Group, 2021 was marked by the countervailing duties imposed on Russian and Moroccan producers in the US market, tighter pricing control and the introduction of quotas and export licences in Russia.\n\nIn 2023, countervailing duties and the export quota system remained in force. The restrictions caused by international sanctions and supply chain disruptions still made it difficult for the Company to deliver its products to its traditional markets.\n\nIn 2023, similarly to the previous year, the Company was adversely affected by the termination of operations in\n\nRussia by some Western suppliers of equipment, services and technology, as well as by difficulties in making payments.\n\nWhen approving the Strategy to 2025, the Board of Directors also weighed the associated strategic risks. The Board of Directors reviews the results of key risk monitoring every quarter, while also looking into their reassessment at the end of the year. Each risk has a dedicated risk management map, containing a detailed description along with mitigants and probability, materiality and risk appetite estimates.\n\nThe previous year's risk profile and materiality assessment remained relevant in 2023. At the same time, the Board of Directors analyses new risks that can affect the Company's ability to perform its obligations and continue business. The key challenges of the reporting year, primarily sanctions and restrictions, did not lead to disruptions of our operations, which proves that we correctly identified and successfully managed these risks, while also taking advantage in such areas as production, sales growth, HR management, and sustainable development.\n\n- For more information on the Company's strategic risks, see the Strategic Report section on page 68\n\nDespite the materialisation of these risks, the Company ensures uninterrupted operation of all its production sites, timely supply of fertilizers, and care for its employees and their families. PhosAgro Group's team manages to cope with the new challenges in a short space of time, not just keeping the business stable, but reaching new highs. Risks materialised in 2023 did not require us to adjust our Strategy to 2025.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Board of Directors finds it reasonable to believe that the Company will, without any reservations, be able to continue its operations and meet all its obligations as they fall due while the Strategy to 2025 is in force.",

WE CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOP AND IMPROVE OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, WHICH ENABLES US TO IDENTIFY EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL RISKS IN A TIMELY MANNER AND DEVELOP EFFECTIVE MITIGANTS.\n\n## Impact on sustainability\n\nEffective starting June 2023 is IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information. This standard requires disclosure of information about sustainability-related risks. These are defined as risks that can affect an entity's cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium and long term. Under the standard, said risks arise as part of an entity's interactions with stakeholders, society, the economy and the natural environment throughout its value chain.\n\n2023 is not a reporting period for the application of IFRS S1. However, for more comprehensive disclosure of information, the Company has classified its risks based on their impact on sustainability, and has described this impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nIn pursuing its goals, the Company is guided by risk appetite, or the level of risk it deems acceptable. Risk appetite is an integral part of strategic and operational decisionmaking. The Board of Directors defines the overall risk appetite when reviewing the Company's risks and also as part of approving its strategy, budget and investment programme and considering other matters within the Board's scope of authority. Risk appetite is then reflected in the Company's specific procedures and key performance indicators.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISKS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a reliable borrower, the Company seeks to raise funding on the most attractive terms available in the market. The Company's core operations are FX-linked, so we use natural hedging methods to manage our FX risk. We are not ready to take on credit risk related to our counterparties: in our relations with them, we either seek to secure terms and conditions we see as most beneficial to us or use risk transfer strategies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- zero risk appetite (no operations) 0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nminimum risk appetite (reduction of risk exposure to the largest extent possible) 1\n\n## STRATEGIC RISKS\n\n4\n\n2\n\nThe Company aims to identify and use opportunities that open up in the market as a result of changes in the external environment. The Company quickly responds to the changing operating landscape and targets priority markets that offer the best terms and conditions to sell its products. At the same time, the Company's business model is designed in a way that ensures operational efficiency while maintaining a commitment to sustainable development.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company aims to prevent any disruptions to its business processes and IT infrastructure performance and to also secure maximum protection from cyber threats and fraud.

It was driven by both growth of sales volumes (especially in the segment of highmargin products) and effective cost control, with cost reduction coming primarily on the back of the investment programme successfully implemented in the previous years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alexander Sharabaika\n\nDeputy CEO for Finance and International Projects at PhosAgro\n\nIn the reporting year, the Company's revenue went above RUB 440 bln, EBITDA reached RUB 183 bln, and adjusted net profit came in at RUB 104 bln. Even though this constituted a decline compared to 2022 with its historically high global fertilizer prices, these results are nonetheless among the strongest on record. Another highlight was the EBITDA margin, which remained at a very high level of over 40%.\n\nIn 2023, the Company had a free cash flow of more than RUB 70 bln, driven by continuously high capital investments and additional liquidity outflows associated with the payment of newly introduced export duties and the year-end transfer of RUB 6.4 bln as an advance payment towards the excess profit tax liabilities.\n\nRobust financial position, capital investments without budget overruns, and a strong free cash flow enable us to fully meet all our debt obligations (including those denominated in foreign currencies) in a timely manner. As at the end of 2023, PhosAgro's leverage remained at a comfortable level, with net debt standing at RUB 223.2 bln and the net debt/ EBITDA ratio coming in at 1.2x. The share of USD-denominated debt also continued to decline.\n\nThe high credit quality of the Company was further confirmed by the success of two exchange-traded bond issues (for CNY 2 bln and RUB 20 bln), which helped, among other things, replace more than 74% of the two remaining PHOR-25 and PHOR-28 Eurobond issues for a total amount of USD 740.4 mln\n\n> RUB 440 bln Company revenue in 2023\n\nRUB 104 bln adjusted net profit\n\n41.6 % EBITDA margin\n\n## KEY EXTERNAL DRIVERS OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nIN ADDITION TO INCREASED SALES VOLUMES AND CONTINUOUSLY COMPETITIVE COST LEVELS, THE STRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS IN 2023 WERE DRIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING MARKET EVENTS:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSignificant increase in mineral fertilizer consumption, primarily in Latin America, Africa, South Asia and Oceania, due to a good fertilizer/crop price ratio, favourable weather conditions in key markets, and stronger government support for agriculture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRestrictions on exports of phosphate-based fertilizers from China to bolster domestic supply and introduction of fertilizer export quotas in Russia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrowth of global crop prices underpinned in part by the growing demand for forage crops, which itself was partially caused by the recovery of hog production in China after the swine flu epidemic in 2018-2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFertilizer affordability issues caused by supply disruptions and an increase in raw materials prices",

PhosAgro Group's feedstock reserves are of igneous origin, which means that they do not\n\nhave concentrations of toxic heavy metals. The Company's phosphate rock is extremely rich in P2O5. The mineral resource base (including off-balance reserves) at one of the world's richest and purest deposits is expected to last for about 60 years.\n\n77.0 % of ore coming from open-pit mining in 2023\n\n39.2 mt total apatite-nepheline ore production in 2023\n\n## PhosAgro Group's ore reserves as at 1 January 2024\n\n| Deposit             | Balance reserves, kt  (A+B+C1+C2)   | Average P2O5  content, %   |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Kukisvumchorr       | 335,180                             | 14.12                      |\n| Yukspor             | 447,413                             | 13.76                      |\n| Apatitovy Cirque    | 79,900                              | 13.58                      |\n| Rasvumchorr Plateau | 351,883                             | 12.06                      |\n| Koashva             | 249,922                             | 17. 28                     |\n| Njorkpahk           | 52,729                              | 14.25                      |\n| Total               | 1,517,027                           | 14.03                      |\n\nAt the close of 2023, reserves at the Rasvumchorr Plateau saw an augmentation attributable to the allocation of reserves from the unallocated area under licence MUR 00892 TE. Conversely, for other deposits, there was a decline in balance reserves from the previous year, which aligns with the extracted ore volumes.\n\nCurrently, the Company is shifting its resource base development profile from open-pit mining to a higher share of underground mining. In the reporting year, the share of open-pit mining came in at 77%.\n\nThe total apatite-nepheline ore production in 2023 nearly matched the preceding year, with a marginal decrease of less than 0.8% to 39.2 mt from 39.5 mt in 2022.\n\nA significant development in October 2023 was the launch of the second start-up facility (Yukspor flank)\n\nat the Kirovsky mine, signifying a milestone in the Construction of +10 m level project. The effort involved roughly 2,000 specialists from more than 50 contractors. These were underground works, melding bleeding-edge technologies with exceptional technical solutions, inclusive of ballastless railway tracks and high-capacity rolling stock. The crushing and delivery equipment utilises durable materials and pioneering technologies to extend useful life, while state-of-the-art equipment bolstered the productivity of the continuous handling system for both the Kukisvumchorr and Yukspor flanks. The facility will help us compensate for diminishing ore volumes and ramp up ore production at the Kirovsky mine to 25 mt per annum over the next triennium, an 8.6% increment relative\n\nto existing production figures. The total investment earmarked for this project is estimated at RUB 38.4 bln.\n\nIn 2023, the Company continued with the investment project to construct a new mine for the Rasvumchorr Plateau deposit.\n\nThe project encompasses the construction of two start-up facilities. The first one at the +430 m level with a 4 mt capacity is set to commence ore extraction in 2Q 2025. The second one at the +310 m level is slated for launch in 2031, with a maximum production capacity of 6 mt by 2035. The total capital investment for this venture is estimated at roughly RUB 37.7 bln.\n\nBy year-end 2024, underground mining is to begin within the Gakman block of the Kirovsky mine's Yukspor deposit.\n\nOn top of that, we remain committed to the active implementation of our sustainable development strategy. In 2023, the mining and processing plant of Apatit consumed a total of 300 million kWh of green electricity. The share of its output produced using green electricity generated by the hydroelectric power plants of TGC-1 increased to 18.1%.\n\n18.1 %\n\nthe shape of its output produced using green electricity generated by the hydroelectric power plants of TG\u0421\n\n## CHEMICAL PRODUCTION\n\n## FEEDSTOCK\n\n## Production volume, kt\n\n| Item              | 2021          | 2022      | 2023      |   \u0394 2023/2022,% |\n|-------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Ammonia           | 1,931.10      | 1,985.30  | 1,982.80  |           -0.13 |\n| Phosphoric acid   | 2,952.00      | 3,199.40  | 3,345.30  |            4.6  |\n| Sulphuric acid    | 7, 3 52 . 2 0 | 7,920.20  | 8,120.00  |            2.5  |\n| Ammonium sulphate | 259.00        | 322.60    | 260.20    |          -19.3  |\n| Total             | 12,494.30     | 13,427.60 | 13,708.30 |            2.1  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, the production of phosphoric acid, the key feedstock used in phosphate fertilizers, reached\n\n3.3 mt, increasing by 4.6% y-o-y on the back of earlier production unit upgrades and increased equipment utilisation efficiency.\n\nIn 2023, sulphuric acid production was up by 2.5% y-o-y to\n\n8.1 mt.\n\nThis was fuelled by greater efficiency of sulphuric acid production in Cherepovets and the launch of a new sulphuric acid facility in Balakovo in late 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmmonia output was virtually flat\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ny-o-y at nearly\n\n2\n\nmt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe decline in ammonium sulphate output in 2023 can be attributed to the scaled-down production of NPS grades in line with the market environment.\n\nThe Company proceeded with its Vostochny mine development project seeking to intensify open-pit mining.

The target to further develop and increase the Vostochny mine's production was revised to 9.5 mt by 2027, as outlined in the updated Programme for the Development of the Ore and Raw Material Base of Apatit's Kirovsk Branch for 2019-2035.\n\n8.6 mt of ore total production at the Vostochny mine in 2023",

        "page_content": "We are committed to the ethical principles of animal welfare and seek to avoid using animals for research. In 2021, we revised our Code of Ethics to state our position on this matter. In line with the Code of Ethics, PhosAgro Group does not conduct experiments on animals, except as required by law; when conducting an expert examination of fertilizers, the main method of evaluating information on the toxicity and hazard of a multi-component substance to animals is to analyse information from national and international databases, as well as information on previously registered fertilizers. Currently, there are very few alternatives to animal research that are recognised by the government.\n\nWe are doing our best to expand the range of allowed research methods and reduce experiments on animals.\n\n## FOREIGN REGULATIONS AND CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS APPLIED TO MINERAL FERTILIZERS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\nPhosAgro Group's products exported to EU customers have been registered pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH). For companies, REACH conformity means greater responsibility for assessing the risks associated with the use of chemicals and providing users with relevant safety information. Companies producing or importing 10 tonnes or more\n\nof hazardous substances per year are required to submit not only technical data, but also a chemical safety assessment (CSA). All information on such substances is communicated by PhosAgro Group in full to the regulators.\n\nPursuant to the above Regulation, Apatit's products contain no substances which are subject to restrictions on their sales in the European Union.\n\nWe produce ammonium nitrate (AN) CAS 6484-52-2 EC No. 229-347-8, which is subject to para 58, Annex XVII of REACH. However, it does not apply if a fertilizer conforms to specifications defined in Annex I and Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 of the European Parliament and of the Council. To assess conformity, samples of ammonium nitrate are sent quarterly to the Inspectorate Estonia AS lab for detonation resistance and oil retention tests. The results are formalised by a protocol for compliance with the requirements of Annex I and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2019/1009.\n\nIn addition, para 30 of Annex XVII to REACH lists substances specified in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 and classified as toxic to reproduction, Category 1A/1B. These include sodium tetraborate, which is on the list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) and is classified as a reproductive toxicant, Category 1\u0412, but the restrictions only apply to individual concentrations in the mixture above 4.5%. We produce NPK fertilizers with boron that contain sodium tetraborate at a concentration of 2-3%.\n\nTherefore, the special concentration level as defined in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 is not reached.\n\nThus, PhosAgro Group faces no restrictions under Annex XVII of Regulation No. 1907/2006.\n\nThe quality and safety of mineral fertilizers produced by the Company is confirmed by state registration certificates, declarations of conformity, and safety data sheets. According to expert reviews, new fertilizer grades of PhosAgro Group are effective and environmentally and toxicologically safe.\n\nThe products are properly classified, labelled and packaged in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 (Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation, CLP Regulation) and Regulation (\u0415U) 2019/1009. All types of manufactured fertilizers have safety data sheets (SDS).\n\nPhosAgro Group's unique phosphate-based fertilizers have perfectly low cadmium average content (0.2 mg per kg), making them among the safest in the world.\n\nOn 5 June 2019, the European Council and European Parliament approved the EU Regulation 2019/1009 (Fertilizing Products Regulation, FPR) on fertilizers, establishing new EU-wide rules for CE-marked fertilizers (also known as EU Fertilizing Products). The regulation provides for reducing cadmium content in EU fertilizers, by introducing a single cap\n\nat 60 mg per kg of P2O5 and banning inorganic fertilizers in the EU with a cadmium content above that cap starting from 16 July 2022. Going forward, the regulation provides for gradual reduction of cadmium content to no more than 20 mg per kg of of P\u2082O\u2085. The plans of cutting the cap to 40 mg per kg of P\u2082O\u2085 have been already announced. At the same time, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) has already issued recommendations\n\nfor a cadmium content in inorganic phosphate-based fertilizers of less than 20 mg per kg of P\u2082O\u2085.\n\nThus, PhosAgro Group's phosphatebased fertilizers have a much lower cadmium content than required in the EU, which is reflected in our product slogan: pure minerals for healthy lives.\n\nIn 2022, in line with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009, Apatit's mineral fertilizers were successfully certified by an independent notified body\n\n## Voluntary ESG certification of products\n\nGRI 2-28, 417-1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll agrochemicals of PhosAgro Group have been certified under the GOST R 58658-2019 national standard, which has introduced the world's most rigorous limits on heavy metal and arsenic content, allowing the Company to use the Green One eco-label.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlso, the Company made a Green Label environmental claim, asserting that the Group's products are free from dangerous cadmium concentrations capable of harming soils.\n\nIn 2023, annual inspection audits confirmed the Company's certificates. Independent assessment results are a testament to the unique eco-friendliness of PhosAgro Group's products.\n\nOn top of that, the Company has a certificate under the Ecological Union's Vitality Leaf standard and the right to use the internationally recognised eco-label on its products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, our products are labelled with an EU pictogram developed under Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 and ensuing rules for voluntary labelling of safe fertilizers in terms of heavy metals content.\n\nin the area of fertilizer certification in the EU, making it possible for the fertilizers to be CE-marked.\n\nPursuant to the Turkish Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (KKDIK), the work was initiated in the reporting year to register chemicals imported to the Republic of Turkey as individual substances and their mixtures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To identify existing and potential expectations of our customers, we use a dedicated questionnaire.\n\nThe data obtained serves as the basis for the annual assessment of customer satisfaction. For 2023, PhosAgro polled its Russian customers using a questionnaire on Yandex Forms, which focused on customer satisfaction aspects.\n\nWith the questionnaire, we obtained a qualitative assessment of consumer satisfaction on a scale from 1 (not satisfied at all) to 5 (completely satisfied). Additionally, the questionnaire assessed the degree of importance of each specific parameter for the customers purchasing mineral fertilizers, also on a scale from 1 (not important at all) to 5 (very important).\n\nCustomer satisfaction was assessed using the following criteria: product quality, packaging (design, durability, moisture protection), product range, performance of PhosAgro's staff in terms of prompt handling of requests and quality of support and consultations.\n\nThe 2023 customer satisfaction level is shown in comparison to the 2022 and 2021 levels.

The project provides for the establishment of a group of hydraulic structures and is aimed at preventing the risk of river pollution when developing new deposits, which is aligned with the principles of environmental responsibility and commitment to look for optimal approaches in terms of environmental and technical safety. The Company's team developed and agreed with regulatory authorities (state environmental review and state expert review) the design documents for the facilities required to divert the Gakman River; similar design documents for the Loparskaya River are pending approval from the regulators.\n\nApart from that, in order to increase output, design documentation was put together for the project to develop the reserves of the Rasvumchorr Plateau deposit through underground mining,\n\nwhich provides for a diversified use of coolants at the main ventilation and hot-air heating unit. The use of liquefied natural gas at the Rasvumchorrsky mine will help reduce emissions of pollutants and GHG.\n\n## Energy and elements of circular economy\n\nImproving the efficiency of using resources, including water, and increasing the energy efficiency of production processes are crucial tasks for PhosAgro.\n\nIn 2023, we implemented a project to increase the hourly loads of process systems by introducing a set of measures to upgrade the production of wet-process phosphoric acid, which made it possible to reduce consumption of raw materials and energy resources across industrial sites.\n\nMeasures were also put in place to improve the reliability of ammonia production units and units\n\nNo. 1, 2 and 3 of the Cherepovets site, with recommendations developed\n\non how to improve the planning efficiency considering major overhauls amid an increase in working time.\n\nIn addition, the Balakovo site is running a project to set up an exhaust gas turbine to generate its own electricity using waste energy (sulphuric acid production steam).\n\nThe Company pays special attention to the recycling of waste and by-products and remains on the lookout for new opportunities to utilise them as feedstock. During 2023, research and engineering efforts were completed for the Volkhov branch to develop formulations of popular NPS fertilizer grades and set up their commercial production involving the mother liquor (by-product) of water-soluble MAP production. The Balakovo branch developed and implemented a process for the conversion of phosphogypsum and fluosilicate acid to obtain a solution of ammonium sulphate and technical calcium fluoride, which makes it possible to utilise the by-product of phosphoric acid production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IMPROVEMENT OF THE PRODUCT MIX\n\n58 grades of agrochemicals of all types: PhosAgro Group's product mix in 2023\n\nPhosAgro Group's product mix comprised 58 grades of agrochemicals of all types in 2023. By 2030, the Company plans to gear up for the introduction of 46 new own products and 24 partner products, which will include biological decomposers of organic matter, fertilizers, crop protection products; mineral fertilizers with controlled and prolonged release, liquid and solid fertilizers with microelements; feed additives with non-protein nitrogen sources and biological components; growth enhancers, adaptogens, and amino acids. The overall focus of these developments\n\nis biologicalisation of agriculture and reduction of the environmental impact of chemicals in intensive farming, which will bolster crop yields and improved quality, while also mitigating climatic and environmental impact.\n\nTo this end, the Company is constantly exploring new solutions for the manufacturing of popular products, among other things in response to the drive for import substitution for some of the most common products.\n\nAs part of our import substitution efforts in 2023, we developed key technical solutions to produce liquid SO 2 . In addition, initial data was made available for the construction of a unit manufacturing food grade and technical grade purified phosphoric acid in the Volkhov branch. The Company is also working on an investment project\n\nDuring the year, the Volkhov branch engaged in research and engineering efforts to develop technologies and set up new production facilities to make highgrade phosphates, including water-soluble phosphate fertilizers (monoammonium phosphate and monopotassium phosphate) and feed phosphates. PhosAgro also developed measurement methods for feed phosphates and food grade phosphoric acid.\n\n## for a construction site for feed phosphates and food grade orthophosphoric acid.\n\nThe Company's team proposed a solution for the reconstruction of the ammonia refrigeration cycle in the third ammonia production line at the Cherepovets site to increase ammonia production in the warm season.\n\nOn top of that, we developed an energy-saving technology for the production of complex granular fertilizers (NPKS/NPK/NPS/ NP), which boasts high capacity per unit and is designed for the upgrade of existing and creation of new production facilities at the Cherepovets site and in the Balakovo branch (for that, Russian patent No. 2805234 was obtained).",

        "page_content": "PERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n## INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENTS OF JSC 'NIUF'\n\nOur long-standing efforts in the development of sulphuric acid production were recognised in 2023, with the NIUIF team nominated for the Russian Government's 2023 Award in science and technology.\n\nSince 2001, NIUIF, which is part of Apatit, has developed, patented and improved an intensive domestic energy-saving and eco-friendly technology to make sulphuric acid from sulphur using the Double Contact Double Absorption (DCDA) method (Russian patent No. 2201393 dated 18 September 2001, Eurasian patent No. 028058 dated 10 March 2017). In 2001-2023, Russianmade sulphuric acid systems with high capacity per unit were designed, built and put into operation at facilities across Russia and the CIS countries.\n\nLessons learnt from the operation of sulphuric acid systems that rely on our technology, combined with actual levels of resource consumption, production of powergenerating steam, and pollutant emissions (which are in line with both Russian and European BAT), have proven the solution's strong competitive edge as compared to technologies offered by leading international engineering companies.\n\nSince 2018, Apatit's sites have faced the need to build sulphuric acid systems of significantly greater capacity, i.e. in excess of 1 mtpa of H 2 SO 4 per year. As part of Russia's focus on import substitution, NIUIF leveraged its track record in constructing and operating domestic sulphuric acid production systems and developed a comprehensive package of technical, design, and engineering documentation for the customer (Apatit) to erect the first ever Russian sulphuric\n\nacid system with mega capacity of 1.1 mtpa of H 2 SO 4 per year, or 3.3 kt of H 2 SO 4 per day.\n\nThis technology features extensive reliance on Russian-made equipment, which has already proven reliable and delivering strong process performance in existing sulphuric acid systems.\n\nIn addition to certain technical solutions contributing to project reliability and operability in a considerably wider range of conditions as compared to foreign peers, the new sulphuric acid technology is based on a short, environmentally friendly, and energysaving DCDA process. To name its competitive advantages, the new process scheme for sulphuric acid:\n\n- \u00b7  quickly reaches design capacity;\n- \u00b7  is reliable and easy to operate;\n- \u00b7  guarantees minimal exhaust of harmful gases into the atmosphere;\n- \u00b7  has minimum power consumption levels;\n- \u00b7  is fitted with simple and reliable equipment;\n- \u00b7  has an SO 2 conversion rate of 0.9980 and above;\n- \u00b7  has a total SO 3 absorption rate of 0.9999;\n- \u00b7  generates high-pressure steam (40 atm) to produce electricity;\n- \u00b7  has reserve capacity available.\n\nAnother major area of related efforts is NIUIF's R&D project run jointly with the Kirovsk-based Geological Institute of the Kola Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences to identify natural diatomite in Russia suitable for the domestic production of high-performance vanadium sulphuric acid catalysts. These efforts bore fruit as the exploration team discovered lake deposits of natural diatomite on the Kola Peninsula, which were deemed fit for obtaining highperformance catalysts. Currently, NIUIF is looking into options available to mine and prepare diatomite for subsequent use. Lake deposits have highquality reserves sufficient to sustain production of catalysts for 40 years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DEVELOPMENT OF NEW FERTILIZERS\n\n## Development of biologised fertilizers\n\nIn 2023, PhosAgro Group, together with the Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, conducted second-year enhanced tests of the impact of mineral fertilizers and their biologised counterparts on the carbon footprint of products. The carbon footprint of crop production includes nitrous oxide emissions from soil resulting from nitrogen conversion processes\n\nin mineral and organic fertilizers, as well as carbon emissions from plant respiration, decomposition of crop residues and straw, and mineralisation of soil organic matter (including humus). Thus, tests with biologised counterparts at comparable fertilizer doses demonstrated higher crop yield per hectare and a smaller carbon footprint per unit of agricultural products.\n\nThe tests also helped obtain data on actual GHG emissions vs standard levels of soil nitrogen and carbon loss. This data can be used for the reduction of the carbon\n\nfootprint of agriculture and carbon accumulation in soil, among other things through the application of new eco-friendly biologised mineral fertilizers. On top of that, the tests clearly showed that the rate of 1% set in Russia for nitrogen losses induced by mineral fertilizer application is significantly overestimated.\n\nIn 2024, there are plans to clarify the data available and to conduct a detailed analysis of the processes of nitrogen and carbon transformations in soil in order to achieve intensified accumulation of humus in arable land.\n\nN 2 O emission for various fertilizers at a nitrogen dose of 100 kg/ha in a spring barley test vs emission estimates assuming a 1% nitrogen loss, and comparison of carbon footprint of 1 g of barley for biologised and non-biologised mineral fertilizers\n\n| Sample                   |   Yield, c/ha | Emission  estimate,  N 2 O (1%), kg  of  \u0421\u041e 2 -eq. per t  of fertilizer   | Actual N 2 O  emission (1%),  kg of \u0421\u041e 2 -eq.  per t  of fertilizer   | Actual vs estimate  ratio   |   Carbon footprint  of the product, kg  of  \u0421\u041e 2 -eq. per t  of barley | Bio / untreated   |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Control                  |          30.4 | -

As one example, the ApaSil adaptogen was placed on the market, with over 5.1 t already supplied to farmers. The product is designed for seed pre-treatment and foliar application on a wide range of agricultural crops and ornamental plants. Field trials in different regions and on different crops have shown that ApaSil helps plants cope with the stresses associated with drought and diseases.\n\nIn 2023, the results of scientific tests have been confirmed by PhosAgro Group's customers.\n\nIn 2024, the process method will be patented, with plans to register ApaSil in foreign markets.\n\n## Development of probiotic feed additives\n\nIn 2023, PhosAgro teamed up with the Skryabin Moscow State Academy of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology to run an experiment on laboratory animals to determine the effectiveness of cuttingedge probiotics against the main pathogens that cause intestinal diseases in the young stock of farm animals. New MAP-based additives will help improve the health and productivity of animals while reducing the intake of antibacterial drugs. Initial results show that animals demonstrated increased survival when new additives were used.\n\nIn 2024, prototypes of probiotic feed additives are planned to be tested on young cattle in farm settings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## APPLICATION IMPROVEMENT\n\n## Research as part of PhosAgro's carbon farm project in the Vologda region\n\nAs part of a long-term climate action, in 2022 the Company set up a carbon farm to study CO 2 compensation and absorption of carbon emissions by various ecosystems, as well as to test hands-on solutions for establishing largescale carbon farms in agriculture and forestry.\n\nIn the Cherepovets and Vologda regions, in 2022 we set up 100 ha trial stations 100 km away from each other to study carbon sequestration abilities of perennial forage grasses cultivated in industrial conditions using a variety of fertilization schemes. In the Vologda region, forage grasses are the basic crop with the greatest GHG absorption potential.\n\nThe project's priority objective is to accumulate knowledge and expertise in cooperation with the research community and study CO 2 absorption by various crops (forage grasses, grain cereals and pulse crops), young coniferous and deciduous\n\nTaking into account the processes of soil respiration, humification and humus mineralisation, these results suggest that soil stores 1,050 carbon units with an average annual gain rate of 2.6 t of CO 2 -eq. per ha, which can be verified in actual farming environments by using the most common methods of tests for soil carbon.\n\nThe carbon farms used only PhosAgro Group's mineral fertilizers and did not rely on organic fertilizers, green mass, or other methods to build soil carbon.\n\nForage grass trials were conducted on a 20-hectare plot at PhosAgro's carbon farm in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7  Agricultural technology 1: ryegrass + clover + festulolium;\n- \u00b7  Agricultural technology 2: ryegrass + clover + alfalfa;\n- \u00b7  Agricultural technology 3: ryegrass + clover + bird's-foot trefoil;\n- \u00b7  Farm's practice: ryegrass + clover\n\nforests, and agricultural sites with varying organomineral nutrition regimes.\n\nIn 2023, we continued tests at 24 forest areas within the carbon farm, planting additional 10 thousand coniferous and 15 thousand coniferous young seedlings to compensate for those that failed to survive the winter.\n\nPreliminary research done by the Centre for Forest Ecology and Productivity of the Russian Academy of Sciences shows that ecosystems of this kind can achieve average annual carbon stock of 14.6-16.0 t of CO 2 -eq. per ha over a period of 25 years.\n\n## Two years of tests run\n\nby the Vereshchagin Vologda State Dairy Farming Academy show that estimated levels of carbon dioxide absorption by the aboveground plant biomass on an area of 200 ha are 5,475 t of CO 2 -eq., resulting in accumulation of 7,925 t of CO 2 -eq. by the belowground plant biomass.\n\n## Carbon absorption by the carbon farm using different farming practices\n\nFormation\n\n| Farm                     | Grass mixture              |   CO 2 -eq. gain  in the biomass  in two years, t/ha |   CO 2 -eq. gain in roots  in two years, t/ha |   of humus,  t of CO 2 -eq. per  ha |   Carbon gain,  t of CO 2 -eq. per ha  (carbon units) |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Vologda carbon farm      | Agricultural  technology 1 |                                                 26.7 |                                          39.5 |                                7.11 |                                                  4.98 |\n|                          | Agricultural  technology 2 |                                                 26.9 |                                          39.7 |                                7.15 |                                                  5.02 |\n|                          | Agricultural  technology 3 |                                                 25.2 |                                          36.9 |                                6.64 |                                                  4.51 |\n|                          | Farm's option              |                                                 24.2 |                                          35.5 |                                6.39 |                                                  4.26 |\n| Cherepovets carbon  farm | Agricultural  technology 1 |                                                 32.8 |                                          47.6 |                                8.57 |                                                  6.44 |\n|                          | Agricultural  technology 2 |                                                 30.4 |                                          43.3 |                                7.79 |                                                  5.66 |\n|                          | Agricultural  technology 3 |                                                 27.5 |                                          38.7 |                                6.97 |                                                  4.84 |\n|                          | Farm's option              |                                                 29.4 |                                          42.7 |                                7.69 |                                                  5.56 |",

Results obtained so far suggest that it is a combination of mineral and organic fertilizers with regular liming that allows for the most effective carbon gain in soil during the crop rotation period (five years).\n\nThese studies show that a balanced approach to crop rotation and application of fertilizers and ameliorants not only deliver a good yield of winter wheat of 5.5-6.0 t per ha in the Vologda region but also, subject to the return of plant residues to soil, achieve carbon gain by soil of 2.8 t of CO 2 -eq. per ha per year even without organic fertilizers; when organic fertilizers are used, the efficiency of the carbon gain process increases to 5.2 t of CO 2 eq. per ha per year. The data demonstrate that with an increase in the dose of mineral\n\nfertilizers, subject to properly organised processes, the carbon footprint of agricultural products will be decreasing.\n\nIn 2024, PhosAgro plans to refine and analyse all data and, jointly with the Izrael Institute of Global Climate and Ecology (IGCE), develop methods for various agricultural crops, ornamental plants and forest crops and have them rolled out for practical application by farmers.\n\n## Change in soil carbon stock for different fertilization schemes, t/ha (five years)\n\n|                                |                        | End of crop rotation   | End of crop rotation   | Change    | Change   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Fertilization scheme           | Initial carbon content | no liming 1            | liming                 | no liming | liming   |\n| Control (no fertilizer)        | 46.52                  | 49.00                  | 48.14                  | 2.48      | 1.62     |\n| Manure, 50 t/ha                | 46.14                  | 51.58                  | 49.48                  | 5.43      | 3.34     |\n| N150P120K225                   | 46.43                  | 49.48                  | 50.24                  | 3.05      | 3.81     |\n| Manure, 25 t/ha + N75P60K113   | 46.62                  | 51.29                  | 52.34                  | 4.67      | 5.72     |\n| Manure, 50 t/ha + N150P120K225 | 47.57                  | 49.96                  | 49.48                  | 2.38      | 1.91     |\n\n## Productivity of crop rotation during crop rotation period, t/ha of conventional grain units (five years)\n\n|                                     | Yield over five years (oat-vetch mixture -  winter wheat - spring barley - red clover  - oats)   | Yield over five years (oat-vetch mixture -  winter wheat - spring barley - red clover  - oats)   | Carbon gain, t of \u0421\u041e 2 -eq. per ha   | Carbon gain, t of \u0421\u041e 2 -eq. per ha   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Fertilization scheme                | no liming 1                                                                                      | liming                                                                                           | no liming                            | liming                               |\n| Control (no fertilizer)             | 17.58                                                                                            | 19.15                                                                                            | 9.09                                 | 5.94                                 |\n| Manure, 50 t/ha                     | 20.29                                                                                            | 22.49                                                                                            | 19.91                                | 12.25                                |\n| N 150 P 120 K 225                   | 21.54                                                                                            | 24.05                                                                                            | 11.18                                | 13.97                                |\n| Manure, 25 t/ha + N 75 P 60 K 113   | 22.81                                                                                            | 25.50                                                                                            | 17.12                                | 20.97                                |\n| Manure, 50 t/ha + N 150 P 120 K 225 | 25.21                                                                                            | 28.27                                                                                            | 8.73                                 | 7.00                                 |\n\n- 1 No liming: pHKCl = 5.1-5.2, liming: pHKCl = 5.7-5.9.\n\n## Cutting-edge biologised adaptive plant nutrition systems\n\nIn 2023, experts from the Company and the Federal Williams Research Centre of Forage Production and Agroecology ran a production trial in the Moscow Region to cultivate forage crops using biologised adaptive plant nutrition systems and a biological preservative for forage conservation.\n\nAs opposed to the routine alfalfa cultivation using 100 kg/ha of ammonium nitrate, two biofertilization options were tested during the trial. The first option involved using only biological agents and the ApaSil adaptogen (trial plot 1), while the second one relied on replacing ammonium nitrate with biologised urea and using the same nitrogen dose along with ApaSil (trial plot 2). Trial results showed that innovative nutrient systems led to improved crop yields.

However, there is much more to the principles and business processes underlying our procurement activities. We believe that running a supply chain in an efficient and responsible manner is the cornerstone of the Company's sustainable development.\n\nIn 2023, our procurements of goods and services reached almost RUB 184 bln. Thousands of our suppliers and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, PhosAgro placed a strong emphasis on import substitution throughout its supply chain. In order to identify alternatives and replace the equipment and machinery of Western suppliers, we engaged in technical audits of Russian manufacturers, ran trials of materials and equipment, and shared our experiences and insights with peers from the chemical and other industries.\n\ncontractors benefit directly from these investments, and so do their employees, who have to provide for their families. We contribute to the public budget at various levels. But what is more important is that the tools that we employ, including our environmental and social assessment of suppliers, as well as anti-corruption mechanisms, directly promote sustainable values across the Russian business community. These values are the bedrock of our business philosophy. We work to ensure that our procurement activities have a strong positive impact on all our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 In accordance with the materiality principle, the quantitative metrics in this section are presented for Apatit (Boundary 2) (Apatit is a subsidiary of PhosAgro holding its production assets)\n\n## RUB\n\n184 bln\n\nprocurements of goods and services in 20231\n\n## MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn its procurement, PhosAgro aims to foster open, trustful and mutually beneficial relationships with our partners in compliance with the applicable laws, regulations, and contractual and other obligations.\n\nAll of the Group's suppliers, including potential ones, are subject to the Company's anti-corruption standards. To ensure compliance with Russian anti-corruption laws and PhosAgro's Anti-Corruption Policy, prevent and fight fraud and corruption, avert conflicts of interest among PhosAgro employees, and provide more opportunities for companies and individuals to engage in supplies of goods and services in line with principles of good faith competition, transparency and openness, the Company adopts a zero tolerance approach to fraud and corruption in any form and manifestation. PhosAgro believes that any and all instances of bribery, fraud and corruption involving the Company's employees and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a way to ensure prompt response to suspected corruption and fraud, in 2016, PhosAgro launched a Groupwide hotline for the Company's management to better handle all reports of violations and issues, including those related to procurement. The hotline is available to everyone, including the Company's contractors and partners.\n\ncontractors are unacceptable. To enforce this principle, PhosAgro expects its potential contractors to meet certain obligations made known to them when first signing up to the EBP.\n\nDocuments governing the Company's procurement activities are publicly available on its official website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439\n\n\u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0424\u043e\u0441\u0410\u0433\u0440\u043e\n\n\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u00ab\u0417\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438\u00bb\n\n\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u0422\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProcurement Policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeneral information on PhosAgro's procurement activities is available in the Procurement section\n\non its official website\n\nRequirements for suppliers\n\nProcurement Policy\n\nThe Company's potential suppliers can participate in a fully transparent and accessible procurement procedure using PhosAgro's electronic bidding platform (EBP).

Among other things, banking operations with foreign suppliers became more complicated. To respond to these challenges, PhosAgro introduced structural changes in the Procurement Department, organised alternative procurement, and put up new supply chains. Category managers secured timely supplies of materials and equipment that are critical for the operational process.\n\nOne of PhosAgro's priorities was collaboration with Russian manufacturers, with a variety of trials held and agreements signed for longterm cooperation and fine-tuning of equipment (including self-propelled underground machinery and automation and control equipment) to meet the needs of Apatit. To manage risks more effectively and swiftly, a dedicated flowsheet was introduced to monitor\n\nthe supplies of critical inventory items. The insourcing of services provided by Cherepovets Energy Company helped increase the share of self-procured electrical goods.\n\nDuring the reporting year, PhosAgro achieved a further reduction in the reject rate at incoming control of centrally procured materials and equipment, bringing it down to 7.7% vs 8.7% a year earlier.\n\n## DIGITAL TOOLS\n\nIn 2023, PhosAgro's Procurement Department continued to actively deploy digital tools and management solutions based on them. In particular, five robotic solutions were developed and implemented to administer and control tasks of procurement function, upload and verify documents, and\n\n## Competitive Procurement Leader\n\nIn October 2023, PhosAgro Group won the Competitive Procurement Leader contest in the Procurement Digitalisation Leader category with its Procurement Automation and Internal Audit of Business Processes projects.\n\nThe Competitive Procurement Leader Award is the first professional competition in the field of trade and procurement, bringing together suppliers, government officials, mass media, and non-governmental organisations. Established in 2012, the award aims to raise awareness about the most significant procurement projects that make operations of companies more efficient and transparent and contribute to the development of the market at large. In 2023, a total of 174 projects were submitted by companies across all industries.\n\nselect the approval route. In addition, the Robert chatbot was launched to quickly process typical procurement queries. At the same time, the transfer of robotic solutions to a new Russian platform was initiated as a way to improve reliability and efficiency.\n\nIn the reporting year, the expanded use of Process Mining technology reduced the time required to approve contractual documents by an average of 13%.\n\nIn 2023, PhosAgro's EBP introduced a new functionality, the Document Management Form (DMF), which enables interaction with potential counterparties and automates the document collection on a one-stop-shop basis. Uploading and keeping documents in the DMF up-to-date are a responsibility of counterparties and a prerequisite for entering into contractual relations with Apatit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is a joint project of the regional government, Vologda regional branch of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP), PhosAgro Group, and Severstal. The initiative will see the creation of a new cluster model for the Vologda region's economy at the industrial site in Cherepovets. The project of the Synergy of Growth 3.0 cluster model is a continuation of the Synergy of Growth project. It provides for the local manufacture of popular products in order to meet long-term needs of the region's largest businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company is engaged in active work with small and medium-sized enterprises and provides comprehensive support to the development of local businesses.

The Company has an automated system in place to evaluate suppliers on the basis of ESG criteria, which results in an individual rating of each counterparty. This enables us to assess our suppliers' environmental, social and governance performance.\n\nTo verify the resources and capabilities of its business partners, the Company conducts regular technical audits of suppliers. In 2023, we carried out 86 audits of Russian and foreign manufacturers, four of which were disqualified on the basis of environmental and social criteria.\n\nAlso, in order to unify approaches and criteria for evaluating suppliers, PhosAgro, as part of the National ESG Alliance, has been a member of a working group since 2023 to discuss draft unified supplier evaluation methodology, a practical ESG transformation solution for as many large companies as possible, as well as for medium and small businesses in corporate supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTraining materials on engaging\n\nwith suppliers in sustainable\n\ndevelopment are available in the\n\nProcurement section on PhosAgro's\n\nofficial website.\n\nTraining materials on engaging with suppliers in sustainable development are available in the Procurement section on PhosAgro's official website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe average score of suppliers\n\n65\n\n| Item                                                                                                                    | 2021   | 2022     | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Number of counterparties that  participated in the evaluation  on PhosAgro's EBP as at the end  of the reporting period | 3,031  | 7, 6 0 5 | 11,191 |\n| Number of suppliers in the reporting  year                                                                              | 3,350  | 3,511    | 3,797  |\n| Number of rated suppliers                                                                                               | 1,046  | 1,888    | 2,418  |\n| Share of rated suppliers  in the reporting year, %                                                                      | 35     | 54       | 64     |\n| Total supplies, RUB bln                                                                                                 | 150.0  | 213.9    | 183.8  |\n| Supplies from rated counterparties  in the total volume of supplies  in the reporting year, RUB bln                     | 36.1   | 74.8     | 108.0  |\n| Share of supplies from rated  counterparties in the total volume  of supplies in the reporting year                     | 24     | 35       | 59     |\n| Average supplier rating, %                                                                                              | 54     | 62       | 65     |\n\nIn 2023, the total number of counterparties that underwent our ESG assessment based on their completion of the Sustainable Procurement Indicators checklist reached X (compared to X in 2022).

In addition, zero-tolerance policies on discrimination and forced labour were adopted respectively by 60% and 61% of the Company's counterparties in the categories 'Producers of raw materials, fuel, energy', 'Commodity producers and intermediaries', 'Logistics services', and 'Construction and installation, repairs'.

Over the last three years, our employees have received more than 21 additional training courses in human rights and corporate ethics.\n\nWe provide equal access to educational resources and endeavour to remove all restrictions on career growth for women and men.\n\nAn important focus for our employees on their way to success is professionalism, consistently high performance, and commitment to corporate values.\n\nThe Company pays special attention to the gender composition of its staff. Due to the nature of our operations, the personnel structure is dominated by men. Nevertheless, PhosAgro seeks to maintain gender diversity both in production and administration, taking into account the specifics of the Company's operations, and to develop an income generation strategy for employees based on these aspects.\n\n## The Code of Ethics\n\nIn our operations, we seek to maintain an impeccable reputation and comply with ethical business practices.\n\nPhosAgro's Personnel Management Policy has the following key areas:\n\n- \u00b7  organisational change management system;\n- \u00b7  personnel attraction and recruitment system;\n- \u00b7  personnel training and development system;\n- \u00b7  incentives and rewards system;\n- \u00b7  social benefits system;\n- \u00b7  corporate communication system;\n- \u00b7  working hours and leisure;\n- \u00b7  respect for human rights and non-discrimination.\n\nPhosAgro adopted a Code of Ethics in 2014 and updated it in 2021. It applies to all employees and is the Company's primary document that clearly defines our corporate culture, rules and regulations for collective behaviour within the Company, business and social relationships, and interactions with other stakeholders.\n\nWhen agreeing and entering into contracts with external contractors, it is an imperative for us to cover arrangements and commitments related to mutual respect of human rights and compliance with the Company's Code of Ethics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GRI 2-30\n\nWe negotiate collective bargaining agreements with trade unions that address issues such as working conditions and compensation for employees at each of our production sites (usually for a three-year period, covering 100% of the employees of Apatit 1, its branches, and standalone business units).\n\nShare of employees covered with collective bargaining agreements, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Code outlines our common values and underpins our success, helping us avoid unjustified risks, maintain longterm business growth, strengthen our position in the Russian and foreign markets, and increase the Company's value for shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n- 1 In accordance with the materiality principle, this metric is presented for Apatit (Boundary 2) (Apatit is a subsidiary of PhosAgro holding its production assets)\n\n## RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe following strategic risks affect our HR management objectives:\n\n3 Social risk\n\n4 HR risk\n\n6 Health and safety risk\n\nfor more information, see the Strategic Risks section on page 68\n\n## RISK AREAS SPECIFIC TO HR MANAGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompliance with human rights and ethical standards;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhealth and safety.\n\n## RECRUITMENT\n\nAs part of its comprehensive recruitment approach, PhosAgro continuously monitors the labour market in Russia to attract skilled staff and efficient managers with work experience at leading national and global companies, always determined to be one step ahead of the curve.\n\nOur recruitment efforts are underpinned by a consistent career guidance model, which prioritises engagement with school and university students.\n\nThe Company works continuously to improve its recruitment processes. In 2023, as part of the process\n\nworkforce sufficiency, competence and development;\n\nprovision of competitive incentives and social support to staff;\n\nautomation, a recruitment module was put into commercial operation to ensure faster communication with candidates and customers, while also reducing the time it takes to fill vacancies and minimising labour inputs along the way. In addition, we actively roll out and develop HR marketing tools.\n\nIf two or more candidates qualify for a job, we are more likely to pick the one who is either:\n\n- \u00b7  a young promising professional (a programme for attracting, mentoring, and upskilling highpotential university graduates);\n- \u00b7  an employee included in our talent pool (a programme for those looking to develop professional and managerial competencies for career growth).\n\nAs at the end of 2023, the Group employed 128 people with disabilities (88 in 2022). We believe we must exercise an individual approach when hiring people with special needs, and we are aware of our responsibility to create an inclusive environment for them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company develops corrective measures as necessary and unlocks opportunities to mitigate those risks.

In 2023, 74% of the Company's workforce participated in the survey.\n\nThe consolidated employee satisfaction and loyalty index stood at 73 p.p., surpassing the industrywide benchmark for manufacturing and mining industries (provided by an independent consulting firm) by 13 p.p. and hitting an all-time high since the measurement began in 2013.\n\nEmployee engagement reached 72 p.p., marking a 2 p.p. increase from the previous year. Additionally, 89% of employees expressed willingness to recommend the Company as a great place to work, which is an improvement from the 2022 level of 82%. Furthermore, 89% of employees expressed trust in PhosAgro's management decisions, compared to 87% in 2022.\n\nThe survey results demonstrate that employees of PhosAgro Group hold a positive view of the Company's overall strategy and the effectiveness of its annual improvement plans.

Senior managers (mentors) share their experience and knowledge with the participants in an attempt to build a next-level management culture, while talent pool members get a chance to learn the secrets of successful management from executives.\n\nPreviously known as the Top 40 Talent Pool, the programme was reconsidered and renamed the Team of the Future. Its goals remain unchanged: fostering conditions for professional and personal growth, sharing experience, and addressing new challenges in the face of constant change. The programme is open for professional managers who act as role models and are willing to take on challenging tasks while remaining true to the Company's values. The Team of the Future programme includes four in-person sessions combining group training and individual support, such as work\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe pillars of creating our talent pool are:\n\n- \u00b7 flexible planning of positions eligible for filling from the talent pool, and of lists of talent pool members;\n- \u00b7 collegial decision-making on key aspects regarding the talent pool;\n- \u00b7 focused career planning and professional development for talent pool members;\n\nin groups of three, mentoring, and project teams. At the end of 2023, Moscow hosted the programme's final session, with six teams showcasing their projects. Of them, three projects were recommended for implementation: 'Automation of the Register of Buildings and Structures', 'Automation of Warehouses', and 'Ideogora' (creation of a single digital platform for new ideas and expert communities based on WebSoft).\n\nStarting 2023, members of the Team of the Future act as mentors for employees taking part in the PhosAgro-START programme. For mentors, it is also an opportunity to take stock of their knowledge,\n\n- \u00b7 prioritised investments in training and development of talent pool members;\n- \u00b7 prioritised appointment of talent pool members to fill relevant job vacancies;\n- \u00b7 transparent communication on how the talent pool is created and how employees can participate and benefit.\n\nskills, and experience. Mentoring is recognised as a valuable tool for mentees as it enables them to seek advice from seasoned managers, better understand the corporate culture and the role of the manager, and build new connections. Mentees can choose their mentor via the corporate portal, where the Mentoring section contains profiles of all available mentors and a contact form to initiate a kick-off meeting.\n\nIn 2024, we will continue our efforts to develop leadership competencies. Another major task for us is to create management teams at structural units and cross-functional project teams led by the Team of the Future members.",

Pursuant to the Regulations, the OHS communication system is divided into internal and external communications, and provides for a feedback procedure:\n\n- \u00b7  regular OHS meetings at business units and enterprises;\n- \u00b7  OHS meetings at production sites, departments and facilities;\n- \u00b7  union and union committee meetings (for feedback from OHS officers);\n- \u00b7  corporate e-mail;\n- \u00b7  corporate periodicals;\n- \u00b7  local health and safety committees;\n- \u00b7  employee loyalty surveys;\n- \u00b7  OHS questionnaires.\n\nInternal OHS communication is achieved through:\n\n- \u00b7  local health and safety committees;\n- \u00b7  management meetings and conferences to discuss the health and safety performance of our enterprises;\n- \u00b7  regular OHS meetings in departments, on production sites and at facilities;\n- \u00b7  health and safety bulletin boards, posters and other visuals;\n- \u00b7  corporate television (screens), intranet site, e-mail;\n- \u00b7  corporate periodicals;\n- \u00b7  education by OHS officers (including one-on-one meetings, training, mentoring, supervision, etc.).\n\n## LOCAL HEALTH AND SAFETY COMMITTEES\n\nSince 2014, health and safety committees have been functioning at the Group's companies. They are both an integral part of our OHS management system and a form of employee participation in it. In their work, these\n\ncommittees rely on the principles of social partnership. As part of their activities, health and safety committees draft and improve programmes to join efforts of the employer, employees and trade unions in ensuring occupational health and safety.\n\nCommittee meetings are held at least once a month and chaired by heads of companies. At meetings, information exchange and reporting are multilateral, as both health and safety functions and local unit heads report on health and safety progress. All resolutions are documented in minutes of the meetings.\n\nAs part of these workstreams health and safety committees consider the following topics:\n\n- \u00b7  'Golden Rules' of OHS;\n- \u00b7  Safety Culture Transformation Project;\n- \u00b7  OHS leadership;\n- \u00b7  OHS motivation;\n- \u00b7  effective OHS communications;\n- \u00b7  contractors' safety;\n- \u00b7  PPE effectiveness;\n- \u00b7  trade union report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, health and safety committees held\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 25 meetings\n\nAdopted\n\n## 790 resolutions\n\nWorkers are represented at committee meetings by heads or representatives of local unions.\n\nMeeting agendas comprise nine workstreams\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccident/incident investigation\n\nOccupational health\n\nIndustrial safety\n\nFire safety\n\nRoad traffic safety\n\nSafety assessments and audits\n\nDevelopment of health and safety management\n\nSafety projects (programmes, initiatives)\n\nEducation and training\n\n## IMPROVING CONTRACTOR SAFETY PRACTICES\n\nMeasures to ensure safety of contractors' employees working at our production and other facilities are an integral component of our OHS strategy. They include the selection of contractors based on a health and safety qualification assessment, briefings, enforcing their application of our safety tools, and conducting relevant OHS compliance audits.\n\nESG assessment is a key factor in contractor selection.\n\n- for more information, see the Supply Chain section on page 128.\n\n## INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INDUSTRIAL SAFETY AUDITS\n\nIn line with statutory requirements, PhosAgro Group is subject to scheduled external audits by Russian authorities, including the Federal Service for the Supervision of Environment, Technology and Nuclear Management (Rostekhnadzor), State Labour Inspectorate, Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor), the Ministry for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters (EMERCOM), etc. We may also engage consulting companies, or international associations of which the Group is a member to conduct additional external audits of compliance with international standards, or as part of a special assessment of workplace conditions.\n\nWe also run internal audits conducted by our OHS departments and directorate, managers and employees exercising production H&S control.\n\nAfter external and internal audits, the Company issues orders and instructions outlining remedial action plans and establishing the deadlines and responsible persons. Identified breaches are remedied within the agreed time limits.\n\nThe Company has a procedure for drafting, submitting and reviewing reports on internal and external OHS audits. The results of all internal and external assessments and audits are recorded in the Safety and Instructions (Shift Assignments) management systems offering instruments for further analysis, gap identification, and elimination monitoring. We also submit all relevant reports to state supervisory bodies and statistical agencies in accordance with the Russian laws.\n\nIn 2023, state supervisory authorities carried out\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nat Apatit and its managed companies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Below you can find more information about what we do on this front.\n\n## SASB RT-CH-320a.2\n\nWe are constantly working to assess and mitigate risks. We perform risk assessment and classify them by severity and frequency using our dedicated proprietary methodology. Following hazard identification and risk assessment, the unit's OHS officer compiles a List of Occupational Risks, which is then used as a basis for the Company's List of Material Occupational Risks.\n\nRisk assessment takes into account the following aspects:\n\n- \u00b7  degree of personnel exposure;\n- \u00b7  impact on personnel;\n- \u00b7  frequency of occurrence;\n- \u00b7  compliance with the applicable regulatory and other OHS requirements.\n\nThe Company has instituted a robust protocol that facilitates swift communication from eyewitnesses to the appropriate functions and managerial personnel, inclusive of PhosAgro's CEO by means of corporate communication tools such as text message alerts and telephone calls.\n\nAll incidents are investigated in accordance with legislative requirements and internal procedures to determine the root causes. The Company encourages its staff to disclose information on potential sources of danger to worker health and life.\n\nFor better OHS efficiency, and to automate and streamline the relevant processes, we have introduced and now use the Safety and Instructions (Shift Assignments) management systems. Both systems\n\ninclude a Risk Management module. The module enables internal check list-based OHS assessment at all units of Apatit. The module's new underlying principles help enhance production H&S control, while its new functions facilitate operation, monitoring and analysis.\n\nThe Company has a formal procedure for addressing workplace hazards. When a hazard is identified, employees are required to suspend work and report it to their supervisors directly or via the Public Scrutiny mobile app (on an anonymous basis if necessary). The supervisor uses the report to assess the risk and develop a remedial action plan.\n\n## EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\n\nAt our sites, we have introduced the following emergency response and prevention measures compliant with the Russian laws:\n\n- \u00b7  accident management action plans for all hazardous industrial facilities as defined by the Russian laws developed;\n- \u00b7  training sessions and drills held in 2023:\n- -test alerts - 143,\n- -fire training sessions - 636,\n- -evacuation drills - 132,\n- -joint fire drills with EMERCOM - 5;\n- \u00b7  a targeted programme for upgrading Apatit's fire safety systems in 2023-2025 developed.\n\n## PROJECT\n\nto roll out the OHS remote monitoring system at the Cherepovets site of Apatit\n\nThe Company endorses the initiatives put forth by state authorities as regards OHS data disclosure, in order to facilitate remote monitoring measures and alleviate the regulatory oversight burden.\n\nStarting from 2021, Apatit's Cherepovets site (fluosilicate acid storage facility of the aluminium fluoride shop) participates in Rostechnadzor's experiment to roll out an OHS remote monitoring system under Russian Government Decree No. 2415 On Experimental Roll-out of the Industrial Safety Remote Monitoring System dated 31 December 2020. The experiment provides for the development of stand-alone remote monitoring technology for hazardous production facilities, and a relevant legal framework. The technology is expected to improve the overall reliability and monitoring efficiency of safety systems, and help reduce the associated paperwork and bureaucracy.\n\nThe OHS remote monitoring system was put into operation in April 2023, with the process of data transmission to the Automated Information System of Rostekhnadzor configured.\n\n0",

Additionally, the Balakovo branch team achieved a zero LTIFR, with a remarkable near fivefold reduction in traffic incidents compared to 2021.\n\n## TRANSPORT SAFETY 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SASB RT-CH-540a.2\n\nFrom 2021 to 2023, PhosAgro Group was able to reduce the total number of traffic accidents nearly fivefold (by 78%) from 37 accidents in 2021 to eight in 2023.\n\nThe initiatives implemented by the OHS Department and transport departments to mitigate traffic accident risks includes drafting internal regulations to ensure safe operation of motor vehicles, selfpropelled machines and rail transport, performing targeted and full-scope inspections of vehicles used by our contractors, subsidiaries, enhancing the competencies and skills of PhosAgro employees responsible for operating all types of transport, and introducing various technical solutions to mitigate risks of traffic accidents. For instance, the Kirovsk branch equipped quarry self-propelled machines with visualisation systems for dangerous zones. There are also ongoing pilot tests for similar systems in underground operations, as well as for collision prevention systems on quarry dump trucks. Preparations are underway at the Cherepovets facility and the Balakovo branch to outfit dump trucks with a fatigue monitoring system\n\nThe solid increase in OHS expenses is attributable to higher investments in personal protective equipment and training in modern OHS practices for employees. Moreover, the ramp-up of production along with the initiation of upgrade and revamp projects triggered the recruitment of extra staff.\n\nThis contributed to an uptick in overall OHS spending. Specifically, there were heightened expenses for check-ups, establishment of supplementary fire command stations (fire brigades), and engagement of services from professional rescue squads.\n\n## OHS expenses of Apatit, RUB mln\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 1,863   | 2,956   | 2,956   | 2,956   | 1,709   | 907   |             |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|-------------|\n| 1,545   | 2,002   | 983     | 447     |         |       |             |\n| 1,397   | 1,770   | 471 203 |         |         |       | 4,977 3,841 |\n\n- Cherepovets site of Apatit\n- Kirovsk branch\n\ntailored to help drivers during their 12-hour shifts.

At the time of publishing this Report, an official investigation is being conducted into an incident involving a Company employee in 2023. The incident has been categorised in the Report as a severe injury, but it is subject to potential reclassification based on the investigation findings. The was a total of 33 injuries recorded in 2023 compared to 20 in 2022. Of these injuries, nine occurred to contractor employees,\n\nnine to PhosAgro's own staff, and 15 to employees of subsidiaries and affiliates (compared to five, eight, and seven in 2022, respectively), which accounted for the largest proportion of all work-related injuries, including major accidents. We are convinced that rolling out the existing methods and tools in the field of occupational safety among personnel of contractors, as well as subsidiaries, affiliates and managed companies, will further reduce the level of occupational injuries among this category of personnel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company plans to continue implementing its safety improvement strategy by leveraging advanced safety tools and modern comprehensive solutions and approaches that have already proven effective, including:\n\n- \u00b7  senior management's leadership and commitment to health and safety;\n- \u00b7  allocating sufficient funding to ensure occupational, industrial and fire safety;\n- \u00b7  knowing and applying international and domestic best practices;\n- \u00b7  improving the internal incident investigation process to identify and eliminate root causes;\n- \u00b7  implementing project solutions and targeted programmes to improve workplace safety;\n- \u00b7  providing employees with modern and effective personal and collective protective equipment;\n- \u00b7  involving blue-collar workers (OHS officers) in directly managing health and safety in their business units;\n- \u00b7  reviewing the structure and functions of occupational health, industrial safety and fire safety services with a focus on enhancing control and preventive work;\n- \u00b7  selecting and appointing highly qualified leaders to key positions in occupational health, industrial safety and fire safety services;\n\nMost of the injuries reported in 2023 were related to falls and contact with moving and rotating objects and equipment, as well as impact of hazardous substances.\n\nThe main causes of work-related injuries in 2023 were poor work organisation, violations of labour and industrial discipline, personal negligence, and underestimation of risks by the injured persons.\n\n- \u00b7   developing and implementing a system of incentives motivating all categories of employees for safe working practices;\n- \u00b7   developing and updating e-courses to educate employees in corporate health and safety requirements;\n- \u00b7   integrating corporate health and safety requirements into the work of contractors;\n- \u00b7   digitalising data management processes to support highquality analysis and effective management decision-making.",

Proper focus on all of these areas helps secure the Company's sustainable development and well-being of the regions across its geography.\n\nOur Strategy to 2025 provides for strict compliance with statutory requirement on environmental responsibility and practices aimed at minimising the impact of the Company's operations throughout the whole life cycle of a fertilizer, from mine to food products.\n\nThe key priorities set out in PhosAgro's Environmental Policy are careful use of natural resources and reduction of the environmental footprint.\n\nWe had a comprehensive assessment of our operations, determining key focus areas of such impact, both direct and indirect, and weighed it against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and national goals.\n\nIn 2020, we started implementing the Climate Strategy based on the Company's vision and expertise in GHG emissions management. The document reviews climate risks and opportunities extensively, setting targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions and presenting the low-carbon transition plan.\n\nPhosAgro carries out the Energy Efficiency Programme designed to ensure compliance with the Climate Strategy and the Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving Policy tightly integrated into the Company's Strategy to 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy to 2025 also seeks to reduce waste generation substantially. Having developed a system for accumulating and analysing data on production and consumption waste from our operations, we are now implementing a range of projects aimed at minimising waste generation and increasing the share of recycled waste.\n\nIn the scope of the strategic objectives to reduce air emissions, PhosAgro is running a comprehensive programme to re-equip production facilities and cut pollutant emissions.\n\nIn addition, we developed the Water Strategy in 2020 to minimise our impact on water bodies by means of lean treatment of resources: less water withdrawal and waste water discharge. As part of the Strategy, we assessed water use risks and opportunities, including potential scarcity of water, set targets for water withdrawal and waste water discharge and designed a detailed action plan for each site to achieve the targets.\n\nThe Company sticks to its biodiversity management system comprising the assessment of potential impact,\n\nBased on the assessment results, we mapped out six strategic focus areas of environmental protection:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nclimate;\n\nenergy efficiency;\n\nwaste;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwater;\n\nbiodiversity.\n\ninteraction with a wide range of stakeholders, as well as monitoring and reporting practices.\n\nWe believe that our requirements should be uniform both for us and our partners engaged in PhosAgro's projects. Everything we require of ourselves equally applies to our counterparties and is enshrined in the Code of Conduct for Counterparties.\n\n## APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTraditionally, we put a special focus on environmental matters and stand in unconditional support of the vulnerable and rare habitats across our geography, leaving them intact and carefully treating\n\nnatural systems and resources. Our operations undergo a stringent assessment for compliance with the Environmental Policy and the Company's internal regulations.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nOur environmental management system is integrated in the Company's overall management framework and is a key element in our approach to managing environmental responsibility.\n\nIn 2022, the environmental management system passed a recertification audit across the Company's production sites and was found to be in full compliance with ISO 14001. In 2023, it successfully underwent an inspection audit under the same standard.\n\nPhosAgro's environmental management system embraces all management levels and all stages of the product's life-cycle, from R&D to manufacturing and finished product application by customers. This approach ensures uniform management requirements across all aspects of the Company's operations.\n\nThe facilities have also put in place a procedure to manage internal audits. Every year, they develop internal audit programmes taking into account the environmental significance of the reviewed processes, changes affecting the facility and previous audit outcomes. The audits provide input data for the Company's management to analyse environmental management efficiency.\n\nFor the full text of the document, please visit the Company's website .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We adopted a unified approach to environmental management that relies on:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Company-wide control\n\nPutting Strategy to 2025 into action and compliance with the Company's environmental policies are overseen by the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee that regularly reports on the Company's progress to the Board of Directors. The Department of Ecology and Environmental Management exercises executive control over the Company's environmental activities.\n\n## A unified management system\n\nThe consistency of PhosAgro's activities aimed at environmental protection and strengthening of the Company's environmental performance results from continuous development of the environmental management system built in line with the ISO 14001 standards.\n\n## Strict compliance\n\nwith applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor PhosAgro's Environmental Policy, see the Company's website.",

Based on the results, we develop measures to bring risks pertaining to significant environmental aspects to an acceptable level\n- \u00b7  Managers and experts responsible for making operational and other decisions that may adversely affect the environment take a specially designed training course in environmental safety\n\nOur strategic environmental protection goals are set out in the Company's Strategy to 2025, as well as Water and Climate strategies. Their achievement is included in the KPIs of managers and senior executives.\n\n## COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTORY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nEnvironmental compliance is key to running a responsible business.\n\nPhosAgro Group's environmental management practices ensure our compliance with the applicable environmental and nature conservation regulations and regulators' decrees. To that end, the\n\nCompany has in place an internal and external control framework, which includes internal audit and external compliance reviews, a reporting system designed in accordance with legislative requirements, and a staff training system.\n\nAll our facilities that have an adverse environmental impact are included in dedicated state registers, with relevant categories assigned to them. PhosAgro has all necessary permits in place for each of these facilities.\n\nNone of PhosAgro's enterprises uses ozone-depleting substances in the production process. A small amount (not more than 250 kg/year) of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is used in laboratory testing.\n\nIn 2021, in order to prevent adverse effects of cross-border handling of Russian chemical products, the Russian Ministry of Industry\n\nand Trade initiated a flagship pilot in the chemical sector, which gave rise to innovative development proposals and support measures for exporters of chemical products. The key pilot objectives were to determine the baseline chemical footprint of products and develop a plan to reduce (and, ultimately, eliminate) the negative impact of the used hazardous chemicals on human health and the environment. In 2023, the Company participated in the project to measure the chemical footprint of products.\n\nWe do not undertake cross-border hazardous waste transportation and our production sites are not situated in protected areas. Hence, there are no significant restrictions on our operations.\n\n- For more information on the project, see page 96 of the Customers and Product Management section.\n\n## Spending on environmental protection, RUB mln\n\n| Item                                                                       | 2021    | 2022      | 2023            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Current environmental protection expenses (form 4-OS)                      | 5,510.3 | 6,534.6   | 7, 3 9 4 . 9 21 |\n| Investments in fixed assets aimed at environmental protection (form 18-KS) | 4,168.8 | 2,396.7   | 3,544.013       |\n| Environmental impact payments                                              | 179.291 | 192.573   | 204.927         |\n| Environmental fines and damages                                            | 4.258   | 2.464     | 1.584           |\n| Total                                                                      | 9,860.7 | 9,126.120 | 11,145.445      |\n\nThe Company takes steps to remedy the harm caused by an emergency in 2019 by committing RUB 1,584,000 to the reproduction of aquatic biological resources in 2023.\n\nNo audits of Apatit by local bodies of Rosprirodnadzor were held in 2023.

Over-limit payments accounted for 0.86% of total environmental impact payments (vs 1.22% in 2022). They resulted from exceeding the permissible emission limit for nitrogen oxides by one of the emission sources at the Cherepovets facility.\n\n## ASSESSMENT, ANALYSIS, AND MONITORING\n\nContinuous improvement is inherent in our environmental management. The Company identifies areas\n\nfor improvement by reviewing its management system using an effective mechanism, which includes external and internal audits of the environmental management system, activities to monitor and assess the Company's performance, including by a wide range of stakeholders, and the analysis and assessment of PhosAgro's performance by the Company's management. These efforts enable us to work out corrective action plans and proposals on how to develop and improve the system.\n\nStakeholder engagement is essential for the Company's planning.

As part of the climate strategy development in 2020, we adopted climate scenarios and determined respective scenario parameters that are most probable and significant for the Company in the short, medium and long term.\n\n- \u00b7  2\u00b0\u0421 scenario is expected to result in stringent climate policy measures that will increase market volatility (goods, services, finances, etc.). This is projected to bring about low-carbon transition, putting in place mechanisms of a low-carbon economy that will slow down physical climate-related impacts going forward;\n\n\u0435 PhosAgro Group assessed the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on its operations under two climate change scenarios: global warming of 2\u00b0\u0421 and 4\u00b0\u0421. The key features of the scenarios are:\n\n\u044f\u043d\u0438\n\n\u043b\u0438\n\n\u0412\n\n- \u00b7  4\u00b0\u0421 scenario is expected to result in less stringent climate policy measures as compared to the 2\u00b0\u0421 scenario, triggering faster physical climate-related changes.\n\nExperts assessed the 2\u00b0C scenario as the most probable, hence it was selected as the basis for setting\n\ntargets, evaluating risks and opportunities, and developing plans under the low-carbon transition.\n\nPhosAgro identified projected changes in climate risks and opportunities under the adopted climate scenarios based on risks, opportunities, scenario parameters, and time frames. In doing so, the Company focused on its operations, strategy, and financial planning.\n\nProcesses to identify and assess climate change risks are being integrated throughout the value chain - from design, procurement and apatite-nepheline ore mining to finished product delivery.\n\n## KEY INITIATIVES IN 2023\n\n| Focus areas                                                                                                                                                                           | Climate-related risk and  opportunities   | Description and results                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Introduce HR actions to support  the implementation of PhosAgro's  Climate Strategy, including additional  training to improve staff competence  and raise staff awareness in climate | R1, R2, O1                                | Our employees take part in events dedicated to sustainable  development and corporate climate responsibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Establish a task group on reduction  of GHG emissions and negative effect  of climate change on the efficiency  of management and production  processes                               | R1, R2, R3, O1                            | Based on the outcomes of the Climate Agenda project, we  continued to consider and implement thoroughly researched  and technically feasible initiatives and proposals to reduce  the Company's climate footprint, minimise risks and maximise  opportunities related to growing climate change impacts  (technology, equipment, energy generation, operations, etc.).

In 2018, GHG emissions were as follows: direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) - 4,624.6 kt of CO2-eq., indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) - 924.1 kt of CO2-eq., and other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3) - 11,413.8 kt of CO2-eq. In 2023, per unit GHG emissions (Scope 1) declined by 21.9 kg/t or 14.6% compared to 2018, driven by growing output, whereas gross GHG emissions (Scope 1) increased by 3% vs 2018. Excluding the output growth factor,\n\ngross emissions decreased by 815 kt compared to 2018. The mix of semifinished products used in fertilizer production had the most significant impact on the reduction of Scope 1 GHG emissions, as part of direct emissions related to manufacturing of semi-finished products decreased due to replacing some of the Company's own products (for example, ammonia) with third-party feedstock.\n\nPer unit GHG emissions (Scope 2) declined by 25.8% compared to the baseline year of 2018, while gross GHG emissions (Scope 2) (excluding the output growth factor) decreased by 288 kt vs 2018.

Key growth drivers in 2023 were as follows: an increase in the volumes of purchased feedstock and fuel consumed at subsidiaries and affiliates that are not included in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as higher product sales. Excluding the output growth factor, Scope 3 GHG emissions declined by 205 kt vs the baseline year.\n\n## List and description of existing metrics introduced for the monitoring of performance under the climate strategy\n\n| Metric                                                                                                             | 2021      | 2022      | 2023    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Gross global emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) per currency unit of total revenue  (GRI 305-4) 1 , t of CO\u2082-eq. / USD mln | 993.100   | 693.500   | 1,072.4 |\n| Gross global emissions (Scope 1 and 2) per FTE (GRI 305-4) 2 ,   t of CO\u2082-eq. / FTE                                | 309.400   | 288.800   | 256,9   |\n| Electricity purchased per unit of finished and semi-finished products,   '000 kWh / t                              | 0.066     | 0.062     | 0.064   |\n| Energy efficiency improvement costs, RUB mln                                                                       | 17. 4 0 0 | 3,044.100 | 371.900 |\n| Share of feedstock suppliers providing necessary input data  on GHG emissions (Scope 3), %                         | 2.700     | 7. 5 0 0  | 9.500   |",

The assessment covered all of the Company's production facilities where teams combining external experts and key employees of each facility performed an in-depth analysis of processes, risks, and opportunities, identified growth areas, and developed action plans to tackle bottlenecks. The assessment findings were thoroughly analysed and submitted for the management's consideration.\n\nIn order to better understand the processes and complex elements of the energy management system, employees and managers underwent relevant training with inputs from external experts.\n\nIn 2023, PhosAgro's executives resolved to establish a stand-alone unit within the Company responsible for building a unified energy management system, setting targets for reducing energy consumption,\n\n## Electricity generated by the Company's own heat and power plants, mln kWh\n\n| Production site   | 2022     | 2023     | Growth, %   |\n|-------------------|----------|----------|-------------|\n| Cherepovets site  | 787.93   | 807.70   | 2.50        |\n| Balakovo branch   | 340.83   | 384.53   | 12.90       |\n| Volkhov branch    | 184.89   | 251.86   | 36.30 1     |\n| Total             | 1,313.65 | 1,444.09 | 10.00       |\n\nand managing changes as part of the continuous improvement of the energy management system.\n\nIn the reporting year, the amount of electricity generated internally by heat and power plants in Cherepovets, Balakovo, and Volkhov went up 10% y-o-y.\n\nAs a result, the Company's production facilities were 42.5% self-sufficient in terms of electricity needs in 2023 (vs 42.9% in 2022, flat y-o-y).\n\nGoing forward, the Company will continue developing in-house power generation. A project to build a new\n\nexhaust gas turbine at the Balakovo branch is currently at the design stage.\n\nIn 2023, we completed tests of a solar power generation technology at the Company's facility in Balakovo. With the manufacturer's lab completing an extensive study of the prototype solar panels, which had operated at the facility for 18 months, PhosAgro gained important knowledge essential for the technology's further roll-out across the Company's facilities.\n\n## STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\n## GRI 3-3, 302-4\n\nIn 2023, the Company continued to follow the Climate Strategy and the Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving Policy approved by the Board of Directors. We reviewed and updated the list of initiatives set out in the Energy Efficiency Programme, which is tightly integrated into the Company's Strategy to 2025.\n\nThe Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving Policy sets out the following key goals:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinuously improving energy efficiency;\n\nusing energy resources in a sustainable and efficient manner;\n\nstreamlining the energy management process for all types of operating activities.\n\nThe Company pays particular attention to managing energy efficiency risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA sufficient and reliable energy supply is a material aspect and major concern for us. We thoroughly explore all opportunities to transition to renewable energy: among other things, in 2023, we continued to purchase electricity generated by hydroelectric power plants.\n\nRisk of Scope 2 GHG emissions to be included in carbon regulation in the EU and other jurisdictions. The Company's energy efficiency directly affects Scope 2 GHG emissions, which poses a potential risk, for example after fullscale implementation of carbon border adjustment mechanisms.\n\nThe initiatives set out in the Programme are aimed at improving energy efficiency, developing energy management at each production site, and achieving objectives in the following focus areas:\n\n- \u00b7  in-house power generation through utilisation of sulphuric acid production steam;\n- \u00b7  introduction of technologies aimed at loss reduction and energy savings (e.g. LED lighting, frequency converters, less heat energy losses).\n\nIn addition, the Company actively studies and tests promising solutions, including by increasing the share of renewable energy sources both\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market availability of electricity from renewable energy sources.\n\nThe Company continuously monitors the market to ensure a sufficient supply of electricity from renewable energy sources.\n\nas part of pilot projects at PhosAgro's own facilities and through green electricity purchases.\n\nIn 2023, we implemented comprehensive energy efficiency projects at all of our sites.\n\n<!-- image -->",

stipulates an increase in the share of recycled hazard class 1-4 waste to 40%.\n\nPhosAgro's waste management is monitored on a regular basis and discussed by the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee before being communicated to the Board of Directors.\n\n2023 highlights\n\n40.17 %\n\nof hazard class 1-4 waste recycled and decontaminated\n\nup 3.6% y-o-y\n\nHaving developed a system for accumulating and analysing data on production and consumption waste from our operations, we are now implementing a range of projects aimed at minimising waste generation and increasing the share of recycled waste.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For instance, in 2023, we held a series of trials of neutralised phosphogypsum on acidic soils together with Pryanishnikov Institute of Agrochemistry and Saratov State Agrarian University. The trial findings were comparable to the results of lime treatment, while the application rate per 1 ha was three times lower.\n\nWe also tested the safety of phosphogypsum used as a component for cattle and poultry bedding. Bedding with phosphogypsum content is 20% dryer. It also serves as a sulphatebased disinfectant, which helps reduce the number of mastitis cases and paw and hoof diseases by 50%.\n\nPhosphogypsum was also tested as an ameliorant for urban areas reducing the deterioration of soils and perennial plants caused by anti-icing reagents, which\n\nCollecting used bags (fertilizer packaging waste) from PhosAgro-Region's customer farmers and their further processing into recycled feedstock for new packaging sacks (in collaboration with Chempack).\n\nare primarily based on sodium salts (toxic for plants). Phosphogypsum offsets the salt effect and preserves urban soils and vegetation.\n\nAn important driver behind the further expansion of phosphogypsum use in Russia's agriculture is its inclusion on the list of subsidised products (for plastering of solonetz soils) as part of the Amelioration Development and Soil Fertility Preservation Programme starting 2024.\n\nWe also promote the use of phosphogypsum in construction. To that end, we implement a joint project with two large cement plants Volga-Cement and Cementum, Saratov region - to partially replace natural gypsum with phosphogypsum in cement production.\n\nPhosphogypsum application in road construction is also gaining momentum. For instance, commercial organisations and agricultural producers use it to build private driveways, ramps, manure storage areas, etc. They apply hemihydrate phosphogypsum to reinforce soils and produce durable road pavement (similar to lean concrete) for category 3-5 roads. Phosphogypsum improves road throughput capacity, doubles\n\nIn 2023, the Company sold\n\n73 kt of phosphogypsum.\n\npermitted axle load, boosts rutting resistance, and prevents soil heaving during abrupt changes in temperature thanks to its low thermal conductivity.\n\nIn addition to expanding phosphogypsum sales geography (for instance, PhosAgro plans to start shipping it to the Volgograd, Astrakhan, Penza and Tambov regions, and the Republic of Udmurtia), the Company's plans for 2024 include active promotion of phosphogypsum in urban soil amelioration, road repairs and construction, and production of building blocks and paving slabs (relevant trials are currently in progress). On top of that, together with the Scientific Research Institute for Road Construction, we started developing a technical certificate (preliminary national standard) for phosphogypsum used in road pavement and soil reinforcement.\n\n## SASB RT-CH-150a.1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe reduction in class 5 waste generation was due to lower generation of waste from mining at the Kirovsk branch resulting from reduction of mining operations on the back of better excavation quality.\n\n## Waste generation by hazard class, t\n\n## GRI 306-3, SASB RT-CH-410b.1\n\n| Waste hazard class   | 2021           | 2022           | 2023 (actual)   |\n|----------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 1                    | 5.63           | 4.22           | 3.82            |\n| 2                    | 3.86           | 0.39           | 3.23            |\n| 3                    | 1,698.52       | 1,436.71       | 1, 278.12       |\n| 4                    | 192,698.46     | 195,057.45     | 253,064.94      |\n| 5                    | 132,227,604.70 | 120,229,530.98 | 94,372,377.65   |\n| Total                | 132,422,011.17 | 120,426,029.77 | 94,626,727.75   |\n\n## Waste by type and disposal method, t 2\n\n## GRI 306-4, 306-5\n\n| Disposal method                          | 2021          | 2022         | 2023         |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|\n| PhosAgro Group's waste reused internally | 19,203,406.7  | 27,753,191.6 | 26,418,490.4 |\n| \u00b7  Hazardous waste                       | 74,266.9      | 74,456.8     | 99,800.9     |\n| \u00b7  Non-hazardous waste                   | 19,129,139.8  | 27,678,734.8 | 26,318,689.5 |\n| Total waste landfilled                   | 112,392,381.5 | 93,400,262.0 | 65,294,928.0 |\n| \u00b7  Hazardous waste                       | 119,050.2     | 120,688.6    | 153,525.5    |\n| \u00b7  Non-hazardous waste                   | 112,273,331.3 | 93,279,573.4 | 65,141,402.5 |\n\n- 1 The Group specific disclosure was calculated as ratio of class 1-4 waste recycled and decontaminated to the total volume of class 1-4 waste.\n- 2 Hazardous means hazard class 1-4 waste; non-hazardous means hazard class 5 waste.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There is no shortage of water sources in the regions where our facilities are based. According to the Water Risk Atlas and Water Risk Filter, all PhosAgro production sites are located in areas with low or moderate fresh water scarcity. However, access to clean water is a major issue facing the world.\n\n## RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## SASB RT-CH-140a.3\n\nThe main risks related to water consumption are water quality deterioration in water bodies across PhosAgro's footprint and\n\nthe Company's non-compliance with statutory requirements for limiting one's negative impact on water bodies.\n\nPhosAgro has implemented closedloop water recycling systems at its sites in Volkhov and Balakovo to reuse water in production processes.\n\nGoing forward, we plan to improve waste water management by focusing on maximum reuse of water through closed-loop water recycling systems and better treatment of effluents discharged into water bodies in addition to ongoing monitoring of water bodies in the regions of operation.\n\nThe regulatory risks include tightened waste water quality requirements, as well as restrictions on the amount of water consumed and discharged into both water\n\n## bodies and centralised waste water\n\nsystems. There were no incidents of non-compliance associated with water quality permits, standards, and regulations in 2023.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, in 2020 we adopted the Water Strategy that sought to reduce water consumption and discharge and improve waste water quality.\n\nThe strategy is implemented at all PhosAgro sites, and we regularly analyse these measures to determine whether they are sufficient and effective enough to achieve our targets.\n\nTo identify the impact of the Company's operations on water bodies, we monitor these bodies in accordance with adopted programmes by engaging our own certified laboratory and external certified laboratories.",

Assessment of the local flora, fauna and landscapes, as well as research, analysis and consideration of public attitudes towards biodiversity protection are integral to our EIA procedures.\n\n## 123,915\n\njuvenile fish was released in 2023\n\n## KEY INITIATIVES IN 2023\n\nFor a number of years, the Company has been conducting research to develop biodiversity protection programmes, including the evaluation of the current state and development of a list of indicators for future biodiversity monitoring.\n\nGoing forward, we plan to integrate the comprehensive biodiversity programmes of the Company's branches into a single system based on a unified approach to assessment and monitoring. This work is underway and it will be finalised as we complete research projects at each of PhosAgro's assets.\n\nFor a number of years, the Company has been working to preserve biodiversity and replenish biological resources. Since 2020, the Company has been developing comprehensive biodiversity protection programmes in partnership with research institutions. The effort is aimed at assessing and restoring environmental conditions across the Company's footprint and establishing its priorities in protecting biodiversity based on indicator species monitoring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Comprehensive biodiversity protection programmes\n\n## GRI 304-2, 304-3\n\nComprehensive biodiversity protection programmes were developed for the Volkhov branch, two of the Kirovsk branch's facilities and the Cherepovets production site.\n\nIn 2022, we completed a comprehensive environmental study of the area within the footprint of the Kirovsky mine. As part of the efforts to develop biodiversity protection programmes in 2023, the Company joined forces with the Kola Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive environmental study of the area within the footprint of the Rasvumchorrsky mine (Kirovsk branch, Murmansk region).\n\nThe research revealed that the biota of terrestrial ecosystems within the footprint of the Rasvumchorrsky\n\nmine includes over 650 species of fungi, liverworts, lichens, mosses and vascular plants, as well as 135 bird and 12 mammal species. The diversity of bird and mammal species was strongly affected and disturbed by human activities in the area. The study also found four fish species within the footprint of the Rasvumchorrsky mine. Lake Bolshoi Vudyavr currently fits the habitat requirements for these species, as it offers ample food supplies for both salmonids (brown trout, Arctic char) and European smelt.\n\nIn 2024, we plan to launch a comprehensive environmental study of the area within the footprint of the Vostochny mine.\n\n## METRICS AND HIGHLIGHTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GRI 304-3\n\n## Juvenile fish and pike larvae, released into water bodies across the Company's geographies\n\n| Water body                                       | 2021    | 2022    | 2023    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Volgograd Reservoir, Saratov region              | 55,838  | 60,838  | 35,838  |\n| Sukhona River, Vologda region                    | 22,933  | 11,743  | -       |\n| Umba River, Murmansk region                      | 5,000   | -       | -       |\n| Rybinsk Reservoir, Vologda and Yaroslavl regions | -       | 70,404  | 11,142  |\n| Saratov Reservoir, Saratov region                | 28,151  | 28,151  | 53,151  |\n| Lake Ladoga, Leningrad region                    | -       | 1,584   | 1,539   |\n| Nakhimovskoye Lake, Leningrad region             | 28,715  | -       | -       |\n| Sheksna Reservoir, Vologda region                | 3,500   | 3,000   | -       |\n| Kovdozero Reservoir, Murmansk region             | -       | 11,502  | -       |\n| Imandra Reservoir                                | -       | -       | 15,520  |\n| Onega River                                      | -       | -       | 6,725   |\n| Total                                            | 144,137 | 187,222 | 123,915 |",

By providing physical resources for building social capital and promoting commitment to healthy lifestyle, the Company assists regional and local authorities in ensuring harmonious and balanced social development, and offering high quality of life comparable to living standards in large cities or even surpassing them in terms of accessibility for an average resident.\n\nPartnership and ongoing meaningful dialogue with stakeholders allow us to fine-tune our social programmes to better align them with focuses of regional development and invest more efficiently. As regional authorities are well aware of the most pressing needs their regions face, they are engaged through mutual agreements to coordinate joint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprogrammes for industrial and economic development, education, culture, sports, support of local communities, etc. This ensures efficient and systemic utilisation of funds allocated by the Company to address social challenges.\n\nThe outcomes and effectiveness of the programme, and its impact on socially significant issues are reviewed in line with the methodology and procedures approved by the Regulations and benchmarked against assessment criteria set for each focus area on an individual basis. These criteria are listed below.\n\nAccording to a sociological survey conducted in the reporting year and feedback collected in social networks, residents of the Vologda, Saratov, Leningrad and Murmansk regions are generally satisfied with urban improvements currently taking place in these regions.\n\n| Item                                                                                                                                                                 |   2022 |   2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total improvement projects completed (including repairs  and reconstruction of social and healthcare facilities,  educational institutions and roads)                |     78 |     84 |\n| Residents' initiatives (applications submitted)                                                                                                                      |      3 |     70 |\n| \u00b7  including those implemented with the Company's  support                                                                                                           |      3 |     24 |\n| Number of partners involved (among others,  local residents for reconstruction/construction  of infrastructure facilities, including leisure and sports  facilities) |    139 |    120 |\n| Number of city-wide events organised by the Company                                                                                                                  |    101 |     91 |\n\n## Funds allocated by PhosAgro Group to finance Our Favourite Cities, RUB mln\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancing allocated by the Company for Our Favourite Cities in 2023 reached\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nup 15% y-o-y\n\nImportantly enough, PhosAgro implements the programme in partnership with a wide array of stakeholders and uses co-financing arrangements to enhance the engagement of society, local government bodies, and business communities. Social and economic partnership agreements signed by the Company with respective regional governments on an annual basis formalise, among other things, PhosAgro's commitment to run Our Favourite Cities programme.\n\n## Vologda region\n\nIn 2023, the Vologda region had 26 social facilities (schools, kindergartens, hospitals, museums, churches, etc.) renovated and 8 public spaces (including parks, public gardens and courtyards) landscaped as part of Our Favourite Cities programme. Additionally, assistance was provided to 31 non-profit organisations (charitable foundations, public organisations for disabled people and veterans, etc.).\n\nComments of city residents regarding the need to maintain improved areas in due state are taken into account when creating PhosAgro Group's municipal and charitable initiatives.\n\n## Saratov region\n\nIn 2023, Our Favourite Cities programme in the Balakovo municipal district of the Saratov region focused on the renovation and improvement of several dozen facilities, including parks, public gardens, sports\n\ngrounds, roads, parking lots, sidewalks, etc. Significant attention was paid to the installation of lighting and video surveillance systems. Additionally, the Company entered into co-financing arrangements with local authorities to beautify 12 public spaces in six villages: Bykov Otrog, Malaya Bykovka, Yelanka, Mayanga, Kormezhka, and Maloperekopnoye.\n\nAs a result, Balakovo won prizes in several nominations of a regional landscaping competition and was recognised the most wellmaintained city of the Saratov region.\n\n## Leningrad region\n\nIn 2023, the Leningrad region had 14 facilities and public spaces renovated and landscaped as part of Our Favourite Cities programme.\n\nAdditionally, the Volkhov branch organised a series of events to address the pressing social issues of Volkhov. One of the most successful\n\nevents was the Cultural Cat festival, which featured fundraising and food donation initiatives for helping animals, discussions with veterinarians, a drawing contest, and many more.\n\nMore than 100 people participated in a campaign launched by the Company to clean up the banks of the Volkhov River, a crucial waterway of the region.\n\n## Murmansk region\n\nIn 2023, the Murmansk region had 18 social facilities (schools, kindergartens, hospitals, museums, churches, etc.) renovated and 35 public spaces (including parks, public gardens and courtyards) landscaped as part of Our Favourite Cities programme. Additionally, assistance was provided to 37 non-profit organisations (charitable foundations and public organisations for disabled people and veterans).\n\n## Promoting entrepreneurship\n\nThe Company traditionally supports a range of initiatives aimed at promoting entrepreneurship in the regions of operation, as it is fully aware of the positive impacts it has on the economic activity, employment market and wellbeing of respective regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- In 2023, in Cherepovets the share of external co-financing for PhosAgro's competitive corporate-city project Making Our City Better Together! reached 52%. 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- One of PhosAgro Group's key social investment projects is the development of the infrastructure of the Khibiny mountain tourism cluster. The flow of tourists to the Khibiny Mountains has been steadily growing over the past five years. The growing tourism industry stimulated demand 2\n\nfor local services. The Company supports local businesses in partnership with municipal authorities, acting through the Tourism and Entrepreneurship Development Agency, a dedicated non-profit organisation. With new hotels and hospitality facilities opened, jobs are being created, people's income is growing, and so are local tax revenues. As a result, the unemployment rate in the city has decreased almost 10 times over 10 years from 5.9% to 0.6%. The number of SMEs has grown almost 2.5 times, from 728 to 1,693.\n\nRUB 8 mln worth of interest-free loans and grants was allocated on a competitive basis to 12 tourism and other related business projects initiated by entrepreneurs from Kirovsk. Additionally, assistance was provided in obtaining a federal grant from the Russian Ministry of Economic Development in the amount of RUB 20.7 mln. Currently, the Company supports 16 investment projects aimed at developing tourism infrastructure in Kirovsk and creating 420 new jobs, with investments totalling RUB 2.9 bln.",

It champions career guidance initiatives and pursues ventures designed to instil a corporate ethos, leadership acumen, and personal competencies that mirror the Company's principles - spirituality, ethics, leadership, reliability, safety, teamwork, continuous improvement, and innovation. Furthermore, there is a retraining and incentive framework in place for the teachers and administrators of these institutions.\n\nPhosAgro organises educational tours annually during the summer months for all PhosAgro Classes students to visit production sites and specialised educational organisations.\n\nIt also holds team-building events and offers elective courses in physics, chemistry, and maths.\n\nSince 2013, the Company has invested a total of over RUB 6 bnl in the programme.\n\nPhosAgro Schools not only develop educational and research auditoria and labs, but also implement career guidance projects to introduce the Company and its corporate culture to students, teachers, and parents.\n\nSince 2019, 126 participants of the PhosAgro Classes programme who graduated from dedicated universities have been hired by PhosAgro units, including 43 in 2023, to take engineering positions.

This programme, bolstered by an 11-year synergy with academic institutions, is tailored to foster closer contacts with graduates, build a talent pool for key positions within the Company and identify career paths for capable young professionals eager to work for the Company. Within this framework, PhosAgro offers young talents comprehensive professional development, hands-on training, and nurtures their personal and leadership competencies via corporate training sessions, workshops, and project presentations, all under the supervision of seasoned mentors.\n\nThose enrolled in the programme enjoy competitive remunerations, assistance with relocation and settling in their new environment, and are offered accommodation.

We are focused on fostering the right conditions for that by developing professional competencies of students and teachers at agricultural universities, as well as of agricultural producers and agro-industrial technology service providers.\n\nThe creation of educational infrastructure is of paramount importance, and it is only achievable with the commitment of engaged businesses. In line with this vision, Timiryazev Agricultural Academy has established the first flagship multifunctional centre, setting the stage for an educational network of 17 regional agrarian universities. Looking ahead to 2024-2025, we project to integrate PhosAgro Group's educational initiatives into\n\n57 Russian agrarian universities, and to give life to another eight educational centres.\n\nIn 2024, we anticipate offering a total of 500 lectures that delve into various aspects of agricultural production, business, and environmental stewardship, encompassing topics like rational and responsible agricultural practices, production processes, food security, and other sustainable development domains. A selection of these lectures is set to evolve into 15 additional professional education courses, culminating in the awarding of both personal PhosAgro certificates and official state qualifications.\n\n17 regional agrarian universities are part of the educational network\n\n8 educational centres will be opened in 2024-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA contemporary agricultural university is much more than a hub for theoretical education; it also serves as an incubator for pioneering new technologies. Recognising this, the Company is dedicated to nurturing digital education platforms. Our initial stride in this direction has been the introduction of Pro Agro Lectorium, an online digital educational platform that grants unrestricted access to free agronomic lectures..\n\n15 new courses for additional professional education to be launched by 2024\n\n## DROZD (Educated and Healthy Children of Russia)\n\nDROZD (Educated and Healthy Children of Russia) is the Company's key social project aimed at a balanced development of young people in the cities where we operate.\n\nThe project is a comprehensive system of multi-faceted long-term interactions with children aged 4 to 18 that harmoniously combines sports, spiritual, and patriotic education. To facilitate the DROZD programme, operators (independent non-profit organisations) have been established in five cities where the Group operates: DROZD-Balakovo (Saratov region), DROZD-Cherepovets (Vologda region), DROZD-Khibiny (Murmansk region) and DROZD-Volkhov\n\n(Leningrad region). 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the DROZD programme.\n\nMedia actively spotlight DROZD's endeavours:\n\n- \u00b7  in local and corporate newspapers and e-publications;\n- \u00b7  in regional and national media outlets;\n- \u00b7  in social networks and partner communities that post information about DROZD's member organisations and events.\n\nNevertheless, DROZD collaborates with social service centres, crisis centres, and homes for children without parental care, integrating their involvement into the programme's initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn important feature of the project is continuous children's health monitoring based on the Health Navigator methodology. It helps teachers and parents to adapt educational activities as closely as possible to specific requirements of a child's body.\n\nHealth monitoring\n\n3,524 Number of children monitored, persons\n\n4.5 Average health index of all children monitored, at the beginning of the reporting period\n\n4.6 Average health index of all children monitored, at the end of the reporting period\n\n1,930 Number of children who improved their health index, persons",

The actual compliance with the CGC is evaluated on an annual basis and disclosed in a dedicated report, which is subject to review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and approval by the Board of Directors, and forms a part of the Company's annual report.\n\nIn February 2024, the Board of Directors reviewed the performance of the 2023 improvement plan. The Board scrutinised the evolution of compliance with the Code's principles and trends in the quality of explanations for non-compliance or partial compliance. Post-review, the Board of Directors approved the 2023 CGC Report, and issued a positive assessment of compliance with the CGC recommendations. Furthermore, the Board of Directors praised progress against the 2023 Corporate Governance Practice Improvement Plan, and approved the improvement plan for 2024.\n\nOver the past three years, PhosAgro has demonstrated a high level of compliance with the CGC recommendations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance with the CGC recommendations\n\n|                                                      | Total              | Full compliance   | Full compliance   | Full compliance   | Partial compliance   | Partial compliance   | Partial compliance   | Non-compliance   | Non-compliance   | Non-compliance   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| CGC section                                          | number  of matters | '21               | '22               | '23               | '21                  | '22                  | '23                  | '21              | '22              | '23              |\n| 1.

In 2023, the quality of PhosAgro's disclosure to explain the non-compliance (partial non-compliance) with the recommendations of the Code, according to the Bank of Russia, improved from 76 to 77%, while the average level in the Russian Federation grew from 59% to 64%.\n\nResults of implementing the CG improvement plan developed and approved by the Board of Directors in the analysis of the 2022 CGC Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpon the re-election of the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee in 2023, the Board of Directors will seek to elect an independent director as the Chairman of the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee.\n\nOnce the General Meeting of Shareholders elects new members of PhosAgro's Board of Directors in 2023, the Board will seek to staff the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee with independent directors only.\n\nAs part of the next amendments made to the Regulations on the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee or upon approval of a new version of the Regulations (presumably in 2023), a clause on conditions (events) for reviewing the compensation policies will be introduced.\n\nIn 2023, the Company will resume the practice of assessing each Board member individually, as part of the Board's overall performance assessment exercise.\n\nDespite these intentions, the Committee continued under the leadership of a non-independent member of the Board (Committee Chairman). The Committee's composition was drawn from the post-election Board, considering attributes most conducive to achieving the Committee's objectives, such as relevant experience, education, and expertise.\n\nThe Company proceeded from the fact that the responsibility to regularly revise the policy, which is specified in the Regulations on the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, implies ensuring that it is updated from time to time and meets the current needs of the Company; thus, stipulating special conditions (trigger events) for reviewing the policy is not a critical element of the Regulations. Since there were no other compelling reasons to revise the Regulations in 2023, its updating was postponed.\n\nThe Board of Directors resolved to skip individual assessment, as 70% of its members are newcomers since July 2022. In this context, the Board identified no significant risks associated with not proceeding with an individual assessment. In 2024, the Company may resume the practice of assessing each Board member individually, as part of the Board's overall performance assessment exercise.\n\n- 1 The most recent year assessed by the Bank of Russia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProposed actions following the review of the 2023 CGC Report include:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nafter the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and election of a new Board, staffing the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee exclusively with independent directors and seeking to elect an independent director as its Chairman;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin 2024, the Company resuming the practice of assessing each Board member individually, as part of the Board's overall performance assessment exercise;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nengaging external experts in relevant topics;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincreasing the number of independent directors in the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee and electing an independent director to chair it;\n\nReport on compliance with the principles and recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code (stand-alone document)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the full text of PhosAgro's Report on compliance with the principles and recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code, please visit the official website of the Company.\n\nearly notifying shareholders of the Board's or Remuneration and Human Resources Committee's assessment of professional qualifications, experience, and skills of Board candidates against the Company's present and future needs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company's internal regulations set out the tasks of the remuneration committee, including those listed in Recommendation 180 of the Code, as well as the conditions (events), upon the occurrence of which the remuneration committee considers revising the company's remuneration policy for members of the board of directors, executive bodies and other key executives\u0432\n\n## Status\u00a0of\u00a0compliance\n\n2022:\n\nNon-compliance\n\n2023: Partial\u00a0compliance\n\nCriterion 1 was only partially complied with, as one of the members of the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee does not meet the independence requirements. The Committee's composition was drawn from the post-election Board, considering attributes most conducive to achieving the Committee's objectives, such as relevant experience, education, and expertise.\n\nOnce the General Meeting of Shareholders elects new members of PhosAgro's Board of Directors in 2024, the Board will seek to staff the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee with independent directors only.\n\nCriterion 2 is partially complied with, as the Chairman of the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee is not an independent member of the Board of Directors. Nonetheless, the individual in question is a seasoned HR management expert whose perspective on Board meeting agenda items has always relied only on professional expertise and insight, independent of other Board members or Company management team.\n\nThe Committee Chairman does not concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nUpon the re-election of the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee in 2024, the Board of Directors will seek to elect an independent director as the Chairman of the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee.\n\nCriterion 3 was not met with respect to the failure to define in the Company's internal documents the conditions (events) upon the occurrence of which the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors considers the revision of PhosAgro's policy on remuneration of the Board members, members of executive bodies, and other key executives. The Company proceeded from the fact that the responsibility to regularly revise the policy, which is specified in the Regulations on the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, implies ensuring that it is updated and meets the current needs of the Company When deliberating on amendments to the Regulations on the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee or the adoption of a new version of the Regulations (anticipated in 2024-2025), specific triggers (events) for reviewing the above policy will be incorporated into the draft documents.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe activities of PhosAgro's supreme governing body - the General Shareholders' Meeting - are governed by the Regulations on the General Meeting of Shareholders. In March 2023, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders was held in absentia to elect new members of the Board of Directors and Review Committee,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Directors continued to oversee strategic focus areas and key decisionmaking within its scope of functions.

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY AND GLOBAL CHALLENGES\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Directors continued to develop our updated Strategy to 2030, but given the serious rise in the level of uncertainty, this will take longer than expected.\n\nThe Board traditionally paid great attention to monitoring progress in the implementation of the Strategy to 2025, including a detailed review of progress towards strategic goals in functional areas such as sales, logistics, production, environmental protection and climate change, occupational health and safety, and personnel development. Statutory compliance was rigorously\n\nevaluated, and the practice of doing regular surveys of stakeholder expectations and reviewing changes in the external environment, particularly concerning sustainable development objectives, was expanded.\n\nIn the reporting year, the fruitful exercise of incorporating anti-crisis management topics into the agenda, established in 2022, continued. This approach focuses on planning and assessing efforts to ensure stable and sustainable operation of the Company's production sites, especially in procurement and sales, amid the existing conditions.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## GRI 2-12, 2-14\n\nDuring 2023, as part of the action plan to implement the ESG agenda in the Company's practices, the Board of Directors updated the tax strategy and a number of internal documents on charity, sponsorship, and external audit.\n\nIn the reporting year, the Board of Directors continued reviewing the Company's practices for compliance with the recommendations published by the Bank of Russia in December 2021 to encourage boards of directors\n\nof public joint-stock companies to consider ESG factors and sustainable development in their activities. Building on the practice of assessment introduced in 2021, the self-assessment of the Board of Directors' performance for 2023 factored in the regulator's recommendations. The postassessment steps were also largely based on this significant document of the Bank of Russia, which reasserted that the Company's sustainable development and high-quality corporate governance are intertwined.\n\n## INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND INFORMATION SECURITY\n\nIn accordance with its earlier decision, the Board of Directors reviewed the quality of countering information security threats twice during 2023. The Board also focused\n\non the Company's readiness to replace software that is about to be no longer supported in Russia after the sanctions were imposed.\n\nIn addition, the focus of the Board during the year was on approved projects that, though not part of the Strategy to 2025, meet the criteria adopted by the Board when approving the Strategy in the context of the main scenarios considered. These criteria include sustainable production growth, introduction of innovative and sustainable products and processes, and stronger operatingefficiency.\n\nThe Board also reviewed a number of investment initiatives that form the basis for the Strategy to 2030 and can be integrated into it in line with developments in the markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ONGOING TASKS\n\nIn addition to the above key tasks, which were the top priorities in the reporting year, there are traditional focus areas in the Board's activities:\n\n- \u00b7  assessment and quarterly monitoring of the risk management process;\n- \u00b7  assessment and quarterly monitoring of subsidiary activities with a focus on workplace health and safety, industrial safety and environmental protection;\n- \u00b7  assessment of compliance with the Inside Information Regulations;\n- \u00b7  assessment of the quality of investment and organisational project management at PhosAgro Group subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7  appointment and evaluation of the performance of PJSC PhosAgro's CEO and Management Board;\n- \u00b7  oversight over management relations with shareholders, investors and other stakeholders;\n- \u00b7  monitoring the implementation of priority areas of PhosAgro's activities in 2023 and determining priority areas of its activities for 2024;\n- \u00b7  reviewing PJSC PhosAgro's budget for 2024, as well as quarterly follow-up on the 2023 budget utilisation;\n\n## PARTICIPATION IN THE BOARD MEETINGS\n\n12 meetings of the Board of Directors held in 2023\n\n78 agenda items considered by the Board of Directors in 2023\n\n- \u00b7  evaluating the alignment of the Company's corporate culture with its goals, values, and strategy; assessing and overseeing the corporate culture;\n- \u00b7  reviewing and approving the results, work plans, and budget of the Internal Audit Department;\n- \u00b7  quarterly review and approval of financial statements;\n- \u00b7  approval of major transactions and interested-party transactions;\n- \u00b7  convening General Meetings of Shareholders;\n- \u00b7  assessing the quality of non-financial reporting and approving the Company's annual report.\n\n## Meetings of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Participation in the Board meetings\n\n| Participation   | Board  of Directors   | Audit  Committee   | Remuneration and Human  Resources Committee   | Strategy and Sustainable  Development Committee   |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                 | 11/12                 | 1/4                | 2/4                                           | Victor Ivanov                                     |\n|                 | 12/12                 |                    |                                               | Yuri Krugovykh                                    |\n|                 | 12/12                 | 3/4                |                                               | Siroj Loikov                                      |\n| 3/12            | 2/6                   | 1/4                |                                               | Ivan Rodionov (before 24 March 2023)              |\n|                 | 11/12                 |                    |                                               | Natalia Pashkevich                                |\n| 8/12            | 4/6                   | 3/4                |                                               | Vladimir Trukhachev                               |\n|                 | 12/12                 |                    |                                               | Alexander Seleznev                                |\n| 11/12           |                       | 6/6                |                                               | Victor Cherepov                                   |\n| 12/12           |                       |                    | 2/4                                           | Mikhail Rybnikov                                  |\n| 12/12           |                       |                    | 4/4                                           | Alexander Sharabaika                              |\n| 11/12           | 6/6                   | 4/4                | 4/4                                           | Andrey Sharonov                                   |",

Board members should have a recognised, including among investors and shareholders, good business reputation and no conflicts of interest with the Company.\n\nThe Company should aim for a wellbalanced composition of its Board of Directors, where the qualifications, experience, knowledge, business acumen, and independence of members are harmonised. The Remuneration and Human Resources Committee and the Board of Directors themselves assess these attributes of prospective candidates and of the serving directors at least semi-annually. This assessment includes evaluating whether potential members can dedicate adequate time to their duties on the Board, considering all other commitments. The Committee's findings on these matters are compiled as part of the documents for the General Meeting of Shareholders whenever elections to the Board are on the agenda.\n\nFurthermore, the correlation of Board members' competencies with the Company's strategic needs is revisited by the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee annually. This is part of managing the succession planning for key executive roles and within the context of the Board's annual performance assessment. The outcomes of these deliberations are communicated to the Board of Directors by the Committee Chairman as part of its performance report.\n\n## Board of Directors: independence, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board of Directors: length of continuous service, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 There are no members of the Board of Directors under the age of 30.\n\nIn the reporting year, there was modest turnover within the Board, with only one new member elected. The Board's responsibility to the government, shareholders, employees, communities in the regions of PhosAgro's footprint and other stakeholders for the Company's operational, financial, environmental and social performance remained unchanged.\n\n## Board of Directors: gender split, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board of Directors 1 : age %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board of Directors: place of

Their position is unbiased, independent and free from the influence of other members of the Board and PJSC PhosAgro's management, and they are primarily focused on improving the Company's performance. Following the election\n\n## D&O 1 LIABILITY INSURANCE\n\nThe Company has been taking out D&O liability insurance every year since 2012. Under the current insurance contract (insurance period from 1 June 2023 to 31 May 2024),\n\nliability for third-party losses incurred in the exercise of duties by directors and officers of PhosAgro is covered up to USD 50 mln in rouble equivalent, with an extension of the aggregate\n\nliability limit for all independent directors by USD 2 mln. Apart from directors' liability, the above contract includes the liability of the Company's officers.\n\n## ASSESSMENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' PERFORMANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn accordance with the Code recommendations, PhosAgro assesses the performance of its Board of Directors on an annual basis, with external experts engaged for this purpose once in three years. In January 2023, IDA - Association of Professional Directors conducted an external assessment of the Board of Directors' performance for 2022.\n\nThe external assessment confirmed that the Board and its committees were functioning in accordance with the recommendations of the Code and the Listing Rules of the Moscow Exchange. Corporate governance practices in such areas\n\n1 Directors & Officers Liability.\n\nas the organisation of activities and operation of the Board of Directors, interaction with committees, the role of the Board Chairman, the performance of the Corporate Secretary, and the Company's ESG and sustainability activities were noted as highly effective.\n\nThe Board performance assessment methodology was based on international best practices, Code requirements and the Listing Rules of the Moscow Exchange, and was agreed with the Chairman of the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee and the Corporate Secretary.\n\nof new directors on 24 March 2023, five out of ten Board members are independent and one of the three Board committees is chaired by an independent director.\n\nThe independence of Board members and nominees is assessed biannually by the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee. The assessment is based on the criteria set out in PhosAgro's\n\nRegulations on the Board of Directors, Clause 2.4 of the Code, Clause 2 of Appendix 2 (2.18) and Appendix 4 of the Listing Rules of the Moscow Exchange, and Clause 10 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (FRC, 2018). In 2023, five of the Board members (Victor Ivanov, Natalia Pashkevich, Vladimir Trukhachev, Victor Cherepov, and Andrey Sharonov) were recognised as independent.\n\nQuestionnaires and interviews were used to assess the performance of the Board of Directors and its committees. During the first stage, detailed questionnaires were circulated among the directors. The findings were supplemented by comments and feedback from Board members and management during individual interviews. As part of the assessment, the number of the Board's focus areas under review was increased to eleven. Each of them received a fairly high score. Following the assessment completion, in March 2023 the Board approved a number of initiatives to further enhance corporate governance practices.\n\n## Progress of improvement initiatives following the

Following the Board of Directors' recommendations issued upon approval, the Committee regularly checks such actual metrics as production volumes, sales in priority markets, expansion of sales and transport infrastructure and ESG metrics, including those set in the Climate and Water strategies approved in 2020, against the Strategy.\n\nAs the Board of Directors approved the Climate Strategy in December 2020 and the low-carbon transition plan was put into action, monitoring of activities specified in these documents remained an important item on the Committee's agenda.\n\nThe Committee took over from the dissolved Sustainable Development Committee\n\nThe Committee focused on the following:\n\n- \u00b7  implementation status of the Company's Development Strategy to 2025;\n- \u00b7  creation and analysis of PhosAgro's framework for sustainable development bylaws, control over their drafting process, relevance, effectiveness and quality;\n- \u00b7  control over progress against internal sustainability objectives;\n- \u00b7  review of sustainability reporting and supervision of disclosures on the Company's sustainability activities;\n- \u00b7  analysis of the Company's practices and bylaws in terms of compliance with sustainable development rating and competition requirements and management of efforts to maintain and improve the Company's standing in ratings/ competitions;\n- \u00b7  monitoring of compliance with HSE laws and progress in reducing negative climate impact from the Company's production activities;\n\nto monitor and regularly update the action plan set to improve ESG ratings. We consider this practice to be effective in terms of developing and prioritising organisational and technical sustainability measures, and intend to maintain this approach going forward. Currently, the above action plan considers not only ESG rating criteria, but also the position of the Company's management bodies regarding the tools to achieve strategic sustainability goals.\n\nSustainability reporting and disclosure supervision were among key agenda items as well. The Committee reviewed matters related to stakeholder engagement, identification of material topics to be disclosed in the 2023 integrated Annual Report, and the Report's overall concept and standards we relied on when preparing it. Also, after analysing the quality of disclosure and feedback on the 2022 integrated Annual Report, the Committee praised the Company's non-financial disclosure practices.\n\nFollowing proposals received from the Board of Directors as part of the external assessment, the Committee invited other Board members and relevant experts to discuss such items as challenges and trends in agriculture and allied industries, report on the carbon farm project in the Vologda region, and PhosAgro's innovations.\n\nThe Committee members also remained focused on HSE compliance by reviewing, among others, draft laws, which are yet to be considered and approved.\n\nFor the first time in its history, the Committee reviewed the findings of a comparative study focusing on PhosAgro's energy efficiency.\n\n- \u00b7  assessment of environmental, social, technological, climate, and industrial risks associated with the Company's production activities;\n- \u00b7  review of investigation records on industrial accidents and incidents, environmental law violations, and breach of climate impact regulations;\n- \u00b7  consideration of proposals on improving working conditions, complying with safety regulations, reducing injury frequency rates, greenhouse gas emissions, pollutant discharges, waste generation and disposal, and enhancing energy efficiency;\n- \u00b7  analysis of progress on programmes and initiatives to introduce resource and energy efficiency solutions and climate protection technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alexander Sharabaika\n\nChairman of the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee",

In addition to that, PhosAgro continued to honour all its social commitments\n\nto develop the regions of operation, keeping its support for social and charitable projects unchanged from the previous year's record level. The Board of Directors praised the performance of executive bodies and key executives for their due consideration of ESG factors and addressing sustainability issues.\n\nThe executive management focuses on PhosAgro's strategy and long-term sustainable business development for the benefit of shareholders and other stakeholders by linking executive remuneration to the Company's goals, including those in the realm of ESG.\n\nAt least twice a year, at the end of six months and full calendar year, the CEO submits a report on the performance of the Company's executive bodies to the Board of Directors for review and approval. The report traditionally includes highlights of the Company's production, sales, logistics, and procurement operations, and data on progress against key investment and target projects. It also focuses heavily on the executive team's environmental and occupational\n\nsafety performance, social support for employees, and external social investments.\n\n- For more information, see the Remuneration Report section on page 280\n\nIn May 2022, the number of Management Board members was approved at three.

Additional remuneration is linked to achieving the Company's KPIs and completeness and quality of accomplishment of additional tasks, as determined by the Board of Directors and\n\nthe CEO for the reporting period, as well as the Company's achievement of the EBITDA target.\n\nAll KPIs are aligned with the Company's strategic goals defined in its Strategy to 2025 and oriented towards their achievement.\n\nThe amount of additional remuneration ranges from 30% to 150% of the annual base salary and depends on the level of the position held and the functional area\n\nThe report on the voting results of PhosAgro's General Meeting of Shareholders dated 28 March 2023 is available on the Company's official website.\n\nof the manager. The Remuneration and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, during its annual evaluation of the incentive system, ensures an effective proportion of fixed and variable components of remuneration.\n\nKPIs for each senior manager are set annually and take into account metrics related to operational efficiency and individual contribution to the corporate growth and strategic performance.\n\nTo assess the performance of the Company's CEO, a number of indicators are used, which aim to improve the efficiency of investments and sales, control\n\ncosts, and reduce employee injury rates for the Company and its contractors.\n\nValues of the CEO KPIs in the range of base case / target / challenge, as well as their actual values at the end of the reporting period are approved by the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Taken together, these indicators contribute to the achievement of the Company's strategic goals and serve the interests of shareholders both in terms of the Company's development and in terms of minimising the risks arising from incentivising excessively risky management decisions.\n\nKPIs of the CEO and N-1 level managers, including sustainable development indicators, are cascaded\n\nKPIs of N-1 level managers include indicators that help benchmark the Company's performance against industry peers:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChange in spread between average EV/EBITDA of public phosphate fertilizer manufacturers and PhosAgro's EV/EBITDA.\n\nEV/EBITDA reflects investors' estimate of the Company's fair market value and its investment case.

On a quarterly basis, the Board of Directors reviewed reports on the management of the Company's key risks. PhosAgro's executives paid special attention to managing these key risks. The Risk Commission continuously monitored the status of risk management activities and, when necessary, initiated changes to improve those related to key risks.\n\n## THE DEVELOPMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK IN 2023\n\nThe Company is making a consistent effort to develop its risk management and internal control framework. The Board of Directors reviewed the results of the framework's\n\n## INTERNAL AUDIT\n\nPhosAgro's Internal Audit Department assists the Company's top executives and the Board of Directors in improving the management of business processes and enhancing the internal control and risk management framework.

Audits are performed at the Company level, as well as at specific subsidiaries and their standalone business units. In addition, the Internal Audit Department monitors the effectiveness and efficiency of corrective actions taken by the management following the audit, and reports to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and to the Board of Directors annually.\n\nIn 2023, the Internal Audit Department fully met the annual action plan. It carried out audits that covered PhosAgro Group's business processes related to personnel management, cash management, and capital investments as well as an IT audit of sales units and an audit of ESG targets. Based on the audit findings, recommendations were developed to improve the efficiency of personnel management processes and approaches, and enhance measures related to information security. The management developed and approved corrective action plans, with the progress monitored by the Internal Audit Department.\n\n## EXTERNAL AUDIT\n\nA key element of the Audit Committee's operations is ongoing interaction with external auditors and development of recommendations for the Board of Directors regarding the choice and approval of auditors. When selecting an auditor, we evaluate the following factors in addition to the cost of their services:\n\n- \u00b7  composition of the audit team (in terms of experience and qualifications), which should ensure that the statements are audited within acceptable deadlines and with adequate quality;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn March 2024, the 11th Internal Auditor of the Year national competition named PhosAgro's Internal Audit Department a winner in the Internal Audit Service of the Year category.\n\nPlans for 2024 encompass audits of various business processes, including logistics management, repairs, industrial safety, and occupational health and safety, as well as IT audits and audits of insider information handling.\n\n## TEAM DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn order to achieve the strategic goals in internal audit, we continue working to develop and diversify the competencies of our team by holding regular training sessions, which focus on sourcing data from information systems and further processing and visualising it. Training initiatives addressing this focus area are scheduled for 2024.\n\n- \u00b7  the auditor's independence evaluated based on a variety of factors, including assessment of the scope of non-audit services provided to us by the candidate company during the relevant periods. Each offer from the current auditor for non-audit services requires confirmation by the audit partner to make sure there is no risk to independence and is submitted to PhosAgro's Audit Committee for consideration and approval. The Committee consents to the contract only if the scope of the non-audit services does\n\nnot call into question the ability to perform the audit service independently and impartially. The Committee's assessment of the auditor's independence is also significantly influenced by the auditor's internal procedures for controlling the impartiality and professional ethics of the auditor's staff, including requirements for periodic rotation of the audit partner, training arranged in this area and the use of specialised software to perform the respective audits;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SELF/uniF6BAASSESSMENT AND EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT\n\nInternal audit quality is assured through regular external independent assessments and self-assessment.\n\nAn external independent assessment takes place once every three years. The previous one was conducted in late 2021 by PwC.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Internal Audit Department held a self-assessment of its compliance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and the Institute of Internal Auditors' Code of Ethics. The self-assessment showed the Department's full compliance with all applicable standards and requirements.",

The Committee may form its opinion on the quality of the external auditor's work during in-person Committee meetings, where the external auditor's mandatory participants are a manager and the partner, as well as during meetings between the audit team and the Chairman of the Audit Committee held prior to the Committee meetings.\n\nPhosAgro's auditor performs the audit of its financial and business operations in compliance\n\n## INSIDER INFORMATION\n\nPhosAgro has adopted the Insider Information Regulations compliant with the Russian laws and the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR).\n\nIn accordance with its provisions, the Corporate Secretary Office keeps a list of insiders, persons discharging managerial responsibilities (PDMR) and persons closely associated with them (PCA). The Regulations define the scope of responsibilities for each insider group, which the Corporate Secretary Office from time to time communicates to respective persons.\n\nFirst and foremost, these include the limitations on the use of insider information and trading in the Company's securities. Depending on the group, an insider may be prohibited from such transactions or obliged to notify the Company or obtain its consent\n\nwith Russian laws and regulations and the agreement signed with the Company. The auditor is approved by the Company's General Meeting of Shareholders. The Company engaged JSC Technologies of Trust Audit (Ferro-Plaza Business Centre, 14/3 Krzhizhanovsky street, bldg. 5/1, Moscow, Russia) to audit its 2023 IFRS financial statements.\n\nThe Company's 2023 RAS accounting statements were audited by JSC Unicon (8 Preobrazhenskaya Ploshchad, Preo 8 Business Centre, Moscow, Russia).\n\nThe approach to assessing external audit's independence and efficiency, as well as appointment and re-appointment of the external auditor\n\nfor such transactions.

Its adoption ensues from the risks and hazards faced by the Group companies in their operations and the respective need to respond to the hazards and minimise the risks.\n\nThe Policy states high priority of information security activities and sets up its key principles. They cover the target setting and planning of information security activities, as well as their implementation, quality management and process improvement. The above principles define the contents of the lower-level documents such as the Information Security Framework and other internal documents covering respective issues. This set of documents reflects modern solutions and best practices in information security.\n\nEnsuring information security is the responsibility of each employee. To this end, the Group regularly holds events to raise employees' awareness of information security issues and develop practical skills to deal with modern threats. This, together with the use of modern information security tools and well-coordinated work of the department, helped\n\navoid information security incidents in 2023 and in previous periods that could have caused tangible material or reputational damage. Information security issues are submitted for consideration by the Board of Directors every six months.\n\nIn 2023, the Company implemented the following information initiatives to enhance information security:\n\n- \u00b7  increasing awareness of information security: over 12,000 employees completed courses and testing on a corporate training platform to enhance their knowledge of information security;\n- \u00b7  improving processes to comply with legal requirements: a total of 21 internal regulations were issued, with measures taken to ensure their implementation;\n- \u00b7  enhancing protection of an automated process control system: information security safeguards were implemented on all significant components of critical information infrastructure, with dedicated training sessions conducted for personnel responsible for operating and supporting the automated process control system;\n- \u00b7  improving processes for managing access to information resources, transitioning to automated control of access rights;\n- \u00b7  automating processes for managing security events and incidents, implementing a security information and event management (SIEM) system and establishing an operations centre;\n- \u00b7  assessing the security of the Group's information resources, developing plans to enhance security safeguards;\n- \u00b7  identifying and blocking fraudulent IT resources linked to the generation of fake commercial offers on behalf of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the full text of the Information Security Policy, please visit the Company's website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll employees of the Economic Security Department receive training in terrorism prevention and the main goals and principles of PhosAgro Group Code of Ethics.\n\n## Security personnel who completed human rights training, %\n\n<!-- image -->",

The trust that our investors, employees, customers, contractors and authorities place in the Company is underpinned by the high ethical standards that we have adhered to since PhosAgro's inception.\n\nWe take an integrated approach to business ethics; in other words, we believe that ethical considerations are intrinsic to all aspects of our operations, from procurement and teamwork to safety and trade. We systematically analyse risks in this area and develop and implement measures to manage them.\n\nTo achieve the above, we need to ensure that our ethical principles and standards are clearly defined and communicated to employees and counterparties. We also need to have relevant legal, organisational and informational mechanisms in place to support and, more importantly, monitor compliance with these principles and standards, which should also be overseen at the highest corporate governance level.\n\nBy consistently implementing this approach for years, PhosAgro has been able to become a company operating to the highest global standards in human rights, industrial\n\nsafety, environmental protection, anti-corruption, etc. We recognise that it is hardly possible to fully eliminate ethical risks in a large and diverse organisation. We believe that by adhering to our ethical principles and standards we minimise unnecessary risks, maintain our business reputation and keep ourselves on track to achieve our ambitious production and financial targets for the benefit of PhosAgro's shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nPhosAgro Group does its best to eliminate violations of human rights, corrupt practices, and other instances of non-compliance with corporate ethical principles, while also enhancing and protecting its business reputation as an honest, open and bona fide company among shareholders, potential investors, partners, employees, and counterparties. Elimination of any possible occurrences bearing the signs of the above, and strengthening the commitment of PhosAgro Group's employees to the highest ethical standards are at the forefront of the Group's activities.\n\nTo ensure PhosAgro Group's observance of ethical practices and generally recognised business standards, the Company among\n\nother things put in place an antifraud and anti-corruption system covering all areas of operation. On top of that, Group companies adopted a set of corporate, legal, information and educational measures to build a shared corporate culture underpinned by high ethical standards and maintain an atmosphere of trust, mutual respect and integrity among employees. All subsidiaries and affiliates of PhosAgro and Apatit approved anti-corruption standards. PhosAgro runs activities as part of an approved anti-corruption plan until 2024.\n\n## ETHICAL STANDARDS AND NORMS OF BEHAVIOUR\n\nThe principles and standards of ethical behaviour when working at and with PhosAgro are set out in relevant policies and other internal documents listed below. These are regulatory documents all the Group's managers, officers and employees must comply with. Employees who have violated them are subject to the respective sanctions, including social condemnation, public censure through publication in the media, full or partial withholding of bonuses, and - if the employee's action (omission) bears signs of a disciplinary offence - disciplinary measures also apply to such employee pursuant to the applicable labour and employment laws.\n\n## The following internal policies and procedures governing the compliance of the Company with the key principles and standards of ethical conduct are currently in effect:\n\n## SASB EM-MM-510a.1, RT-CH-530a.1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nThe Code outlines the key principles and rules of ethical business conduct underlying the corporate culture of PhosAgro\n\n## Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Code defines the main principles of and approaches to corporate governance\n\n## Code of Conduct for Counterparties\n\nThe Company may refuse to cooperate with suppliers or business partners discriminating their own or subcontractors' employees or using forced labour\n\n## Anti-Corruption Policy\n\nThe Policy defines the goals and objectives and sets forth the Company's key principles and employee responsibilities in the sphere of anti-fraud and anti-corruption\n\nRegulations on Conflict of Interest\n\nThe Regulations establish the procedure for identifying and resolving conflicts of interest arising with employees in the course of their employment\n\nApatit's Procurement Policy\n\nThe Policy defines the goals, key principles, roles and employee responsibilities in procurement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUK Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement\n\nThe Act outlines the Company's actions to prevent all forms of modern slavery and human trafficking within PhosAgro and its supply chain\n\nRegulations on the Commission for Combating Fraud and Corruption and Regulating Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe Regulations address and govern the issues pertaining to employee anti-corruption compliance\n\nRegulations on Internal Checks\n\nRegulations on Inspections\n\nThe regulations govern a set of actions taken to elicit the facts and identify the circumstances, motives and conditions\n\nof misconduct, incidents, and other violations of requirements set out in the Company's internal regulations\n\n## PhosAgro Hotline Regulations\n\nThe Regulations set out the goals and objectives with regard to the receipt of employee reports on the matters pertaining to combating fraud, corruption and theft and identifying conflicts of interest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegulations on Business Presents and Representation Expenses\n\nThe Regulations set out the procedure for receiving presents by the Company's employees, as well as making them on behalf of the Company.

PhosAgro Group's employees and counterparties have free and easy access to information about the Company's anti-corruption practices. PhosAgro's official website features a special section on anti-corruption, which contains CEO's message about\n\nthe need to strictly comply with established anti-corruption standards, as well as copies of internal documents aimed at preventing corruption (the Anti-Corruption Policy, Code of Ethics, Regulations on Conflict of Interest and on PhosAgro Hot Line). Internal documents are supplemented by methodological materials (handouts, presentations), which explain in easy terms the anti-corruption policy, standards of conduct, responsibility, and provide examples of corruptionprone situations that employees may encounter in the course of their employment.\n\nEvery new employee receives training on the basic requirements of the Anti-Fraud and AntiCorruption Policy, the Code of Ethics, Regulations on Conflict of Interest and\n\non PhosAgro Hot Line by watching a respective video and putting their signature in briefing log to confirm the above. Employees' job descriptions stipulate their obligation to comply with anti-corruption standards and PhosAgro Group's internal regulations, as well as to receive respective training. When employees perform functions involving a high risk of corruption, those responsible for the implementation of the AntiCorruption Policy additionally explain to them the Russian laws and the Group's internal policies on anti-corruption. Employees and counterparties can inquire about the Company's anti-corruption standards through PhosAgro's hotline portal, where they can obtain professional legal assistance and expert clarification.\n\n0",

As at 31 December 2023, the Company's leverage was comfortable, with the net debt/ EBITDA ratio standing at 1.2x.\n\nWhen determining its borrowing requirements, the Company assesses the cost of borrowing from banks and\n\npublic debt markets, the amount and maturity available while striving to ensure that this fits into the Group's long-term debt reduction strategy. The choice of the currency of borrowings is based on the availability of currencies and the structure of the Company's revenue, about 70% of which was in foreign currency in 2023.\n\nIn line with the investment policy designed to meet PhosAgro's investor obligations and strengthen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EUROBONDS\n\n| XS2099039542                  |                               | ISIN XS2384719402            |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| PJSC PhosAgro                 | PJSC PhosAgro                 | Borrower                     |\n| PhosAgro Bond Funding Limited | PhosAgro Bond Funding Limited | Issuer                       |\n| USD                           | USD                           | Currency                     |\n| 23 January 2020               | 16 September 2021             | Offering date                |\n| 23 January 2025               | 16 September 2028             | Maturity date                |\n| 500                           | 500                           | Issue value, USD mln         |\n| RU000A106G31                  | RU000A106G56                  | Including replacement bonds, |\n|                               | 383.470                       | USD mln  356.915             |\n\nits investment case, the investment budget shall not exceed 50% of planned EBITDA.\n\nThe record high capital investments and charitable expenses in 2023 did not affect the Company's leverage, which remained comfortably below the net debt/EBITDA target.\n\n## RUB/uniF6BADENOMINATED EXCHANGE BONDS\n\n| RU000A106516   | ISIN                 |\n|----------------|----------------------|\n| PJSC PhosAgro  | Issuer               |\n| RUB            | Currency             |\n| 21 April 2023  | Offering date        |\n| 17 April 2026  | Maturity date        |\n| 20,000         | Issue value, RUB mln |\n\n## CNY/uniF6BADENOMINATED EXCHANGE BONDS\n\n| RU000A1063Z5   | ISIN                 |\n|----------------|----------------------|\n| PJSC PhosAgro  | Issuer               |\n| CNY            | Currency             |\n| 13 April 2023  | Offering date        |\n| 9 April 2026   | Maturity date        |\n| 2,000          | Issue value, CNY mln |\n\n## ANALYST COVERAGE\n\nPhosAgro is covered by analysts from leading Russian and international brokers.\n\n| Company                      | Analyst           | Tel.                          |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| ATON                         | Andrey Lobazov    | +7 (495) 213-03-37            |\n| Alfa Bank                    | Boris Krasnojenov | +7 (495) 795-36-12            |\n| BCS Global Markets           | Kirill Chuyko     | +7 (495) 213-15-26            |\n| Sberbank CIB                 | Georgiy Ivanin    | +7 (495) 665-56-00            |\n| Sinara Financial Corporation | Dmitriy Smolin    | +7 (916) 555-79-97            |\n| Veles Capital                | Elsa Gazizova     | +7 (495) 258-19-88, ext. 599  |\n| My Investments               | -                 | -                             |\n| Finam                        | Alexey Kalachev   | +7 (495) 796-93-88, ext. 2357 |\n| Renaissance Capital          |                   |                               |\n\n## DIVIDEND POLICY\n\nPhosAgro is committed to striking an effective and reasonable balance between the payment of dividends and reinvestment of profit in further development.\n\nHigher transparency and predictability of dividend payments are a priority for the Company as it seeks to ramp up its growth and strengthen its investment case.\n\nAll resolutions on the payment of dividends and the timing and amount of such payment are subject to approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders, based on recommendations provided by PhosAgro's Board of Directors.\n\nWhen preparing recommendations for the General Meeting of Shareholders on any dividend payout (declaration), in addition to the current financial standing assessment, the Board of Directors takes into account the relevant provisions of PhosAgro's dividend policy whereby the amount of distributed dividends may range from 50 to over 75% (subject to PhosAgro's leverage ratio) of PhosAgro's consolidated free cash flow for the respective year under IFRS. At the same time, the amount of declared dividends should not be lower than 50% of adjusted net profit for the year under IFRS.\n\nIn light of the above-mentioned drain on liquidity and in accordance with PhosAgro's dividend policy, a decision was taken not to include the issue of profit distribution for 2023 on the agenda for the Board of Directors meeting where the Company's annual financial statements are to be discussed. This issue is expected to be included on the agenda for the Board of Directors meeting that will discuss the Company's 1Q 2024 performance. .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe full text of the Company's Dividend Policy is available on the Company's website\n\nt",

In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including, among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, if any, both individually and in aggregate on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\nOverall Group materiality\n\nRUB 5,730 million (2022: RUB 11,615 million)\n\nHow we determined it\n\n5% of profit before tax\n\nRationale for the materiality benchmark applied\n\nWe chose profit before tax as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most commonly measured by users, and is a generally accepted benchmark. We chose 5% which is consistent with quantitative materiality thresholds used for profit- oriented companies in this sector.\n\n## How we tailored our Group audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.\n\nWe selected components based on the assessment of risk of material misstatement of the Group's consolidated financial statements associated with components, taking into account a relative significance of the components for the Group. The Group auditor performed further audit procedures for the selected components on their entire financial information not engaging the component auditors. We also included information systems and tax specialists in our engagement team.\n\nBy performing the above audit procedures at the components, combined with the centralized audit procedures and audit procedures with respect to the process of preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we have obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the consolidated financial statements of the Group as a whole.\n\n## Other information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Integrated annual report of PJSC 'PhosAgro' for 2023 (but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, and the Securities issuer's report for the 12 months 2023, which is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nWhen we read the Securities issuer's report for the 12 months 2023, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management;\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u00b7 plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\n4",

PJSC 'PhosAgro' and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 'Group') comprise Russian legal entities. The Company was registered in October 2001. The Company's address is Leninsky prospekt 55/1 building 1, Moscow, Russian Federation, 119333.\n\nThe Group's principal activity is production of apatite concentrate and mineral fertilisers at plants located in the cities of Kirovsk (Murmansk region), Cherepovets (Vologda region), Balakovo (Saratov region) and Volkhov (Leningrad region), and their distribution across the Russian Federation and abroad.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 and at 31 December 2022, the Company's major shareholder is the entity registered  in  Russia  -  ILLC Adorabella  holding  approximately  23.3%  of  the  ordinary  shares.  As  of 31 December 2023, and 31 December 2022, the Parent does not have the ultimate controlling party in accordance with the definitions of control described in IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements .\n\n## (b) Russian business environment\n\nThe Group's operations are primarily located in the Russian Federation. Consequently, the Group is exposed to the economic and financial conditions of the Russian Federation, which display certain characteristics of an emerging market. Its economy is particularly sensitive to oil and gas prices. The legal, tax and regulatory frameworks continue development, and  are subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes (note 29). The Russian economy continues to be negatively impacted by ongoing political tension in the region and international sanctions against certain Russian companies and individuals.\n\nGeopolitical tension caused by the Ukrainian case in February 2022 continued in 2023. Geopolitical situation escalation resulted in significant exchange rates fluctuations and increased volatility in financial and commodity markets. Sanctions and restrictions have been and continue to be imposed towards a number of Russian entities such as access termination to European and USA financial markets, SWIFT international system and others. Price cap on Russian oil and gas and embargo on Russian petrochemicals were introduced. There is no way to determine how long the increased volatility will continue and when the above factors will stabilise. The future effects of current economic situation and the above measures are difficult to predict. Management's current expectations and estimates could differ from actual results.\n\nThe Russian Government Resolution that came into effect starting from 2023 introduced export duties on mineral fertilisers followed by the subsequent changes to the customs duty calculation method and rates:\n\n- 1) From 1 January to 31 August 2023, the rate stood at 23.5% and was applied to a difference between the customs value of exported products and USD 450 per tonne.\n- 2) From 1 September to 30 September 2023, the customs duty rate for nitrogen-based fertilisers was 7% of their customs value, but not less than RUB 1,100 per tonne; the rate for phosphate-based and compound fertilisers stood at 7% of their customs value, but not less than RUB 2,100 per tonne.\n- 3) From 1 October 2023 to 31 December 2024, the following customs duty rates depending on the official exchange rate of US dollar to Russian Rouble set by the Central Bank of Russia are applied:\n- -on nitrogen-based fertilisers -7%  of  their customs  value,  but  not  less  than RUB 1,100 per tonne, if the average US dollar exchange rate over the monitoring month is below RUB 80, or 10% of their customs value, but not less than RUB 1,100 per tonne, if the average US dollar exchange rate over the monitoring month is above RUB 80;\n- -on phosphate-based and compound fertilisers - 7% of their customs value, but not less than RUB 2,100 per tonne, if the average US dollar exchange rate over the monitoring month is below RUB 80, or 10% of their customs value, but not less than RUB 2,100 per tonne, if the average US dollar exchange rate over the monitoring month is above RUB 80.\n\nOn 4 August 2023, the President of the Russian Federation signed Federal Law No. 414-FZ On Excess Profits Tax (the so-called 'Windfall Tax') effective from 1 January 2024. The law introduces 10% tax rate applied to the excess of the arithmetic average profits for 2021-2022 over the arithmetic average profits for 2018-2019. The amount of tax can be reduced by half to the effective rate of 5% provided that the taxpayer pays a security payment to the federal budget from 1 October to 30 November 2023. The Group's windfall tax liability and expense calculated at 5% tax rate is RUB 6,355 million. In November 2023, the Group made a security payment for the windfall tax presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nManagement  of  the  Group  has  considered  events  and  conditions  that  could  give  rise  to  material uncertainties and concluded that the range of possible outcomes does not cast significant doubt over the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2",

In March 2022, the Group lost control over its 100% foreign subsidiary Phosint Limited (currently PUREFERT LIMITED) owning all the foreign companies of the Group. Until the loss of control, the Group included entities with US dollar, Euro and other currencies as a functional currency.\n\n## (d) Presentation currency\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in RUB.  All financial information  presented in RUB has been rounded to the nearest million, except per share amounts.\n\nIn 2022, until the loss of control over Phosint Limited, profit and loss items of foreign subsidiaries were translated from USD and EUR into RUB at the following average exchange rates for the appropriate month:\n\n|                                     | 2022         | 2022         |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Average exchange rate for the month | RUB to USD 1 | RUB to EUR 1 |\n| January                             | 75.8837      | 85.9393      |\n| February                            | 77.4048      | 87.7638      |\n| March                               | 104.0810     | 114.7127     |\n\n## (e) Use of estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS Accounting  Standards requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n\nInformation about critical assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes:\n\n- \u00b7 Note 3 (b) (iii) - estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment;\n- \u00b7 Note 15 - recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable income for offsetting with appropriate tax losses.\n\n## (f) Adoption of new and revised standards and interpretations\n\nThe following revised standards,  issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)  and approved for use on the territory of Russian Federation, became effective from January 1, 2023, but didn't have a material impact on the Group unless otherwise specified.\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued on 18 May 2017 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, the effective date subsequently modified to 1 January 2023.\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 17 and an amendment to IFRS 4 (issued on 25 June 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023).\n\n6\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting policies (issued on 12 February 2021 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023). The Group revised its approach to significant accounting policies disclosure in accordance with amendments to the requirements as set out in note 3.\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued on 12 February 2021 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023).\n- \u00b7 Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction - Amendments to IAS 12 (issued on 7 May 2021 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023).\n\nThe following amendments, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), were not approved for application in Russian Federation and didn't have a material impact on the Group:\n\nInternational Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules - Narrow-scope amendments to IAS 12 (issued on 23 May 2023 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023).\n\n## (g) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nA number of new standards and interpretations have been issued that are mandatory for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 and which the Group has not early adopted, but is in process of assessing the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current - Amendments to IAS 1 (issued on 23 January 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, the effective date subsequently modified to 1 January 2024).\n- \u00b7 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current, deferral of effective date - Amendments to IAS 1 (issued on 15 July 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, the effective date subsequently modified to 1 January 2024).\n- \u00b7 Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback Amendments to IFRS 16 - Amendments to IFRS 16 (issued on 22 September 2022 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024).\n- \u00b7 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - Amendments to IAS 1 (issued on 31 October 2022 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024).\n- \u00b7 Supplier Finance Arrangements - amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 (issued on 25 May 2023 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024).\n- \u00b7 Lack of exchangeability - Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (issued on 15 August 2023 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025).\n- \u00b7 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its associate or joint venture - Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (issued on 11 September 2014 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after a date to be determined by the IASB).\n- \u00b7 IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (issued on 9 April 2024 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027).\n\n## 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (a) Foreign currencies\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses that  relate to loans and borrowings  as well as cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income within the line item 'Foreign exchange loss/gain from financing activities, net'.

        "page_content": "## 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n\n## (b) Property, plant and equipment\n\n## (i) Initial recognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  at  the  date  of  transition  to  IFRS  Accounting  Standards (January 1, 2005) was determined by reference to its fair value at that date ('deemed cost') as determined by an independent appraiser.\n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.\n\n## (ii) Subsequent expenditure\n\nExpenses related to current repairs and maintenance of property, plant and equipment are recognised within profit or loss and other comprehensive income as incurred.\n\nThe Group recognises  expenses  related to current repairs  and  maintenance  of property, plant and equipment incurred less than once per 12 months with the cost of more than RUB 100 thousand as assets, and depreciates these assets on a straight-line basis until the next repair.\n\nExpenses related to the replacement of major spare parts and renewal of property, plant and equipment are capitalised and depreciated in the ordinary course.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (iii) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is charged to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the individual  assets.  Depreciation  commences  on  the  month  of  acquisition  or,  in  respect  of  internally constructed assets, from the month when an asset is completed and ready for use. Land is not depreciated.\n\nTangible fixed assets are depreciated over the following useful lives:\n\nBuildings\n\n10 to 60 years;\n\nPlant and equipment\n\n5 to 35 years;\n\nFixtures and fittings\n\n2 to 25 years.\n\n## (iv) Capitalisation of borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets that necessarily take a substantial time to get ready for intended use or sale (qualifying assets) are capitalised as part of the costs of those assets.\n\nCapitalisation of borrowing costs continues up to the date when the assets are substantially ready for their use or sale.\n\nThe Group capitalises borrowing costs that could have been avoided if it had not made capital expenditure on qualifying assets. Borrowing costs capitalised are calculated at the Group's average funding cost (the weighted average interest cost is applied), except to the extent that funds are borrowed specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. Where this occurs, actual borrowing costs are capitalised.\n\nBorrowing costs capitalised are presented as part of cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## (v) Advances issued for property, plant and equipment\n\nA prepayment is classified as non-current when the goods or services relating to the prepayment are expected to be obtained after one year, or when the prepayment relates to an asset which will itself be classified as non-current upon initial recognition.\n\n8\n\n## 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n\n## (c) Financial instruments\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, long-term accounts receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nThe Group's financial assets measured at amortised cost include trade and other receivables (excluding receivables measured at fair value under provisionally priced sales agreements), long-term receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and loans issued.\n\nThe  Group's financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss include receivables under provisional pricing agreements and investments in equity instruments.\n\nThe Group's financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, trade and other payables, dividends payable.\n\n## (d) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank deposits held for longer than three months that are repayable on demand within several working days without penalties or that can be redeemed/withdrawn, subject to the interest income forfeited, are classified as cash equivalents if the deposits are held to meet short-term cash needs and there is no significant risk of a change in value as a result of an early withdrawal.\n\n## (e) Inventories\n\nIn the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\nThe cost of inventory (finished goods and goods for resale) for distribution companies is determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The cost of inventories for production companies is based on the weighted average principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.\n\nSpare parts to be used for construction and in repairs capitalised are classified as non-current assets and are included in line item 'Non-current spare parts'.\n\nCatalysts to be used in production during the period of more than 1 year are classified as part of non-current assets and written-off to the production cost based on the volume of goods produced. Catalysts to be used in production within 1 year are classified as part of inventories.\n\n## (f) Impairment\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortised cost. The Group estimates loss allowances either based on ECLs that result from default events possible within 12 months after the reporting date or based on lifetime ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nThe Group estimates loss allowance for trade receivables using the simplified approach in the amount equal to the lifetime ECL of the financial instrument. To calculate expected credit losses, the Group segments counterparties based on their geographic location and considers their credit rating, adjusted for current  and  future  factors  specific  to  the  debtors,  historical  credit  loss  experience  and  economic environment in which they operate.\n\n9\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\ne\n\nt\n\nn\n\nI",

In assessing ECL and credit risk, the Group considers quantitative and qualitative information and performs an analysis that is based on the Group's actual credit loss experience and considers forward-looking information. A significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past due.\n\nIf credit risk has increased significantly since the initial recognition or there is evidence that a financial asset is impaired, the expected credit losses for that asset are measured based on the lifetime ECLs. If the fair value of an impaired financial asset subsequently increases and such increase can be objectively attributed to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss for the period, the amount written off as a loss is reversed and the reversed amount is recognised in profit or loss for the period.\n\n## (g) Leases\n\n## As a lessee\n\nThe Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and making certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed payments.\n\nThe Group separates lease cash flows into principal lease payments (financing activities) and interest lease payments (operating activities) in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nLease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is revalued when there is a change in future lease payments arising from adjusted interest rate, extension or termination option and other events.\n\nUnder IFRS 16, right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets .\n\nFor short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets the Group has opted to recognise a lease expense on a straight-line basis as permitted by IFRS 16. This expense is presented within cost of sales, administrative expenses and selling expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\n## (h) Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for  each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets, if any, is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations. The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised immediately as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. To the extent the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\nAll actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (ii) Long-term service benefits other than pensions\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations. All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.\n\n10\n\n## 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (iii) Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Group makes mandatory contributions to the Social Fund of Russian Federation (until January 1, 2023 - Russia's State pension fund). These amounts are written off as expenses in the period when the Group's employees provided services related to these accruals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (i) Income tax\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws in force or put into force by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n## (j) Windfall tax\n\nWindfall tax is within the scope of IAS 12 Income taxes, it is recognised as a current income tax and is subject to respective income tax accounting policy.\n\nWindfall tax is a one-off tax. Windfall tax liability and expenses are recognised in the consolidated financial statements starting from the moment when the Federal Law has been substantively enacted.\n\nWindfall tax liability and expenses are measured at the amount calculated using the tax rates considering security payment made.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of financial position, the security payment was reflected together with the with the windfall tax liability until the entity had a legally enforceable right of offset, which would arise from 1 January 2024.\n\n## (k) Revenues\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to a customer. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services, taking into account any trade, volume and other discounts.\n\nThe selling price for goods or services can be fixed or provisionally priced, with subsequent determination of the final price within the period established by the contract (provisionally priced contracts). Revenue under  such  contracts  is  initially  recognised  at  a  predetermined  price.  Accounts  receivable  under provisionally priced contracts are measured at fair value through profit or loss with appropriate adjustments recorded in revenue until the final price is determined.\n\nAdvances received before the control passes to a customer are recognised as the contract liabilities. The amount of consideration does not contain a significant financial component as payment terms for the majority of contracts  are less than one year. No information is provided about remaining performance obligations as at the reporting date that have an original expected duration of one year or less, as allowed by IFRS 15.\n\nContracts with customers for the supply of goods use a variety of delivery terms. The Group determined that under the terms of the certain contracts for the supply of goods the Group undertakes to provide delivery and the related delivery services after the transfer of control over the goods to the buyer at the loading port. Under IFRS 15, these services are a separate performance obligation, which revenue must be recognised during the period of delivery as revenue from logistics activities. The Group recognises revenue from these logistics services at the time of delivery, due to the fact that the potential difference is calculated and recognised as insignificant.\n\nGroup's  revenue  include  the  proceeds  from  transportation  services.  Costs  related  to  rendering  of transportation services are mainly represented by logistics costs and included in cost of Group products sold.\n\n11\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\ne\n\nt\n\nn\n\nI",

The Group does not classify these expenses according to their function in the line items of cost of sales, administrative and selling expenses. According to the Group's management opinion the presentation in a separate line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, transparently and fully presents information about taxes, other than income tax impact on the financial results of the Group.\n\n## (n) Finance income and finance costs\n\nFinance income comprises interest income, dividend income, unwinding of discount on financial assets and share of profit of associates and foreign exchange  gains  on financing activities. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Group's right to receive payment is established.\n\nFinance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest expense on lease liabilities, bank fees, interest expense on defined benefit obligations, securitisation fees, increase in credit loss  for financial investments, share of loss of associates and foreign exchange losses on financing activities.\n\nForeign currency gains and losses, arising from operations with foreign currency and share of profit and losses of associates are reported on a net basis.\n\n## (o) Overburden removal expenditure\n\nIn open pit apatite rock mining operations, it is necessary to remove the overburden and other waste in order to access the economically recoverable resources.\n\nAccording to the Group's approach to stripping, the ore, which becomes accessible after the overburden removal, is extracted within no more than four months. Therefore, the stripping ratio (volume of overburden removed over the volume of resources extracted) is expected to stay relatively constant over the future periods and stripping costs incurred during the production phase of the open pit mine are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## 4 FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION\n\nWhen  measuring  a  fair  value  of  an  asset  or  a  liability,  the  Group  uses  market  observable  data as far as possible.  Fair  values  are  categorised  into  different  levels  of  a  fair  value  hierarchy  based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 : quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Level 2 : inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);\n- \u00b7 Level 3 : inputs for the asset and liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\nIf inputs used to measure a fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised into different levels of fair value hierarchy, then fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.\n\nThe Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.\n\nFair values have been determined for measurement and / or disclosure purposes based on the methods described below. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.\n\n12\n\n## 4 FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION (CONTINUED)\n\n## (a) Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nThe fair value of financial assets and liabilities represented by short-term loans issued, trade and other receivables (except for receivables measured at fair value under provisional pricing agreements), cash and cash  equivalents,  trade  and  other  payables  is  categorised  into  level  3  of  fair  value  hierarchy  and approximate their carrying amounts at the reporting date.\n\nBonds' fair value is measured based on quoted market prices for disclosure purposes and categorised into level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Loans  and  borrowings  and non-current receivables  fair value is categorised into level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## (b) Financial instruments measured at fair value\n\nThe  fair  value  of  investments  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  and  receivables  under provisionally priced sales agreements measured at fair value through profit or loss is determined using the valuation techniques and categorised into level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nInvestments  value  measured at fair value through profit or loss is estimated based on the model  of discounted cash flows from the investee's operating activities.\n\nReceivables fair value under provisionally priced sales agreements is calculated based on mineral fertiliser market prices expected at the date when the price is finalised. These assumptions are based on consensus prices forecasts prepared by independent analytical agencies, adjusted in accordance with price calculation formulas specified in existing delivery contracts.\n\n## 5 REVENUES\n\n| RUB million                                 | 2023    | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Phosphate-based and nitrogen-based products | 421,690 | 551,037 |\n| Other                                       | 18,614  | 18,490  |\n| Revenues                                    | 440,304 | 569,527 |\n\n## 6 COST OF GROUP PRODUCTS SOLD\n\n| RUB million                                                | 2023      | 2022      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Production expense for Group goods sold                    | (197,783) | (222,360) |\n| Depreciation                                               | (29,374)  | (26,979)  |\n| Salaries and social contributions                          | (26,265)  | (19,667)  |\n| Potash                                                     | (22,444)  | (27,418)  |\n| Materials and services                                     | (22,158)  | (19,997)  |\n| Repair and maintenance expenses                            | (15,865)  | (12,002)  |\n| Natural gas                                                | (15,033)  | (14,226)  |\n| Transportation of phosphate rock                           | (13,468)  | (11,610)  |\n| Ammonia                                                    | (11,533)  | (19,550)  |\n| Sulphur and sulphuric acid                                 | (11,507)  | (40,798)  |\n| Electricity                                                | (7,317)   | (6,754)   |\n| Fuel                                                       | (5,754)   | (6,459)   |\n| Feedstock processing services                              | (4,341)   | -         |\n| Anti-clodding agent                                        | (3,785)   | (4,597)   |\n| Drilling and blasting operations expenses                  | (3,101)   | (3,217)   |\n| Reagents                                                   | (3,020)   | (2,755)   |\n| Ammonium sulphate                                          | (2,818)   | (6,331)   |\n| Logistics expenses for Group goods sold                    | (37,777)  | (31,059)  |\n| Russian Railways infrastructure tariff and operators' fees | (14,047)  | (12,647)  |\n| Customs duties                                             | (13,207)  | (1,420)   |\n| Freight, port and stevedoring expenses                     | (9,924)   | (16,382)  |\n| Other services and materials                               | (599)     | (610)     |\n| Cost of Group products sold                                | (235,560) | (253,419) |\n\n13\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\ne\n\nt\n\nn\n\nI",

Due to the Russian tax legislation, starting from 1 January 2017, tax losses accumulated as at 31 December 2023 can be carried forward without limitation on utilisation period.\n\nManagement has developed a tax strategy to utilise the above tax losses. In assessing the tax losses recoverability, management considers a future Group's taxable profits forecast and the Group's tax position to ensure whether it is probable that the relevant taxable profit will be available taking into account the Group's available restructuring arrangements to deferred tax utilization. In addition, management expects to utilise a part of tax losses in 2024 through the taxable income from the repayment of short-term part of receivable recognised as a result of Phosint Group disposal (note 17).\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, no deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences of RUB 88,627 million associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries  has  been  recognised  (31  December  2022:  for  taxable temporary differences of RUB 113,212 1 million), either because the Parent can control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future, or because the applicable  income  tax rate  for intragroup dividends  is expected to be 0%.\n\n1 In 2023, the Group changed the approach to taxable temporary differences calculation. The Group adjusted the amount of taxable temporary differences as at 31 December 2022 to ensure information comparability in the consolidated financial statements for 2023.\n\n18\n\n## 15 DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)\n\n## (b) Movement in temporary differences during the year\n\n| RUB million                    | 31 December  2023   | Recognised  in profit or  loss   | Recognised  in other  comprehensi ve income   | Disposal of  foreign  subsidiaries   | 1 January  2023   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment, |                     |                                  |                                               |                                      |                   |\n| right-of-use assets and        |                     |                                  |                                               |                                      |                   |\n| intangible assets              | (18,229)            | (2,347)                          | -

As a result of negative economic situation, significant market disruptions to broker cross-border operations led to his liquidity problems and inability to repurchase securities back from the Group. As a result, the Group loan issued under this transaction was fully impaired and loss of RUB 4,124 million was recognised as a part of finance costs.\n\n20\n\n## 18 INVENTORIES\n\n| RUB million                                                                      | 31 December   2023   | 31 December   2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Raw materials and spare parts                                                    | 23,767               | 15,109               |\n| Finished goods:                                                                  |                      |                      |\n| Chemical fertilisers                                                             | 12,641               | 10,388               |\n| Apatite concentrate                                                              | 698                  | 801                  |\n| Other products                                                                   | 1,066                | 1,379                |\n| Work-in-progress:                                                                |                      |                      |\n| Chemical fertilisers and other products                                          | 8,250                | 5,685                |\n| Chemical fertilisers and other products for resale, purchased from third parties | 1,965                | 5,941                |\n| Other goods                                                                      | 177                  | 148                  |\n| Allowance for inventory write-down                                               | (96)                 | (102)                |\n| Total inventories                                                                | 48,468               | 39,349               |\n\n## 19 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES\n\n| RUB million                                                          | 31 December   2023   | 31 December   2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Financial assets                                                     |                      |                      |\n| Trade accounts receivable                                            | 51,403               | 61,997               |\n| Other receivables                                                    | 430                  | 1,479                |\n| Credit losses allowance                                              | (474)                | (482)                |\n| Non-financial assets                                                 |                      |                      |\n| Advances issued                                                      | 9,958                | 8,634                |\n| Advances issued on custom duties                                     | 4,816                | 3,901                |\n| Deferred expenses                                                    | 204                  | 202                  |\n| Receivables from employees                                           | 40                   | 20                   |\n| Provision for doubtful accounts and expected credit losses allowance | (15)                 | (10)                 |\n| Total trade and other receivables                                    | 66,362               | 75,741               |\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group performed revaluation of receivables under provisionally priced sales agreements measured at fair value through profit or loss and recognised an adjustment within revenue.\n\nThe following information shows the movement of the Group's receivables under provisionally priced sales agreements:\n\n| RUB million                                      | 2023            |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Balance at 1 January                             | 2,711           |\n| Receivables recognised                           | 90,813          |\n| Receivables redeemed  Foreign exchange gain, net | (62,097)  2,233 |\n| Loss from revaluation at fair value (unrealised) | (74)            |\n| Balance at                                       | 33,586          |\n| 31 December                                      |                 |\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, a 5% increase/(decrease) in forecasted market prices, with all other variables held constant, will lead to increase/(decrease) fair value of the Group's receivables under provisionally priced sales agreements by RUB 1,493 million.\n\n21\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\ne\n\nt\n\nn\n\nI",

All issued ordinary shares are fully paid. Each ordinary share carries one vote.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the number of ordinary shares authorised for additional issue is 994,977,080, with a par value of RUB 2.5 per share.\n\n## (b) Dividend policy\n\nThe Group's dividend policy is based on the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 striking an effective and reasonable balance between the payment of dividends and reinvestment of profit in further development;\n- \u00b7 ensuring transparency and predictability of dividend payments as a way to boost the Company's investment case.\n\n22\n\n## 21 EQUITY (CONTINUED)\n\nAmount  of  such  payment  is  subject  to  approval  of  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting,  based  on recommendations provided by the PhosAgro Board of Directors. The Board of Directors' recommendations depend on such factors as the Company's earnings for the reporting period and its financial position. To calculate  the  amount  of  dividend  payments,  the  Board  of  Directors  considers  the  Company's consolidated free cash flow for the reporting period (quarter, six months, first nine months or year) under IFRS Accounting Standards. Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities based on the consolidated statement of cash flows. A decision on the payment of an interim dividend is made at the General Shareholders' Meeting within three months of the end of the relevant reporting period. The payment period for dividends payable to a nominal holder or a trustee, which is a professional participant of the securities market, who are registered in the share register, shall be not more than 10 business days. The payment period for dividends payable to other parties registered in the shareholders register shall not exceed 25 business days after the date on which the parties entitled to receive dividends are determined. Holders of PhosAgro GDRs are also entitled to receive dividends in respect of the underlying shares, subject to the terms of their Depositary Agreements.  In accordance with the dividend policy, the Board of Directors shall seek to make sure that the amount of distributed dividends ranges from 50% to over 75% (subject to the Company's leverage ratio) of the Company's consolidated free cash flow for the respective period under IFRS Accounting Standards. At the same time, the amount of declared dividends shall not be lower than 50% of net profit for the relevant period under IFRS Accounting Standards adjusted by the amount of unrealised exchange rate difference.\n\n## (c) Dividends\n\nIn accordance with Russian legislation the Company's distributable reserves are limited to the balance of accumulated retained earnings as recorded in the Company's financial statements prepared in accordance with Russian Accounting Standards. As at 31 December  2023, the Company had cumulative retained earnings of RUB 38,397 million (31 December 2022: RUB 69,540 million).\n\n| Proposed  by the Board of Directors in   | Approved  by shareholders in   | Amount per  share  RUB   | Amount of  dividends  RUB million   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| March 2023                               | March 2023                     | 465                      | 60,217.5                            |\n| May 2023                                 | June 2023                      | 264                      | 34,188.0                            |\n| November 2023                            | December 2023                  | 291                      | 37,684.5                            |\n| Total                                    |                                |                          | 132,090.0                           |\n\n| Proposed  by the Board of Directors in   | Approved  by shareholders in   | Amount per  share  RUB   | Amount of  dividends  RUB million   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| August 2022                              | September 2022                 | 780                      | 101,010.0                           |\n| November 2022                            | December 2022                  | 318                      | 41,181.0                            |\n| Total                                    |                                |                          | 142,191.0                           |\n\n## 22 EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nBasic  earnings  per share are  calculated based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.  Risk  management  policies  and  systems  are  reviewed  regularly  to  reflect  changes  in  market conditions and the Group's activities.\n\n## (b) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market conditions, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's profit or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\n\n## (c) Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currency of Group entities. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily USD, CNY and EUR.\n\nIn respect of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.\n\nThe Group implemented a natural hedge approach (policy) aiming at reducing its exposure to foreign currency risk by means of borrowing in the same currencies in which the Group's sales agreements are denominated.\n\n27\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\ne\n\nt\n\nn\n\nI",

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2022.\n\nThe net foreign exchange loss recognised in profit or loss of RUB 17,964 million (net foreign exchange gain of RUB 2,417 million for the comparative period) resulted from Russian rouble depreciation against major currencies during the reporting period (Russian rouble appreciation against major currencies during the comparative period).\n\n## (d) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely impact the financial results of the Group. Management does not have a formal policy of determining how much of the Group's exposure should be to fixed or variable rates. However, at the time of raising new loans or borrowings management uses its judgment to decide whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favourable to the Group over the expected period until maturity.\n\nThe interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments at their carrying values is as follows:\n\n| RUB million                              | 31 December 2023   | 31 December 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Fixed rate instruments                   |                    |                    |\n| Call deposits and other financial assets | 20,208             | 6,063              |\n| Other non-current assets                 | 74                 | 107                |\n| Long-term borrowings                     | (132,309)          | (107,781)          |\n| Short-term borrowings                    | (75,107)           | (74,749)           |\n| Lease liabilities                        | (4,231)            | (2,936)            |\n| Total fixed rate instruments             | (191,365)          | (179,296)          |\n| Variable rate instruments                |                    |                    |\n| Long-term borrowings                     | (29,762)           | (2,223)            |\n| Short-term borrowings                    | (11,322)           | (6,225)            |\n| Total variable rate instruments          | (41,084)           | (8,448)            |\n\nSensitivity analysis for financial instruments with variable interest rates\n\nAt 31 December 2023, 2 percentage points increase/(decrease) in interest rate, with all other variables held constant, would have decreased/(increased) the Group's profit for the year and equity by RUB 822 million (31 December 2022: RUB 169 million).\n\n28\n\n## 27 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (e) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer and supplier or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises from the Group's receivables from customers, current and non-current financial assets and cash and cash equivalents.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount  of  its  financial  assets  and  amounted  to  RUB  92,842  million  (31  December  2022: RUB 85,116 million).  As  at  31  December  2023,  95%  of  the  Group's  trade  receivables  balance  are represented by one counterparty (31 December 2022: 98%).\n\nAs  at  31  December  2023,  the  Group's  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost  amounted  to RUB 59,245 million (31 December 2022: RUB 84,563 million).\n\nAs at 31 December 2023,  the Group's  financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss amounted to RUB 33,597 million (31 December 2022: RUB 553 million).\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual specific characteristics of each customer. The general characteristics of the Group's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which customers operate, have less of an influence on credit risk.\n\nManagement has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group's review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum amount of outstanding receivables; these limits are reviewed quarterly. Customers that fail to meet the Group's benchmarks of creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.\n\nThe majority of the Group's customers have been transacting with the Group for several years, and losses have occurred infrequently. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics. Trade and other receivables relate mainly to the Group's wholesale customers.\n\nThe Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables, except for new customers who are required to work on a prepayment basis or present an acceptable bank guarantee or set up letter of credit with an acceptable bank.\n\nThe Group establishes an allowance for expected credit losses that represents its estimate of the expected credit losses in respect of trade and other receivables and other financial assets. The Group estimates the allowance for expected credit losses for trade receivables in the amount equal to lifetime expected loss allowance  of  the financial instrument.  In the terms of calculating the expected credit loss, the Group considers the credit rating of counterparties, adjusted with forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and economic environment in which they operate, and historical credit loss experience.\n\nExposures within each credit risk grade are segmented by geographic region classification and an ECL rate is calculated for each segment based on delinquency status and actual credit loss experience over the past years.\n\nThe allowance for expected credit losses on accounts receivable has been accrued in accordance with the risk matrix presented in the table below:\n\n51,359\n\n| RUB million           | 31 December 2023   | 31 December 2023     | 31 December 2023       | 31 December 2023       | 31 December 2023    | 31 December 2023   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n|                       | Not past due       | Past due   0-90 days | Past due   91-180 days | Past due  181-365 days | More than  one year | Total              |\n| Loss rate             | 0.1-6%             | 0.1-10%              | 8.62%                  | 10.53%                 | 100%                |                    |\n| Gross carrying amount | 50,148             | 1,338                | 58                     | 57                     | 232                 | 51,833             |\n| Lifetime ECL          | (165)              | (66)                 | (5)                    | (6)                    | (232)               | (474)              |\n| Net carrying value    | 49,983             | 1,272                | 53                     | 51                     | -                   |                    |\n\n29\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\ne\n\nt\n\nn\n\nI",

Based on the prior experience, management believes that there is no significant credit risk in respect of related party and third party loans.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are primarily held with large banks with high credit rating and minimal risk of default, which provides high-level credit risk limits. All bank account balances and term deposits are not overdue or impaired.\n\n## (f) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nTypically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 30 days, including the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. In addition, the Group maintains several lines of credit in various Russian and international banks.\n\nThe table below illustrates the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments, which are converted at the closing exchange rates, where applicable. The amounts disclosed in the maturity table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows:\n\n|                          | 31 December 2023   | 31 December 2023        | 31 December 2023   | 31 December 2023   | 31 December 2023   | 31 December 2023   | 31 December 2023   | 31 December 2023   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| RUB million              | Carrying  value    | Contractual  cash flows | 0-1 year           | 1-2 yrs            | 2-3 yrs            | 3-4 yrs            | 4-5 yrs            | Over  5 yrs        |\n| Loans and borrowings     | 248,500            | 267,696                 | 94,081             | 59,358             | 64,308             | 3,939              | 46,010             | -                  |\n| Lease liabilities        | 4,231              | 5,823                   | 1,770              | 1,003              | 758                | 522                | 355                | 1,415              |\n| Dividends payable        | 54,919             | 54,919                  | 54,919             | -                  | -                  | -                  | -                  | -                  |\n| Trade and other payables | 23,000             | 23,000                  | 23,000             | -                  | -                  | -                  | -                  | -                  |\n| Total                    | 330,650            | 351,438                 | 173,770            | 60,361             | 65,066             | 4,461              | 46,365             | 1,415              |\n\n|                          | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022                  | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| RUB million              | Carrying  value    | Contractual  cash flows  0-1 year |                    | 1-2 yrs            | 2-3 yrs            | 3-4 yrs            | 4-5 yrs            | Over  5 yrs        |\n| Loans and borrowings     | 190,978            | 202,313                           | 84,567             | 26,025             | 40,747             | 11,829             | 3,060              | 36,085             |\n| Lease liabilities        | 2,936              | 3,487                             | 1,488              | 1,026              | 515                | 312                | 113                | 33                 |\n| Dividends payable        | 82                 | 82                                | 82                 | -                  | -                  | -                  | -                  | -                  |\n| Trade and other payables | 16,789             | 16,789                            | 16,789             | -                  | -                  | -                  | -                  | -                  |\n| Total                    | 210,785            | 222,671                           | 102,926            | 27,051             | 41,262             | 12,141             | 3,173              | 36,118             |\n\n30\n\n## 27 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\n\n## (g) Capital management\n\nThe Group's Board of Directors pursues a policy aimed at maintaining high capital levels to keep investor, lender  and market confidence and to  provide  future  sustainable  business  development. The Board of Directors keeps under control the return on invested capital and dividends paid to shareholders. To maintain and adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust periods of dividend payment to shareholders, revise its investment programme and obtain new or repay existing loans and borrowings. There were no changes in the Board's approach to capital management during the year.\n\nThe Group defines capital under management as the amount in 'Equity attributable to shareholders of the Company' line item in the consolidated statement of financial position. As  at 31  December 2023,  the Group's capital under  management  amounted  to  RUB  151,521  million  (31  December  2022: RUB 197,562 million).\n\nThe Group's management regularly analyses Net Debt / EBITDA ratio calculated by dividing the Group's total short-term and long-term loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents by EBITDA (operating profit adjusted for depreciation and amortisation). Some loan agreements cap this ratio at no more than 3.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries comply with  external  regulatory  requirements  for capital including requirements established by law and loan agreements.\n\n## 28 COMMITMENTS\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had contractual commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment  for  RUB  52,917  million  (31 December  2022:  RUB 35,181  million),  including  VAT  where applicable.\n\n## 29 CONTINGENCIES\n\n## (a) Litigation\n\nThe Group has a number of small claims and litigations relating to regular business activities and small fiscal claims. Management believes that none of these claims, individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse impact on the Group.\n\n## (b) Taxation contingencies\n\nRussian tax and customs legislation which was enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, is subject to varying interpretations when being applied to the transactions and activities of the Group. Consequently, tax positions taken by management and the formal documentation supporting the tax positions may be challenged tax authorities. Russian tax administration is gradually strengthening, including the fact that there is a higher risk of review of tax transactions without a clear business purpose or with tax incompliant counterparties. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year when decisions about the review was made. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.\n\nRussian transfer pricing (TP) legislation is generally aligned with the international TP principles developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), although it has specific features. The TP legislation provides for the possibility of additional tax assessment for controlled transactions (transactions  between  related  parties  and  certain  transactions  between  unrelated  parties)  if  such transactions are not on an arm's-length basis. The management has implemented internal controls to comply with current TP legislation.\n\nTax liabilities arising from controlled transactions are determined based on their actual transaction prices. It is possible, with the evolution of the interpretation of TP rules, that such prices could be challenged. The impact of any such challenge cannot be reliably estimated; however, it may be significant to the financial position and/or the Group's operations.\n\nAs Russian tax legislation does not provide definitive guidance in certain areas, the Group adopts, from time to time, interpretations of such uncertain areas that reduce the overall tax rate of the Group. While management currently estimates that the tax positions and interpretations that it has taken can probably be sustained, there is a possible risk that an outflow of resources will be required should such tax positions and interpretations be challenged by the tax authorities. The impact of any such challenge cannot be reliably estimated; however, it may be significant to the financial position and/or the overall operations of the Group.\n\n31\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\ne\n\nt\n\nn\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## 29 CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)\n\n## (c) Environmental contingencies\n\nThe enforcement of environmental regulation in the Russian Federation is evolving and the enforcement posture of government authorities is continually being reconsidered.\n\nThe Group is involved in chemical production, which is inherently exposed to significant environmental risks. The Group companies record environmental obligations as they become probable and reliably measurable. The Group companies are parties to different litigations with the Russian environmental authorities. The management believes that based on its interpretations of applicable Russian legislation, official  pronouncements  and  court  decisions  no  provision  is  required  for  environmental  obligations. However, the interpretations of the relevant authorities could differ from management's position and the effect on these consolidated financial statements, if the authorities were successful in enforcing their interpretations, could be significant.\n\n## (d) Compliance with covenants\n\nThe Group is subject to certain covenants related primarily to its loans and borrowings. Non-compliance with such covenants may result in negative consequences for the Group including growth in the cost of borrowings and declaration of default. The payment obligations of the Group in respect of coupon payments for Eurobonds are fulfilled when the funds are transferred to the account of the paying agent.\n\nThe  Group  was  in  compliance  with  covenants  during  the  years  ended  31  December  2023  and 31 December 2022 and as of each reporting date.\n\n## 30 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nParties are generally considered to be related if the parties are under common control or if one party has the ability to control the other party or can exercise significant influence or joint control over the other party in making financial and operational decisions.  In considering each possible related party relationship, attention is directed to the substance of the relationship, not merely the legal form.

We permit this report to be disclosed in the Integrated Annual Report, which will be published on the Company's website 1 , to assist management in responding to its governance responsibilities by obtaining an independent auditor's limited assurance report in connection with the Selected Information. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the management of the Group for our work or this report except where the respective terms are expressly agreed between us in writing and our prior consent in writing is obtained.\n\n## Professional standards applied and level of assurance\n\nWe performed our limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information', issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.\n\n## Our independence and quality management\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour, and the ethical requirements of the Auditor's Professional Ethics Code and Auditor's Independence Rules that are relevant to our limited assurance engagement in respect of the Selected Information in the Russian Federation.\n\nOur firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Work done\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information. In doing so, we:\n\n- \u00b7 made enquiries of the Group's management, including the Group Sustainability Reporting (SR) team and those with responsibility for SR management and Group SR reporting;\n- \u00b7 conducted interviews of Group's personnel responsible for the preparation of the Integrated Annual Report and collection and analysis of underlying data;\n- \u00b7 performed analysis of the relevant internal methodology and guidelines (including the PhosAgro Methodology), gaining an understanding of the design of the key structures, systems, processes and controls for managing, recording, preparing and reporting the Selected Information;\n- \u00b7 performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected Information to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported; and\n- \u00b7 reviewed the Selected Information for compliance of the disclosures with the relevant requirements of the Reporting Criteria.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n2\n\n## Reporting and measurement techniques\n\nUnder the GRI Standards there is a range of different, but acceptable, reporting and measurement techniques. The techniques, together with the PhosAgro Methodology, can result in materially different reporting outcomes that may affect comparability with other organisations. The Selected Information should therefore be read in conjunction with the methodology used by management in preparing the Integrated Annual Report, described therein, and for which the Group is solely responsible.\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Information for the year ended 31 December 2023 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.\n\n## 27 April 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFegetsin Alexey Iakovlevich is authorised to sign on behalf of the General Director of Joint-Stock Company 'Technologies of Trust - Audit' (Principal Registration Number of the Record in the Register of Auditors and Audit Organizations (PRNR) - 12006020338), certified auditor (PRNR - 21906101957)\n\n3",

The Regulations include GRI-compliant data collection forms for the Report and establish\n\napproach to defining material topics based on double materiality. This approach relies on the review of the impact that social, economic, regulatory and governance and/or environmental factors or aspects have on the Company and vice versa.\n\nIn 2023, the Company added the following new sources of information to the materiality analysis process:\n\n## STEPS TO SELECT MATERIAL TOPICS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIdentifying the source of data for selecting material topics and assessing respective impacts\n\n- \u00b7 Review of material topics from the perspective of the corporate strategy, risks, opportunities and the Company's business model\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder surveys (within the Company)\n- \u00b7 Survey of investors' opinions on material topics\n- \u00b7 Analysis of global and local ESG ratings, rankings and standards\n- \u00b7 Review of material topics as per the SASB industry standard\n- \u00b7 Review of comments and suggestions from external experts, including RSPP\n- \u00b7 Reports on long-term trends and strategies issued by major analytical agencies, such as the Higher School of Economics, Skolkovo, McKinsey, the National ESG Alliance, etc.)\n- \u00b7 Analysis and prioritising of the UN SDGs\n- \u00b7 Survey of external stakeholders, including review of complaints and queries received via the PhosAgro hot line and e-mail\n\n## Short-listing material topics\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment of each topic's materiality:\n- -for the Company and its stakeholders (including investors);\n- -from the perspective of industry standards and ratings\n- \u00b7 Materiality assessment of negative and positive impacts and assessing the materiality of each impact in the value chain\n- \u00b7 Assessment of each topic's materiality on a scale from 0 to 3\n\nApproving the final list of material topics\n\n- \u00b7 Checking the selected topics for relevance to information users and against expert opinions\n- \u00b7 Selection of GRI topics rated above 1 (see Appendix 1)\n- \u00b7 Approving the final list of material topics by the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee\n\nfeedback and comments received during the RSPP public assurance process, as well as opinions of external experts on the quality of the Company's reports and its compliance with the best market practices, in particular, opinions of experts from Telegram channels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur strategy and risk experts analysed the list of topics, compared them against our strategic priorities and risk profile, and assessed their impact on PhosAgro's value chain. The impact of material aspects on our value chain from mine to plate was rated as high, medium or low.\n\n- For more information, see the Business Model section on page 15.\n\nOur strategy and risk experts analysed the list of topics, compared them against our strategic priorities and risk profile and assessed their impact on PhosAgro's value chain. The impact of material aspects on our value chain from mine to plate was rated as high, medium or low. When assessing the degree of impact on processes under our control such as product development and manufacturing, purchase and mining of mineral resources, logistics and sales, we took into account the scale of an actual and potential impact and the nature of the assessed topic with due regard to industry specifics. With the application of our products seen as an important stage in value creation, we assessed the effect of this element on the selection\n\nof material topics by analysing both the Company's impact on the end consumer and customer needs, expectations and requirements with regard to our products and practices.\n\nTo illustrate our approach to impact assessment, let us look at the GRI 404 Training and Education. For this topic, we rated the impact as high at every stage of the value chain due to an important role our highly qualified staff plays along the way from product development to sales. As regards the application stage, we assume that the customer gets a 2-in-1 product, including a fertilizer and our service expertise (training, agronomic advice and support). Employees are also directly interested in improving their professional qualifications as a means of facilitating their career development in the Company and obtaining a competitive edge in the labour market. Personal development tools help employees to harmoniously develop their skills in other areas of interest. Hence, relevant competencies and skills acquired, in particular, as part of the provided training are highly relevant.\n\n## KEY ASPECTS OF 2023 REPORTING THAT DESERVE A SPECIAL MENTION\n\n- 1. Material topics disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report are still relevant in 2023.\n- 2.  Our work to define material topics resulted in a materiality list based on the entire range of stakeholder interests and opinions related to the Company's disclosures.\n- 3.  45 GRI indicators underwent external independent audit by Technologies of Trust - Audit JSC providing limited assurance.\n\nNotably, we did not receive any communications from stakeholders via the hot line and email (esg@phosagro.ru and ir@phosagro.ru) in 2023.\n\n- For more information, see the GRI Content Index section on page 358.",
