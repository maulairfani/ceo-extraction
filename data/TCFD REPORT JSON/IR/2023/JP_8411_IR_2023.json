The earliest of its kind in Japan, over 150 years have passed since First National Bank was founded in 1873.\n\nWith the qualitative changes in globalism, a rapid increase in ESG awareness, the social change that accompanies technological advancements, and the acceleration of Japan's declining birthrate and aging society, we find ourselves in increasingly uncertain times. There is no solution to be found in carrying on as we have in the past. To pave the way to the future, Japan-together with the rest of the world-must rise to many challenges. Going forward, we will need to consistently create innovative solutions at an unprecedented pace while working together with people from all kinds of professional backgrounds.\n\nThe foresight and integrity of many of Japan's early industrialists and entrepreneurs, such as Eiichi Shibusawa and Zenjiro Yasuda, have left their mark on Mizuho's DNA. We have a legacy of striving for socioeconomic development. Fast-forwarding to the present day, we have the drive to keep one step ahead of change and create new value.\n\nIt is in this context that we defined Mizuho's corporate Purpose: 'Proactively innovate together with our clients for a prosperous and sustainable future.'\n\nThe Purpose means we align ourselves with each customer's efforts toward achieving their goals and aspirations, and when doing so we use our finance and consulting capabilities to contribute to making the world a better place. It means we work towards a sustainable future together with corporate clients that are pushing themselves to develop new technologies and businesses, through collaborations with other companies and through business and finance support. And it means that we connect all our people, and that each day we are innovating and improving through new perspectives and contributing to a brighter future.\n\nWe will challenge ourselves, while supporting the endeavors of our clients, to co-create a prosperous future.\n\nWith renewed determination, we put this Purpose into words.",

        "page_content": "## Message from the Group CEO\n\nProactively innovate together with our clients for a prosperous and sustainable future.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## What is the responsibility of a CEO?\n\nThe world is now in an era of major change. Geopolitical tensions and the reshaping of globalization are driving prolonged inflation and higher interest rates, causing instability in the economic environment. Disparity between high-net-worth and low-income individuals is becoming an increasingly serious social issue. Rapid evolution of technology, though opening new possibilities, is also giving rise to unknown risks. On the other hand, Japan's economy has finally escaped its long deflationary era, and Japanese companies are putting their resources towards investment and wage increases, creating a positive cycle of growth and distribution. With this as a backdrop, Japanese households are also increasingly showing an interest in shifting from saving to investment. In combination, these global and local changes constitute a significant turning point.\n\nIn this era of material change, financial institutions have an outsize role to play. My responsibility as the CEO of a financial institution is to envision the course Mizuho will follow during times of change and, in doing so, continue creating social value and enhancing corporate value for all of our stakeholders. Keeping this in mind, over the last year I have led three initiatives.\n\nThe first was to determine Mizuho's role and reason for being in the current era: our corporate Purpose. By defining our Purpose, we can share our goals and values with our stakeholders.\n\n- -   Purpose: 'Proactively innovate together with our clients for a prosperous and sustainable future.'\n\nTo facilitate innovation in times of change and make our own innovations at the same time. We felt this was central to our Purpose.\n\nThe second was to clarify our strategy for achieving our Purpose. How do we reach a prosperous and sustainable future? What are the strengths we can apply there, in light of our history and the corporate DNA we have carried forward from our founders, who were capitalists and entrepreneurs of early modern Japan? We identified our five business focus areas from these two perspectives.",

This will be a catalyst for innovation and enable us to achieve our Purpose.\n\nBy uniting our Purpose, strategy, and healthy corporate culture in a virtuous cycle, we will be able to fulfill our commitment to grow together with our stakeholders.\n\nFrom here, I will outline our progress and challenges on the five business focus areas that form the core of our strategy.\n\nAppendix",

Improving customer experience\n\nFor our retail customers in Japan, we have been continually improving the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of our Mizuho digital banking app as well as our Mizuho Wallet app, which consolidates payment functions. Most of our customers are now able to complete regular, repetitive transactions almost entirely online. We are also gradually converting our branches to be more comfortable and streamlined spaces suited to face-to-face consulting on asset management. To expand our remote services, which stand in between our online services and physical services, we are setting up an AI-assisted next-generation call center and are augmenting our systems to provide more useful advice to customers.\n\nGoing forward, we will further improve the UI and UX of our digital, branch, and call center services. We will seamlessly connect these three channels and incorporate digital marketing methods so that we can offer our customers the most convenient and trustworthy services. By\n\nconstantly improving our customer's experiences, we will enhance the attractiveness of our deposit accounts, which comprise our base for extending the credit required for economic growth.\n\n## 2. Asset and wealth management in Japan\n\nWe are keeping pace with the Japanese government's policy plan to promote Japan as a leading asset management center. We have accelerated our efforts to broaden our customer base in our asset management business by promoting the new Nippon Individual Savings Accounts, as well as enhancing our strategic alliances with Rakuten Securities, Inc. and PayPay Securities Corporation, aimed toward establishing integrated online and face-to-face services. Also, Mizuho Securities eliminated individual sales targets for employees in fiscal 2023 and is implementing a thorough transition to more customer-oriented business operations.\n\nGoing forward, we will tenaciously fortify our consulting capabilities and further elevate both our employees' business literacy and our customer-oriented business approach.

Enhancing the competitiveness of Japanese companies\n\nWe have been extending growth support for corporate clients in Japan, primarily middle-market firms struggling with issues such as stagnating corporate value or price-to-book ratios short of 1. Our support has enabled these clients to explore options and take actions such as business restructuring, delisting, and others. Also, we are increasingly being asked for advice about succession of family businesses and wealth, built up through many generations, to the next generation.\n\nGoing forward, we will bring together our consulting capabilities with the financial technology of Mizuho group companies, such as Mizuho Trust & Banking and Mizuho Securities, to further advance our provision of comprehensive solutions. At the same time, in order to sustainably grow together with our clients, we will optimally balance our corporate resources with consideration to regions and customer segments.\n\n## 4. Sustainability and innovation\n\nOn innovation, we are looking to take part in the creation and incubation of companies that will be\n\nable to compete on a global scale, solve social issues, and contribute to industrial development. Our focus here is on providing funding for their growth. As part of that, we have launched a venture debt fund in collaboration with the startup company Upsider, Inc. and have also been making capital investments on our own, supporting the innovation of ambitious entrepreneurs. Going forward, we will become more involved in supporting the incubation of Japanese unicorns in the deep tech field.\n\nSustainability presents both business opportunities and risks for financial institutions. On the business side, we are making efforts to connect public and private initiatives to formulate a 'grand design' for transition. We are also extending sustainable and transition finance and co-investing with our clients in projects that will promote sustainability. For risk management, we are continually developing our framework for managing exposure in carbon-related sectors, pursuing an ideal balance between opportunity and risk.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to leverage our cutting-edge financial technology and information sourced from our global network. Also, in order to dramatically change the current chicken-andegg situation in which inadequate supply is holding back demand and inadequate demand is holding back supply, we will devote resources to three areas: promoting efforts to create a supply of and demand chain for hydrogen; developing the carbon credit market; and promoting impact",

Global Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) business model\n\nWe have been steadily refreshing our assets to more effectively utilize capital and constructing a stable and highly profitable CIB business model. In the US, the world's largest financial market, we have placed in the higher ranks of the CIB league tables, and in Asia, where interest rates have been on the rise, we have further enhanced our transaction banking business. On top of this, we acquired US-based M&A advisory firm Greenhill to further our M&A and equity capabilities, adding to our existing strengths in bonds and loan arrangement. Such moves are helping us develop a unique edge in supporting corporate activities that bridge Japan and the rest of the world. In addition to our business growth, we will meticulously enhance our control and governance structure in each of the regions we operate.\n\nAs we gain greater competitiveness in our five business focus areas, we are also linking our strengths across areas to produce new added value. This is our target business model.\n\n## Enhancing our corporate foundations\n\nTurning our five business focus areas into a unique competitive edge will require a corporate culture that encourages our people, the driving force behind the implementation of our strategy, to connect across business areas, engage in constructive discussions, and take on even greater challenges. Our Purpose is the cornerstone of this. To communicate it throughout the organization, I have been visiting our offices around the world and holding extensive discussions with my colleagues. I believe these discussions have been beneficial in bridging the gap between executive management and employees. The proposals raised during such discussions have also been vital in improving our operations.\n\nOur transformation to a more innovative corporate culture is already bearing fruit. My colleagues have been launching and participating in new initiatives one after another. Some examples include the Mizuho Group CEO Challenge internal business idea competition, adoption of best practices among offices, and a collaborative operational framework between two branches in the same, less urban area.\n\nFairly evaluating such innovative initiatives alongside other contributions to the organization is crucial, as is supporting our people in proactively developing their careers. Accordingly, we are completely overhauling our human resources framework in Japan as well as stepping up efforts to make Mizuho a welcoming and supportive environment for talent from a variety of backgrounds. On the latter, we have been further prioritizing women's participation and advancement in the workplace and expanding our 'alumni' network of former Mizuho colleagues, broadening our attractiveness as a place where diverse professionals come together and inspire one another.",

Achieve steady profit growth (improve RORA, generate growth expectations)\n\nWithin the five business focus areas of our medium-term business plan, asset and wealth management, corporate business in Japan, and the global Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) business are our priority areas, and over the three years beginning from fiscal 2023 we are aiming to grow our Net Business Profits by approximately \u00a5170 billion. In fiscal 2023, we implemented strategies to enhance our competitiveness in these areas and extended our Net Business Profits by \u00a546 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, we plan to bring Net Business Profits up to \u00a587 billion above fiscal 2022, while also making upfront investments in corporate resources, including in enhancement of human capital for future growth.\n\n## \u25a0 Net Business Profits in priority areas\n\n| (\u00a5 billion)                 |   FY2023 (vs. FY2022) |   FY2024 (vs. FY2022) |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Asset & wealth management   |                     9 |                    18 |\n| Corporate business in Japan |                    25 |                    40 |\n| Global CIB business1        |                    12 |                    29 |\n| Total in priority areas     |                    46 |                    87 |\n\n## 2. Improve asset profitability (improve RORA)\n\nTowards improving our ROE, we are shifting corporate resources to business areas with higher capital efficiency. Specifically, we are focusing more on M&A, real estate, and other types of finance in which we can expect various ancillary business. In tandem, we are reducing mortgage loans, for which the market is extremely competitive, and other low-profit business globally. Such initiatives are steadily improving our RORA.\n\nWe are also continuing to reduce our crossshareholdings, which have a high risk of market value fluctuation and low capital efficiency. The book value of our cross-shareholdings, which stood at approximately \u00a52 trillion at the beginning of fiscal 2015, was down to just below \u00a51 trillion by the beginning of fiscal 2023. The additional reduction target we have set for the current medium-term business plan is \u00a5300 billion. During fiscal 2023, the first year of the plan, our reductions came to \u00a582.1 billion. However, when including unsold shares for which we have obtained client consent to sale, these reductions came to \u00a5117.1 billion.\n\n\u25b6 P. 88 Policy Regarding Mizuho Financial Group's Cross-shareholdings of Other Listed Companies\n\n## 3.

Manage credit related costs (mitigate volatility)\n\nThe return of positive interest rates in Japan could cause concern about a potential rise in credit-related costs. We will continue our predictive risk management in order to minimize our credit-related costs and also provide support for clients who are reviewing their business structures in response to financial difficulties. Furthermore, we will carry out thorough preventative measures, facilitated by our forward-looking reserves.\n\n## 5.  Diversify revenue, enhance complementary revenue streams (mitigate volatility)\n\nWhen the Bank of Japan introduced negative interest rates in 2016, it led to a significant drop in interest income in Japan. Accordingly, we reinforced our Japan noninterest business and our global Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) business, diversified our revenue sources, and enhanced our complementary revenue streams. In the midst of a challenging business environment, these\n\ninitiatives enabled us to maintain stable profit growth.\n\nWe will develop our initiatives further going forward to build a robust business portfolio resilient to changes in the external environment. In particular, for our global CIB business centered on the US, we will further pursue synergies between our lending, investment banking, and markets businesses, with a focus on highly credit-worthy, leading global clients, so as to further strengthen our business against the impacts of financial market volatility.\n\nBy appropriately controlling our Japanese yen and foreign currency banking portfolio, we will ensure that the revenue streams from our customer and markets divisions complement one another to an even greater extent, allowing us to mitigate revenue fluctuations from interest rate changes.\n\n## \u25a0 Stable growth in Gross Profits (customer divisions + S&T)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendix\n\nMessages from the CEOs of group companies",

Use capital effectively (control CET1 Capital Ratio, generate growth expectations)\n\nAs part of complying with the finalized, fully effective Basel III regulatory framework, for many years Mizuho has been placing emphasis on capital accumulation. We have allocated the Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent that we have recorded over the last 10 years (\u00a55.2 trillion) primarily to capital adequacy (\u00a52.7 trillion) and shareholder returns (\u00a52 trillion), devoting only \u00a50.5 trillion to growth investment.\n\nNevertheless, we still managed to leverage investment opportunities. Our North America CIB business is a good example. Recently, looking ahead to a digital shift in our retail business in Japan, we have been investing in asset and wealth management, including making an additional investment in Rakuten Securities, Inc.\n\nGiven the steady growth of our stable revenue base, we are estimating our total dividends for fiscal 2024 to be \u00a5115 per share (up \u00a510 year-on-year), which will mark four consecutive fiscal years of increases.\n\n## \u25a0 Track record\n\n## Allocation track record\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growth investments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

We carefully look into opportunities and conduct multifaceted and in-depth examinations of factors such as adequacy of investment returns, effectiveness of governance, and compatibility of corporate cultures. The second is investment that could contribute to our future growth opportunities, such as investment in digital finance in Asia. We will implement disciplined management of these investments, thoroughly monitoring them after we make them and quickly exiting from any that do not produce the expected return within a certain time period.\n\n## Stakeholder communication\n\nIn my message for fiscal 2023, I mentioned that we would further strengthen engagement with our stakeholders\n\nand improve our disclosures.\n\nWe have been vigorously rolling out IR activities to expand our opportunities for dialogue with investors both in and outside Japan. This has entailed not only considerably increasing the number of meetings with investors, but also improving our disclosures, such as detailing our initiatives for raising our P/B ratio.

In addition, we have had a number of in-depth meetings directly in English with our global investors, which have been constructive for both sides.\n\nWe receive many insightful suggestions from investors and are diligent about incorporating them into our strategies for sustainable growth. One example has been our initiatives to improve our disclosures.

Since then, I have led delegation of authority and elimination of excessive and inward-looking reporting. I feel that Mizuho is beginning to show signs of being more pliant and flexible, and we are moving toward a culture in which we focus our time and energy more on our customers.\n\nMizuho Bank is the group's major touchpoint with our customers. By serving as the relationship hub for our customers and tying together the group's various strengths, we will spearhead efforts to maximize value creation for our customers. As times change, such as the return of positive interest rates in Japan, we are fully committed to improving our range of products and solutions responsive to customer needs.\n\nMizuho Bank is also responsible for the largest volume of operations within the group. In order to continuously and sustainably improve our services amidst a shrinking population in Japan, we will drive the transformation of our operations while also maintaining our stable business operations. We will optimize product and service lineups, review operational processes to boost efficiency and productivity, and take full advantage of digital technology.\n\nWithin this, each employee will develop greater initiative and professionalism, using their creativity and ambition to enhance customer value and improve business operations.\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nMasahiko Kato\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI have spent my entire career in Mizuho Trust & Banking, as a practitioner of product development using asset liquidation mechanisms, as the head of the Sendai and Fukuoka branches, and most immediately, before taking on this role, I served as the head of Kansai and the West Japan region.\n\nCurrently we are working to combine our specialized trust functions with other functions across the group in order to deliver a wider range of value added services, and by doing so, also achieve sustainable growth and a prosperous future.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we are looking to leverage our strengths in consulting to drive new business opportunities across the group. Specifically, we are undertaking the following two initiatives.\n\nSupporting the sustainable growth of our clients and society: Leveraging the expertise inherent to trust banking, we strive to be the \"go-to partner\" for corporate management in enhancing corporate value and grow Mizuho Trust & Banking's reputation for succeeding businesses and assets through to the next generation, offering comprehensive consulting that encompasses everything from group-wide solutions to operational support.\n\nBecoming a 'trust bank you can trust': By remaining attuned to clients and society, and maintaining our high ethical values and professionalism to realize their ambitions and growth, we will serve as a trust bank that clients can trust .\n\nIn 2025, we will celebrate our 100 th anniversary. While carrying forward the aspirations of our predecessors and the foundations they cultivated, we will deploy fresh thinking, expanding the possibilities of 'trust' itself.

We will maintain and cultivate our input-our capital for value creation-to create social value and enhance corporate value.\n\n## Mizuho's history, corporate DNA, and strengths\n\n## 150-year history of contributing for our customers and society\n\nCorporate Philosophy: 'Responsible and transparent', Purpose: 'Proactively innovate together with our clients for a prosperous and sustainable future'\n\n2023 marked 150 years since the founding of First National Bank, one of the three banks to which Mizuho traces its roots. Among Mizuho's founders were two capitalists and entrepreneurs of early modern Japan: Eiichi Shibusawa and Zenjiro Yasuda. Both of them were instrumental figures in the modernization of Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. They were open-minded, connecting various capitalists and other professionals, and had foresight in taking on new risks and challenges. Their actions were based in their belief in morality and in putting the public interest above selfinterest. Their responsibility, transparency, and foresight are still at the core of Mizuho's identity.\n\nEiichi Shibusawa\n\nZenjiro Yasuda\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCourtesy of the Shibusawa Memorial Museum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCourtesy of the National Diet Library\n\n## Collaborative structure, nurtured under the 'One Mizuho' concept\n\nIn 1999, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and Industrial Bank of Japan announced their merger. After several subsequent mergers and reorganizations, the current Mizuho consists of banking, trust banking, securities, asset management, and research and consulting.\n\nFrom fiscal 2013, we cultivated the 'One Mizuho' concept where we respond to customer needs as a unified group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ability to respond to customer needs and provide solutions as a unified group under the group-wide in-house company system\n\nBased on this collaborative structure, nurtured under the 'One Mizuho' concept, the in-house company system that began in fiscal 2016 operates across Mizuho according to customer segment. We have established five in-house companies, which determine and promote group-wide strategies across banking, trust banking, securities, and other business areas according to customer segment, as well as two units that support all of the in-house companies.

We will also make our deposit accounts more attractive and secure the stable individual deposits necessary to provide funding support to customers, industry, and society, capturing a future customer base for our asset and wealth management business.\n\n- * The Kishida administration has announced the Doubling Asset-based Income Plan, which encourages the shift of excess household funds from savings into investment.\n\n## Progress in fiscal 2023 and initiatives moving forward\n\n## Make NISAs a core part of the Mizuho brand\n\nTo expand the base of individual customers who are interested in investment and asset formation while using the new NISAs (which began in January 2024) as a catalyst, we started up the Mizuho NISA Cafe as a means of capturing opportunities, enabling the rollout of promotions, and allowing customers to easily stop in for consultations. We provided opportunities and information related to asset formation closer to customers; for example, by holding NISA Cafe seminars not only at branches, but at shopping malls and apartments as well. Our goal is to make NISAs a core part of the Mizuho brand.\n\nMoving forward, we will further strengthen the group's ability to provide comprehensive asset consulting and investment products.\n\n## Reforms in digital, remote, and physical (branch, ATM) channels\n\nBy improving the convenience of the Mizuho online banking app/website Mizuho Direct, we are steadily increasing the number of users. Even when serving customers at branches, we have increased the ratio of usage for tablet terminals in the branches. Thanks to these, the automation of administrative procedures and processes has been progressing. At the same time, we will reexamine the status of existing branches and promote a transition to branches handling consulting (e.g., for asset formation and management) and branches specializing in opening accounts. In February 2024, we opened our first branch dedicated to opening deposit accounts for individual customers, in Ikebukuro, Tokyo.\n\nIn the future, we will further improve digital tools.\n\n## Pursuit of best-in-class customer experience in both digital and in-person touchpoints, also through collaboration with other companies\n\nIn December 2023, Mizuho Securities and Rakuten Securities Holdings, Inc. agreed to further strengthen the strategic capital and business alliance between the two companies originally announced in October 2022. The goal is to build a new retail business model in the asset formation and management fields combining the convenience of online interactions with face-to-face experiences that enable consultations. We will build a structure that allows customers to choose their own optimum access route, rather than having the financial institution lead the customer to one or the other.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNumber of NISAs\n\nEnd of March 2024:\n\n750,000 accounts\n\n(No. of new accounts opened in fiscal 2023: Approx. 120,000)\n\nBalance of individual assets under management\n\nEnd of March 2024:\n\n\u00a529.6\n\ntrillion\n\n(+\u00a54.6 trillion compared to the end of March 2023)\n\n\u25b6 Human resources strategy for implementing growth strategy and its KPIs:\n\nP. 49 Building a talent portfolio to implement growth strategy (within 'Human capital management')\n\nMizuho Direct monthly active users\n\nAs of March 2024:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompared to January 2022 (before UI/UX improvement)",

Through these initiatives, we are contributing to realizing a sustainable society and economy as part of our long-term goal for the future.\n\nWe will connect our corporate clients of various scales and at various stages, support their challenges, and provide thorough support in business growth and enhancing corporate value.\n\n## Progress in fiscal 2023 and initiatives moving forward\n\n## Supporting business growth\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we started up the Business Development Support Office, a specialized team for conducting discussions on business development with middle-market firms. First, we submitted proposals and held discussions with a focus on 100 clients. We received positive responses from about 30% of these clients, and having confirmed the effectiveness of such approaches, we expanded our activities. From April 2024, we have unified corporate solution functions (e.g., business matching and support for global expansion) to form the Business Development Support Department, and expanded on target clients and proposal/discussion topics.\n\n## Startups/innovative companies\n\nTo increase provision of risk capital to startups/innovative companies, in August 2023 we established the Mizuho Venture Debt Fund, which provides capital through the acquisition of corporate bonds with warrants and focuses mainly on companies in the growth and later stages, and in November 2023 we executed the first investment from the fund. We also established a debt fund for startups in the growth stage, through a joint venture with Upsider, Inc., a fintech company that provides corporate settlement services through an original AI credit model. We executed the first investment from this debt fund in January 2024.\n\n## Business succession\n\nHow to sustainably pass down businesses, technologies, and products with incredible potential is a social issue in Japan. We provide support by leveraging our strengths as a unified group, such as our attention to the perspective of both corporations and owners, our expertise and solutions in trust banking, and our product capabilities in investment banking. We provide support in various forms of business succession, including succession within families, as well as M&As and MBOs, which have been increasing in recent years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKPIs\n\nNumber of companies approached regarding business growth support\n\nFY2023:\n\nProposals submitted to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompanies\n\n- \u25b6 Human resources strategy for implementing growth strategy and its KPIs:\n\nP. 49 Building a talent portfolio to implement growth strategy (within 'Human capital management')\n\n## Enhancing the competitiveness of Japanese companies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeague tables (in Japan)\n\nFY2023 (FY2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1st)\n\n(4th)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Source: Capital Eye and LSEG)",

Leveraging this strength, and combining our expertise in sustainability, we continue to be on the top of the league tables in Japan in both syndicated loans and SDG bonds, and we hold a top-class position in global syndicated loans as well (Source: LSEG). Japan is leading the transition finance market, and Mizuho has supported a majority of this financing (Source: Tabulated by Mizuho based on Bloomberg data).\n\n## Value co-creation: Promoting sustainability and creating innovations\n\nWe have entered an era in which social issues are becoming increasingly complex, and it is difficult for a single company to resolve these issues alone. We are strengthening our approach of 'value co-creation', in which we work with clients to take on the challenges of resolving these social issues and creating new business.\n\nIn addition to making joint investments with clients in technologies and businesses aimed at resolving social issues, we are developing new businesses and platforms by connecting with diverse companies.\n\nWe have prepared two investment facilities-a Transition Equity Investment Facility 1 suited to the growth stage of the technology or business, and a Value Co-creation Investment Facility. 2 We executed a total of 11 investments as of the end of March 2024, and are in the process of establishing a pipeline.\n\n- 1.  Transition Equity Investment Facility: An investment facility targeting projects related to the transition field, in the development and verification stages. This facility was set in April 2022, with a view toward investments exceeding \u00a550 billion.\n- 2. Value Co-creation Investment Facility: Investments that support the creation of new businesses by clients and the commercialization of those businesses.\n\n## Deepening our involvement in individual fields targeting decarbonization and resolving social issues (e.g., hydrogen, carbon credits, impact evaluations)\n\nIt is becoming increasingly important for financial institutions to provide funding to quickly set up supply chains for hydrogen and related technologies. In May 2024, Mizuho announced that it would arrange \u00a52 trillion in financing for these fields by 2030.\n\nIn the field of carbon credit, we have been involved in the creation of rules in Japan, and we have collaborated with credit creating companies. We are the only Japanese bank to be designated as a 'market maker' on the Tokyo Stock Exchange carbon credit market, and we received the Best Market Maker award from the Tokyo Stock Exchange in February 2024.\n\nIn May 2024, we published Impact Business Compass, which describes our involvement in the impact business field and also its potential.\n\n## KPIs\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this way, we will contribute to the achievement of a sustainable society and economy.\n\nWe will demonstrate our strengths, such as our global network and our CIB business model in the Americas.\n\n## Progress in fiscal 2023 and initiatives moving forward\n\nAmericas: Further enhancing the functions of the CIB business model for the Americas, which integrates banking and securities operations as well as primary and secondary markets business and is one of Mizuho's strengths\n\nIn addition to the strong US capital market presence that we have cultivated in the debt field (loan capital markets and debt capital markets; LCM/DCM), we have expanded on equity capital markets (ECM), M&As, and other such primary business-linked sales and trading (S&T). Against that backdrop, we completed the acquisition of the US M&A advisory firm Greenhill in December 2023.\n\nBy integrating Greenhill into the Mizuho group, in addition to further expanding the US business, we will collaborate with offices in Japan and around the world using Greenhill as a strong edge and seize cross-border M&A opportunities.\n\n## EMEA: Transition to a lightweight, selective CIB model with an emphasis on sustainability\n\nIn October 2023, we announced our intention to create a universal bank in the EU and bring together our banking and securities businesses, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nWhile transitioning to a CIB model that strives to stably and continuously provide and expand financial services in this region, we will increase finance arrangements and knowledge acquisition in the sustainability space.\n\n## APAC: Expand transaction banking business in Asia and adopt the Americas model for success in derivative and capital markets business\n\nWe will scale up transaction banking business and derivative and capital markets business in keeping with the specific characteristics of each country in Asia, where the regional economy will continue to grow in the future.\n\nIn India, which has demonstrated rapidly growing demand for digital financial services amid strong economic growth and the world's largest population, in March 2024, we invested an equity ratio equivalent to 15% in Kisetsu Saison Finance (India) Pvt.

We will enhance our human capital through hiring and training that enables employees to develop their expertise and capabilities, and we will provide a sense of purpose and support for them to strengthen their motivation and reach their maximum potential.\n\n- \u20dd Strengthen personnel capabilities\n- \u20dd Produce personnel who will lead the organization\n- \u20dd  Create a workplace environment that draws out latent potential: Support taking on challenges, reward contributions, and provide a supportive working environment\n\n## Progress in fiscal 2023 and initiatives moving forward\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we have supported employees in preparation for the new HR framework starting from fiscal 2024 in Japan. We will firmly align business strategy and human resources strategy in order to strengthen human capital through the new HR framework. At the same time, we will increase motivation and ease of work for each and every employee so that they can reach the full potential of their expertise and abilities, and we will always strive to broadly incorporate feedback and suggestions from employees.\n\n## Corporate culture transformation\n\n\u25b6 P. 55  Building a corporate culture where employees are fulfilled and successful (within 'Human capital management')\n\nThrough integrated promotion of internal communication (corporate culture transformation) and brand communication (improvement of our brand value), we will improve employee and customer engagement.\n\n## Progress in fiscal 2023 and initiatives moving forward\n\nIn order to firmly establish the Corporate Identity among employees, the Group CEO personally increased the number of his town hall meetings and on-site visits across the globe, spoke directly to employees about the meaning and intent of the Corporate Identity and the Purpose, and expanded communications. Also, to encourage the executive management leading our organization to see the Corporate Identity from a first-person perspective, the executive management team conducted workshops within the team and delivered their own personal thoughts to the respective divisions each of them lead.\n\nWe can see signs of change in employee awareness, and there have been gradual improvements in the engagement scores and inclusion scores put forward as human capital KPIs. Even so, we will need to work on these areas continuously, rather than seeing them only as short-term initiatives.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, in addition to communication of the Purpose-Proactively innovate together with our clients for a prosperous and sustainable future-we will strive for communication of the Values, which are specific values and behaviors to realize the Purpose. We will promote a variety of activities that will enable employees to practice the Values in the context of day-to-day operations and ensure that these behaviors are clearly evaluated and encouraged.\n\n## Company town hall meetings / on-site visits: Dialogues between management and the frontlines to promote adoption of the Corporate Identity\n\nThe Group CEO held town hall meetings for all in-house companies, units, and groups. The Group CEO and other management members also\n\ncontinuously visit offices in Japan and across the globe, and they will increase dialogues further going forward.\n\n## Feedback from participants\n\n'I got a real sense of the intent behind the Corporate Identity.'

We will continue to encourage and support such changes and corporate culture transformation.\n\nMio Ishibashi Life Plan Advisor Mizuho Bank\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Working as a Life Plan Advisor  (LPA)\n\nI became an LPA because I want the bank to be a place where anyone can visit comfortably and talk about asset management. At the Musashi-Kosugi Branch (at the time of the interview), we launched initiatives in which we can engage in discussions to support customers' asset formation and share branch member activities, and I have enjoyed being involved in these operations.\n\nI have also actively communicated about seminars hosted by the Musashi-Kosugi Branch and related initiatives, for example by holding informational meetings with branches in the same sub-regional area, exchanging information with colleagues of other branches in Japan that I have met through training seminars and other activities, and posting information on in-house social media. By transmitting information on activities at our own branches, we have received inquiries from other LPAs across Japan. Now, various branches are communicating a variety of ideas via in-house social media, and I can feel that positive activities are expanding at branches all over Japan.\n\n## Change in our communication style through reverse mentoring for the CEO\n\nReverse mentoring is a system in which early career employees in their twenties act as mentors for executive officers, engaging in dialogue from a young person's perspective. From August 2023, I acted as mentor for Mr. Masahiko Kato, President & CEO of Mizuho Bank. I majored in nuclear reactor engineering in graduate school, and I currently handle data analysis and other operations. Using my background in the sciences, I had conversations with Mr. Kato on topics such as natural language processing and network theory, as well as early career employment and Generation Z / Generation Alpha.\n\nWe especially talked about ways of communicating messages to early career employees, including myself, and approaches that would make employees feel closer to executive officers; for example, people find dialogues easier to remember than speeches and employees also need more opportunities to increase recognition among members of management. After that, I felt that there was a change in in-house communications; for example, the president changed the format of his video messages for employees from an individual speech to a dialogue format; social events were held for executive officers and employees to get to know each other; and the executive officers, including Mr. Kato, began posting actively on in-house social media.\n\nAyako Obara CEO Mizuho Pochette\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRyosuke Shimizu Mizuho-DL Financial Technology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aiming to resolve social issues through entrepreneurship originating from Mizuho\n\nWhen I was on an extended business trip to Myanmar right after its demilitarization, I saw how the country had developed, and I wanted to work on a project that would bring a new vitality to Japan as well, so I applied for the Mizuho Group CEO Challenge, an in-house business contest which began in 2022 and in which employees can take on the challenge of starting up a new business. At first, I thought about business targeting households with schoolchildren, to support work and home life, but following the changes in the business environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and after receiving a lot of advice, we transitioned the business concept to Mizuho Pochette, which specializes in financial education that is unique to Mizuho.\n\nIn April 2024, we established a new company as a joint venture with Sega XD Co., Ltd. The reason that I have been able to come this far, in addition to a determination to carry through with this idea right to the end, was the understanding and support that I felt very strongly from the people around me, with regard to taking time out of my regular duties to take on this challenge. I plan to tenaciously oversee the growth of this business, as a model case for providing new value by making full use of Mizuho's tangible and intangible resources to resolve social issues.\n\n\u25b6 P. 70  Mizuho Group CEO Challenge  First business project: Mizuho Pochette (within 'Digital transformation')",

The results of digital transformation have already begun to appear, with increased customer convenience resulting from improved user interface and user experience (UI/UX) where digital transformation has been incorporated into business and operations, and in the establishment of companies based on new business ideas created by employees.

We will improve the cost and investment return checking process by setting more effective KPIs, such as ROI at the time of the investment decision, and we will improve on IT investment and cost management by increasing visibility.

As it is quite a broad concept, I would like to break it up into three subtopics: management, business, and take-up by employees and the organization. We'll start with management. What challenges do you see in the existing state of affairs for sustainability, given the conversations you've had at various opportunities and your own experience?\n\nNoda At the Japan Business Federation, where I serve as one of the vice chairs, we have put forward a policy of practicing sustainable capitalism. We see sustainability as a central theme of corporate management and are pursuing it as such. I believe three points are key when it comes to sustainability. The first goes almost without saying: environmental conservation. Right now, the earth's environment is in crisis. There is a pressing need for us to accelerate actual innovation towards green transformation and a circular economy. The second is sustainability in society. Corporations should have a social viewpoint and contribute to the development of a fair and equitable society.\n\nThey should balance doing business with contributing to the betterment of society by investing in people and fulfilling their responsibilities in relation to supply chains and subcontractors. The third is the complexity of the concept of sustainability. Determining what counts as sustainable is no easy task. For example, green transformation demands renewable energy and a shift to electric vehicles, but these may lead to increases in geopolitical risk\n\nsurrounding rare earth minerals and loss of biodiversity. It is also necessary to think about impacts on society in areas such as local employment. Corporate executives have to confront these innumerable, intractable contradictions and still make progress. It is a considerable challenge.\n\nKihara When I attended the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum at Davos in January 2024, I also felt that more people were beginning to see sustainability as a difficult task. As you said, the dimensions of sustainability have been multiplying. Sustainability topics have already extended from the environment and climate change to the circular economy, human capital, and human rights. With populations aging, birth rates declining, and lifespans lengthening, health has also joined the list. What's more, Japan may be looking at more severe disparity due to inflation. In the face of these sustainability challenges, under our Purpose of 'Proactively innovate together with our clients for a prosperous and sustainable future', Mizuho has committed in our current medium-term business plan to creating both corporate value and social value. However, it is very tough.\n\nNoda I think that is why the spirit of the Purpose is so critical. Kihara If we are to be a company that contributes to society, we must first challenge ourselves to become a sustainable company. In other words, we need to have a sound sustainability management structure in place. For human capital, we need to be accepting of people who have grown at Mizuho and then leave Mizuho to pursue",

For human rights, we need to stay on top of due diligence. For a circular economy, we need to take even greater action.\n\nUshikubo From the perspective of Mizuho's own management, I think it is important that we fulfill our role as a financial institution by providing risk capital for the transition to net zero. As the process will vary from country to country, we will meticulously respond to the needs of society and clients according to the situation in each location, contributing to resolving social issues while connecting stakeholders. Concurrently, we have to remain attentive to transition risks. We need to think about two axes: whether or not a particular sector has high carbon emissions and whether or not the client has the intention and planning to decarbonize their business. Disclosures are another important aspect. Global standards for sustainability disclosures are still in process and rules for Japan are still under discussion, too. We are preparing to comply with these, but it is not enough to simply follow the regulations. Communicating effectively through disclosures so as to deepen our stakeholders' understanding is also essential.\n\n## Sustainability business strategy to differentiate Mizuho\n\nNoda Supporting clients' decarbonization is very important. Corporate management is often wandering around without a compass. The key point is whether or not Mizuho can get close to them and innovate together with them. The 20th century economy was a mass production, mass consumption, mass disposal economy. Turning it into a circular economy will require transforming the entire value chaindesign, manufacturing, consumption, collection, and renewal. You could call this a revolution. The younger generation in Europe has taken notice of the fact that human activity is already crossing the so-called 'planetary boundaries', beyond which we may cause irreversible changes to the earth's systems. In 2023, I met with the\n\nEuropean Commission's Environment Commissioner, who was 33 at the time, in Brussels. He said that transitioning to a circular economy is a matter of course-that there is absolutely no choice not to do it. To make it happen, it will be necessary to bring together a range of stakeholders. I expect that Mizuho, being a linchpin of industrial finance in Japan, will be able to connect a wide range of related stakeholders.\n\nKihara We will not be able to break with the past if we do not connect a variety of stakeholders. The Corporate & Investment Banking Company, our in-house company in charge of large corporate clients, has a Value Co-creation Team. Most of the members of this team have financial backgrounds, and some joined us from different sectors, such as Japanese trading companies. We are not only discussing and investing in creative business ideas with our clients but also constructing creative business platforms with them. For example, along with another Japanese company, we invested in an Indiafocused startup that has the technology to produce alternative fuel from landfill garbage. The technology alone will not be enough; it will be necessary to also have plants that can apply the technology. In that way, growth in business leads to growth in demand for financing, which in turn leads to growth in our finance business. Also, in constructing new value chains for business, I want us to expand the breadth of connections, beyond large companies to middle-market firms and SMEs. Changing the whole industrial structure is no small task. We need to come up with comprehensive designs for industries. We can't be so full of ourselves as to think we can do it alone. We want to and need to talk with a wide range of stakeholders and create such comprehensive designs together.\n\nNoda That is really one of Mizuho's strengths and something I would like you to try to do. I used to work at a bank myself, and I know bankers tend to decide whether or not the bank will lend to a borrower just by looking at the borrower's financial statements. Going forward,",

        "page_content": "Discussion\n\nbanks should take a more proactive role, enhancing their broad connections with clients and utilizing talent from a diversity of backgrounds.\n\nKihara I think the new shape of banking will be to look not only at a borrower's financial statements but at their growth potential. The Japanese government's Green Transformation Implementation Council is seriously discussing the state of industry and their vision for 2040. I am considering what can be done to connect industry, government, and academia together and what Mizuho can do there.\n\nUshikubo One of our actions in fiscal 2023 was to formulate a sustainable business strategy, which was also discussed at the Board of Directors. We are trying to imagine a future in which society has achieved carbon neutrality, a circular economy, and so on, and we have to think about what Mizuho's strengths can contribute and what our aims should be, in both a short-term and medium- to long-term time frame. Mizuho's culture of emphasizing research is an important characteristic here, I think. Also, in terms of support in the short term, finance is key. Our sustainable finance target of \u00a5100 trillion by 2030 shows our commitment. In fiscal 2023, we released our Human Capitalbased Management Impact Finance product in Japan, which comes with an impact assessment by the consulting division of Mizuho Research & Technologies. We've already had 10 Japanese companies sign up for it and had interest from many more. The concept of impact is an effective way to align the vectors of social contribution and corporate value. Over the medium to long term, as Group CEO Kihara said, our investment activities will be important. We have our Value Co-creation Investment Facility for the later stage and Transition Equity Investment Facility for the early stage. For hydrogen, we have announced that we will provide \u00a52 trillion in financing by 2030.\n\nProviding risk capital is one of the functions finance institutions are performing to support the Japanese government's initiatives. About the connecting aspect, we want to connect large corporations with middle-market firms, SMEs, and less urban areas in Japan, and to connect middle-market firms and SMEs that have promising technology with large corporations. Sustainability has a lot of areas for collaboration, even with competitors. I believe Mizuho might be able to convince our clients to join hands with their competitors.\n\nNoda On the flip side, what are Mizuho's challenges in terms of sustainability?\n\nUshikubo One of our challenges is our global reach. We need to gather information from Europe, which is ahead on rulemaking for sustainability, and introduce Japan to the innovations that are advancing in other parts of the world. We want to strengthen our capacity here. Raising our literacy and sensitivity around global sustainability developments is a must. Part of this is sending our employees from Japan to our offices elsewhere so that they can assist local employees in identifying implications for Japan.\n\nNoda There is a lot to do, but the highest priority is, as you implied, Mizuho's determination. We are living in a time with no easy answers, and moving forward without stopping requires both determination and courage. I heard Group CEO Kihara talked with Paul Polman, the former CEO of Unilever, recently. He has been continually advocating for sustainability for over 20 years and unwaveringly promoted Unilever's sustainability management. Mizuho should be a financial institution supporting companies that have such determination and courage.\n\nKihara Before I talked with Paul Polman, I read his book Net Positive. His stance was not to quit the hard things, because those are the\n\n<!-- image -->",

That's in line with the thinking of Eiichi Shibusawa, who founded one of our predecessor banks, First National Bank, along with many other companies. At the time, Japan didn't have any of the industries or companies that the US and Europe did. No one could have known for sure if those sorts of industries and companies would be successful in Japan. But that is exactly why Shibusawa supported them. That is the role of finance.\n\n## Sustainability mindset among employees\n\nUshikubo It takes more than just a few members of the organization to make innovation happen. Do you have any advice, from your experience in corporate management, for promoting awareness of sustainability among employees throughout the organization? Noda My company is like Mizuho in that it does business all over Japan, employing nearly 10,000 people. Getting every employee in every region to adopt your corporate Purpose and a sustainability mindset is very ambitious. What I think is important is that each leader, from executive management to the heads of business lines to general managers on down, talks about the Purpose in their own words. It is also important that employees consider what the Purpose and sustainability mean in the context of their own work.\n\nUshikubo I agree that sending messages across the various layers of the organization is important. In fiscal 2023, as Group Chief Sustainability Officer, I held about 30 dialogues with employees, mainly employees in frontline offices who have contact with clients every day. I was surprised to find that early career employees in their first or second years would tell me Mizuho could still do a lot more for\n\nsustainability or they hadn't been able to propose a solution for their client's sustainability needs and wanted to do better next time. I could see that the younger generation's interest in sustainability was far beyond my original understanding. In fiscal 2024, we are going to launch an employee-led working group that will call for and implement ideas to foster a sustainability mindset throughout Mizuho and provide solutions to our clients. It won't just be for the relationship managers of large corporate clients in related sectors or for the departments that handle large-scale project finance or for the departments that make policy proposals. It will be for every employee to take ownership of sustainability themselves. That will lead to specific plans and to uncovering sustainability needs that even our clients haven't realized yet.\n\nKihara We had one case of providing financing to a startup dealing in semiconductor-related materials that can reduce energy consumption in semiconductor manufacturing, where such consumption is quite large. We rewarded this deal internally as a good example of completing a deal even in the face of many challenges, but it is also a positive example of us taking on sustainability. I think it is important for employees to understand when they have done something that contributes to sustainability so that they can communicate it as well. Noda It would be great if employees could take notice when their own work has contributed to sustainability, even if only in a small way. I look forward to talking more in the future about what Mizuho can do as a financial institution to contribute to a sustainable society and economy. I will be supporting Mizuho's innovations from my standpoint as an outside director.\n\nThank you for your time today.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## New HR management under CANADE\n\n## An HR framework to support self-driven endeavors\n\nThe environment surrounding our customers and society is changing and becoming more complex every day, as are the issues they face. These shifts are causing attendant shifts in the demands placed on Mizuho. Employees must hone their expertise and take on new roles to achieve their desired careers, and Mizuho must build a strong talent portfolio capable of meeting the varied needs of customers and society.\n\nConventional HR management in Japan has struggled to do away with preconceived notions and old customs such as the seniority system. In order to transform our HR management and encourage our people to take on new challenges, we have made rewarding contributions and supporting self-driven endeavors the main pillars of CANADE.\n\n## Compensation and allocation\n\n## \u20dd Compensation and allocation of personnel according to scope of duties and level of responsibility\n\nTo create a rewarding place to work, it is important to fairly reward employees for their contributions and achievements.\n\nOur new HR framework in Japan rewards employees for their contributions according to scope of duties and level of responsibility through a new role-based compensation system. As part of the new framework, we have also removed multi-tiered organizational performance from the factors that determine employee bonuses, which are now based on achievement of individual goals and performance contributions. These changes have made for a clear system in which each employee is rewarded according to their roles and achievements and which provides employees with incentives to grow and take on the challenge of larger roles.\n\n## \u20dd Enabling appointment and selection independent of seniority\n\nThe introduction of role-based compensation has made it possible to allocate the right person to the right job based on their skills and abilities, regardless of age or seniority, and promote early career employees to a greater extent than before. At the same time, a previous system that resulted in lower compensation at certain ages, regardless of individual skill and ability, has been abolished, expanding opportunities for experienced employees. By reforming our HR system under the motto of 'understanding every individual', we are enabling employees to take on more challenging tasks and greater responsibilities as they grow, irrespective of age and seniority.\n\nIn addition, we have made a shared HR platform for the five core group companies 1 and revised the compensation system so that employees with the same role will receive the same compensation, even if they work for different entities. This allows for efficiently allocating personnel across entities.\n\n1. Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Trust & Banking, Mizuho Securities, and Mizuho Research & Technologies.\n\n## Evaluation\n\n## \u20dd Growth-oriented evaluation system\n\nAt Mizuho, we aim for every employee to grow on their own terms and take on more challenging roles with greater responsibility. We believe that HR systems and management should support this. In the past, our evaluation system linked evaluation results (rank) directly to salary and assignment. Consequently, employees would focus on obtaining a higher rank at the expense of self-driven endeavors and personal growth. To address this situation, we have shifted to a more growth-oriented evaluation system so that employees and managers will be able to consider issues together and focus on individual growth through dialogue. This will encourage employees to reflect and take initiative toward their own growth.\n\n## \u20dd Framework for evaluating personnel who embody Mizuho's Corporate Identity\n\nIn addition, the previous evaluation framework centered solely on skill level and ability. In order to keep all employees in sync with our Corporate Identity (Purpose and Values) and translate this into better performance for Mizuho, we have both redefined our Corporate Identity and updated our evaluation framework to emphasize not only skills and abilities but also embodiment of our Values, which serve as the axis for employees' behavior based on our Corporate Identity.",

With this in mind, we have reviewed our management development program to ensure that it consistently produces leaders who have the conceptual ability to envision the future of the entire business and the execution to drive the organization as a whole.\n\n## Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn order to have a steady flow of executive officer candidates, we have set the target number for management candidates at twice or more the number of executive officers. Repeated selections and evaluations provide for a consistent level of quality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince fiscal 2022, we have maintained more than twice as many candidates as we have executive officer positions, and we are committed to early selection and ongoing training.\n\nWhile the total number of executive officer candidates has remained steady, there is a bias toward certain business areas. In order to achieve sustainable growth, we will work to systematically optimize the candidate pool.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Establishment of the AOI Program in Japan to develop personnel of the quality and quantity necessary for leadership\n\nIn this rapidly changing business environment, the management talent companies need will not spontaneously emerge on their own. Recognizing that Mizuho does not have sufficient systems or mechanisms in Japan to secure the management candidates we will require in the future, we established the AOI Program, a management candidate development program under the direction of the Group CEO, as a framework to secure the quality and quantity of personnel necessary to support Mizuho's future management. AOI stands for the Aspiration to lead our future management; the Optimism to see that negativity is an emotion, while positivity is a choice; and the recognition of Ignorance, because the more you learn, the more you realize how little you know.\n\nThe program involves an evaluation system to continuously assess a candidate's suitability for management, within a cycle of selecting new eligible candidates in light of their characteristics and motivations. Such a system allows us to improve candidate growth across the board by strategically handing out tough assignments and encouraging deep reflection, aligned with the areas for improvement that each candidate identifies during the training. The program has only just gone into effect, and we will continue to review and make improvements as necessary to produce a stable flow of management candidates who can be responsible for Mizuho's future.\n\n## Launch of AOI Juku (training) to prepare and inspire management candidates\n\nIn addition to the overall changes to the system, we have also revised our training program into AOI Juku, which we launched in fiscal 2023. This program not only focuses on acquisition of management skills, such as strategic thinking and the forward momentum necessary for effecting change, but also on the candidate's preparedness for and aspiration toward management. The program provides opportunities for direct dialogue with the Group CEO and other members of the management team so that participants can learn to better understand and reflect on themselves. This helps develop the strong leadership required of management candidates, and we encourage continuous growth through tough assignments for each participant after their completion of the AOI Juku program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendix",

This will offer such employees opportunities to gain practical experience in both front office and governance roles, allowing us to build a sustainable portfolio of talent with international experience.\n\n## Digital transformation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                 | Digital transformation 5                                                                                                                                                                                             | Promotion Agency, Japan; able to perform all assigned duties and lead projects independently; program launched in FY2023).                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 5.

        "page_content": "## Elevating individual employees' capabilities\n\nIn order to implement our growth strategies, it is important for all Mizuho employees to grow in their own ways while taking on the challenge of developing their skills and abilities toward their career goals. As part of encouraging such an attitude among our employees in Japan, we are working to enhance our career development offerings and middle management's support capabilities. We view such efforts as an investment in the growth of our people, and we believe that if we provide appropriate opportunities, our people will be able to improve their skills and abilities on their own initiative. This will in turn translate to a talent pool that can serve as an even stronger foundation for our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Encouraging career independence through a career development framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur career development framework in Japan enables each employee to envision their own unique career path and grow while taking on new roles. Many of our career advisors are also certified career consultants (we have about 30 consultants present at any given time in the HR division).\n\nWe are implementing a cycle of employees building their self-knowledge through career interviews, gaining career field knowledge through introduction of various departments and duties within the group, thinking about their careers with the company, creating their careers through training and other self-improvement, and growing by taking on new roles, followed by renewed self-knowledge.\n\nAt the same time, an internal questionnaire has revealed that some employees have anxiety about the future of their careers, a low awareness of the need to create one's own career, and issues with the self-motivated development necessary to realize one's career goals. To address these problems, our career advisors are providing advice to employees on what kind of career they should aim for and what kind of steps they should take to achieve their career goals.\n\n## Upskilling for middle management, the channel of communication between the company and employees\n\nSupporting self-driven endeavors means recognizing that employees and the company need to work together. We believe it is important for middle management, as the channel of communication between employees and the company, to provide feedback that encourages employees to take on challenges in their daily work and develop their skills and abilities.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we redesigned our training program for newly appointed managers in Japan. Under the themes of listening to employees and understanding the power of organizational leadership to leverage diversity, the program conveyed the importance of guiding communication between employees and the company and the differences in motivation that arise from different positions. Aside from this, we have also created a set of Management Principles to establish a standard of the model manager.\n\nStarting in fiscal 2024, we will be laying out the knowledge, skills, and abilities required of managers, and we will implement upskilling with training programs throughout the year, while visualizing and monitoring each person's participation. We are calling these efforts to enhance management personnel the Manager Update Program (M-UP), and we will promote it by publishing a guidebook that clearly explains the details.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Mizuho's Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion sets out our three commitments of 'Celebrate diversity', 'Promote work-life satisfaction\", and 'Create an inclusive culture'. These mean that every employee can flourish in their own way and feel satisfaction and pride in working as a member of Mizuho, in turn creating new value for everyone at Mizuho and for society at large.\n\n## Ensuring diversity in management and decision-making\n\nMizuho is looking to incorporate more diverse perspectives and values into our operations and decision-making. We consider promotion of women, employees hired outside Japan, and mid-career hires to be particularly important strategic themes and ensuring diversity within management decision-making to be a first step.\n\n## \u20dd Establishment of infrastructure to promote women's advancement\n\nIn increasing the percentage of management positions filled by women, we are focusing on assignment of duties and professional networking. Our comprehensive efforts in this area include mentoring by executive officers, training for women appointed to general manager and equivalent positions, as well as opportunities for women in other manager and equivalent positions to learn the appeal of management through talk sessions with women employees who are at a further stage in their careers. In addition, the percentage of women in new graduates hired in Japan, which is one of the key indicators for promoting the development and advancement of women employees over the medium to long term, has been growing steadily.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. Japan (Total of Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Trust & Banking, Mizuho Securities, and Mizuho Research & Technologies). 2. From FY2023 onward, due to a change in the scope of calculation, employees seconded to affiliates outside Japan are excluded.\n\nBackground\n\nof this KPI\n\nTo have business operations integrating the perspectives and ideas of women, who account for half of Mizuho's employees, and to lay a foundation for the advancement of women employees in the workplace over the medium to long term, we have set the percentage of women in new graduates hired in Japan as one of our human capital KPIs, complementing our KPIs for management and other decision-making positions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe percentage of management positions filled by women has been steadily increasing through active promotion of women to management positions and enhanced training. On the other hand, many female employees are anxious or resistant to the idea of participating in management, and it remains a challenge to find ways to eliminate anxiety in this segment of the workforce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn order to resolve issues toward the achievement of our targets, we will continue to provide internal and external networking opportunities and to communicate the appeal of management through talks and roundtable discussions by employee role models.\n\n## \u20dd Promotion of employees hired outside Japan\n\nIn order to maintain and increase the percentage of management positions filled by employees hired outside Japan, we are working to improve the global literacy of Head Office personnel who interface with offices outside Japan, and we are formulating a training and succession plan for employees hired outside Japan. Beyond visualizing positions that deal with ex-Japan operations at our Head Office in Tokyo, assigning people with international experience, and providing intensive language training, we have also invited succession candidates hired outside Japan to Head Office to receive management candidate training jointly with candidates from Japan, as well as provided opportunities to discuss management issues.\n\n## Percentage of management positions outside Japan filled by employees hired outside Japan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther promotion of locally hired managers is necessary to drive our diversifying global business, leading us to set this as a human capital KPI.\n\nThe target has been achieved and the percentage is steadily increasing. However, systematic training of candidates for appointment is key to maintaining this percentage.\n\nWe will work to establish a framework for training candidates for promotion, including personnel transfers between offices, and to improve global literacy at Head Office.\n\nCurrent status\n\nGoing forward\n\n## \u20dd Securing and retaining mid-career hires in Japan\n\nThe percentage of mid-career hires in Japan has increased significantly in recent years, and we have focused on attracting personnel in priority areas, particularly digital transformation. As a result, the percentage of management positions filled by mid-career hires has reached 16%, and we will continue to strengthen retention and proactive hiring.\n\nAppendix\n\nBusiness portfolio\n\n(business strategies by in-house company)",

        "page_content": "## Becoming an organization that better enables our people to understand and elevate each other as they exercise their individuality\n\nTo enable our people to flourish, we must ensure diversity at the decision-making level and also create an environment in which every employee can succeed in their own way, while understanding and elevating their colleagues. In aiming to create a workplace where everyone can work comfortably and grow autonomously, we have established a diverse range of channels and opportunities for employees, including Employee Resource Groups (ERG), an internal network that encourages self-driven endeavors through interpersonal connection; Mizuho Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Month, a series of employee-led projects and events to promote DEI; and an 'alumni network' bringing together current and former Mizuho employees in Japan.\n\n## \u20dd An environment that supports childcare and family care while working\n\nBased on our recognition that supporting a balance between work and child/family care is key to a good work environment, we are continuously improving systems for flexible work styles that are not restricted by time or location, as well as implementing training programs to facilitate understanding of these systems. In particular, in preparation for a significant increase in the number of employees balancing work and family care, we conducted a questionnaire and training session on the family care experience and how to balance it with work. With regard to childcare, we are also focused on furthering understanding among colleagues through measures such as training for managers, talks by general managers who have taken childcare leave, and seminars on balancing work and childcare, at which spouses are welcome.\n\n## Percentage of eligible male employees who take childcare leave\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe aim to create a workplace where everyone can work comfortably. As part of this, we encourage men to proactively participate in childcare, and we promote understanding and practice of balancing work and childcare throughout the organization.\n\nThe target has been achieved consistently since FY2022. However, the majority of these leave requests are for short periods, so the challenge is to create an environment that allows employees to take longer periods of leave as desired.\n\nTowards continual, consistent achievement of our target, we will promote systematic leave acquisition and do more to ensure an environment that nurtures understanding among colleagues, including managers.\n\n## \u20dd A workplace where employees with diverse values can play an active role\n\nIn order for everyone to succeed, it is necessary to be proactively inclusive of different types of diversity. Mizuho's initiatives in Japan for inclusion of employees with disabilities and LGBT+ employees offer two examples. For employees with disabilities, we have been building a work environment in which these employees can demonstrate their skills and individuality. We have been doing this not only by providing support, but also by cultivating greater understanding among colleagues.\n\nFor LGBT+ employees, Mizuho has received the PRIDE Index gold rating for eight consecutive years due to our ongoing efforts to improve the workplace environment and further acceptance. We foster a culture in which the organization and employees work together to promote understanding. At the same time, we are still in the process of eliminating unconscious bias in the workplace, and we will continue to raise awareness to ensure that our organization is one in which each employee's sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) is respected.\n\nReceived the top rating of gold for eight years in a row\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u20dd Expanding networking beyond the boundaries of the organization: Alumni\n\nWe are continuing to expand our Japan network of former Mizuho employees ('alumni') who are now flourishing in diverse fields outside Mizuho. In addition, since fiscal 2023, we have been trialing business collaborations that aim to create new businesses and contribute to society by connecting current employees with alumni. Alongside this, we are proactively lowering the barriers to former employees rejoining Mizuho, including through a dedicated contact point that was set up in fiscal 2021. In recognition of these efforts, we received the grand prize at the Japan Alumni Awards 2023 for the second year in a row.\n\nReceived the grand prize for the second year in a row.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Pursuit of employee well-being\n\nWe believe that ensuring and promoting physical and mental health on an ongoing basis is a part of enabling every employee to work to their full potential. Mizuho supports employee well-being in terms of both physical and mental health and wellness, which raises employees' productivity and motivates them to take on new challenges. Our support also extends to financial health and wellness, helping employees avoid financial worries in the future.\n\n## Physical and mental health: Formulating a strategic map to achieve health-focused management in Japan\n\nAs part of realizing our vision for health and productivity management in Japan, in fiscal 2023, we formulated a health and productivity management strategy map to visualize the links between our goals and measures. Health awareness among employees is improving, thanks in part to the effects of our internal Health Promotion Month and various other measures. Conversely, the number of employees taking leave due to mental health issues has also been on the rise, so we are focusing on initiatives that lead to early detection of such issues and strengthening support for employees to return to work. We recognize there is a need for further efforts, as the percentage of absenteeism 1 (the percentage of employees who have been absent from work for 30 or more calendar days after the start of sick leave, excluding paid leave) is still at 1.8%, the same level as in fiscal 2022.\n\n- 1. Although we are aiming for improvement, rest should be taken when necessary, and monitoring and factor analysis should be conducted without setting targets at this time.\n\n## Presenteeism 2\n\nWe set this as a new human capital KPI because we believe that reducing presenteeism is essential to increasing productivity through health management measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Percentage of paid annual leave taken by employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvery employee needs sufficient time off if they are to work productively and actively. To further improve the mental and physical health of our employees, from fiscal 2024 we will raise our target for the percentage of paid annual leave taken by employees to 80%.\n\n- 2.  Assuming the condition of no illness or injury to be 100%, this asks the employee to assess as a percentage their condition for the past four weeks. The shortfall from 100% (percentage lost) is set as a KPI.\n\nCurrent status\n\nGoing forward\n\nCurrent status\n\nGoing forward\n\nSince this is somewhat higher than the average level and may lead to more sick leave being taken in the future, we must implement ongoing efforts, including measures for prevention and early detection.\n\nIn addition to continuing our efforts to help employees improve their lifestyles, we will strengthen manager support systems and assistance for individual health management in order to facilitate prevention and detection of diseases at an early stage.\n\nThe percentage of paid annual leave taken remained steadily above the target as in fiscal 2022. However, the percentage varies between different teams, offices, departments, and divisions, and the challenge now is to create an environment where employees anywhere in the organization and in any role are able to take leave.\n\nTowards achieving the new target, we will continue employing work style reform consulting services to increase work efficiency and productivity as we work on normalizing the taking of leave throughout Mizuho.\n\n## \u20dd Health and productivity management strategy map\n\n| Aims of health and productivity  management

This will then allow them to enjoy connecting with others and demonstrating their strengths and individuality. The success of these employees is a source of increased corporate value. Business growth creates a virtuous cycle in which employees attain greater job satisfaction, while a positive corporate culture leads to sound organizational management and reduced risk. As part of realizing these, we conduct regular employee surveys to identify employees' attitudes and situations, and respond to them swiftly.\n\n## Signs of change in employee mindsets, but corporate culture still in development\n\nIn fiscal 2023, all of our KPIs improved as a result of steady implementation of measures to firmly establish our Corporate Identity among employees and improve communication. Overall, however, there is still some way to go, especially toward achieving two of our human capital KPIs (for the engagement and inclusion scores).\n\nIn addition, about 20% of employees felt that their overall experience working at Mizuho did not meet their expectations, indicating that some do not fully understand how their work is connected to Mizuho's strategies and organizational goals.\n\nWhen asked if they intended to continue working for Mizuho, only about 10% of employees responded 'No', indicating that few have strong intentions to leave the company.

We extracted the following four issues for the group to address as a whole by looking at the absolute values of scores, including analyzing comments, and the degree of deviation from the average level among Japanese companies.\n\n## \u20dd Strategy communication\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we held town hall meetings and other events and sent out messages from executive management to instill in our employees a sense of ownership over our redefined Corporate Identity, but it still has not yet fully resonated with some employees. We believe that this is due to the fact that employees perceive messages differently depending on their duties and situation. We will continue to collect direct comments from employees to thoroughly understand the circumstances of each team and employee and take prompt measures so that every employee will be able to feel the changes that are occurring.\n\n## \u20dd Improving communication\n\nWe have taken steps to foster a corporate culture that encourages self-driven endeavors and a sense of unity through mutual recognition of diverse personalities, and employees now feel better about the quality of communication. On the other hand, there are still challenges in interorganizational cooperation and mutual understanding between Head Office and the frontlines. Although all employees are equal in providing value to customers, the economy, and society, some employees feel there is a hierarchy between positions and sections, which is a sentiment we are working to eliminate.\n\n## \u20dd Achievement of career goals\n\nAiming to help our employees achieve their career goals, our new HR framework in Japan encourages employees to grow through their own endeavors and rewards their contributions. However, the reality is that employees have responded to this system with a mixture of expectation and concern. Also, it is clear that employees are not fully satisfied with their own evaluations and transfers due to a lack of dialogue with their managers. We believe that this is due to middle management lacking the skills and abilities to support employee growth, as well as lacking time to devote to management tasks.

Dialogue between management and employees is one example. In fiscal 2023, we have had more direct contact and dialogue between management and employees than ever before. With the commitment of management, we will quickly implement measures to address issues identified from employee insights and verify the effectiveness of such measures through repeated dialogue.\n\nIn addition, as an initiative to promote dialogue among employees, we are pursuing organizational development that strengthens collaborative employee relationships and improves organizational effectiveness. Ongoing dialogue furthers psychological safety and mutual understanding, leading to better coordination at work and collaborative processes. This results in a greater sense of job satisfaction and fosters a sense of unity in the organization.\n\nDialogue between colleagues from offices outside Japan and Group CCuO Akita\n\n<!-- image -->",

Mizuho has steadily built up its initiatives in these regards, aiming to contribute to sustainable growth worldwide.\n\nAmong the most important challenges we are addressing are responses to climate change. Aiming to contribute to achieving net zero by 2050, we have established a Net Zero Transition Plan and are taking an integrated approach to facilitating transition in the real economy, capturing business opportunities, and managing risk. To achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through financing and investment, we increased the sectors for which we set medium-term GHG emissions reduction targets and we are engaging with clients on these targets. At the same time, we are bolstering our risk management framework to enable us to gain an accurate understanding of client progress on transition risk responses and assist them as required.\n\nThe transition to a decarbonized society is also an opportunity to enhance the competitiveness of Japan's industry by supporting our clients' structural transformation and practical application of next-generation technologies. Having set a sustainable finance target of \u00a5100 trillion to provide funding needed for transition, we are providing risk capital for groundbreaking business sectors.\n\nOur implementation of these initiatives is underpinned by collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders and each employee's high level of knowledge and awareness regarding our course of action. We are focusing on capability building by engaging in dialogue with employees in branches, offices, and other workplaces.\n\nWe will proactively innovate together with our clients and stakeholders for a prosperous and sustainable future, as stated in our Purpose.\n\n## Overview of sustainability initiatives\n\nAims\n\nWe will contribute to environmental conservation and the sustainable development and prosperity of the economy, industry, and society both in Japan and around the world. Also, we will engage in management practices that take into consideration value creation for various stakeholders and will work to enhance our corporate value through the sustainable and steady growth of the Mizuho group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability promotion structure\n\nWe discuss at the business execution line, e.g., the Sustainability Promotion Committee and Executive Management Committee, with supervision by the Board of Directors and Risk Committee.\n\nThe Group CSuO reports directly to the Group CEO, and plans and promotes group-wide sustainability initiatives. Further, under the Group Chief Risk Officer (Group CRO), we strengthen our system for conducting centralized sustainability-related risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirections and actions to promote initiatives\n\nGroup companies",

Scenario analyses  \u25b6   We added cement, chemicals, and automotive (suppliers) to the sectors for which we conduct transition risk analysis.\n\nRisk control in carbon-related sectors  \u25b6   During fiscal 2024, we will add GHG emissions reduction performance and alignment of targets and results with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway as criteria for evaluating the status of clients' transition risk responses. The Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity (ES Policy)  \u25b6   We revised the activity policy for human rights issues, weapons and arms, and coal-fired power generation and added specific sectors (mining, woody biomass power generation, fisheries, and aquaculture).\n\nScope 3 (emissions from financing and investment)  \u25b6   Set medium-term Scope 3 targets for the automotive, maritime transportation, steel, and real estate sectors. Completed initial target setting based on NZBA guidelines. Other disclosure items aside from the monitored metrics  \u25b6   Made trial measurements of facilitated emissions (emissions from capital market activities).\n\nWe expanded our existing TCFD Report to create the Climate & Nature-related Report, which provides comprehensive disclosure on Mizuho's climate- and nature-related information in line with the recommendations of both the TCFD and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\n\n## Governance\n\n- \u20dd  We built a supervision and business execution governance framework that centers on the Board of Directors (P. 57  Sustainability promotion structure).\n-   Supervision: The Board of Directors and Risk Committee conduct oversight regarding information that is reported to them and deliberated following discussions at the business execution line.\n-   Business execution: The Sustainability Promotion Committee, Risk Management Committee, and Executive Management Committee deliberate and discuss, then report to the Board of Directors.\n- \u20dd The Group CSuO and Group CRO move forward initiatives in each field under the management of the Group CEO.\n- \u20dd  Sustainability-related indicators have been adopted for evaluating executive compensation. These indicators include sustainable finance amount, climate change initiatives, and assessments by ESG rating agencies.

risk using a risk appetite framework and a comprehensive risk management framework.\n- \u20dd Risk control in carbon-related sectors (P. 60   Climate-related risk management):\n- - We have established a risk control framework to assess and monitor the degree of risks for each client along two axes-(1) client sectors and (2) progress of response to transition risks.\n- - We control exposure in high-risk areas by promoting transition through engagement and assistance.\n- \u20dd Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity (ES policy) :  We have established

To that end, we are promoting digital transformation, having consolidated our associated functions-which were previously scattered throughout the group-under the Group CDO in April 2023.\n\nSpecifically, we have made generative AI available for use by employees and carried out a digital transformation employee development program. Other measures have included reinforcing our services and channels by boosting standards and efficiency in businesses and operations leveraging digital technologies. Examples of this include launching a system offering the right service via the right channel at the right time for each individual customer, and improving the usability of the Mizuho Wallet app, which consolidates payment functions. In addition, we are starting to see new business projects resulting from the Mizuho Group CEO Challenge, our business contest in which employees propose new ideas.\n\nHowever, our endeavors have only just begun. Digital technologies have the potential to not only change our lifestyles and behavioral patterns, but also to significantly impact the nature of financial services and the way we work. We are therefore helping to forge a prosperous future by building beneficial partnerships with a diverse array of companies and individuals.\n\nEnhancement of our group-wide digital transformation foundations\n\nDigital transformation of our business and operations\n\nNew business creation\n\n- \u25cf Strengthen research and development (R&D) in AI and other cutting-edge technologies, and leverage these technologies in our business\n- \u25cf Enhance capacity to promote digital transformation group-wide by steadily progressing our digital transformation employee development program\n- \u25cf Upgrade data utilization, governance, and digital architecture in unison and reinforce frameworks\n- \u25cf Instill a culture of implementing work style digital transformation and other forms of digital transformation\n- \u25cf Accelerate digital transformation (through use of AI, operational reform, etc.) for both customers and internal operations by strategically selecting business domains and projects in which to focus and optimize resources For customers : Improve customer experiences\n- For internal operations : Boost operational efficiency and standards\n- \u25cf Generate new value through increased collaboration with other companies, primarily via partnerships with startups and use of corporate venture capital (CVC)\n- \u25cf Encourage employee-centered proposals for new business ideas and commercialize such ideas",

Efforts to that end include strengthening R&D in AI and other cutting-edge technologies, and leveraging these technologies in our business; developing digital transformation personnel; upgrading data utilization and governance; and instilling a culture that implements work style digital transformation and other forms of digital transformation.\n\n## Encouraging AI use at work\n\nIn June 2023, we used Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to launch 'Wiz Chat', our own version of ChatGPT, for use by employees in Japan. With templates to access assistance for different purposes (creating presentation materials, brainstorming, translation, etc.), even beginners were able to take advantage of it. It is now an integral part of many employees' day to day.\n\nIn August 2023, we held an 'ideathon' on using generative AI at work, which saw a return of more than 2,000 ideas from employees both inside and outside Japan. Ten particularly outstanding ideas were selected as winners, and we are already in the verification phase ahead of their implementation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs AI technologies continue their rapid advancement, we can expect them to offer an even greater scope for use in the future. We will continue to keep close watch on the latest developments, and identify any business domains suited to take advantage of them.\n\n## Digital transformation employee development\n\nPromoting digital transformation throughout the group requires training a broad range of employees. In conjunction with this, we need to make use of cutting-edge digital technologies and organize teams with high levels of expertise to boost our competitiveness. Mizuho is pursuing both of these approaches simultaneously.\n\nIn fiscal 2023 we launched our digital transformation employee development program for Japan and have now begun promoting it across the group. The program offers five levels of certification for (1) digital transformation personnel who have high-level digital expertise and are capable of leading clients' and Mizuho's transformation, and (2) digital transformation basics personnel who are literate in digital transformation and are capable of applying it to their own work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe endeavor to develop digital transformation basics personnel by encouraging as many employees as possible to take part in the training. With more and more employees now eager to do so group-wide, we set a KPI for the end of fiscal 2025 of reaching 1,000 employees certified at Lv. 2-the minimum level required to be officially literate in digital transformation. At the end of fiscal 2023 this was already at 924 employees, demonstrating significant group-wide awareness and commitment.\n\nIn terms of developing personnel with high-level expertise, we set a KPI for the end of fiscal 2025 of reaching 100 employees certified at Lv. 4, and at the end of fiscal 2023, 84 employees had already acquired certification, primarily through working on actual projects. However, one issue is that, despite employees needing opportunities to practice what they are learning within actual projects, we are currently unable to provide enough of these opportunities internally. In order to continue promoting digital transformation, therefore, we are addressing such issues as part of our efforts to improve initiatives in this regard.\n\n\u25b6 P. 49  Building a talent portfolio to implement growth strategy (within 'Human capital management')\n\nAppendix",

Further, in January 2024, we launched hyper-personalized marketing as an initiative aimed at offering the right service via the right channel at the right time for each individual customer.\n\nHowever, alongside these initiatives demonstrating progress in digital transformation itself, we are also facing a range of challenges in the stages prior to its full launch. To accelerate our digital transformation initiatives going forward, we will strategically select business domains and projects, including those in which we face such challenges, focusing and optimizing resources in these areas. Having consolidated the functions of Mizuho Research & Technologies and Mizuho-DL Financial Technology under the Group CDO in fiscal 2023, we will pursue the initiatives of both to provide better services, with a long-term view to achieving full digital transformation in the future.\n\n## Mizuho Wallet revamp: Improving our app's UI & UX and consolidating payment services\n\nIn May 2024, we released an updated version of the Mizuho Wallet app, our cashless payment system, offering a broader range of payment services. In addition to the services already provided previously, Mizuho Wallet can now be used to pay using credit cards, debit cards, prepaid e-money cards for transportation and shopping, and Mizuho's own smartphone payment application. We also revamped the design and usability, making it easier for customers to choose their preferred payment method. We are currently considering how to better connect the app to a range of banking services such as account opening.\n\nWe will continue working to improve our services, accelerating the integration of the real world (branch-based) and the digital (app-based) to enable customers to transact with us more conveniently.\n\nA digital wallet app enabling both payments and checking of statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Launch of hyper-personalized marketing\n\nIn January 2024, we launched hyper-personalized marketing. This is a service that analyzes customer information, financial data, and behavioral data, and uses the results to offer the right information at the right time through the right channel, rather than standardized one-size-fits-all information. This service was created by taking advantage of a digital marketing platform that can process a variety of data rapidly and securely.\n\nAfter launching the service, we notified customers who had used Mizuho Direct about consent to personalized services.

Under a holding company, we have five in-house companies with the aim of better providing services that meet client needs in a timely manner.\n\nMizuho strives to allocate corporate resources to the in-house companies optimally in line with group strategy, seeking to achieve sustained, stable growth in the corporate value of the entire Mizuho group through the individual in-house companies' provision of services for customers. We maintain disciplined financial management by setting targets for each in-house company (including profitability, ROE, and expense ratios) in line with group-wide financial targets, as well as the business characteristics and operating environment of each in-house company, and monitoring progress toward these targets during the fiscal year. Furthermore, each in-house company provides optimal solutions to customers by focusing allocation of corporate resources such as expenses, personnel, and risk-weighted assets (RWA) on domains in which it can leverage its own strengths based on an in-house company strategy linked to the group strategy.\n\nMizuho pursues measures to improve our entire business portfolio's resilience to changes in markets and the economic environment by pursuing capital efficiency and growth, expanding our stable revenue base and diversifying our revenue sources, as well as improving the distribution and complementary effects of revenue within in-house companies, or among business domains spanning multiple in-house companies. Under the medium-term business plan launched in fiscal 2023, we will aim to achieve our financial targets in terms of Consolidated ROE, Consolidated Net Business Profits, and Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent by making constant efforts to optimize our portfolio in line with the characteristics of individual in-house companies, thereby establishing a more resilient business portfolio possessing a combination of growth potential, efficiency, and stability.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, though we realized mark-to-market losses related to the securities portfolio in light of the market environment, we achieved steady profit growth and improved our Consolidated ROE through business expansion in investment banking and solutions, as well as an increase in interest income from foreign currency deposits on the back of persistently high US interest rates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consolidated ROE 1\n\n1.

A particular point of examination was whether or not Mizuho's employees have fully adopted the thinking behind the business strategy and begun specifically implementing it towards facilitating Mizuho's vision for the future.\n\nIn business terms, it is important that Mizuho take concrete action based on the strategy and implement a PDCA cycle in line with changes in the business environment. Therefore, the Board of Directors engaged in thorough discussions with the heads of in-house companies and the CEOs of group companies to ascertain the state of business. In discussions on sustainable business strategy, mass-market retailing strategy, advancement of digital transformation, and other individual areas, we took up multiple issues. Outside directors shared their views on topics such as the adequacy of planning to achieve the strategy, the setting and evaluation of multifaceted KPIs linked to Mizuho's Purpose and Values, and the effectiveness of frameworks for encouraging the aforementioned concrete action on the part of employees.\n\nAdditionally, regarding corporate foundations, the most critical aspect of ensuring even more sustainable, stable, and robust business operations is changes in individual employees' mindsets and day-to-day behavior in the workplace. In order to understand the progress of corporate culture transformation and changes in employees' mindsets across the group, we continued gathering information through a wide range of channels. Among these were off-site meetings, workplace visits, conversations with management and employees, and meetings with outside directors from the banking, trust banking, and securities arms.\n\n## \u00b7 IT / Digital Transformation Committee\n\nTo move forward debate on IT and digital transformation areas, which are a source of competitiveness, we have set up the IT / Digital Transformation Committee as an advisory body to the Board of Directors. On top of monitoring stable IT system operations, this\n\ncommittee holds vigorous discussions about the importance of implementing digital transformation in tandem with the business strategy, which is essential to overcoming obstacles to the business application of IT and digital transformation and establishing a competitive position.\n\n## Operation of the Board of Directors in fiscal 2024\n\n## \u00b7 Awareness of the business environment as Chairperson of the Board of Directors\n\nWhile there were changes in the external environment, including the Bank of Japan scrapping its negative interest rate policy and the yen continuing its sharp fall, I see the first fiscal year of the medium-term business plan as having gone relatively well. To firmly establish and accelerate this momentum and attain further growth, Mizuho must ceaselessly continue to challenge itself. Mizuho's foresight, looking as far as 10 years into the future, will be of increased importance.\n\n## \u00b7 Key points for fiscal 2024\n\nI believe discussions on the growth strategy from a medium- to long-term perspective, continued development of human capital, and initiatives to change employees' mindsets will cultivate the foresight of everyone in all areas of the organization. For fiscal 2024, the Board of Directors will place topics relevant to the medium- to long-term growth strategy at the center of discussions. We will increase opportunities for talks with the business execution line and support them in their endeavors by holding in-depth discussions, including on how Mizuho is leveraging its advantages to differentiate itself; whether or not individual employees are able to raise concerns and put that towards changing their behavior; whether or not Mizuho is utilizing its various resources to their maximum effectiveness; and what Mizuho is doing to cultivate talent that will support strategy implementation.\n\nIn order for Mizuho to provide lasting value to customers, the economy and society, and employees, I will, as Chairperson of the Board of Directors, make every effort to accelerate Mizuho's initiatives for growth so that Mizuho will be able to continue growing hand in hand with all stakeholders.",

This reflects factors including the changes in the environment surrounding Japan's Corporate Governance Code and the potential impact on our financial position associated with stock market volatility risk.\n- \u00b7 We consider cross-shareholdings to be meaningful if they contribute to the maintenance and improvement of the corporate value of issuers and the Mizuho group based on their growth potential, outlook, or revitalization perspectives or as a result of studies on present and future economic feasibility and profitability.\n- \u00b7 We will regularly and continually examine whether shares held as cross-holdings are meaningful, and we will dispose of holdings determined to be deficient in meaning with due regard to the impact on the market and other matters. Through dialogue with the issuing companies, we will also reduce even those holdings we consider to be meaningful.\n\n\u25b6 For reductions in cross-shareholdings, see p. 37 Financial highlights\n\n## Process for assessing whether cross-shareholding is meaningful\n\nTaking into account our Policy Regarding Mizuho Financial Group's Cross-shareholdings of Other Listed Companies, we assess whether crossshareholding is meaningful using the process outlined below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Criteria of quantitative assessment:\n\n- \u00b7 We determine holdings to be meaningful when the client's total pro/fit 1 divided by risk capital 2 exceeds a hurdle rate based on the cost of capital plus a premium\n- 1.  After deducting credit costs, expenses, funding costs, etc.\n- 2.  'Risk' accounts for a combination of credit risk, stock market volatility risk, etc.\n\n## Criteria of comprehensive assessment:\n\n- \u00b7 Whether or not it is possible to improve pro/fitability and to meet the criteria through dialogue with the client\n- \u00b7 Consideration is given to cases where clients are taking corporate revitalization measures\n- \u00b7 We will continue to hold the shares of clients if those shares meet certain profitability standards based on a quantitative assessment. However, in light of factors including the changes in the environment surrounding Japan's Corporate Governance Code and the potential impact on our financial position associated with stock market volatility risk, we are working to reduce our cross-shareholdings through dialogue with our clients.\n- \u00b7 For those shares that also fall short of profitability standards based on a comprehensive assessment, we will draw on our relationship of trust with the client in order to engage with them in constructive dialogue. If improvements in profitability can be made as a result, we will continue to hold the shares, but if improvement is not possible, we will negotiate with the client regarding the sale of the shares.\n- \u00b7 We periodically confirm the status of negotiations for the sale of cross-shareholdings, client efforts to improve profitability, and other matters. Additionally, once per year at a meeting of the Board of Directors, we conduct an assessment of whether it is meaningful to maintain shares of each of the stocks listed in Japan that we are holding.\n- \u00b7 In our assessment of cross-shareholdings as of the end of March 2023, of stocks listed in Japan that we are holding (\u00a5997.3 billion in total as of the end of March 2023), around 30% did not meet the standards for continued holding. The results of the assessment may vary based on our business relationship with the client, the market environment, and other factors at the time of assessment, but we will continue to work steadily to reduce our cross-shareholdings.\n- \u00b7 Note that we also conduct a similar assessment for deemed holdings of shares (e.g., shares contributed to the employee retirement benefit trust).\n\n## Standards Regarding the Exercise of Voting Rights Associated with Cross-shareholdings\n\n- \u00b7 Mizuho Financial Group and the Three Core Companies will exercise voting rights after comprehensive consideration of whether an issuing company has established effective corporate governance and is making appropriate decisions to improve its corporate value over the medium to long term. We will also consider any impact to our own corporate value.\n- \u00b7 Further, if we are unable to agree on proposals made by issuing companies, we may consider disposing of our shareholdings.\n- \u00b7 We will consider specific proposals through dialogue with the issuing companies and studies conducted by our own specialized departments. In particular, when these proposals could affect corporate value or shareholder interests, we will decide on the exercise of voting rights after comprehensive consideration of the purposes of the proposals and the issuing company's approach to improving corporate value.",

From the perspective of ensuring the effectiveness of the supervisory function, compensation for non-executive officers responsible for management supervision shall, in principle, consist of only Base Compensation and Stock Compensation I, with respect to which the details of the payment is not changed due to, among other reasons, our business results.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                                         |                         |                                   |                                                                           |                | Example of composition of compensation                 |                           |     |                         |     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----|-------------------------|-----|\n| Compensation type                                                                                       |                         | Performance-linked or not (range) | Payment timing                                                            | Payment method | Executive of/ficers responsible for business execution |                           |     | Non-executive of/ficers |     |\n|                                                                                                         |                         |                                   |                                                                           |                |                                                        | Group executive of/ficers |     |                         |     |\n| Base Compensation\u00b9 Not linked                                                                           |                         |                                   |                                                                           |                | Group CEO 55%                                          |                           | 55% |                         |     |\n|                                                                                                         |                         |                                   |                                                                           | Cash Monthly   | 40% 40%                                                | 5%                        |     | 85%                     | 85% |\n|                                                                                                         | Stock  Compensation I 2 | Not linked Linked (0 - 150%)      | Time of resignation Deferred payment over three years                     | Stock          | 5%                                                     | 17.5%                     |     |                         |     |\n| Medium- to Long-term Incentive Compensation Stock Compensation II 3 Short-term Incentive Compensation 4 |                         | Linked (0 - 150%)                 | starting the /fiscal year after next Lump sum in the next  /fiscal year 5 | Stock Cash     | 60% 22.5% 25% 30%                                      |                           | 45% | 15%                     | 15% |\n\nSubject to malus and clawback 6\n\n- 1.

We have addressed each top risk with a variety of controls,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthree of which we will focus on here as they relate to the core topics of the medium-term business plan.\n\nFirst, our readiness for an increasingly unpredictable global financial and economic environment. With regard to credit risk, we simulate and examine the impact of rising interest rates on the macroeconomy and corporate earnings, and take risks based on an appropriate risk-return calculation. In addition, despite the volatile market environment, with the yen at historic lows against the dollar, we are monitoring trends in different countries' financial policies and working to control market and liquidity risks with a forward-looking approach, drawing on lessons learned from the market volatility caused by rapid interest rate hikes in the US and Europe in recent years.\n\nSecond is global risk management. The acquisition of Greenhill in the Americas is an example of our group's expansion of the global CIB business. We are also strengthening our risk management systems in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC to provide banking and securities functions globally.\n\nFinally, we are strengthening our corporate foundations. We must improve readiness in areas of growing risk, such as cybersecurity, and also be vigilant against new risks due to the rapid spread of AI. In order to provide stable financial services, we will strive to improve risk management also from the perspective of operational resilience.\n\nIn the context of unprecedented uncertainty around the globe, this will be an important year for us to assess the global environment in a forward-looking manner under our risk appetite framework, and to execute our strategy through flexible and appropriate risk-taking and risk control. We will comprehensively assess and evaluate risks and opportunities in order to proceed with appropriate risk management on a group and global basis.\n\n## Top risks\n\n| Resurgence of inflation and economic slowdown in the US and Europe   | Rising prices, interest rates, and expanding fiscal concerns in Japan   | Escalating US-China conflict and sluggish Chinese economy   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Global decoupling and growing geopolitical risks                     | Worsening impact of climate change                                      | IT system failures                                          |\n| Cyberattacks                                                         | Money laundering / Financing of terrorism                               | Improper acts and omissions by executive officers/employees |\n| Stagnation of sustainable growth due to talent shortages             | Changes in the competitive environment                                  | (As of March 2024)                                          |",

Through our RAF, we manage strategy and risk in an integrated manner and aim to achieve the optimal risk and return through appropriate risk-taking and risk control.\n\nIn the actual implementation of our RAF, the Board of Directors determines basic matters concerning the RAF and also decides on a risk appetite statement (RAS), which documents the RAF's management system and Mizuho's risk appetite. Operations are supervised based on the Board's decisions. In addition, the Risk Committee, which advises the Board of Directors, provides advice to the Board on matters concerning the RAF and related topics. In business operations, the Group CRO, Group CFO, and Group CSO provide assistance overseen by the Group CEO, and implement business strategy, financial strategy, and risk management from an overall perspective.\n\nRisk appetite is determined through management discussions on top risks and other potential risk events, which are then incorporated into baseline scenarios and risk scenarios that are shared internally. Based on our awareness of these internal and external environments, we then formulate a risk appetite policy consistent with the medium-term and fiscal year business plans. Also, regarding capital adequacy, profitability, and liquidity, we set the quantitative risk appetite indices and their levels. The risk appetite policy as well as the risk appetite indices and their levels are determined by the Board of Directors. The risk appetite operating conditions are regularly monitored and reported to the Board of Directors. The risk appetite is also revised as necessary when there are changes in the environment or strategies.\n\n## Mizuho's risk management system\n\n<!-- image -->",

We can confirm whether our capital adequacy ratio, performance, and other indicators are sufficient in the case that stress events actually materialize. If such indicators fall below the necessary level, we reconsider and revise our risk appetite and business plans. In addition, we calculate the impact on risk levels, including interest rate risk in the banking book, and confirm the balance between this risk capital and owned capital at the post-stress stage to assess the adequacy of the capital level.\n\nIn addition, to structure robust risk management systems, stress testing is also used to manage risk in various risk categories, such as liquidity risk and market risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mizuho's capital adequacy stress testing\n\n1.

In the interest of clarifying how the check-and-balance system applies to the Group Chief Information Officer (Group CIO) as part of our second line of defense, the Group CISO reports to both the Group CIO and Group Chief Risk Officer (Group CRO). We are striving to enhance our cybersecurity posture by implementing this system of double reporting. The Group CISO, as the person responsible for cybersecurity risk management, reports to the Executive Management Committee and Board of Directors the progress of the various measures taken, and works with management to review cybersecurity policies and resource allocation in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.

SOC detects suspicious activity to identify potential threats using a 24-hour, 365-day monitoring framework, while MizuhoCIRT shares information with internal and external partners to better handle incident response, investigation, and recovery based on the information received from SOC.\n\nThese specialist units have established a procedure for responding to different cyberattack methods, and are constantly conducting internal and external training and drills to properly respond to any incident.\n\n- 1.

We take measures to ensure consistent security throughout the system development lifecycle, from planning through development and operation.\n\nOur systems have a virus analysis and a multi-layered defense mechanism, and we are working to strengthen our resilience by implementing TLPT 1 to test the effectiveness of these technical measures and the effectiveness of the response process.\n\nIn order to evaluate the maturity of these cybersecurity measures, we refer to third party assessment by the Cybersecurity Assessment Tool of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and the Cybersecurity Framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n- 1.

We have also prepared the Conduct Guidelines for Compliance setting out the model of conduct we are required to follow. Mizuho ensures that all executive officers and employees are fully acquainted with both the Code of Conduct and the Conduct Guidelines for Compliance through ongoing training and messages from management.\n\nWe monitor the status of compliance levels through self-assessments by each department and monitoring conducted by the compliance department of each company. In addition, every fiscal year, each of our group companies formulates a compliance program which is a concrete, practical plan for enhancing the compliance framework, conducting training, checks, and the like in light of changes in the global market transaction environment and increasing demands such as for prevention of money laundering and protection and management of personal information on a global basis. Progress on the compliance program is monitored every six months.\n\nWe are committed to implementing a compliance framework to practice fair and honest corporate activities in order to live up to the trust of our customers and society, and we are constantly aware of the weight of our social responsibility and public mission as a provider of economic and social infrastructure.\n\n- \u20dd  We are committed to enhancing our compliance framework in light of changes in the environment and increasing demands globally.

In light of these trends, measures for anti-money laundering (AML), combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), and counter-proliferation financing (CPF) are extremely important. Against this backdrop, the key challenge for financial institutions is the strengthening of their AML/CFT/CPF measures. Mizuho considers money laundering / financing of terrorism to be one of our top risks, and we have formulated a framework to ensure compliance with the related laws and regulations in each jurisdiction. We are also continually enhancing our AML/CFT/CPF measures through discussions at the AML Enhancement Working Group and compliance inspections.\n\nWe ensure that everyone at Mizuho is trained to be aware of the importance of AML/CFT/CPF measures and their roles. By preventing the transfer of criminal proceeds and cutting off the supply of funds to terrorist organizations through these efforts, we contribute to the protection of our customers, the security of the international community, and the sound development of economic activities.\n\nWe have recently been working to prevent and contain damage due to special fraud and investment fraud, both of which are on the rise in Japan, by improving customer awareness, monitoring transactions, and suspending transactions where necessary.\n\nRecognizing the social importance of preventing bribery, corruption, and corrupt practices, Mizuho has formulated a Policy for Anti-Bribery and Corruption and put in place a framework to prevent bribery and other corrupt practices at all group companies.\n\n## Our stance towards organized crime\n\nIn order to prevent organized crime from being involved in our business activities and to prevent any harm caused by organized crime, the Mizuho Code of Conduct includes an economic and social policy covering our zero-tolerance stance on business relationships with individuals or organizations that are in any way associated with organized crime and therefore threaten the order and safety of civil society.\n\nWe have also formed an Anti-Organized Crime Committee which includes external experts in industry-specific, in-depth discussions on this subject, in addition to other initiatives we are implementing on a group-wide basis to ensure that we have no direct or indirect associations with organized crime. Moreover, drawing on the discussions in this committee, these matters are also discussed and reported on at meetings of the compliance committees of Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Trust & Banking, and Mizuho Securities.\n\nFurthermore, core group companies have established departments dedicated to responding to organized crimes, appointed officers responsible for responding to unreasonable demands, formulated a manual on how to manage such issues, and established a framework for conducting training. If required, we consult with third-party experts and authorities on the handling of specific cases.\n\n## Measures for ensuring compliance\n\n## Education and training\n\nAt Mizuho, compliance-related education and training are key measures for ensuring appropriate compliance.\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, Mizuho provided effective training tailored to a broad range of roles within the organization. We conducted e-learning training sessions on specific compliance topics for all employees and role-specific training for each class of positions such as executive officers, general managers, and compliance officers.\n\nIn addition to understanding the rules and procedures, the all-hands training is designed to deepen understanding and to provide points to note regarding responding to compliance risks in a timely manner. We will continue to improve this content going forward with the objective that all staff should be able to understand the principles of compliance based on the purpose and background of the law, and be prepared to take action proactively.\n\nWe are also dedicated to detecting potential compliance issues at the earliest stage possible and taking appropriate action.  Therefore, each group company has established an internal reporting system through which executive officers and employees can directly get in touch with dedicated persons in their company's compliance department, an external law office or an external company specialized in internal reporting.\n\n## Internal reporting system (Compliance hotline)\n\nWe have a group-wide internal reporting system that is available 24 hours a day, every day of the year that connects to external contact points. The system also offers service in English and accepts anonymous reports. In order to ensure that executive officers and employees are fully acquainted with it, we provide in-house training to all staff, and hotline numbers and other relevant information is included on posters within each workplace and distributed to all executive officers and employees on wallet-sized cards. We are working to further improve the effectiveness of the system by regularly disseminating information such as past internal reports without specifying the case, and by taking thorough measures to protect staff who file reports. In fiscal 2023, we received a total of 175 reports through our hotlines via the internal and external contact points, with the response status reported to members of our Audit Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hotline for accounting and auditing\n\nWe have a hotline connecting to an external law office specifically for reporting inappropriate matters pertaining to the internal control and auditing of accounting and financial reports, which is also available to external personnel.",

This was due to growth in interest income, solutions and investment banking-related income, and strong performance in both customer and markets divisions, as well as tailwinds such as high US interest rates and the depreciation of the yen.\n\n## Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProfit Attributable to Owners of Parent increased by \u00a5123.4 billion year-on-year to \u00a5678.9 billion, exceeding the interim revised forecast of \u00a5640 billion. This was due to the increase in Consolidated Net Business Profits and gains on sale of cross-shareholdings and despite recording reserves for credit-related costs from a forward-looking perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consolidated ROE\n\nConsolidated ROE improved by 1.0 percentage point year-on-year to 7.6%, due to the steady growth in Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent as a result of greater capital efficiency.

Loans outside Japan decreased in foreign currency-denominated terms due to the general weakening of demand for financing as a result of high US interest rates and other factors, and Mizuho's selective lending policy, which aims to improve profitability. In yen-denominated terms, loans outside Japan increased due to the weak yen.\n\nDeposits from both individual and corporate customers increased inside and outside Japan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other Securities\n\nWith the end of the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy, the balance of investment in Japanese bonds decreased by \u00a55.7 trillion year-on-year, and the Bank of Japan current account balance increased by \u00a56.3 trillion year-on-year.\n\nForeign bonds increased by \u00a55.0 trillion year-on-year, in part due to the depreciation of the yen.\n\n(\u00a5 trillion)\n\n| 171 (+7.1)                              |                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| RBC Individual 3 RBC Corporate 3 CIBC 3 | 47.1 (+0.8) 32.6 (+1.7) 46.8 (+1.6) |\n\n| Other Liabilities   |\n|---------------------|\n| 96 (+16.1)          |\n\nNet Assets\n\n10 (+1.1)",

In this context, we have carried out a revision of our risk scenarios, changing 'continuation of high inflation and spillover to credit risk' and 'a shift in monetary policy and growing fiscal concerns' to 'resurgence of inflation and economic slowdown in the US and Europe' and 'rising prices, interest rates, and expanding fiscal\n\nconcerns in Japan' respectively, as well as revising the scenarios for 'escalating US-China conflict and sluggish Chinese economy' and 'global decoupling and growing geopolitical risks'. We are also revising risk scenarios for related top risks in light of the potential medium to long-term emergence of risks associated with elevated demands and expectations for financial institutions with regard to loss of nature, and risks arising from the expanding use of AI.\n\nFor designated top risks, we have decided on additional risk control measures, including measures for preventing the designated top risks and follow-up responses, and we are monitoring the status of risk control throughout the fiscal year and reporting to the Risk Committee and Board of Directors.\n\n(Please see p. 93 for more on our management of top risks.)\n\n| Risk event                                                              | Top risks Risk scenario

Specifically, Mizuho Financial Group establishes the group's fundamental credit risk policy to manage major group companies, and monitors and manages the credit risks of the group as a whole.\n\n## Credit risk management structure\n\nOur Board of Directors determines the Mizuho group's basic matters pertaining to credit risk management. In addition, the Risk Management Committee broadly discusses and coordinates matters relating to basic policies and operations in connection with credit risk management and matters relating to credit risk monitoring for the Mizuho group. Under the control of the Group CRO, the Credit Risk Management Department and the Risk Management Department jointly monitor, analyze, and submit suggestions concerning credit risk and formulate and execute plans in connection with basic matters pertaining to credit risk management.\n\nOur principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies manage their credit risk according to the scale and nature of their exposures in line with basic policies set forth by Mizuho Financial Group. The board of directors of each company determines key matters pertaining to credit risk management.\n\n## Credit Risk Management Method\n\nWe have adopted two different but mutually complementary approaches to credit risk management. The first approach is 'individual credit management', in which we manage the process for each individual transaction and individual obligor from execution until collection, based on our assessment of the credit quality of the\n\nobligor. Through this process, we curb losses in the case of a credit event. The second is 'credit portfolio management', in which we utilize statistical methods to assess the potential for losses related to credit risk. Through this process, we identify credit risks and respond appropriately.\n\n## Individual credit management\n\n## 1. Credit codes\n\nThe basic code of conduct for all of our executive officers and employees engaged in the credit business is set forth in our credit code. Seeking to fulfill the bank's mission and social responsibilities, our basic policy for credit business is determined in light of fundamental principles focusing on public welfare, safety, growth, and profitability.\n\n## 2. Internal rating system\n\nOne of the most important elements of the risk management infrastructure of our principal banking subsidiaries is the use of an internal rating system that consists of credit ratings and pool allocations. Credit ratings consist of obligor ratings which represent the level of credit risk of the obligor, and transaction ratings which represent the possibility of ultimately incurring losses related to each individual claim by taking into consideration the nature of any collateral or guarantee and the seniority of the claim.\n\nIn principle, obligor ratings apply to all obligors and are subject to regular reviews at least once a year to reflect promptly the fiscal period end financial results of the obligors, as well as special reviews as required whenever an obligor's credit standing changes. This enables our principal banking subsidiaries to monitor both individual obligors and the status of the overall portfolio in a timely fashion. Because we consider obligor ratings to be an initial phase of the self-assessment process regarding the quality of our loans\n\nand off-balance-sheet instruments, such obligor ratings are closely linked to the obligor classifications and are an integral part of the process for determining the provision for credit losses on loans and charge-offs in our self-assessment of loans and off-balance-sheet instruments. (Please refer to the chart on the next page regarding the connection between obligor ratings, definition of obligor classifications of self-assessments, non-performing loans based on the Banking Act and the Financial Reconstruction Act).\n\nTo assign obligor ratings, we have a quantitative evaluation system (rating model) in place to enable proper assessment of an obligor's credit standing. The system gives a quantitative rating to an obligor based on obligor-specific characteristics such as type of business (corporation or individual) and geography (in Japan or outside Japan). We categorize our rating models for companies in Japan into those for large companies and those for small and mediumsized companies. The former consist of 13 models according to industry-specific factors, while the latter consist of three models. For companies outside Japan, we utilize nine models.\n\nThese were developed by the Credit Risk Management Department based on a statistical methodology and approved by the CRO.\n\nPool allocations are applied to small claims that are less than a specified amount by pooling obligors and claims with similar risk characteristics and assessing and managing the risk for each such\n\nThe Balance Sheet & Risk Management Committee and the Credit Committee, each of which is a business policy committee of our principal banking subsidiaries, are responsible for discussing and coordinating overall management of their individual credit portfolios and transaction policies towards obligors. The respective Chief Risk Officers (CRO) of our principal banking subsidiaries are responsible for matters relating to planning and implementing credit risk management. The credit risk management departments of our principal banking subsidiaries are in charge of planning and administering credit risk management and conducting credit risk measuring and monitoring. Such departments regularly present reports regarding their risk management situation to Mizuho Financial Group. The credit departments of our principal banking subsidiaries determine policies and approve/disapprove individual transactions in terms of credit review, credit management and collection from obligors in accordance with the lines of authority set forth respectively by our principal banking subsidiaries. In addition, our principal banking subsidiaries have established internal audit groups that are independent of the business departments in order to ensure appropriate credit risk management.",

Self-assessment, provision for credit losses on loans and offbalance-sheet instruments and charge-offs\n\nWe conduct self-assessment of assets to ascertain the status of assets both as an integral part of credit risk management and in preparation for appropriate accounting treatment, including provision for credit losses on loans and off-balance-sheet instruments and charge-offs. During the process of selfassessment, obligors are categorized into certain groups taking into consideration their financial condition and their ability to make payments, and credit ratings are assigned to all obligors, in principle, to reflect the extent of their credit risks. The related assets are then categorized into certain classes based on the risk of impairment. This process allows us to identify and control the actual quality of assets and determine the appropriate accounting treatment, including provision for credit losses on loans and off-balance-sheet instruments and charge-offs. Specifically, the credit risk management department of each of our principal subsidiaries is responsible for the overall control of the selfassessment of assets of the respective banking subsidiaries, cooperating with the administrative departments specified for each type of asset, including loan portfolios and securities, in executing and managing self-assessments. In our assessment of the probability of obligor bankruptcy, we deem an obligor that is rated as being insolvent or lower as being bankrupt.\n\n## Credit portfolio management\n\n## 1. Risk measurement\n\nWe use statistical methodologies that involve a risk measurement system (enterprise value corporate valuation model, holding period of one year) to manage the possibility of losses by measuring the expected average loss for a one-year risk horizon ('Expected Loss') and the maximum loss within a certain confidence interval ('Credit VAR'). The difference between Expected Loss and Credit VAR is measured as the credit risk amount ('Unexpected Loss').\n\nThe risk measurement system covers the following account items\n\n## \u25a0 Loss distribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4. Credit review\n\nPrevention of new impaired loans through routine credit management is important in maintaining the quality of our overall loan assets.\n\nCredit review involves analysis and screening of each potential transaction within the relevant business department. In case the screening exceeds the authority of the department, the credit department in charge at headquarters carries out the review. We have specialist departments for different industries, business sizes, and regions, which carry out timely and specialized examinations based on the characteristics of the client and its market, and provide appropriate advice to the business department.\n\nIn addition, in the case of obligors with low credit ratings and high downside risks, the business department and credit department jointly clarify their credit policy and in appropriate cases assist the obligors at an early stage in working towards credit soundness.\n\nreported by each Mizuho Financial Group company: credit transactions including loans and discounts; securities; obligors' liabilities for acceptances and guarantees; deposits and foreign exchange; derivatives including swaps and options; off-balancesheet items including commitments; and other assets involving credit risk.\n\nIn establishing transaction spread guidelines for credit transactions, we aim to ensure an appropriate return from the transaction in light of the level of risk by utilizing credit cost data as a reference.\n\nAlso, we monitor our credit portfolio from various perspectives and set guidelines noted below so that losses incurred through a hypothetical realization of the full Credit VAR would be within the amount of risk capital and loan loss reserves.\n\n## 2. Risk control methods\n\nOur principal banking subsidiaries have established guidelines to manage 'credit concentration risk', which stems from granting excessive credit to certain corporate groups. Our principal banking subsidiaries also set the credit limit based on a verification of the status of capital adequacy. In cases where the limit is exceeded, our principal banking subsidiaries will formulate a handling policy and/or action plan.\n\nIn addition to the above, our principal banking subsidiaries monitor total credit exposure, credit exposure per rating, credit concentration per corporate group, geographic area, and business sector to make a periodical report to the Balance Sheet & Risk Management Committee and the Credit Committee.",

Our definition includes the risk of losses incurred when it becomes impossible to execute transactions in the market because of market confusion or losses arising from transactions at prices that are significantly less favorable than usual.\n\nMizuho Financial Group manages market risk for the Mizuho group as a whole. Specifically, Mizuho Financial Group establishes the fundamental risk management policy for the entire group, manages the market risk of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies, and monitors how the group's market risk is being managed as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market risk management structure\n\nOur Board of Directors determines basic matters pertaining to market risk management policies. The Risk Management Committee of Mizuho Financial Group broadly discusses and coordinates matters relating to basic policies in connection with market risk management, market risk operations, and market risk monitoring. The Group CRO is responsible for matters relating to market risk management planning and operations.\n\nThe Risk Management Department of Mizuho Financial Group is responsible for monitoring market risk, reporting and analyzing, making proposals, setting limits and guidelines, and formulating and implementing plans relating to market risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market risk management method\n\nTo manage market risk, we set limits that correspond to risk capital allocations according to the risk profile of each of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies and thereby prevent the overall market risk we hold from exceeding our financial\n\nstrength represented by capital and other indicators. The amount of risk capital allocated to market risk corresponds to value-at-risk (VAR) and additional costs that may arise in order to close relevant positions.\n\n## Setting limits\n\nWhen the above mentioned limits are set, various factors are taken into account, including business strategies, historical limit usage ratios, risk-bearing capacity (profits, equity capital, and risk management framework), profit targets, and the market liquidity of the products involved. The limits are determined after being discussed and coordinated by the Risk Management Committee,\n\ndiscussed further by the Executive Management Committee. For trading and banking activities, we set limits for VAR and for losses. For banking activities, we set position limits based on interest rate sensitivity (10 BPV) as needed. An excess over any of these limits is immediately reported and addressed according to a pre-determined procedure.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTo provide a system of mutual checks and balances in market operations, we have established middle offices specializing in risk management that are independent of front offices which engage in market transactions and of back offices which are responsible for book entries and settlements. When VAR is not adequate to control\n\nrisk, the middle offices manage risk using additional risk indices, carry out stress testing, and set stop loss limits as needed. We monitor market liquidity risk for individual financial products in the market while taking turnover and other factors into consideration.\n\nAs for the situation of market risk, the Risk Management Department submits reports to our President & Group CEO on a daily basis and to our Board of Directors on a regular basis. For the purpose of managing the market risk of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies, the department regularly receives reports from each of them to properly identify and manage their market risk. These subsidiaries and core group companies, which account for most of the Mizuho group's exposure to market risk, establish their basic policies based on ours, and their boards of directors determine important matters relating to market risk management.",

Past market movement, however, is not necessarily a good indicator of future events, particularly potential future events that are extreme in nature.\n- \u00b7 VAR may underestimate the probability of extreme market movements.\n- \u00b7 The use of a 99.0% confidence level does not take account of, nor makes any statement about, any losses that might occur beyond this confidence level.\n\n- \u00b7 VAR does not capture all complex effects of various risk factors on the value of positions and portfolios and could underestimate potential losses.\n\n## Cross-shareholdings portfolio management activities\n\nWe take the market risk management approach with use of VAR and risk indices for cross-shareholdings portfolio management activities to properly manage stock price risk. Specifically, we monitor VAR measurements and the state of risk capital on a daily basis. Moreover, in order to control stock price risk, we are working on the reduction of cross-shareholdings through careful negotiations with counterparties.\n\n## Back testing\n\nIn order to evaluate the effectiveness of market risk measurements calculated using the VAR method, we carry out regular back tests to compare VAR with assumptive profits and losses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stress testing\n\nBecause the VAR method is based on statistical assumptions, we conduct stress testing to simulate the levels of losses that could be incurred in cases where the market moves suddenly to levels that exceed these assumptions.",

Specifically, Mizuho Financial Group establishes the group's fundamental cybersecurity risk policy to manage major group companies, and monitors and manages the cybersecurity risks of the group as a whole.\n\n## Cybersecurity risk management structure\n\nAt Mizuho Financial Group, the Board of Directors deliberates and resolves fundamental issues related to cybersecurity risk management. The Board of Directors receives reports from the Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) on cybersecurity risks that may have an impact on management policies and strategies, annual business plans, medium- to long-term business plans, etc., other cybersecurity risks that the Board of Directors should be aware of from a medium- to long-term perspective, and important matters such as the status of risk control.\n\nThe Risk Committee and the IT / Digital Transformation Committee, both of which are advisory bodies to the Board of Directors, each receive reports from the Group CRO on the status of comprehensive risk management and from the Group CISO on basic matters related to cybersecurity risk management, evaluate conformity with our basic management policies and the appropriateness of our cyber initiatives, and present recommendations or opinions to the Board of Directors.\n\n## Cybersecurity risk management method\n\nMizuho Financial Group promotes cybersecurity risk management measures across the group, globally and in our supply chains. Specifically, the Mizuho-CIRT 1 and other highly qualified professionals are deployed, and a 24-hour, 365-day a year monitoring system is in place using an integrated SOC 2 , while making full use of intelligence and advanced technologies in cooperation with external specialized agencies.\n\nOur systems have a virus analysis and a multi-layered defense mechanism, and we are working to strengthen our resilience by implementing TLPT 3 to test the effectiveness of these technical measures and the effectiveness of the response process.\n\nWe confirm in advance the security management preparedness of third parties such as cloud service providers that provide outsourcing and cloud services, including their preparedness to respond in the event of a cyber incident. In our day-to-day security management we strive to monitor the occurrence of third-party cyber incidents and respond appropriately to risks\n\nBased on the instructions of the Group CISO, the Cybersecurity Management Department identifies the location and magnitude of possible cybersecurity risks through evaluation informed by the characteristics of our business and systems. It formulates appropriate measures in light of the risks identified, and builds capacity for rapid response in the event of cyberattacks. The department also gathers day-to-day information on increasingly serious cyberattacks and developments in defensive technologies, and works ceaselessly to implement the plans it has formulated for the further enhancement of cybersecurity.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Management Department reports to the Group CISO on the status of cybersecurity risk management, and the Group CISO reports, and if applicable, submits proposals for deliberation, to the Management Committee via the IT Strategy Promotion Committee and to the Board of Directors, each on the status of our cybersecurity measures, with the aim of developing and strengthening a system for ensuring cybersecurity.\n\nwhen there is concern about the impact on the group, as well as carrying out periodic assessments to ensure that full preparedness is maintained.\n\nIn order to evaluate the maturity of these cybersecurity measures, we refer to third party assessment by the Cybersecurity Assessment Tool of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and the Cybersecurity Framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the unlikely event that a cyber incident is detected, or if it is determined on firm grounds that the likelihood of a cyber incident occurring is very high, the Cybersecurity Management Department will report the cyber incident to the Group CISO.

In addition, their role includes collecting and analyzing signs and indicators of a potential crisis, and reporting their findings promptly to management.\n\nParticular focus is placed on continuous efforts to confirm the content and processes of our system and business contingency plans and strengthen our group-wide, hands-on training and drills with management participation, in order to minimize the impact on customers in the event of an IT system failure.\n\nWe are also strengthening our first response to natural disasters, covering not only earthquakes and tsunamis but also large-scale wind or water damage, and improving readiness against terrorism and conflict as well as cyberattacks in order to improve the effectiveness of our business continuity management system for securing operational resilience.",

The main organizational body driving our support is our Regional Revitalization Desk, which houses our headquarters functions for planning and promoting initiatives towards resolving issues faced by local communities.\n\nFor example, in May 2024 we provided support including loan and capital financing of \u00a54.5 billion to the Nobels Group, a large agricultural corporation in Hokkaido's Tokachi region, in collaboration with the Regional Economy Vitalization Corporation of Japan, government-affiliated financial institutions, regional financial institutions, and others.

As the financial services industry and world affairs have developed, steps have been taken to steadily enhance this framework. Formulated in 2010, Basel III is a framework that tightened capital requirements along with\n\nintroducing liquidity requirements to address issues that came to light in the 2008 global financial crisis. Regulatory reforms following the financial crisis were largely completed in 2017 (Basel III finalization) with reforms aimed at reducing discrepancies among banks regarding the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWA, which is the denominator of the capital ratio).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf Strengthening qualitative and quantitative requirements for capital (numerator of the capital ratio)\n- \u25cf Introduction of leverage ratio and liquidity requirements\n\n| Capital ratio             | Capital RWA (calculated by taking account   of the risk of assets held)                              |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Leverage ratio            | Capital Exposure (calculated without taking account                                                  |\n| Liquidity  coverage ratio | Stock of high-quality liquid assets                                                                  |\n|                           | Total net cash outflows under severe stress conditions over  a specified short-term period (30 days) |\n| Net stable  funding ratio | Available amount of stable funding   (capital, deposits, market funding, etc.)                       |\n| Net stable  funding ratio | Required amount of stable funding (loans, securities, etc.)                                          |\n\n- \u25cf Finalization of minimum capital requirements for market risk\n\n## Principal requirements under Basel III and state of compliance\n\nAs a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), Mizuho Financial Group must meet some regulatory standards at a higher level. We maintain full compliance with all the requirements in the standards and, going forward, we will steadily accumulate capital and control our balance sheet to ensure that we can satisfy any new requirements that are introduced.\n\n## International financial regulations going forward\n\nWith the completion of the post-global financial crisis regulatory reforms, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which are responsible for developing international financial regulatory standards, are turning their attention to new areas. Specifically, they have shifted their focus from developing new regulatory standards to consistent implementation of regulations in individual countries and evaluating the impact of regulatory reforms (e.g., are they having the intended effect without compromising regulatory resilience). Recently, responding to the banking turmoil of 2023, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reaffirmed their expectation of implementing all aspects of the Basel III framework in full, consistently, and as soon as possible.\n\nIn addition, the environment that financial institutions operate in has reached a critical turning point, including rapidly accelerating digitalization and increasing societal interest in sustainability. There is growing attention to, and international discussion about, the opportunities and risks presented to banks and financial systems by the various impacts of climate change and the popularization of digital assets. For example, various international bodies and local regulatory authorities, foremost among them the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, have been looking into responses to risks related to digital assets and climaterelated financial risk.\n\nTo address these various risks, we will work closely with government, academia, and industry, while also holding proactive internal discussions.",

When making these assessments, we calculate the potential losses arising from assumed stress events and risk volumes, which we assess whether they balance with the group's capital. Stress events are based on risk scenarios that are formulated based on the current economic condition and the economic outlook, etc. In addition, we examine whether an appropriate return on risk is maintained in the assessments.\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\nc",

Differences between regulatory exposure amounts and carrying values in consolidated financial statements and the main sources of the differences are as follows.\n- \u00b7 Off-balance sheet amounts correspond to the differences produced mainly by adding exposures to undrawn commitments and by multiplying customer liabilities for acceptances and guarantees by the credit conversion factor (CCF) assigned to off-balance sheet items under the regulatory capital requirements.\n- \u00b7 Differences due to consideration of provision for loan losses, and write-offs are produced mainly by adding general provisions for loan losses, specific provisions for loan losses and partial direct bad debt write-offs to those assets subject to the advanced internal ratings-based approach.\n- \u00b7 Differences due to derivative transactions, etc. are produced mainly by incorporating future market value fluctuations and the effect of netting into regulatory exposure amounts. Derivative transactions, etc. include long-settlement transactions.\n- \u00b7 Differences due to repurchase transactions are mainly produced by adding the exposure amounts related to assets pledged as collateral and considering the effect of netting and collateral.\n- \u00b7 Other differences are produced mainly by considering the offsetting of deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities and the regulatory recognized effectiveness of hedging and making regulatory prudential adjustments.\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\ne c\n\nu\n\nal\n\nv\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\nc",

Column (a) is not necessarily equal to the sum of columns (b) to (e) due to assets being riskweighted more than once.\n- 2. Differences between regulatory exposure amounts and carrying values in consolidated financial statements and the main sources of the differences are as follows.\n- \u00b7 Off-balance sheet amounts correspond to the differences produced mainly by adding exposures to undrawn commitments and by multiplying customer liabilities for acceptances and guarantees by the credit conversion factor (CCF) assigned to off-balance sheet items under the regulatory capital requirements.\n- \u00b7 Differences due to consideration of provision for loan losses, and write-offs are produced mainly by adding general provisions for loan losses, specific provisions for loan losses and partial direct bad debt write-offs to those assets subject to the advanced internal ratings-based approach.\n- \u00b7 Differences due to derivative transactions, etc. are produced mainly by incorporating future market value fluctuations and the effect of netting into regulatory exposure amounts. Derivative transactions, etc. include long-settlement transactions.\n- \u00b7 Differences due to repurchase transactions are mainly produced by adding the exposure amounts related to assets pledged as collateral and considering the effect of netting and collateral.\n- \u00b7 Other differences are produced mainly by considering the offsetting of deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities and the regulatory recognized effectiveness of hedging and making regulatory prudential adjustments.",

The following business units have adopted the AIRB approach: Mizuho Financial Group, Inc., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., Mizuho Credit Guarantee Co., Ltd., Mizuho Trust Realty Company Limited, Mizuho Bank (China), Mizuho Bank (USA), Ltd., Mizuho Bank Europe N.V., Mizuho Capital Markets LLC., Mizuho Markets Cayman LP., and Mizuho Markets Americas LLC.\n\nNote: Special purpose companies (SPCs) controlled by the above companies have also adopted the AIRB approach due to their business operations integrated with their parent companies.\n\nFurthermore, the following business units will adopt the AIRB approach in phases: Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. and Mizuho Securities USA LLC.\n\nThe application scope of AIRB is determined through taking into account the importance for each business unit, such as the ratio of its credit RWA to that of the entire group. AIRB is generally applied to those assets held by the business units that have adopted AIRB except for some asset classes considered immaterial for the purpose of calculating credit RWA .In addition, AIRB is used for all equity exposures regardless of what approach the business unit has adopted. With respect to credit RWA exposures under Regarded-Method, AIRB is used for those of which the look-through approach is applied except for cases where it is difficult to accurately calculate credit RWA regarding their underlying assets based on the IRB Approach and therefore reliability of credit RWA cannot be secured. The standardized approach will be applied to any of those business units and asset classes that do not meet the above conditions.\n\n## (ii) Summary of Our Internal Rating System\n\nSee pages 112 to 114 for a summary of our internal rating system and rating assignment procedures.\n\n## Estimation of parameters and validation\n\nWe use our own estimates for the parameters indicated below in the calculation of credit RWA under the Basel Framework. We generally validate the parameters by backtesting or other methods on an annual basis. Methods of estimation and validation as well as results are approved by the Chief Risk Officer.\n\n| PD   | Probability of default (likelihood of default of an obligor over a period of one year)   |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LGD  | Loss given default                                                                       |\n| EAD  | Exposure at default                                                                      |\n\nThe definition of default conforms to the Notice issued by Japan's Financial Services Agency.\n\n## Details of Estimates:\n\nPD is determined for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures by obligor rating and retail exposures by pool allocations.\n\nConservative adjustments such as estimation errors have been added to the long-term average of internal default records to calculate PD. External data are applied to supplement the estimations for low default portfolios.\n\nWe apply the regulatory floor PD (0.05%) to A1-rated , A2-rated and A3-rated obligors in the measurement of credit RWA, except for sovereign exposures. Almost all of estimated parameters exceeded actual defaults in this year. The differences stemmed from such reasons as: defaults in this year were lower than the long-term average in the entire period; and conservative adjustments have been made to estimated parameters.\n\nWe estimate LGD based on obligor classifications in our self-assessments or pool allocations, and protection coverage.\n\nFor LGD per obligor classifications, we estimate LGD under normal economic circumstances based on prior defaulted obligor data, making adjustments in consideration of periods of economic downturn using stochastic methods. Our estimation is based on validation of the time between the default event and the closure of the exposure as well as LGD for low default portfolios etc. With regard to protection, we estimate LGD per type of collateral using some external data.\n\nWe estimate EAD based on prior defaulted obligor data.\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\nc",

Exposures to sovereign and bank is included in the category of corporate, etc. because their obligors can be presumably specified. Likewise, exposures to corporate (except specialized lending), specialized lending, equity and purchased receivables (corporate) is included in the category of corporate, etc. because the data of the respective portfolios is not separately used for PD estimation. Since purchased receivables (retail) account for a small portion of the entire exposure, they are incorporated with any one of QRRE, residential mortgage or other retail depending on the portfolio classification of the purchased receivables.\n\n- 2. PD Range indicates the ranges of PD estimates for multiple consolidated internal ratings groups.\n- 3.

Exposures to sovereign and bank is included in the category of corporate, etc. because their obligors can be presumably specified. Likewise, exposures to corporate (except specialized lending), specialized lending, equity and purchased receivables (corporate) is included in the category of corporate, etc. because the data of the respective portfolios is not separately used for PD estimation. Since purchased receivables (retail) account for a small portion of the entire exposure, they are incorporated with any one of QRRE, residential mortgage or other retail depending on the portfolio classification of the purchased receivables.\n- 2. PD Range indicates the ranges of PD estimates for multiple consolidated internal ratings groups.\n- 3. The following shows the percentages accounted for by the respective portfolios among the credit RWA calculated by the AIRB: Corporate, etc. : 76%, QRRE: 1%, Residential mortgage : 4%, Other retail : 1%.\n- 4. The number of credits is disclosed as the number of data of obligors for QRRE, residential mortgage and other retail excluding credit for business purpose.\n- 5. The back testing covers the period from September 30, 2021 to September 30, 2022.\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\ne c\n\nu\n\nal\n\nv\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\nc",

(Moody's), S&P Global Ratings (S&P), Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch), Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I) and Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR).\n\n## (ii) Standards for Classifying Exposures to Which the Standardized Approach is Applied into the Portfolios Managed under the Internal Ratings-based Approach\n\nWe adopt the standardized approach for the assets excluded from the application of the internal ratings-based approach and for the assets to be phased into the internal ratings-based approach. The assets excluded are certain non-customer assets and some retail exposures for which it is difficult to obtain actual data for parameter estimation, while the assets to be phased in are the claims held by Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. and Mizuho Securities USA LLC. We calculate risk-weighted assets using the standardized approach for these assets.\n\nWith respect to equity exposures, we adopt the transitional arrangements as stipulated in Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Supplementary Provisions to the FSA Notice No. 20. During this transitional period, we calculate risk weights under both the standardized approach and the method prescribed in the previous provisions of Article 144, Paragraph 1, each item of the FSA Notice No. 20, and apply the higher of the two risk weights. If the risk weights are the same, the standardized approach is used.\n\n## (iii) Quantitative disclosure on credit risk under standardized approach",

In obtaining the collateral and guarantees, we evaluate the value of the collateral, guarantee performance capability of guarantor and legal enforceability, and we also conduct periodical subsequent re-evaluations. Furthermore, we monitor any concentration of risks in particular corporate groups including indirect credit exposure such as collateral issuers and guarantees. When calculating the credit risk weighted assets for capital adequacy ratio regulations, the effect of credit risk mitigation through financial collateral (mainly deposits and securities), other collateral (mainly real estate) and guarantees by \"sovereign, banks or corporations above a certain credit rating\" is reflected.\n\n## (ii) Quantitative Disclosure on Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques\n\nCounterparty risk exposures, securitization exposures, and regarded-method exposures are excluded from the amount of credit risk exposures below.\n\n## (A) CR3: Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques - Overview\n\n|     |                              |                      |                      |                      |                         | (Millions of yen)           |\n|-----|------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|     |                              | As of March 31, 2024 | As of March 31, 2024 | As of March 31, 2024 | As of March 31, 2024    | As of March 31, 2024        |\n|     |                              | a                    | b                    | c                    | d                       | e                           |\n|     |                              | Exposures            | Exposures            | Exposures secured    | Exposures secured       | Exposures secured by credit |\n| No. |                              | unsecured            | secured              | by collateral        | by financial guarantees | derivatives                 |\n| 1   | Loans                        | \u00a5 69,490,161         | \u00a5 17,921,399         | \u00a5 7,269,142          | \u00a5 7,234,095             | \u00a5 -                         |\n| 2   | Debt securities              | 29,073,875           | 881,821              | 371,402              | 396,803                 | -                           |\n| 3   | Other on balance debt assets | 78,011,645           | 125,638              | 1,350                | 100,570                 | -                           |\n| 4   | Total (1+2+3)                | \u00a5 176,575,683        | \u00a5 18,928,859         | \u00a5 7,641,896          | \u00a5 7,731,470             | \u00a5 -                         |\n| 5   | Of which defaulted           | 316,896              | 369,182              | 125,811              | 67,364                  | -                           |\n\n- 2.

For derivatives transactions and repurchase transactions, in cases in which a bilateral netting agreement is valid in light of the legal system of the relevant jurisdiction, we take its effect into consideration. As to derivatives transactions with financial institutions, etc., we periodically, where necessary, deliver and receive collateral to and from the counterparty based on the replacement cost to mitigate credit risk (collateralized derivatives transactions).

We use the SA-CVA, full BA-CVA and reduced BA-CVA approaches to calculate CVA risk equivalent. The transactions subject to the measurement of CVA risk equivalent are derivatives transactions with counterparties other than central counterparties, etc., (as stipulated in Article 270-2, Paragraph 2, each item of the FSA Notice No. 20).\n\n## (2) Summary of CVA Risk Profile and CVA Risk Management Structure\n\nCVA risk is primarily affected by the credit quality of counterparties to derivatives transactions, market factors, etc. We calculate CVA risk equivalent on a quarterly basis as part of the calculation of the capital adequacy ratio, and compare them with the values calculated in the previous quarter to check for any changes. We seek to mitigate CVA risk through the delivery and receipt of collateral under CSA agreements and through hedging activities by CVA desks.\n\n## (3) Management of CVA Risk under the Standardized Approach (SA-CVA)\n\n- (i) Summary of CVA Risk Management Structure\n- We manage CVA risk through our market risk management structure, in principle.\n\n## (ii) Summary of Senior Management Governance for Effective Functioning of CVA Risk Management Structure\n\nIn our market risk management structure, the Risk Management Committee of Mizuho Financial Group determines, discusses and coordinates the matters relating to CVA risk management. The Group CRO is responsible for matters relating to the planning and operations of CVA risk management. The Risk Management Department of Mizuho Financial Group is responsible for CVA risk monitoring, reporting, analyzing, making proposals, setting limits/guidelines, and formulating/implementing plans relating to CVA risk management. The CVA risk situation is, as part of the market risk situation, reported to our President & Group CEO on a daily basis, and to our Board of Directors and the Risk Management Committee of Mizuho Financial Group on a regular basis.\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\ne c\n\nu\n\nal\n\nv\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\nc",

        "page_content": "## \u25a0 Securitization Exposures\n\nWe classify transactions as securitization exposures based on two characteristics, \"non-recourse\" and \"senior/subordinated structure,\" pursuant to the definitions set forth in the FSA Notice No. 20, etc.; provided that the transactions do not include those which fall within specialized lending exposure.\n\n## (1) Summary of Risk Management Regarding Securitization Exposures Our role in securitization transactions\n\nWe are associated with securitization transactions from various purposes and positions through our banking book and trading book.\n\n## (a) Securitization of our assets (\"Securitization as originator\")\n\nFor the purposes of mitigating credit risk and credit concentration risk, controlling economic capital and responding to the needs of our investors, etc., we engage in securitization transactions, the underlying assets of which include mortgage loans and loans to our corporate customers. When conducting a securitization as an originator, we consider such transactions from various aspects, including the effects of reduction of economic capital and improvement of return on risk as well as the practical effects of risk transfers, and make a comprehensive judgment on the structure and appropriateness of such transactions.\n\n## (b) Securitization program (ABCP/ABL) sponsor\n\nAs a means of supporting our customers in the securitization of their account receivables and notes receivables, etc., we retain securitization exposure by providing asset-backed loans (ABLs, which are on-balance-sheet transactions), and providing asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) backup lines (off-balance-sheet transactions), as sponsor to special purpose companies (in the form of Cayman Islands Corporations, etc.). In addition to gaining firm understanding of the actual risk profile through due diligence from the viewpoint of investors, we assign internal ratings and make evaluations by assessing such transactions and carefully managing the exposure together with other direct loan assets.\n\n## (c) Investment in alternative credit risk assets (\"Securitization Transactions as an Investor\")\n\nWe hold securitization products, such as ABS, CMBS, RMBS, and CDO, and resecuritization products, the underlying assets of which are mainly RMBS and CDO, etc., for the purpose of investing in alternative credit risk assets that are different from conventional credit risk assets in order to diversify our investment portfolio. The Risk Management Committee, etc. set limits on the amount of investment for Securitization Transactions as an Investor, and we maintain a stringent structure for management of such transactions. In addition, we implement stress tests based on scenarios under the market liquidity depletion and sharp price declines.\n\nIn addition, we undertake various securitization program arrangements such as ABL, ABCP and trust schemes, etc., as a means of financing for our customers. We endeavor to understand the actual risk profile, including the underlying assets, and to appropriately disclose the risks and terms of the program to the customers who invest in the product.\n\nFurthermore, we actively act as servicer for securitization transactions, offer settlement account facilities (servicer cash advance) and provide interest rate swaps to securitization conduits.\n\nOne of our affiliated entities, Mizuho Leasing Company, Ltd, holds securitization products in which we are involved as originators or sponsors.\n\nThe securitization conduits included within the scope of consolidation are as follows:\n\nROCK FIELD CORPORATION, FANTASTIC FUNDING CORPORATION, N&M FUNDING CORPORATION, Denshi Saiken Kaitori Godo Kaisha, JAPAN SECURITIZATION CORPORATION, Allstar Funding Co.,Ltd, SPARCS FUNDING CORPORATION, and PERPETUAL FUNDING CORPORATION.\n\nThere are no securitization conduits that provide credit enhancement beyond what is provided in agreements.\n\n## Overview of risk profile of securitization transactions and monitoring system\n\nIn addition to price fluctuation and market liquidity risks, securitization and resecuritization products are exposed to risks related to default, recovery and granularity of underlying asset portfolio. The structure of these products also contains risks related to the originators, the administrators, trustees and managers of the underlying assets.\n\nTo address these risks, we also analyze the structure in terms of the underlying assets and credit events. We monitor the ability, quality and operating performance of originators and managers in charge of controlling the underlying assets as well as covenant information and credit status of the parties related to the program. In addition, for resecuritization products, we pay attention to the underlying assets of the underlying securitization products. We also assign internal ratings to all products and review the rating at least once a year. If there is a change in the credit situations, we will review the internal rating as appropriate. As mentioned above, we have established a system to comprehensively understand the risk characteristics of securitization exposures and manage these exposures.\n\nWe conduct credit risk measurements on all credit transactions, including securitization transactions. Furthermore, we carry out periodic monitoring on investment amount and performance on securitization transactions and report the situations to our Risk Management Committee, etc.\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\nc",

        "page_content": "## Response to Basel Framework\n\nIn calculating credit risk-weighted assets of securitization exposure, we apply the internal-ratings-based approach (\"IRBA\") if we have sufficient information regarding all the underlying assets for IRBA. If IRBA cannot be applied to a certain asset and it has a rating obtained from an eligible external credit assessment institution, we apply the External rating-based approach (\"ERBA\") We apply the standardized approach (\"SA\") in other cases pursuant to the FSA Notice No. 20. We apply a risk weight of 1250% under Basel III when neither IRBA, ERBA nor SA can be applied.\n\nIn terms of securitization exposure in our trading book that is subject to market risk regulations, we adopt the standardized measurement method and calculate market risk equivalent amounts in connection with securitization products based on risk weights according to ratings assigned by eligible external credit assessment institutions pursuant to the FSA Notice No. 20.\n\nAs for the eligible external credit assessment institutions, we refer to Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I),Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR), Moody's Investors Service Inc. (Moody's), S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. in determining securitization exposure risk weight.\n\n## (2) Accounting Policies for Securitization Transactions\n\nThe point at which financial assets and liabilities relating to securitization transactions begin or cease to be recognized, their evaluation and accounting treatment are pursuant to \"Accounting Standards Relating to Financial Products\"\n\n(Business Accounting Standards No. 10).\n\n## (3) Quantitative Disclosure on Securitization Exposures\n\n## (A) SEC1: Securitization Exposures in the Banking Book by Type of Underlying Assets\n\n(Millions of yen)\n\n|     |                              | (Millions of yen)       | (Millions of yen)       | (Millions of yen)       | (Millions of yen)   | (Millions of yen)    | (Millions of yen)    | (Millions of yen)         | (Millions of yen)      | (Millions of yen)      |\n|-----|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|     |                              | a                       | b                       | c                       | d                   | e                    | f                    | g                         | h                      | i                      |\n|     |                              | Bank acts as originator | Bank acts as originator | Bank acts as originator |                     | Bank acts as sponsor | Bank acts as sponsor | Banks acts as investor    | Banks acts as investor | Banks acts as investor |\n| No. | type of underlying assets    | Traditional             | Synthetic               | Sub-total               | Traditional         | Synthetic            | Sub-total            | Traditional               | Synthetic              | Sub-total              |\n| 1   | Retail (total) -

The historical simulation method is used for the calculation of VAR and stressed VAR under the Internal Models Approach.\n\n- 2. VAR is measured based on the observation period of 3 years (801 business days), a 99% confidence interval and a 1-day holding period. This 1-day VAR is scaled up to 10-business day VAR using the square-root-of-time ( \u221a T) rule. We update historical data on a daily basis, in principle, and do not weight such data. When re-pricing instruments, we use the full revaluation method, a sensitivity-based approach and the like. We consider change width or rate as market volatility of risk factors according to product attributes.\n- 3. When measuring stressed VAR, the same measurement approach as VAR is used except for the observation period of 1 year (265 business days). As a stressed period, we select a period which has an adequate length of time and is considered the most stressful under a certain set of criteria established based on the most recent portfolio.\n- 4. When applying the internal model, we regularly verify the preconditions used for VAR measurement.\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\ne c\n\nu\n\nal\n\nv",

Decreased economic values and interest income are shown as positive values.\n\n- 2. As for some of those current deposits and ordinary deposits whose interest rates are not changed at predetermined intervals and from which depositors can withdraw money as desired on demand, we measure the interest rate risk associated with such deposits by applying an appropriate method after recognizing them as core deposits. The average repricing maturities are 0.8 years for yen deposits and 0.6 years for dollar deposits respectively. The longest repricing maturities are 10.0 years for yen deposits and 5.0 years for dollar deposits respectively. We measure interest rate risk associated with term deposits and loans in an appropriate manner by estimating their early redemption rates based on their historical prepayment and cancellation data.\n- 3. When aggregating the respective \u0394EVE of multiple currencies, we use the internal model that estimates the correlations between the key currencies based on historical data.\n- When aggregating the respective \u0394NII of multiple currencies, we simply add their respective \u0394NII.\n- 4. For the calculation of \u0394EVE and \u0394NII , we set an appropriate interest rate and spread according to a certain discount rate and reference rate.\n- 5. When making the calculations above, we use regulatory defined preconditions including an interest rate shock scenario.\n\n## (3) Transfers between the trading book and the banking book, Risk transfer through internal transactions\n\nI n our group, no products were transferred between the trading book and the banking book. For risk transfer through internal transactions (derivatives among the bank's internal organizations or books) from the banking book to the trading book, such transfers are conducted through the internal transaction desk and hedged as needed.\n\n## \u25a0 Investment or E quity E xposure\n\n## (1) Summary of Risk Profile, Risk Management Policies / Procedures and Structure\n\nWith regard to equities, we manage default risk through our credit risk management structure and price fluctuation risk through our market risk management structure. With regard to subsidiaries and related companies in which we invest, we manage their risks on a consolidated basis, and manage them appropriately in accordance with their management classification. I n addition, securities, a part of equity exposure, are valued as follows: Securities are stated at market price (cost of securities sold is calculated primarily by the moving average method). Stocks and others without a quoted market price are stated at acquisition cost and determined by the moving average method.\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\ne c\n\nu\n\nal\n\nv",

In addition, there is no significant currency mismatch between the total amount of the HQLA allowed to be included in the calculation and net cash outflow regarding main currencies (those currencies of which the aggregate liabilities denominated amount to 5% or more of our total liabilities).\n\n## (D) Other matters regarding the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (Consolidated)\n\nWe do not apply the \"exceptional treatment regarding qualifying operational deposits\" in Article 28 of the Notice No. 62 and \"the amount of additional collateral required due to market valuation changes to derivatives transactions estimated by the scenario approach\" in Article 37 of the Notice No. 62. \"Cash outflows from other contracts\" in Article 59 of the Notice No. 62 includes \"cash outflows related to small consolidated subsidiaries.\" There are no material items that require detailed explanation of \"cash outflows from other contingent events\" in Article 52 of the Notice No. 62 and \"cash inflows from other contracts\" in Article 72 of the Notice No. 62. Monthly or quarterly data is used for some of our consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## \u25a0 Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\n## (1) Disclosure of quantitative information regarding the Net Stable Funding Ratio (Consolidated)\n\n(Millions of yen, %)\n\n|                                                    |                                                                                                                                                           | As of March 31, 2024                              | As of March 31, 2024   | As of March 31, 2024   | As of March 31, 2024   | As of March 31, 2024   |                                                   |                        |                        |                        |                     |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                    |                                                                                                                                                           |                                                   |                        |                        |                        |                        | As of December 31,2023                            | As of December 31,2023 | As of December 31,2023 | As of December 31,2023 |                     |\n| Item                                               | Item                                                                                                                                                      | Unweighted value by residual maturity No maturity | < 6 months             | 6 months to <1yr       | \u2265 1yr                  | Weighted value         | Unweighted value by residual maturity No maturity | < 6 months             | 6 months to <1yr       | \u2265 1yr                  | Weighted value      |\n| Available stable funding (ASF) items (1)           | Available stable funding (ASF) items (1)                                                                                                                  |                                                   |                        |                        |                        |                        |                                                   |                        |                        |                        |                     |\n|                                                    | Capital;

In addition, we have established and maintain a separate compensation recovery policy called the \"Recovery Policy for Executive Compensation\" based on Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\ne c\n\nu\n\nal\n\nv\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\nc",

Compensation System\n\n- I. Compensation for the Officers responsible for business execution shall, in principle, consist of Basic Compensation and Incentive Compensation. Incentive Compensation consists of Medium- to Long-term Incentive Compensation and Short-term Incentive Compensation, and Mediumto Long-term Incentive Compensation consists of Stock Compensation I and Stock Compensation II. The proportion of each type of compensation for Officers is determined according to the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers and the proportion of Incentive Compensation is determined so as to maximize the proportion of the Group CEO's compensation. From the perspective of ensuring the effectiveness of the supervisory function, compensation for Non-executive officers responsible for management supervision shall, in principle, consist of only Base Compensation and Stock Compensation I, with respect to which the details of the payment is not changed due to, among other reasons, our business results, and such composition shall be, in principle, 85% and 15%, respectively.\n- (i) \"Basic Compensation\" shall factor in the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers, and payment will be made monthly in cash.\n- (ii) \"Medium- to Long-term Incentive Compensation\" shall be paid in the form of shares of common stock of Mizuho Financial Group consisting of \"Stock Compensation I\" and \"Stock Compensation II\" acquired from the stock market through a trust, as an incentive for the enhancement of corporate value over the medium to long term.\n- (a) \"Stock Compensation I\" shall be paid at the time of resignation of each Officer, etc., in the form of shares of common stock of Mizuho Financial Group calculated based on the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers. A system shall be adopted which enables a decrease or forfeiture of the amount by resolution of the Compensation Committee, etc., depending on performance of the company or the individual.\n- (b) \"Stock Compensation II\" shall be paid in accordance with level of achievement of financial indicators emphasized by the Mizuho Financial Group and evaluation of indicators related to stakeholders as an incentive to increase corporate value over the medium- to long-term and for other purposes. \"Stock Compensation II\" shall be paid, in principle, within the range of 0% to 150% of the standard amount for the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers. A system shall be adopted which enables the entire amount of deferred payments over three years, as well as a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount by resolution of the Compensation Committee, etc., depending on performance of the company or the individual.\n- (iii) \"Short-term Incentive Compensation\" shall be made as a monetary incentive for Officers, etc., based on the level of achievement of financial indicators emphasized by the Mizuho Financial Group and the evaluation of individual performance as an incentive for fiscal year performance to increase corporate value. \"Short-term Incentive Compensation\" shall be paid, in principle, within the range of 0% to 150% of the standard amount for the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers. A system shall be adopted which, based on resolution by the Compensation Committee, etc., enables certain amounts of deferred payments of the Short-term Incentive Compensation over three years, as well as a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount depending on performance, etc., of the company or the individual.\n- II. There are cases where compensation for some personnel, including those officers recruited locally in countries other than Japan, may be designed individually in compliance with local compensation regulations while taking into consideration local compensation practices and the responsibilities, business characteristics and market value, etc., of each respective officer.\n- For cases where compensation is designed individually, payment of compensation is also made in accordance with the performance of the company or the individual. Payment of compensation is designed to avoid excessive risktaking through a system which enables certain amount or a portion of deferred payments and non-monetary payments such as stock, as well as a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount depending on the performance, etc., of the company or the individual.",

Each employee of the risk management department, the compliance department and the internal audit department sets their own objectives in the employee performance evaluations, subject to the approval of their superiors. The degree to which the objectives are achieved is evaluated by taking into account the degree of the employee's contribution to the establishment of a system for risk management, compliance and internal audit.\n- 2. Linking compensation of \"Subject directors and employees\" with performance Stock Compensation II and Short-term Incentive Compensation for \"Officers Responsible for Business Execution\" shall be determined by multiplying the standard amount, which is determined based on the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers, by a corporate performance linked coefficient.\n- The corporate performance linked factor for Stock Compensation II shall be determined by the Compensation Committee within the range of 0% to 150% based on target achievement rates for medium- to long-term performance indicators, with respect to which the evaluation axes are ' Finance of Mizuho Financial Group,'\n- ' Customers,' ' Economy and society' and ' Employees.' For the medium-to long-term performance indicators, we selected ' Consolidated ROE' (which indicates management efficiency), ' Consolidated Net Business Profits + Net gains or losses related to ETFs and others' (which indicates the profitability of the core operations) and ' Total Shareholder Return (TSR)' (which indicates overall shareholder returns), with respect to which the evaluation axis is ' Finance of Mizuho Financial Group.' In addition, we selected, among others, ' Sustainable finance amount' (which indicates the outcome of responding to capital demand for resolution of environmental and societal issues), ' Assessments by ESG rating agencies' (which indicates the objective assessments of sustainability promotion structure) and ' Engagement score' and ' Inclusion score' (which indicate the status of human capital enhancement and corporate culture transformation), with respect to which the evaluation axes are ' Customers,' ' Economy and society' and ' Employees.'\n\nThe corporate performance linked factor for Short-term Incentive Compensation shall be determined by the Compensation Committee within the range of 0% to 150% based on the figure calculated by multiplying (i) the factor of the evaluation based on the target achievement rates for short-term performance indicators we selected, with respect to which the evaluation axis is ' Finance of Mizuho Financial Group' (the ' short-term performance indicators' and, along with the evaluation using such indicators, hereinafter the ' evaluation of short-term performance indicators' ) by (ii) the evaluation factor based on individual evaluation of each Officer. For the short-term performance indicators, we selected the ' Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent' (which is the final result of management's performance) and the ' Gross Profit RORA' (which indicates the management's efficiency), with respect to which the evaluation axis is ' Finance of Mizuho Financial Group.' In addition, individual evaluation shall be conducted based on perspectives of evaluation to be set based on the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers. In the case of the Group CEO, the factor of the evaluation of short-term performance indicators fluctuates within the range of 0% to 140%, the individual evaluation factor fluctuates within the range of 0% to 110%, and the evaluation factor for the short-term performance indicators and individual evaluation is capped at 150%.\n\nThe entire amount of the Stock Compensation II and a certain amount of the Short-term Incentive Compensation shall be made or paid in deferred payments over three years, and a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount may be made depending on the performance, etc., of the company and such officer. It should be noted that certain \"Subject directors and employees\" have entered into compensation-related contracts. Stock compensation for \"Non-Executive Officers Responsible for Management Supervision\" shall be made in accordance with the standard amount set for the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers, and the payment level shall not change based on the performance of each officer. With regard to compensation for other employees, salary is determined according to their job duties and responsibilities. In addition, the proportion linked to the performance bonus is determined through appropriately and comprehensively evaluating the contribution to performance, including the degree of contribution to the organization, etc., so as not to become excessively performance based.",

The stated amount is the total amount for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023.\n- 4. No. 7, \"Fixed compensation,\" \"Other compensation amount,\" includes condolence money insurance premiums, based on the decision of our Compensation Committee.\n- 5. No. 11, \"Variable compensation\" \"Cash compensation amount,\" includes the recorded performance payment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 for directors, executive officers (as defined in the Companies Act), and executive officers (as defined in our internal regulations) of MHFG, MHBK, MHTB and MHSC. For portions that exceed a certain amount, we plan to defer payment over the three-year period from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.\n- 6. No. 13, \"Variable compensation\" \"Stock compensation amount or stock-based type compensation amount\" includes the amount obtained by multiplying the stock compensation and performance-based stock compensation ownership points (with one point to be converted into one share of MHFG stock) granted to the directors, executive officers (as defined in the Companies Act), and executive officers (as defined in our internal regulations) of MHFG, MHBK, MHTB and MHSC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 by the book value of MHFG's shares (2,229.193yen per share). For stock compensation and performance-based stock compensation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we plan to defer payment over the three-year period from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.\n- 7. Because the amounts of the stock compensation, performance payment and performance-based-type stock compensation for the directors, executive officers (as defined in the Companies Act), and executive officers (as defined in our internal regulations) MHFG, MHBK, MHTB and MHSC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 have not been determined at this time, they are not included in the above compensation. However, we have recorded the required reserves for accounting purposes.\n- 8. The exercise periods for the stock compensation-type stock options (stock acquisition rights) are as set out below. Under the stock option agreements, exercise of the options is postponed, even during the exercise period, until the time of retirement of the director or employee.\n\n|                                                    | Exercise period                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Seventh Series of stock Acquisition Rights of MHFG | December 2, 2014 to December 1, 2034 |\n\nn\n\nio\n\nt\n\na\n\ne\n\nr\n\nc",

Basic Principles\n\nOur Corporate Philosophy is 'Operating responsibly and transparently with foresight, Mizuho is deeply committed to serving client needs, enabling our people to flourish, and helping to improve society and the communities where we do business.' We place one of the highest management priorities on continuing to disclose information to our customers, shareholders, and investors both in and outside Japan in a fair, timely and appropriate manner, in order that they may form proper judgments and appraisals of the group. To achieve this aim, we observe applicable domestic and international laws and regulations as well as stock exchange rules relating to corporate disclosure, and we establish and implement appropriate Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\n\n## 2. Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n## (1) Establishment and Implementation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur Disclosure Controls and Procedures are established to observe applicable domestic and international laws and regulations as well as stock exchange rules and to implement fair, timely and appropriate corporate disclosure. The Disclosure Controls and Procedures are the process carried out by executive officers and employees of Mizuho Financial Group and include Internal Controls over Financial Reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Financial Reporting and the Preparation of Financial Statements. We have established the basic principles underlying our Disclosure Controls and Procedures as well as our internal rules related to Disclosure Controls and Procedures that govern the management framework for the entire Mizuho Financial Group including group companies, and we are striving to establish, implement and continuously improve our Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our Disclosure Committee is the Business Policy Committee that is responsible for discussing and coordinating matters relating to Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\n\n## (2) Evaluation of Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur Disclosure Controls and Procedures are documented, and evaluation of the overall effectiveness of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures is conducted regularly by reviewing the contents of such documentation and their implementation. In addition, evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures is conducted through internal audits.\n\n## (3) Others\n\nWe established a 'Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals' to be observed by all executive officers and employees within Mizuho Financial Group who engage in financial reporting, accounting or disclosure. We have also developed the 'Internal Controls and Audit Hotline', a system designed for reporting questionable accounting, internal control, or auditing matters from both inside and outside Mizuho Financial Group.\n\n## 3. Disclosure Methods, Other\n\n## (1) Disclosure Methods\n\nWith respect to the information which is required to be disclosed pursuant to applicable domestic and international laws and regulations as well as stock exchange rules, we\n\nfollow the defined disclosure procedures such as publishing such information in business reports (Jigyo-Hokoku), annual securities reports (Yukashoken-Hokokusho), Integrated Report (Annual Review) and other disclosure publications, as well as providing such information through the information distribution systems of domestic and international stock exchanges and through press releases. We also endeavor to disclose other information in a fair, timely and appropriate manner. When we disclose such information, we basically publish on our website the information we disclose. In addition, we endeavor to utilize the latest disclosure methods and tools to provide more fair and widespread disclosure.\n\n## (2) Investor Relations Activities\n\nInvestor Relations activities to market participants both in and outside Japan such as shareholders, investors and securities analysts are conducted by the President & Group CEO, Group CFO, Deputy Group CFO, Chief IR Officer, and executive officers and employees designated by them. In accordance with our Basic Principles described in section 1 above, and with due attention to two-way communication, we endeavor sincerely to facilitate a proper understanding of our management strategies, financial condition and other matters. In this way, we aim to earn the trust of the market and obtain an appropriate market reputation.\n\nBeginning with the disclosure required by applicable domestic and international laws and regulations as well as stock exchange rules, we endeavor to grasp properly the types of information desired by the market and to disclose useful and appropriate information voluntarily and proactively, in accordance with the so-called Fair Disclosure Rule ('FDR'). Regarding disclosure of information we consider particularly important, we communicate such information on an ad hoc basis as and when necessary, even if a press release has already been issued, through such means as special briefing sessions.\n\nAs we respect various disclosure principles including fair disclosure in regards to individual calls, private meetings or conferences hosted or attended by representatives of Mizuho Financial Group, we strive to limit carefully our explanations to matters already disclosed and facts commonly known.\n\nShould we happen to disclose important information such as information subject to insider trading regulations and/or undisclosed financial results that might have a significant influence on stock prices, we take necessary action such as officially announcing the information as soon as possible, in accordance with FDR.\n\n## (3) Correction of Misconceptions in the Markets\n\nIf we identify significant misconceptions regarding Mizuho Financial Group in the market due to the reputational risk events or otherwise, we endeavor to investigate their causes and correct such misconceptions promptly.",
