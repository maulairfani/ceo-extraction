With this trust as a foundation, we aim to grow by realizing business management based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions. We are committed to meeting the expectations of our shareholders and investors through the economic value and social value generated by our business activities. At the same time, we will create job satisfaction, thereby contributing to the happiness of our employees and their families. Furthermore, by ensuring that achievements are used for its future growth, the JR East Group aims to be a highly aspirational 'good for all' corporate group that is engaged in helping customers and people in local communities realize enriched lives and pursuing sustainable growth.\n\nThe JR East Group INTEGRATED REPORT 2024 includes a message from the new president, roundtable discussion with outside directors on governance, and many interviews focused on the value that employeeswho play leading roles in achieving the JR East Group Management Vision 'Move Up' 2027-are creating by deepening integration and collaboration. With respect to the report's structure, various innovations have been used to further readers' understanding of the JR East Group, and the large amount of feedback received on the 2023 edition of the report has been reflected in this year's report. For example, we have included Our Story, which summarizes the narrative we want to convey throughout the report as a whole; a section on the Group's value creation and strengths; the strategies, KPIs, and priority measures of each business segment and business; and the strategies that are the basis of our growth. Another important feature of the report is that it also serves as the safety report that the JR East Group publishes under the Railway Business Act and therefore includes detailed explanations of safety initiatives. Thus, this report has been produced to provide readers with information on the Group's concerted efforts to create a virtuous cycle of enhancing corporate value and resolving social issues.\n\nWe sincerely hope the 2024 report facilitates communication with numerous stakeholders.\n\n## Bodies Involved in Report Production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe production of this report was based on discussions held by the Integrated Report Review Subcommittee, which operates under the Sustainability Strategy Committee (see page 23) and comprises the general managers of headquarters departments and other departments. Details of these discussions were reported to directors and other members of senior management, and the report was improved in accordance with their feedback.\n\n## References\n\nInternational Integrated Reporting Framework (IFRS Foundation) Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan) Environmental Reporting Guidelines 2018 (Ministry of the Environment, Japan)\n\n## Reporting Period\n\nThis report principally covers our activities for fiscal 2024, from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024, although certain events presented here took place earlier or in the period between the end of March 2024 and the publication of this report in August 2024.\n\n## Boundary of Reporting\n\nEast Japan Railway Company\n\nJR East Group, consolidated subsidiaries (72 companies) Economic reporting: JR East, consolidated subsidiaries, equity-method affiliates (11 companies) Environmental reporting: JR East, consolidated Japanese\n\nsubsidiaries (67 companies)\n\nSocial reporting: JR East, consolidated subsidiaries\n\nTotals may not match the sum of individual figures due to rounding.\n\n## Corporate Website\n\nJapanese\n\nhttps://www.jreast.co.jp/company/\n\n## English\n\nhttps://www.jreast.co.jp/e/aboutus/\n\n## Cover Photographs (from the Top)\n\n- 1.

Meanwhile, our employees have worked tirelessly to enhance safety.\n\nAt the same time, JR East has helped to reduce congestion in the Tokyo metropolitan area by increasing the frequency of train services and adding trainsets, and it has increased commuting distances by introducing direct services and fast commuter trains.

In 1989, I joined the Company as an administrative employee and served in frontline operations at Ueno Station, Shinjuku Station, and other locations. I was then engaged for many years in human resource- related duties and was also involved in corporate planning and investment planning. As general manager of the Management Planning Department, I contributed to the formulation of the current JR East Group Management Vision 'Move Up' 2027 ('Move Up' 2027). Most recently, I served as director general of the Marketing Headquarters, where I was in charge of the preparation and implementation of growth strategies for Lifestyle Solutions. Many years of service in corporate planning and human resource positions have provided me with an overview of the Group and given me insights into its many different businesses. Moreover, I have developed a perspective on these businesses that is based on medium- to long-term changes in the business environment. I believe that these insights and this perspective will be an advantage in steering management as president. In addition, as director general of the Marketing Headquarters, I was involved in Lifestyle Solutions businesses,\n\nwhich have a wide range of points of contact with customers' daily lives. In this capacity, I took on ambitious new initiatives aimed at greatly expanding Lifestyle and IT & Suica services. As a result, I have acquired insights and perspectives that will be useful for building the Suica economic zone.\n\nAs for my basic approach to business management, I strongly believe that our employees are the foundation and drivers of all growth of the Group and that we must steadily promote sound business management.\n\nDuring my long career in human resources, I always emphasized employees' job satisfaction and personal growth. This emphasis stems from seeing how the growth of employees links directly to the development of the Group as a whole. Each Group employee plays a leading role. Together with our employees, I aim to create a corporate group that continues to address social issues through its business activities. To this end, we must create systems and organizations that empower employees and develop new types of jobs and fields of work. I realize that cultivating a new engagement between employees and management is one of my main roles as president. As a company established following the Japanese National Railways (JNR) privatization reforms, we must firmly uphold the principles of safety first, autonomy and self-reliance, and customers first, which are a legacy of the JNR privatization reforms. I have internalized these principles, which have been passed down over generations and become part of our DNA.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Message from the President\n\n## The JR East Group's Value Creation\n\nBased on the trust of customers and local communities, we will develop a wide range of businesses in a people-focused manner, thereby helping our customers and people in communities to realize enriched lives.\n\nOn a macro level, the JR East Group's raison d'\u00eatre is to provide infrastructure that underpins Japan's economic activities. Further, on a micro level, it is to support the daily lives of customers and local communities. 'Move Up' 2027 sets out making regional areas more prosperous as one of the main focuses of business development initiatives, alongside making cities more comfortable and developing businesses for the world. Heightening the convenience of Tokyo and other metropolitan areas even further and enhancing value is of course an important task. However, the foundations of our growth are vibrant regional communities that are interconnected throughout Japan by our multilayered networks, including our transportation networks. In this sense, I believe that our value as a corporate group lies in the ability to resolutely address the problems of regions. We must step up the pace of digital transformation to increase and diversify points of contact with customers even further. I am convinced that these efforts will become a milestone in the advancement of the Group's growth.\n\nAs a railway operator, we view safety as the top priority of business management. One of our major missions is to provide a variety of value based on the trust that our pursuit of ultimate safety levels has garnered from customers and local communities. We will forge ahead with day-to-day duties based on our three strengths: trust, employees, and networks.\n\nThe trust that our railway business has earned from customers, local communities, and other stakeholders is unmatched by other companies. Based on this trust, we will not develop in a railway infrastructure-focused way but instead develop a wide range of businesses in a people-focused manner by further deepening various types of integration and collaboration-among the Transportation, Lifestyle, and IT & Suica businesses; among Group companies; and with municipal authorities and many different external companies. In this way, the Group will grow by leveraging its combined strength to realize business development that is aimed at helping customers and people in communities to realize enriched lives.\n\n'Move Up' 2027 calls on all Group employees to play leading roles in structural reform. To align the growth of each employee with the overall growth of the Group without being restricted by the narrow frameworks of human capital management, I believe that employees must be open-minded about the outside world. Through 'internal globalization,' I want to enable our employees to demonstrate their significant potential in a variety of business initiatives.\n\nMeanwhile, our networks are multilayered, facilitating not only the movement of people but also the movement of goods and information. Amid a declining population, an aging population, and other structural changes in society, my mission is to rebuild ekinaka locations (inside railway stations) and other real-world assets that have been strengths of the JR East Group into business\n\nadvantages. To this end, we will combine our real-world multilayered networks with digital technologies, which are evolving with each passing day.\n\n## Fiscal 2024 Performance Review\n\nThanks to concerted efforts to realize 'Move Up' 2027, the Group achieved increases in both revenues and income, posting higher operating revenues for the third consecutive fiscal year.\n\nI would now like to review our performance in fiscal 2024, the year ended March 31, 2024. With post-COVID-19 and visitors to Japan as key themes, we implemented various measures to stimulate demand, such as launching the weekday-only discount railway pass, Let's Travel on Weekdays! Early Booking Discount Pass . We also encouraged travel by enhancing initiatives for visitors to Japan and increased revenues through revision of the prices of railway passes used by visitors to Japan. In addition, we advanced measures aimed at transforming our business portfolio through the expansion of businesses that help realize Lifestyle Solutions. For example, we established JR EAST Smart Logistics Co., Ltd. and strategically developed the real estate business. Thanks to such concerted efforts by all Group employees to realize 'Move Up' 2027, railway usage rose and revenues from ekinaka stores, hotels, and shopping centers grew. Consequently, the Group achieved increases in both revenues and income, posting higher operating revenues for the third consecutive fiscal year. By business segment, the Transportation, Retail & Services, and Others realized increases in both revenues and income, while the Real Estate & Hotels segment recorded a rise in revenues but a decline in income. Excluding the real estate sales business, however, this business segment grew both revenues and income.\n\n## Growth Strategies to Achieve Our Vision\n\nIn addition to the favorable progress of the railway business, the finance business associated with the start of JRE BANK operations and the real estate business, which has TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY at its core, are making steady progress.\n\nWhen formulating 'Move Up' 2027 in 2018, we were already incorporating changes in the business environment that would accompany population decline, such as market changes, the aging of society and other changes in the demographic structure, and labor shortages. Anticipating various other structural shifts in business conditions, such as changes in customer lifestyles, we prepared a management vision with a long time frame of 10 years. The concept is to realize a world that is not a continuation of the status quo by having Group employees play leading roles in transformation and ambitious new initiatives.\n\nDuring the first half of the 10-year period, I believe that the railway business became structurally leaner as a result of steady progress in the introduction of condition-based maintenance (CBM), smart maintenance that utilizes drones, and driver-only operations. In addition, several projects that we have been undertaking will come to fruition in the second half of the 10-year period. For example, an \u00a586.0 billion investment for the introduction of Green Cars (first-class carriages) to the Chuo Rapid Line in spring 2025 is expected to generate \u00a58.0 billion in annual revenues. We are steadily enhancing the convenience of Suica. By the end of fiscal 2024, the Suica usage area had been expanded to include Aomori, Iwate, Akita, and Yamagata prefectures, with further expansion planned through the inclusion of Nagano Prefecture at the end of fiscal 2025. In addition, in June 2023 we began the construction of the Haneda Airport Access Line (tentative name), which is scheduled to open in fiscal 2032. We are also planning to phase in automated operations.\n\nIn the Suica and finance business, JRE BANK began operations in May 2024, and we plan to complete the ID integration of eki-net , Mobile Suica, and other digital services by fiscal 2028. Also, we plan to launch a new railway ticketing system through cloud migration by the end of fiscal 2028 and realize integration of these digital services through use of the Suica app (tentative name) by fiscal 2029.\n\nAs for the real estate business, which will be a major engine of future growth, we followed on from the establishment of JR East Real Estate Asset Management Co., Ltd. by establishing JREast Real Estate Co., Ltd. in July 2024 in order to monetize unrealized value. We are further expanding the rotational business model with the aim of developing a real estate fund business that has an overall scale of more than \u00a5400.0 billion by fiscal 2028.\n\nAnother important initiative common to all of our businesses is the advancement of comprehensive collaborations with various companies and academic institutions. 'Move Up' 2027 calls for the promotion of open innovation. Accordingly, we have concluded numerous comprehensive collaboration agreements aimed at actively incorporating society's expertise and advanced technologies, thereby moving away from a self-sufficient approach that pursues initiatives in isolation. Our collaborations with a variety of startups are also progressing. We have already held nine DEMO DAY results debriefing sessions for companies selected by the JR East Startup Program, and further sessions are planned.\n\nTAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY is a symbolic example of how we will create new services and value. This development initiative will serve as 'an experimental site to create enriching lives for the next 100 years' where we collaborate with a large number of companies and academic institutions. Specifically, the University of Tokyo will establish the cross-disciplinary University of Tokyo GATEWAY Campus. In the new city, we will also partner with the National University of Singapore as well as Institut Pasteur, a French private research institute that is a world authority in research on infectious diseases. Through such collaborations, we will bring together many different types of expertise to develop TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY into a base for the creation of new business value. We hope to realize a city that creates cycles in which the various ideas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noriginating from such efforts are introduced to society, with the results being disseminated throughout Japan and the rest of the world and feedback on the disseminated initiatives being received and then reflected. I believe that it will become a very exciting city. This urban development project is progressing well. THE LINKPILLAR 1, which is the name of the twin towers in front of Takanawa Gateway Station, is scheduled to open in March 2025, while the construction of THE LINKPILLAR 2, a residential building, and another building will be completed by the end of fiscal 2026. The project is expected to account for overall investment of \u00a5600.0 billion and annual revenues of \u00a557.0 billion. On the former site of a rail yard, we created approximately 13 hectares of land for development. Of this area, we are using approximately 10 hectares to develop TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY. The project has symbolic significance for us because our inability to fully monetize our assets has been an issue for the Group. Another example of our efforts to monetize our assets is the Beyond Stations concept, which entails the creation of various revenue sources through greater utilization of railway station space. We have already begun developing businesses that are becoming a 'lifestyle platform' that is not limited to sales of goods, food, and beverages. These businesses include a hub that supports business matching for regional industries and clinics that can be used in combination with online services. The development of businesses in this way by using the Group's assets to create new value and maximize monetization is a major challenge for the growth of the Group. However, I am confident that we are equal to the task.\n\nBy steadily advancing the initiatives I have described, we aim to achieve the numerical targets of 'Move Up' 2027. The entire Group will forge ahead with its sights firmly set on achieving ROA of approximately 4.0% and reducing the net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA ratio to approximately 5 times in the medium term and to approximately 3.5 times in the long term.\n\nCorporate Go\n\nvernance\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors",

        "page_content": "## Initiatives Based on a Medium- to Long-Term Perspective\n\nViewing changes in the business environment as an opportunity to advance structural reforms and get onto a growth trajectory, we will take on the challenge of creating new value through business management based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions.\n\nWe are facing a transformation of the social environment the likes of which we have never experienced before. In addition to a declining population and an aging society and the labor shortages accompanying these trends, there is greater fluidity in human resources. Further, the social environment is evolving at an accelerating pace due to changes in values and lifestyles, technological innovations such as generative AI, and global climate change. I see these drastic changes in the business environment as an opportunity to make major structural reforms and get onto a growth trajectory. With respect to our aging society, we can create market-oriented businesses based on the concept of creating new markets for seniors. Through structural reform of business management, we will achieve our goal of establishing growth that is based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions.\n\nThe government has set the realization of 60 million visitors to Japan as a target to be reached by 2030. Without a doubt increasing numbers of visitors to Japan are a major factor supporting the growth of the Group. Including this trend, I believe that our growth will be driven by integrating the three elements of Transportation services, Lifestyle services, and IT & Suica services and by taking on the challenge of creating new people-focused convenience and value in the domestic market. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of a management structure built solely on the pillar of Mobility. Therefore, I believe that to ensure our sustainable growth we need to develop Lifestyle Solutions into another management pillar and establish a business management structure based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions.\n\nFrom a medium- to long-term perspective, we will continue to pursue ultimate safety levels and position safety as the top priority of business management. Safety is our unchanging mission and must never be undermined. Safety efforts never end. In our daily work, we are constantly raising levels of safety. This unremitting effort is the meaning of the phrase 'pursuing ultimate safety levels.' Clearly, this commitment to safety has been passed down as DNA from the days of JNR. With safety as a foundation, we must rapidly establish business management based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions. To this end, the Group will seek sustainable growth while further advancing integration and collaboration among its various businesses.\n\nTo date, our businesses have almost exclusively served customers who use railway stations. These businesses include ekinaka stores, shopping centers, and offices. While improving the services of these businesses, we need to broaden our field of vision to encompass areas outside railway stations and accelerate the development of businesses that target a wide range of customers, not just railway passengers. I believe we have to rebuild our\n\nbusiness model based on the premise of customers ordinarily gathering at railway stations.\n\nIn Mobility, we will not only actively incorporate a range of expertise and advanced technologies but also use our accumulated technological expertise to create and grow new businesses that offer leading-edge technological services. The trusted brand that we have built up is fundamentally supported by a safe, reliable transportation system. By continuing to promote digital transformation and use machines and systems for tasks that can be performed without humans, we will become a highly productive business and strengthen our profitability. For the Group, the railway business is very significant in that it provides real points of contact with customers. This business will provide a base for creating a competitive edge that no other company has, thereby contributing to the growth of the entire Group. Sustainable business operations will be achieved in Mobility through stability and growth.\n\nIn Lifestyle Solutions, we aim to increase profits through our medium- to long-term business growth strategy 'Beyond the Border.' With an eye on the future, we will further heighten the growth potential of existing businesses through market-oriented business strategies based on customer data and other information. In conjunction with these efforts, we will design new strengths by creating purposes (destinations) of travel and strengthening points of contact with individual customers through digital transformation. We will concentrate the investment of management resources on building the Suica economic zone through the evolution of Suica into a digital platform and the use of JRE POINT as a hub that links the Group's diverse businesses. In this way, we aim to double operating income over the next 10 years.\n\n## Initiatives in Fiscal 2025\n\nIn the current fiscal year, we are shifting management from the defensive mode of the COVID-19 pandemic to an offensive mode. We aim to create unprecedented new value by realizing synergies through integration and collaboration that takes advantage of our strengths in Transportation services, Lifestyle services, and IT & Suica services.\n\nFiscal 2025 will be a major milestone year as post-COVID-19 economic activities begin in earnest and a generational shift takes place in-house as the generation hired by JNR reaches retirement age. I view this significant social and economic transformation as an opportunity to further accelerate the Companywide structural reforms we have been undertaking. Beginning from the current fiscal year, I want to usher in a new era by setting out new growth strategies and boldly advancing them. With the aim of operating under a new framework for consolidated cash flow management in the current fiscal year, we have defined strategies and KPIs for each of our four business segments and 14 businesses as well as for the foundations of growth, which comprise human resources; digital transformation and intellectual property; finance and investment; and environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\n\nfactors. Based on these strategies and KPIs, Group employees will create value through integration and collaboration, maximize cash flows (economic value), and advance business activities that contribute to the solution of social issues (social value).\n\nRegarding specific measures in fiscal 2025, in Mobility we will further increase driver-only operations while continuing to streamline maintenance work through the utilization of digital transformation. In addition, we will work to increase tourism, including initiatives to attract more visitors to Japan, and implement growth investments for the introduction of Green Cars to the Chuo Rapid Line and the construction of the Haneda Airport Access Line (tentative name). Further, as the Revenue Cost Calculation Guidelines were partially revised in April 2024, we are carefully examining revenues and cost in light of this guideline, and if the conditions are met, we will promptly apply to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism for approval of a train fare revision. We hope to further popularize off-peak commuter passes by lowering their prices in October.\n\nWe will also continue dialogue with local communities regarding local lines. About 30% of all conventional lines had a traffic density of less than 4,000 passengers per day when JR East was established. As of fiscal 2023, the percentage of lines with this density reached about 50% due to the continuing decline in population and a shift to automobile use. The business environment for local lines is expected to become even more challenging in the future due to population decline and other factors. We recognize that it is extremely important to find ways of sustainably maintaining local transportation under conditions in which we are not able to realize the distinctive benefits of railway services, which transport large numbers of passengers to their destinations safely and reliably. In conjunction with efforts to promote management efficiency by streamlining facilities and simplifying operations, we will work together with local communities to gain the understanding and cooperation of the people living in line-side areas and examine how\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbest to achieve sustainable transportation systems. While building sustainable transportation systems, we must also engage with local communities through various businesses, such as tourism, Lifestyle services, Suica services, and Mobility as a Service (MaaS). By enhancing tourism resources so that customers become fans of specific regions and visit them repeatedly, we are increasing the number of people engaging with regions while promoting all kinds of regional industries, including agriculture and fishing industries and industries selling products that are unique to particular regions. The Group as a whole is engaged in collaborative regional development efforts that involve a range of different industries, such as Hako-byun train-based freight transportation service, which utilizes our high-speed transportation network to connect regional industries with the markets of the Tokyo metropolitan area. Going forward, the entire JR East Group will continue tackling the challenges of regions.\n\nIn Lifestyle Solutions, we will focus on real estate as a business that enables our future growth. We will move forward with development to increase revenue-producing real estate, and we will strengthen the operational capabilities of existing shopping centers and other facilities. At the same time, the Group will develop the rotational business, which is based on the real estate fund business, to improve capital efficiency and yields. In the current fiscal year, we have already opened many newly developed facilities. For example, we have opened EATo LUMINE, which is inside Shinjuku Station and comprises 28 stores, including new-format stores; the JR Aomori Station East Exit Building, which consists of a hotel, commercial facilities, and a hub aimed at providing medical care locally and attracting medical tourism; and CoCoLo Niigata, where the leasing of approximately 140 stores is progressing. Also, the retail business will further improve profitability by installing more Multi-Ecube lockers, which enable locker functions to be used as part of logistics networks, growing the revenues of JRE MALL, and implementing measures to further commercialize Hako-byun .\n\nThe promotion of MaaS is also important. By combining our railway network with local public transportation, we can significantly increase customer numbers in regions. The Group will accelerate MaaS initiatives to establish systems that optimally combine these transportation networks, thereby encouraging their use and helping enrich customers' lifestyles. Aiming to heighten the experience value of not only transportation services but also various aspects of our customers' lives, we will pursue alliances with municipal authorities and a range of businesses in the transportation and tourism fields and promote digital transformation.\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

        "page_content": "## Initiatives for the Establishment of Growth Foundations\n\nESG factors are fundamental to our business management. Based on our strengths of trust, employees, and networks, we will create value in relation to various social issues and help to build a sustainable society.\n\nSociety faces a variety of challenges, and we have to focus our efforts on addressing these social issues through our businesses. While our activities as a private company are premised on earning money, I think how we earn this money is the question. ESG factors are fundamental to the Group's business management, and the Group must fulfill social responsibilities in ways that are consistent with the characteristics of each of its businesses. The purpose of the JR East Group will be augmented if it uses its strengths of trust, employees, and networks as advantages to lay the foundations for the creation of many different types of value that build a sustainable society by reflecting increasingly complex and sophisticated social issues.\n\nSpecifically, we will accelerate initiatives aimed at the realization of a decarbonized, circular economy, which is a global task for all humankind. Although railways enjoy environmental superiority as a means of transportation, their operation consumes large amounts of energy. With the need for environment-friendly mobility growing, we will actively work to make railways an even more preferred means of transportation. Announced in 2020, our Zero Carbon Challenge 2050 long-term environmental objectives are a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by fiscal 2031, compared with their fiscal 2014 level, and net zero CO2 emissions by fiscal 2051. Further, in August 2023 we submitted a commitment letter with a view to acquiring Science Based Targets certification. Science Based Targets are emission reduction targets for greenhouse gases that companies set in line with the Paris Agreement goals. The source of the environmental superiority of railways is their extremely high energy efficiency per unit of transportation. Modal shifts to railways are particularly effective for urban and intercity transportation. Given that railways have the lowest CO2 emissions and energy consumption per unit of transportation, I believe that the environmental superiority of railways in such areas will remain unassailable, even if progress toward zero emissions is made in other modes of transportation.\n\nOn the social front, we will advance regional revitalization by strengthening ties with local communities and customers, engaging in collaborative community building, advancing regional and tourismoriented MaaS, and pursuing co-creation with local startups. We will also strengthen business activities that are aimed at respecting human rights, conduct activities in accordance with the JR East Group Policy on Human Rights and the JR East Group Policy on Customer Harassment, and promote sustainable procurement. In particular, to enhance employee engagement, we will create a system for business management that integrates ideas from the senior management team with opinions and ambitious proposals\n\nreceived from employees. We will create a new relationship between the senior management team and employees in which each person can make significant contributions to our operations and have a sense of participation in business management. I believe that this approach to business management will enable us to meet the growth expectations of Group employees and build strong engagement. To continuously increase their corporate value while adapting to changes in the business environment, companies must build human resource portfolios that anticipate the evolution of business portfolios. In addition, it is important for human resource strategies to complement management strategies aimed at such goals as the construction of organizations and the development of personnel that generate innovation and added value. The JR East Group needs flexible human resource policies. We have to create a flexible personnel system that is capable of catering to employees' diverse ambitions and that is suited to business management based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions. We will develop a training system that enables employees to play important roles in an array of business fields, including overseas fields.\n\nI also want to promote initiatives aimed at invigorating communication between the senior management team and Group employees. I regularly visit our workplaces with a view to creating opportunities for direct conversations between executives and employees. For example, we hold Breakthrough Communication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsessions in which head office executives talk with junior employees who are embarking on ambitious initiatives. In-house messages that I issue are always directed to all Group employees, and we establish new systems and training programs and implement health and productivity management with the entire Group in mind.\n\nThe messages I issue to employees constantly emphasize that I am fully cognizant of the whole Group.\n\nCorporate governance and internal control are very important elements of our efforts to grow as a Group. We will implement original internal control initiatives that, rather than simply stopping because there are risks, manage identified risks while enabling them to be optimally leveraged for the advancement of the Group's development. The Company has established Corporate Governance Guidelines to ensure that it makes transparent, fair, firm, and timely decisions. We strive for genuine collaboration with our stakeholders, including customers, local communities, shareholders and other investors, business partners, and Group employees. In this way, we will endeavor to achieve sustained business growth and enhance our medium- to long-term corporate value.\n\nIn June 2023, JR East transitioned to a company with audit and supervisory committee corporate governance structure. Under this structure, the authority to make important decisions on operational execution has been transferred from the Board of Directors to the executive directors to expedite decision-making and operational execution. Also, by strengthening the supervisory function of the Board, we intend to further enhance governance and pursue defensive and offensive risk management that promotes the Group's development.\n\nWe have been reforming jobs and our organization to adapt to dramatic changes in the business environment, heighten job satisfaction, and strengthen management operational efficiency. These reforms are based on a management policy of increasing the fields of work available to employees and thereby aligning their personal growth and job satisfaction with the Group's growth. Day-to-day issues that become management problems occur in the operations closest to customers and local communities. The Company has undertaken reorganization to transfer roles and authority so that employees who are closest to customers can solve day-to-day issues in the course of their duties. We hope the reorganization will allow employees to demonstrate creativity in operations close to customers and further heighten employees' motivation to take on the challenge of achieving personal growth and creating new value.\n\n## Management That Is 'Good For All'\n\nBy achieving steady growth, we will offer all our stakeholders enriched, cheerful lives.\n\nThe JR East Group creates opportunities for constructive dialogue with its shareholders and other investors to further their understanding of its businesses. Our goal is to build long-term relationships of trust so that we sustain business growth over the medium to long term. In deepening communication with our various shareholders and investors both in Japan and overseas, we will always disclose information in a timely and appropriate manner and facilitate constructive dialogue with these stakeholders based on a\n\ngood understanding of their expectations, requests, and criticisms. The Group has to grow profits by creating a better world through its business activities. We must then use the earned profits to provide customers, local communities, and shareholders and investors with returns. Moreover, we must not forget to further the happiness of all Group employees and their families. Of course, as a company, we need to grow. Accordingly, we will also use our profits to realize our next stage of growth. We call this management that is 'good for all,' and we will conduct well-balanced business management that keeps both corporate growth and stakeholders firmly in mind. Furthermore, we have a strong desire to work together with our employees to create a highly aspirational corporate group that is able to help with the resolution of various social issues, such as environmental problems, regional revitalization, and population aging, by constantly considering how our business activities can benefit society. By achieving steady growth, we will offer all our stakeholders enriched, cheerful lives. As we begin a new chapter, I would like all stakeholders to understand our activities and view the future of the JR East Group with optimism.\n\nYoichi Kise President and CEO September 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

Goals and achievements are reported to the Sustainability Strategy Committee and then disclosed. (Please see page 55 for details.)\n\n## Participation in Initiatives and Advocacy Activities\n\nWith the aim of realizing a sustainable society, the JR East Group promotes sustainability initiatives both within the Group and in cooperation with external parties. We actively participate in domestic and international initiatives and endorse related statements, on environmental issues in particular, working with other companies to energize such initiatives as climate change countermeasures and realize a sustainable society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMindful of its medium- to long-term vision, the JR East Group has established the following six material issues and is addressing social issues through its business activities.\n\n## Providing Society with Safe,\n\n## Reliable Infrastructure\n\nWe will provide society with safe, reliable infrastructure by placing safety at the top of management.\n\n## Risks and Opportunities\n\n- \u00b7  The occurrence of an accident or other incident is a risk that could have a serious impact on business management.\n- \u00b7  Safety inspires and increases trust, which is the foundation of all our businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReinforcement of\n\nBusiness Foundations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enriching the Global Environment\n\nWe will realize carbon neutrality and secure stable energy supplies, taking into account the effect of climate change on our businesses.

From now onwards, with the enrichment of everyone in their daily lives as our starting point, we will create new services and provide them to society by utilizing a multilayered real-world network and introducing technologies and knowledge from outside the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Vision in 'Move Up' 2027\n\n## Creating Value through Trust and Enrichment\n\nFocusing on people and advancing initiatives in cities, regions, and the world at large, we will offer value by realizing safety, enriching people's daily lives, and contributing to the happiness of our employees and their families.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Speed Up 'Move Up' 2027: Increasing the Pace and Level of Initiatives\n\nIn response to the dramatic changes in the business environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in September 2020 JR East developed Speed Up 'Move Up' 2027.

The Group has actively implemented capital expenditures supported by a strong\n\nfinancial base. In addition to this financial capital, we have abundant non-financial capital. Specific types of non-financial capital include the trust that the Company has cultivated over the 150-year history of Japan's railways, technological and operational experience that supports safety, close relationships with local communities, and a\n\nnetwork that links various stakeholders with real-world assets. Our financial capital and non-financial capital are the sources of cash flow, which is economic value, and they also create social value, such as safe, secure daily life, community enrichment, and a carbon neutral society. Our goal is to create a virtuous cycle in which economic value and social value are used to accumulate further financial and nonfinancial capital. To cyclically link value with capital accumulation, we will actively implement capital expenditures and address social issues.\n\nFinancial and Investment Strategies in the Value Creation Model\n\nAccumulating non-financial capital by addressing social issues\n\nExpanding our revenue base through active capital expenditures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn advancing the above value creation process, the cornerstone of our financial and investment strategies is consolidated cash flow management from a medium- to long-term perspective. The businesses operated by the Group, such as the railway business and large-scale real estate development, have a significant social impact and generally recover investments over long periods. For this reason, we are more focused on maximizing cash flows on a consolidated basis over the medium to long term than on profit in specific fiscal years. We will further enhance corporate value by achieving both sustainable growth and financial soundness.\n\nWith respect to the use of cash over the medium term, we plan to invest approximately \u00a53.9 trillion during the five years from fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2028, which is more than the approximately \u00a53.8 trillion in operating cash flow that is expected to be generated during this period. Of this investment amount, approximately \u00a51.7 trillion has been earmarked for growth investment. In particular, fiscal 2026 will see investment peak due to the full opening of TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY and the opening of the Oimachi development project. Therefore, we will engage in up-front investment until fiscal 2026. Partly as a result of the contribution to revenues from these large-scale development projects, free cash flow is expected to become positive from fiscal 2027 onward.\n\nAs for shareholder returns, we are aiming for a dividend payout ratio of 30%. Although in the near term we will give priority to the allocation of cash for growth investment, our aim is to achieve a total return ratio of 40% by fiscal 2028, when growth investment is expected to stabilize. In light of trends in capital expenditures and business performance, we will steadily enhance shareholder returns.\n\nIn the near term, an increase in interest-bearing debt is planned. However, we will steadily restore financial soundness by controlling interest-bearing debt in line with cash flow. Our policy is to reduce the net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA ratio, which we use as a management indicator for interest-bearing debt, to approximately 5 times in the medium term and to approximately 3.5 times in the long term. At the same time, we will strive to maintain our credit rating through sincere dialogue with rating agencies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What are your policies with respect to 'cash flow management optimized for business characteristics?'\n\nThe business management of the JR East Group is supported by two pillars: Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions. Our cash flow management is optimized for the characteristics of each business.\n\nMobility is a sustainable business that provides stability as well as growth. Based on safe and reliable transportation, we will work to increase revenues even further by capturing demand from visitors to Japan and by stimulating tourism demand. Regarding the revision of railway fares in the railway business, following discussions with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the Revenue Cost Calculation Guidelines were partially revised in April 2024. Therefore, if conditions are met, we will promptly submit an application for fare revision. With respect to the operations and maintenance of the railway business, we will utilize AI and other new technologies to build work systems that anticipate a 20% decrease in the working-age population. We will proceed with structural reforms aimed at achieving a further \u00a5100 billion reduction in the operational costs of the railway business by fiscal 2028 (compared with those of fiscal 2020). Through these efforts, we will raise the level of EBITDA. By ensuring that\n\ninvestment needed for the continuous operation of business and growth investment are within the scope of EBITDA, we aim to achieve sustainable business management. Our financial policy is to reduce the net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA ratio.\n\nLifestyle Solutions are growth businesses that swiftly anticipate change. As symbolized by TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY, our foundations and potential for revenues are significant. Going forward, we will accelerate our digital strategy by evolving Suica from travel and payment toward day-to-day life. In addition, through a marketing strategy that makes full use of the vast amount of data and information we gather, we will create a growth engine. Our financial policy is to focus on EBITDA growth in order to secure investment capacity that will lead to a stronger earnings base. Particularly in the Real Estate & Hotels segment, we will actively utilize interest-bearing debt to implement growth investment that advances many large-scale development projects, including projects that will contribute to earnings from fiscal 2029 onward. In the future, we will consider setting a target for the net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA ratio that is separate from the overall target.\n\n## Cash Allocation (from Fiscal 2024 to Fiscal 2028)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

Cash flow will be maximized both by generating cash through the addition of\n\nvalue in each business and by keeping transactions and the resulting cash within the Group. The first objective of establishing 14 businesses is to formulate and implement medium-term strategies from a consolidated perspective. Rather than proceeding on an individual Group company basis, JR East divisions and Group companies that belong to the same type of business will work together to formulate and execute flexible and bold growth strategies. The second objective is to achieve sustainable growth. By setting key performance indicators (KPIs) that emphasize medium-term cash flow and by optimally allocating the resources necessary for business operations, we will realize business growth and enhance the productivity of the entire Group. Our third objective is to advance a portfolio strategy. We will identify the strengths and weaknesses of each business through comparisons with other companies in the same industry. We will clarify priority fields, fields that should be strengthened, and fields where approaches to businesses need to be reviewed, and we will then realize an optimally structured business portfolio, taking into consideration external collaborations and M&As.\n\nOf course, we must consider overall optimization rather than pursuit of optimization for individual businesses. We have always engaged in projects that straddle businesses, such as projects that organically link the establishment of new railway stations, the installation of new automatic ticket gates, transportation improvements, and urban development. Going forward, we will accelerate the integration of different businesses more than ever and strengthen collaboration among them.\n\n## Two Pillars, Four Segments, and 14 Businesses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Mobility               | Lifestyle Solutions   | Lifestyle Solutions                     | Lifestyle Solutions   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Transportation         | Retail & Services     | Real Estate & Hotels                    | Others                |\n| Shinkansen             | Retail                | Real estate  ownership and  utilization | Suica and finance     |\n| Conventional lines     | Advertising and       | Real estate rotation                    | Overseas railway      |\n| Bus                    |                       |                                         | Energy                |\n| Railcar  manufacturing | Overseas              | Real estate  management                 | Construction          |\n\nUnder construction\n\nIn operation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How will the Group's employees be involved in promoting consolidated cash flow management?\n\nThe sources of sustained growth for the entire Group are its abundance of assets that produce revenues as a network, and its diverse personnel who have grown by overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the long periods that the\n\nGroup often requires to earn returns on capital expenditures, the rapid generation of cash by realizing the potential of existing assets without being restricted by their past uses is required. This is because the rapid generation of cash will enable the establishment of a virtuous cycle in which generated cash is allocated to further investment, thereby generating even more cash. To ensure that each Group employee is more engaged in addressing such management tasks as enhancing asset efficiency, we have created two systems.\n\nThe first system is the ROA(R) System. The '(R)' stands for railway, and 'ROA(R)' refers to the ROA of the railway business, which has a particularly large volume of assets. The denominator of ROA(R) is the fixed assets of the railway business. To emphasize cash generation, we have made the numerator EBITDA rather than operating income. Further, through the use of a ROA(R) Tree, we have subdivided this indicator into elements related to the railway business, including revenues, cost, capital investment, and the turnover ratio of fixed assets. Also, we have developed the system so that an EBITDA KPI showing the cash to be generated is set for each headquarters and branch office. Under the system, these targets can be achieved by increasing revenues, reducing costs, and enhancing asset efficiency. In addition, the system shows how the specific initiatives at each workplace contribute to ROA(R) and enables the Companywide sharing of ideas and good case studies from respective workplaces. We hope that the continuous generation of cash resulting from workplaces' efforts to use this system to enhance of profitability and asset efficiency will create a significant wave.\n\nThe second system is referred to as the Area Management System. Particularly in the railway business, collaboration among workplaces is essential in daily operations. Accordingly, we promptly quantify the results of steady day-to-day measures and initiatives, such as measures to increase revenues and reduce costs in areas that encompass and unite workplaces. By visualizing the numerical results of measures and visualizing area revenues and costs in this way, we are enabling personnel to proactively consider how to heighten the value of their own areas and providing strong support for bottom-up efforts that improve area value. We have established the Area Management System and ROA(R) System in an integrated, Companywide manner, creating a structure that allows each employee to participate in management.\n\nIn Lifestyle Solutions, we will adopt a consolidated viewpoint in efforts to optimize real estate, one of our key management resources. We will not only utilize assets effectively through such measures as repurposing company housing sites for commercial and residential purposes but also improve profitability by strengthening existing assets for which issues have yet to become apparent when the assets are viewed from the perspective of individual Group companies. We will also enhance asset efficiency through the utilization of the real estate rotation business. Under the this business, we sell our own properties to private real estate investment trusts (REITs) and funds to secure development profits promptly. We then reinvest the resulting capital in areas with high growth potential.\n\nIn addition to our previously established consolidated ROA target of 4.0% for fiscal 2028, we set new ROA targets for business segments in April 2024. We aim to achieve the ROA targets by realizing business management in which all employees participate.\n\n## ROA(R) Tree\n\n<!-- image -->",

In March 2024, we analyzed and evaluated our current situation with regard to action to implement management that is conscious of cost of capital\n\nand stock price and formulated a policy for future efforts toward improvement.\n\nWith respect to the price-to-book ratio (PBR), which indicates the stock market's evaluation, our goal is to realize a PBR that exceeds 1.0 times and increases consistently. PBR is the product of return on equity (ROE), in other words the rate of return, multiplied by the priceearnings ratio (PER), which reflects anticipated growth. Therefore, we need to increase PBR through both rate of return improvement and growth expectations. Since we have a huge volume of fixed assets for railway operations, the previously explained enhancement of ROA through efforts to improve profitability and increase asset efficiency will directly lead to the enhancement of ROE and PBR. For this reason, raising ROA beyond the 4.0% target will also raise the level of ROE. We recognize that the cost of equity is around 5% to 6%. Even if the cost of shareholders' equity rises in the future, we will aim for ROE that\n\nconsistently exceeds the cost of equity. Further, we will enhance growth expectations by ensuring active dialogue between our senior management team and shareholders and investors; by enhancing disclosure of business information and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information; and by communicating businessspecific strategies.\n\nWe place paramount importance on practicing ESG management. The source of the Group's growth is human resources. The growth of employees is the driving force behind the Group's growth. We will provide new value to society by realizing the potential of each employee and enhancing employee engagement. We will also work together with our various business partners to address increasingly complex and sophisticated social issues through our business activities. Going forward, we will endeavor to earn the long-term trust of our shareholders and investors. In conjunction with these efforts, we aim to meet the expectations of stakeholders by pursuing the enhancement of corporate value.\n\nhttps://www.jreast.co.jp/e/investor/taiwa/\n\n## PBR Tree\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental Investment and ESG Bond Issuance\n\nWe place paramount importance on practicing ESG management, and we plan to invest approximately \u00a5130.0 billion in such initiatives over the five years from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028. For us, environmental investment means decarbonization investment that contributes primarily to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Specifically, it includes the introduction of high environmental performance rolling stock, LED lighting in stations, and the development of high-efficiency air-conditioning.\n\nSince January 2020, we have issued six sustainability bonds* 1 in Japan and three green bonds* 2 overseas. Further, in February 2024 JR East received the Silver Prize (Minister of the Environment Award) at the ESG Finance Awards Japan (Fund Procurement Category), organized by the Ministry of the Environment.\n\n- *1  Sustainability bonds: The proceeds of these bonds are used for projects that contribute to the resolution of environmental problems and social issues.\n- *2 Green bonds: The proceeds of these bonds are used for projects that contribute to solutions to environmental problems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Note: The calculations of '2025 (Forecast),' '2026 (Outlook),' and '2027 (Outlook)' reflect the following changes, which came into effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n- \u00b7 The classification of JR East Sports Co., Ltd. and GALA YUZAWA Co., Ltd. was changed from the Retail & Services segment to the Real Estate & Hotels segment.\n- \u00b7 The classification of JREFU Hotel Management & Consulting Co., Ltd. was changed from the Real Estate & Hotels segment to the Retail & Services segment.\n- \u00b7 The recognition of JR East's revenues from rent of the space under elevated railway tracks was changed from the Transportation segment to the Real Estate & Hotels segment.",

Takuya Uchiyama discusses the path taken to develop and deliver a service that benefits customers, participating companies, and the JR East Group and that helps to solve the major social challenge of alleviating congestion.\n\n## Sustainable Railway Operations Enabled by Off-Peak Commuter Passes\n\nOff-peak commuter passes are passes that can be used at anytime excluding peak hours on weekday mornings and that are offered at a price approximately 10% cheaper than regular commuter passes. Peak times are set based on customer traffic at the stations in question, mainly around 8am on weekdays when traffic is at its highest.\n\nUntil now, measures to alleviate congestion during the weekday morning rush hour have focused on strengthening JR East's 'hardware' through capital investment, such as increasing the frequency of trains and the number of railcars to boost transportation capacity, as well as implementing direct services like those on the ShonanShinjuku Line. However, capital investment requires substantial amounts of money and time, and in some cases the efforts of our Company alone have not been able to fully meet our customers' needs. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has made customers keener than ever before to have reduced congestion and to avoid the 'Three Cs' (closed spaces, crowds, and close contact), leading to major changes in the way they work and commute, such as telecommuting and conducting meetings online. Given these developments, we have launched a new off-peak commuter pass service in an effort to alleviate congestion not only through adjustments to 'hardware' but also to 'software,' by encouraging 'peak shifting.'\n\nI believe that this service can be positioned as an initiative to strengthen our management structure dramatically. As off-peak commuting becomes more widespread, it will lead to a more flexible cost structure for the Company. In the medium to long term, this will also serve as a stepping stone to allocating the Group's resources more appropriately, such as by reducing the number of railcars and the frequency of trains, and by leveling out the deployment of station staff. We will continue to promote the use of off-peak commuter passes since they will no doubt benefit both our customers and the\n\nparticipating companies, and they will contribute to sustainable railway operations and the provision of high-quality services by JR East.\n\n## Taking on the Challenge of Addressing Social Issues through Products That Encourage Behavioral Change\n\nIn introducing the off-peak commuter pass, we have truly overcome many challenges. Railway fares are subject to a maximum price system based on the total cost method, and any fare revision that involves changing the maximum price requires government approval. In the case of off-peak commuter passes, it is possible to lower prices within an upper limit by filing a notification with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, but simply reducing the price would mean reduced revenues for the Company. What happened, therefore, was that we sought permission from the government to simplify the procedures by raising the price of regular commuter passes by 1.4% and reducing the price of off-peak commuter passes by 10%, which it described as a 'fare revision' based on the assumption that this change would 'not result in increased revenue.'\n\nAs a result, the government issued a processing policy that stipulates the simplification of the procedures for revising fares, and based on this policy, we applied for approval of a variable fare system using simplified procedures, which led to the launch of our new off-peak commuter passes. We have engaged in repeated consultations with the government and, after much hard work, improved the current system.\n\nAt the time of the launch, this was a new and unprecedented service so we had a lot of trouble coordinating with various parties, both in terms of educating our own employees and also in terms of informing the relevant railway companies on how to handle the service and requesting that posters be put up providing information on peak hours. We also focused on advertising, using posters, pamphlets, and setting up a special website, to instill customer awareness of the product as quickly as possible.\n\nAs this was the first such initiative in the railway industry, customer reactions were mixed. Although alleviating congestion is a meaningful initiative that helps address a particular social issue, customers need more motivation to change their behavior. At JR East, we believe it is important to create products that contribute to peak shifting so that there is an economic incentive to off-peak commuting. It is we, the business operators, who can provide products and services that encourage behavioral change in customers. I believe that by providing services that respond to changes in society, and by gaining the understanding and cooperation of companies and customers, as well as further support from the national and local governments, we can address the social issue of alleviating congestion.\n\nApproximately one year after the service was launched, the purchase rate is around 8%, which is roughly half of our target figure. Although there are now more than 200,000 users, that is still a fair way away from our target. Going forward, we plan to step up our efforts to reach out to companies (who pay their employees' commuting allowances) and focus on increasing the number of new users who use our services during off-peak hours.\n\n## Advancing Discussions Beyond the JR East Group and the Rail Industry\n\nFrom October 2024, we will raise the discount rate to 15% and further widen the price difference, as part of our efforts to increase the purchase rate for off-peak commuter passes. In particular, since many companies cover their employees' commuting costs, we believe that this price reduction will help create the incentives companies require to adjust working hours and switch from the standard commuter pass. We will also provide even more detailed information about the product than before.\n\nFor example, peak hours are determined only by the time of station entry, and with a 15% discount, commuters can enter stations during peak hours three to four times a month and still break even, meaning they can also report to work during peak hours to handle urgent business. So, we will actively communicate these benefits, which should help convince companies to adopt off-peak commuting.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of off-peak commuter passes and the price hikes for commuter passes were made possible by the issuance of a national notification following the Interim Report of the Subcommittee on Improvement of Railway Fares and Charges Systems. This marks the first time in the long history of railway fares and pricing systems that the upper fare cap has been changed in a way that is not based on the total cost method. We believe that being able to take on the new challenge of lobbying the government to change the system is an epoch-making development for the railway industry, and we hope to advance discussions further with the government and other operators about introducing more flexibility into the existing rigid fare system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Off-Peak Commuter Passes are a Gateway to Greater Flexibility in Fares and Charges Systems\n\nIn April 2024, parts of the Government's Revenue Cost Calculation Guidelines, which serve as the basis for calculating railway fare levels, were revised for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century, but the fare system itself has not yet been revised. We will continue to urge the government to enable us to create a simple and flexible fares and charges system so that our customers can use railways more conveniently and comfortably. We are currently examining our revenues and costs based on the revised calculation guidelines, and if the conditions are met, we plan to apply for approval for fare revisions. We will make the necessary capital investments to provide our customers with safe, secure, and comfortable services, and we hope to contribute to sustainable railway operations.\n\n## Overview of the Off-Peak Commuter Pass\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur off-peak commuter pass is a Suica commuter pass that can be used at anytime excluding off-peak hours on weekday mornings and that is approximately 10% cheaper than a regular commuter pass. This service aims to alleviate congestion by setting peak times during rush hour (mainly around 8 A.M. on weekdays) at eligible stations and encouraging passengers to shift their travel schedules during peak hours.\n\n## Features\n\n## 1) Cheaper than a Standard Commuter Pass\n\nCurrently, the price is set at about 10% cheaper than a standard commuter pass, and the discount rate will be increased to 15% from October 2024. When combined with the 5% JRE POINT bonus on off-peak commuter passes that has been in place since March 2024, this represents an even bigger discount.\n\n## 2) Applies to Specific Train Sections in Tokyo\n\nThe pass can be used for any journey that is completed within a specific section of JR East's Tokyo train network, and also applies to Suica commuter passes that span private railways and subways. However, off-peak commuter fares only apply to services on JR lines.\n\n## Issues Addressed by the Off-Peak Commuter Pass\n\nThe introduction of the off-peak commuter pass is expected to bring a variety of benefits to both customers and companies.\n\nProviding a Safe and Comfortable Commuting Environment by Reducing Congestion\n\n- \u00b7  Switching to off-peak commuting can mitigate the physical and psychological impacts of congestion, and it also has the potential to boost workers' motivation and lead to more effective use of their time.\n- \u00b7  For customers who must commute during peak hours due to the nature of their work, the passenger load will decrease as other customers shift their commutes from peak hours, thus creating a more convenient commuting environment than before.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResults of Survey of Purchasers of Off-Peak Commuter Passes\n\nReduced Commuting Allowances\n\n- \u00b7  The option to purchase commuter passes at lower prices offers the prospect of substantial cost reductions for companies.\n- \u00b7  Some companies have introduced this service to certain employees only, based on the characteristics of their work. Thus, companies can adopt off-peak commuting in stages in keeping with their individual circumstances.\n\nContributing to the Retention and Securing of Talented Personnel\n\n- \u00b7  A workplace environment that accepts and promotes diverse workstyles leads to greater employee satisfaction and more competitive recruitment.\n\n## Current Issues and Future Outlook\n\nOur goal is a 17% purchase rate, and since the current purchase rate is around half that, we are focusing on getting more customers to buy off-peak commuter passes by raising the discount rate and providing further price incentives, as well as further strengthening advertising and publicity for the product content. Additionally, we will continue to work with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Smooth Biz as well as economic organizations to encourage companies to adopt offpeak commuting and create a society that promotes diverse workstyles such as staggered commuting and telecommuting.\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

Through such patronage, we are able to gather various forms of data, such as mobility, consumption, and payments, which constitute assets specific to the Group. We will utilize this data to put into practice the market-in business strategy set out in our medium- to long-term business growth strategy, Beyond the Border.\n\nTo this end, in existing businesses, we will not only implement data marketing in the development of products and services such as ekinaka and advertising but also increase profitability by efficiently running our businesses using digital technology by generating business synergies with startups, primarily in Southeast Asia, through a corporate venture capital fund established in Singapore. Over the medium to long term, we will also enhance lifetime value through JRE POINT.\n\nIn terms of new businesses, we are working to establish JRE MALL and the Hako-byun railway parcel transportation service as businesses that are unique to the JR East Group and to differentiate them from the competition.

We are working with the local community to promote the appeal of Akita Prefecture and are challenging ourselves to create new value via Hako-byun .\n\n## Advantages of Hako-byun over Other Means of Transportation\n\nHako-byun is a parcel transportation service that utilizes JR East Group trains and benefits from the speed of the Group's railways, high-quality transportation, and wide-area network. This project was born from the idea of transporting fresh local products by Shinkansen to farmer's markets held at terminal stations to promote the allure of the Eastern Japan area. We can provide high-added-value parcel transportation services by utilizing existing infrastructure, such as the space in the onboard sales preparation compartments of passenger Shinkansen and limited express trains. We see Hako-byun as a nextgeneration delivery service.\n\nMost parcels are transported by truck and freight train, but trucks only carry cargo one way and are often empty on their return journeys. In contrast, since Hako-byun uses existing railway networks and train services, it avoids those shortcomings. Furthermore, I believe we can\n\nhelp address social issues in the logistics industry, such as driver shortages and environmental impact, by carrying both passengers and parcels on a mixed basis using railways, which are a mode of transport with a relatively low environmental impact.\n\nLoading Japanese sake onto Shinkansen trains\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Collaborating with Local Residents to Contribute to Regional Revitalization\n\nOne of the objectives of the JR East Group Management Vision 'Move Up' 2027 is making regional areas more prosperous, and I believe that Hako-byun 's business contributes to the development of local communities. I also work at farmer's markets selling Akita products at terminal stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and I receive particularly positive feedback on the high-added-value products shipped in that very same day, such as Asatsume and Asashibori (morning brewed) Japanese sake packed that morning and freshly picked vegetables. This has given me a strong sense of the added value that rapid transportation can bring to distribution. In addition, when making sales we also promote tourism by distributing pamphlets and merchandise and explaining local specialties. These activities are possible thanks to the involvement of not only JR East Group employees but also many local people in Hako-byun operations. We have been reaching out to various people in local communities to promote Hako-byun patronage. Although it has been a challenging business to provide a rail-based parcel transportation service, everyone has showed interest and listened to what we have to say. I believe this is due to the connection we have had through working together on tourism events to enliven the entire Akita prefecture. I also believe that these initiatives have been made possible thanks to the strong public trust that the JR East Group has built up over the years. Through this series of activities, we hope to directly convey the attractive aspects of Akita to the public, thereby encouraging people to visit and increasing the number of people with ties to and who interact with the region.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSelling Japanese sake at nomono Akihabara, select shop\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFresh products on sale at the Sanchoku-Ichi (farmers' markets) at Omiya Station\n\n## Using Teamwork to Overcome Difficulties\n\nHowever, there are also challenges to overcome in actually running the business. These include loading items onto trains in a brief window of time while still allowing passengers to board and disembark, keeping train schedules in mind, and coordinating with train crew. Normally, the loading and unloading of Hako-byun trains is handled by staff from Group companies in charge of logistics, such as JR East Logistics Co., Ltd., but some stations, such as Omagari Station, which is under my jurisdiction, do not have any local Group company offices in the vicinity, so station employees are responsible for loading and unloading packages. To improve efficiency, all employees work together to create formations and conduct simulations. Working quickly with limited manpower is always a challenge, but we are seeing results from workplace reconfiguration through the integration of station and transport workplaces based on the Group's efforts to deepen integration and collaboration. At Omagari Station, we are working in partnership with Yokote Station and our transportation department, as well as with train conductors and crew attendants. This is truly a cross-divisional effort.\n\nWe will continue to accelerate integration and collaboration in all aspects and deliver more attractive products by understanding cus-\n\ntomer needs through regularly scheduled delivery and marketing, rather than mere one-off deliveries. We also aim to achieve mutual prosperity with local communities by utilizing local resources and developing new sales channels.\n\nTransmitting train operation instructions to crew members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Working with Shippers to Promote Regional Allure\n\nWe conducted this reporting at Suzuki Brewing and Co., a partnership that brews and sells Japanese sake in Daisen City, Akita Prefecture. They use Hako-byun to transport sake, including the famous Hideyoshi brand, from Akita Prefecture to the Tokyo metropolitan area. Working in cooperation with the local community, we are promoting the allure of Akita Prefecture outside the prefecture.\n\nSuzuki Brewing and Co. and employees of JR East Akita Branch\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview of Hako-byun\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHako-byun is the name of our parcel transportation service that uses Shinkansen as well as conventional train lines. Fresh food, medical supplies, machinery, electronic parts, and other items entrusted to us by our customers are quickly delivered to their destinations with the punctual and reliable transportation that only railways can provide. Transportation by train is also attracting attention in terms of its low environmental impact.\n\n## Features\n\n## 1) Speed\n\nTaking advantage of the speed of our Shinkansen and limited express trains, which can travel up to 320 km/h, it is now possible to take vegetables and fruit harvested in rural areas in the morning and deliver them to and sell them in Tokyo in the evening, making it possible to transport extremely fresh products with high added value.\n\n## 2) High-Quality Transportation\n\nShinkansen and limited express trains combine high speed with minimal vibration to transport many passengers in comfort. They also boast very high levels of punctuality. By ensuring this high level of transportation quality, they are able to flexibly respond to various customer needs, including precision instrument parts and medical supplies.\n\n## 3) A Railway Network Spanning Far and Wide\n\nJR East's Shinkansen network starts from Tokyo Station and spans the Hokkaido, Tohoku, Yamagata, Akita, Joetsu, and Hokuriku regions. Taking advantage of this network, we can meet a wide range of needs, such as transportation from outlying regions to the Tokyo area and back again.\n\n## Various Measures\n\nWe have implemented a range of measures since launching our Shinkansen parcel transportation service in 2017. We are constantly evolving and improving convenience by incorporating feedback from customers and those in the field.\n\n| High-Volume  Transportation Using  Passenger  Compartments         | Utilization of passenger compartments as well as onboard  sales preparation compartments makes it possible to  transport more goods.                                                                                                                             |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Collaboration with JR  Companies                                   | Fresh products are transported from Shin-Hakodate Hokuto  Station and Kanazawa Station in collaboration with JR  Hokkaido and JR West. Furthermore, collaboration with other  JR companies makes it possible to transport famous  products from various regions. |\n| Transportation of  Products from the Tokyo  Area to Regional Areas | Products otherwise limited to the Tokyo area are transported  to regional cities on outbound trains.

It is good to have customer demand for the service but there are limits as to how much loading and unloading we can do at originating and terminal stations and to the amount of cargo that can be loaded onto trains. Going forward, we will implement various measures, mainly focusing on boosting transportation capacity, so that we can further increase custom. By connecting regions through people and products, we will promote regional revitalization and enrich peoples' lives in ways that only the JR East Group can.\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

By co-creating with a variety of partners, we will provide the kind of value that only the JR East Group can create.\n\n## Leading Projects by Taking Advantage of Diverse Backgrounds\n\nI joined the Company in 2006 and have been involved in the Shinagawa development project since 2016. I heard about this project when I was job-hunting. I was attracted by the large scale of the project and the unique possibilities for urban development, which is why I applied to join the Company. After joining the Company, I gained experience in store operations and tenant leasing in station buildings, as well as property management of land and areas under elevated railway tracks, and from 2016 I got involved in land readjustment projects and urban redevelopment projects in the Shinagawa area. I believe that I have had a rare career path for a JR East Group employee, learning about the practical aspects of startup investment at a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley for about a year and a half from April 2022, and studying business co-creation through collaboration with startups. I am currently in charge of creating a startup ecosystem in TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY.\n\n## Community Development That Only the JR East Group, a Company with a Long History and a Trusted Brand, Can Achieve\n\nI believe that the key to the success of this ambitious project lies in the JR East Group's broad range of businesses and its trusted brand. The Group operates a wide variety of businesses, including offices, shopping centers, housing, and hotels, and one of its strengths is the large number of points of contact with customers. By linking our extensive customer contact points and the mobility data collected by\n\nSuica with a variety of real-world and digital services, we hope to develop people-focused services that only we can provide. In addition, this project is made up of members with a variety of backgrounds, including many seconded from Group companies and some with experience as train crew. I believe that the ability to advance a project from such diverse perspectives is something unique to JR East.\n\nAnother strength is the reliability of our railway business, which is highly regarded not only in Japan but also around the world. I believe that the Group has a unique advantage in promoting community development thanks to the trusted brand that it has cultivated both domestically and internationally, including safe and clean stations and fast, punctual Shinkansen trains.\n\nIn the co-creation of the startup ecosystem that I am currently in charge of, I believe that the strengths of the Group have allowed us to attract a diverse range of partners, including companies and universities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aiming to Solve Global Social Issues\n\nTakanawa is a place of innovation in that it was the first place in Japan where an embankment was built on the sea, over which Japan's first train run about 150 years ago. I believe we must carry on the legacy of the aspirations of our predecessors that led to the railway network we have today and work to make Takanawa a community that can help solve global social issues. As demonstrated by the development of generative AI, the creation and innovation of new businesses is accelerating around the world, meaning it is difficult for a company to create something new on its own. I think that going forward, it will be increasingly necessary for us to develop by building win-win relationships with our partners, rather than remaining self-contained within the Group. By creating people-focused lifestyles, which is a goal of 'Move Up' 2027, and by co-creating networks with a diverse range of partners, TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY will become an experimental site to create enriching lives for the next 100 years, a place where we will take on the challenge of innovating.\n\n## Opening Up New Possibilities through Community Development\n\nCommunity development does not end with the opening of a new facility. We plan to set up a co-working space and incubation facility as a base for realizing a startup ecosystem, which I am responsible for. I would also like to work on developing the mechanisms necessary for establishing partners and communities to conduct pilot projects, and for co-creating with those partners. I believe it is our mission to use TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY as a proving ground for enriched lifestyles, to generate various synergies, and to leverage the JR East brand value in developments cultivated through this project to expand further business opportunities both in Japan and overseas.\n\nFurthermore, through this project, we hope to cultivate as many human resources as possible with the ability to create new businesses. It is my hope that we will use the knowledge we have gained from this project to cultivate human resources with the mindset for creating policies that will contribute to profit growth of the entire Group as well as creating new businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Making Original Beer to Create a Place for People of All Generations to Interact\n\nIn community development, collaboration with the local community is important to us. At TAKANAWA HOP WAY, we brew beer using hops grown with the cooperation of Takanawa area residents of all generations to participate in community development.\n\nCommunity members toast the completion of beer made with Takanawa hops\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview of TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY\n\nAs part of the Shinagawa Development Project, TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY aims to create an experimental site to

experimental site to create enriching lives for the next 100 years I believe it is vital that we continue to co-create and generate synergies with a variety of partners and the local community. By providing a place where the people who gather in this community can take on new challenges and grow, the JR East Group will continue to create mechanisms that generate new innovations from the community and disseminate them to Japan and the world.\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

We took a look behind the scenes at this unprecedented challenge and the background to its success.\n\n## JRE Bank's Unique Features as Compared with Other Banks\n\nViewcard Co., Ltd. is operating JRE BANK as a banking agent. We are responsible for financial services of the JR East Group and are engaged in payment and finance businesses, primarily the credit card business. I joined the project before the JRE BANK department was established, and I am currently in charge of configuring operations. This was the first attempt by JR East Group to enter the online banking service market, so we faced many challenges in creating an unprecedented new business from scratch, but we successfully launched the service in May 2024.\n\nUnder the concept of 'bringing experience to one's life,' JRE BANK not only provides value to customers by helping them increase their assets in the manner of general financial institutions but also utilizes the JR East Group's business fields to offer benefits to customers who deposit financial assets.\n\nThrough JRE BANK, we aim to improve convenience for our customers and help them live enriched lives.\n\n## Why the JR East Group Decided to Expand into the Banking Industry\n\nThe customers who use the JR East Group's services, although mostly in eastern Japan, are located all over the country. We are undertaking a variety of initiatives to build and deepen long-term engagement with our customers. Compared to credit cards, banking services are used by a wider range of people, from children to the elderly. For this reason, we have established the JRE BANK business with the aim of building and strengthening long-term, deep engagement in conjunction with Suica.\n\nThe service benefits offered by typical banks are often financial, such as deposit interest rates and transfer fees, but in addition to these, JRE BANK offers a wide range of benefits unique to the JR East Group. For example, benefits include discount coupons offering a 40% discount on one-way fares for Shinkansen and other JR East line trains, as well as special offers and discounts at participating JR East hotels. Not only do these measures have direct benefits for customers, but they also help expand and increase points of contact with the Group, starting with banking services.\n\nThe JR East Group's growth has been led by its railway business, but rather than customers actively choosing us because of the services and products we offer, they use our services without thinking, simply treating them as a daily means of transportation, and we recognize this gap as a challenge. Therefore, starting with JRE BANK, which offers unique special benefits, convenience, and other high added value from the JR East Group, we aim to penetrate the various services of the JR East Group into everyday life to help increase engagement with the Group. In addition to instilling a keener awareness among customers of their use of the Group's services, we will position JRE BANK as a gateway for learning about the wide range of services offered by the Group, and we will create opportunities for customers to use the Group's services in addition to railways, such as shopping at station buildings or staying at hotels. By attracting more customers, we will create a virtuous cycle that will lead to growth for the Group.\n\n## Helping Enrich Life for All Our Customers through JRE BANK Benefits\n\nWhen considering what kind of benefits we could provide to our customers by launching JRE BANK, we initially thought that our customers would probably most appreciate cash-equivalent benefits, such as rewards points redemption and fee discounts. Ultimately, though, we decided to promote benefits based on the JR East Group's services as the primary benefits, as these benefits truly demonstrate the Group's collective strengths. And it turned out to be a hit! We are delighted that our customers have found high added value in benefits that utilize the products and services we provide, and that they have been so pleased with them. These benefits give our customers a greater range of choices in life. Such choices might include an opportunity for customers to visit their hometowns, to travel, or to enjoy a luxurious dinner at a hotel on their birthday, and we believe that these experiences can help enrich life for our customers, their families, and those around them.\n\nI also believe that the reason we have received so many applications to open accounts, despite being newcomers to the market, is due to the JR East Group's trusted brand. I believe that our customers entrust their valuable assets to us because they can see the financial services we provide as being safe, based on the trust we have earned from our customers through the repeated operation of safe and secure railways every day.\n\n## Developing JRE BANK into a Pillar That Supports JRE POINT Lifestyle Zone\n\nJRE BANK has been extremely well received, with applications exceeding initial plans. For the time being, we will continue to stabilize our foundation so that we can meet such high demand. To ensure that our valued customers continue to use JRE BANK over the long term, we will thoroughly inform them of the qualifications for receiving benefits and continue to create services that please them. In addition, we will consider new measures as may be required to further spread the word about JRE BANK and obtain more accounts.\n\nIn the medium to long term, we would like to develop JRE BANK into a pillar that uses financial services to support the expansion of the scope of JRE POINT. With the launch of JRE BANK, the payment methods offered by the Group now include the option of immediate payment by debit card, in addition to prepaid Suica and postpaid credit cards. This will enable us to meet the diverse needs of our customers. We will continue to increase engagement between our customers and the Group, leading to growth for the JR East Group.\n\n## Overview of JRE BANK\n\nJRE BANK is a digital financial service provided by JR East and Viewcard Co., Ltd.* It provides services such as deposits and home mortgage loans through dedicated accounts, and offers many benefits related to the JR East Group. It uses financial services to encourage customer engagement with various businesses, leading to increased use of the services of each Group company.\n\n- *  Viewcard Co., Ltd. acts as an intermediary for the conclusion of various contracts as a bank agent with Rakuten Bank Ltd. as its affiliated bank.\n\n## Features\n\nJRE BANK offers a wide range of services and products to meet the diverse needs of the JR East Group's customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1)  Customers can obtain various benefits that utilize the Group's business areas.\n\n- 2) Customers can use banking services with a single app.\n\n## Benefits Based on Usage\n\nBy offering special benefits that take advantage of the JR East Group's business fields, we aim to help all our customers enrich their daily lives. For example, we offer the following rail benefits, providing opportunities for customers to use train services at a discount for travel and daily transportation.\n\n| JRE BANK Discount  Coupon (40% off)            | One coupon offers a 40% discount on one-way fares and fares  on lines operated by JR East. (Twice a year, if qualified maximum  of 10 coupons per year)            |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dokokani Byuun!  2,000-points discount  coupon | Dokokani Byuun!  offered at 2,000 points off the regular 6,000  points (Four times a year, maximum of 12 coupons per year)                                         |\n| (Mobile Suica only)  Suica Green Ticket        | Offer of Suica Green Tickets, for riding in the Green Car  (first-class) of standard trains free of charge. (Four times a year,  maximum of four coupons per year) |\n\nFurther details about JRE Bank benefits are available at the following link (Japanese only): https://www.jrebank.jp/top/\n\n## Future Developments\n\nIn June 2024, we formulated a new medium- to long-term business growth strategy called Beyond the Border, and announced an initiative to build a new digital platform through the evolution of Suica. We plan to create a Suica app (tentative name) and expand the Suica economic zone, in which JRE BANK will play a major role. By utilizing financial and payment information through JRE Bank as well as rail travel data in our marketing strategies and service development, we aim to provide customers with one-to-one, highly convenient services, and achieve synergy through integration and collaboration across Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions.\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

We are advancing various initiatives that respond to the diverse ambitions and initiatives of our employees and encourage their growth. JR East's basic human resource strategy is to create new engagement between employees and the Company and to expand a virtuous cycle in which employees achieve self-development by taking on new challenges and their resulting personal growth spurs the Group's growth. Specifically, we have positioned human resource strategy as one of the key strategies for achieving 'Move Up' 2027. Accordingly, in Mobility we aim to realize a highly productive workstyle that allows employees to demonstrate creativity and ingenuity in frontline offices. At the same time, we aim to concentrate human capital in priority growth areas. In these ways, we will realize business management based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions.\n\nIn 'Move Up' 2027, we call on all employees to play important roles. To this end, we have been taking measures that enable employees to experience a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment through their work and to feel a sense of job satisfaction. Further, JR East promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) management based on the belief that the Company's growth will be driven through the contribution to operations of a diverse workforce with a greater diversity of values. In addition, we will conduct flexible, person-centered human resource management, and we will create growth opportunities tailored to each individual so that a diverse range of personnel can play active roles. Through these efforts, our goal is to simultaneously achieve job satisfaction enhancement and productivity enhancement at an even higher level.\n\n## Human Resource Strategies for Realizing Our Vision\n\nThus far, we have implemented a variety of human resource measures aimed at realizing 'Move Up' 2027. In addition to introducing flexible workstyles, these measures have expanded employees' work fields by delegating authority and transferring operations to frontline offices. JR East will continue to create job satisfaction by viewing all Group employees as taking loading roles and continue to heighten the value of the Company's human capital. Further, the Company will link these improvements to the sustained growth of employees and the Group. We are also examining new human resource strategies that will enable employees to fully demonstrate their technical skills and specializations. With diversity, flexibility, and growth as our watchwords, we aim to enhance job satisfaction and the employee friendliness of working conditions.\n\nBy advancing a range of measures that encourage employees to take on new challenges, JR East will respond to the growth aspirations of each employee and create new engagement between employees and the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New Engagement between Employees and the Company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures to Overcome Human Resource Challenges\n\nJR East has identified eight challenges that it must overcome in relation to the evolution of work, workstyles, and workplaces in order to reflect changes in the relationship between employees and the Company, create new engagement between employees and the Company, and forge ahead with management strategies.\n\nWe will promote five human resource measures aimed at overcoming the eight challenges. In these efforts, the key themes will be skills utilization, advanced specialization, role diversity, and workstyle flexibility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (1) Transformation of Human Resource Portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human Resource Measures\n\n## Advancement of Management Premised on DE&I\n\nIncreasing workforce diversity, ensuring equity, and fostering organizational inclusiveness\n\n## Fundamental Improvement of Work Quality\n\nReviewing the utilization of skills and systems Creating systems for growth and the realization of abilities\n\n## Flexible Allocation of Human Resources\n\nAssigning human resources to priority growth fields and\n\nStrengthening of frontline systems acquiring highly skilled personnel\n\n## Reconstruction of Recruitment, Management, and Training Systems\n\nFacilitating autonomous career development in relation to both advanced specialization and role diversity\n\n## New Human Resource System\n\nRedesigning the system to respond to the efforts and achievements of motivated employees\n\n## KPIs for Human Resource Strategies (Examples)\n\n## (1) Reform of Human Resource Portfolio\n\nAssignment of personnel to priority growth fields: 2,000 or more in total\n\n## (2) Engagement\n\nCategorization of important engagement items and the establishment of a survey methodology\n\n## (3) DE&I\n\n- \u00b7  Percentage of managers who are female: 10% or more\n- \u00b7  Acquisition rate of paternity leave: 85% or more\n- \u21d2 Third General Employer Action Plan (Page 91)\n\n## (4) Health and Productivity Management\n\nPercentage of employees receiving regular health checkups: 100%\n\nPercentage of highly stressed employees: 10% or lower\n\n\u21d2 JR East Group Health Vision 2029 (Page 96)\n\n## Assignment of personnel to priority growth fields Fiscal 2028 target: 2,000 or more in total\n\nces\n\n## Results of Using an Open Recruitment System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nces\n\nesour\n\nnal human r\n\nSecuring exter\n\n## Stepped-Up Hiring of Experienced Personnel\n\nWe will actively and flexibly hire highly specialized personnel by introducing year-round hiring and diversifying our recruitment channels.\n\nWe are also implementing Welcome Back hiring, whereby personnel who left us to advance their careers are encouraged to return to our organization.\n\n## Launch of Job Specific Personnel Management\n\nWith the aim of powerfully advancing businesses in priority growth fields, in fiscal 2025 we began job specific personnel management that is limited to those working in designated business fields.\n\n(Fields where job specific personnel management is used)\n\n- \u00b7 Development and real estate\n- \u00b7 Suica  services\n- \u00b7 Data  marketing\n- \u00b7 Introduction of common standards for next-generation mobility\n- \u00b7 Maintenance  business\n- \u00b7 Communications  business\n- \u00b7 Energy  business\n\n## Work and Employee Engagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (2) Engagement\n\nJR East conducts engagement surveys covering all of its employees.

To further promote in-house digital transformation, the JR East Group must decisively advance data utilization and human resource development. Our Digital & Data Innovation Center and 'Key in-house promoters of digital transformation, DX pros' will lead efforts to enhance digital technology skills and foster a corporate culture that embraces new digital technologies. In addition, with an emphasis on strengthening data and AI governance, we will create an environment that enables the appropriate use of data and generative AI.\n\nWe will modernize systems to create a platform that supports businesses and adapts as they change. More specifically, by applying the latest technologies and architecture to preexisting systems that were created and optimized in isolation, the Group will build a new systems architecture that enables overall optimization.\n\nIn research and development, the Group will pursue forward-looking innovations to address the management and frontline issues that it faces, such as a declining working-age population, energy and environmental issues, and countermeasures for increasingly severe natural disasters.\n\nTo ensure that the abovementioned innovations generate revenues, we must remain mindful of intellectual property. By pursuing collaborations based on open innovation with external parties while appropriately managing our intellectual properties, we will increase the pace of new value creation and operational reform and enhance corporate value.\n\n## Setting Out a Medium- to Long-Term Vision\n\nWith a view to value creation through digital transformation, in fiscal 2024 the Innovation Strategy Headquarters set out its target profile in the form of a medium- to long-term plan. As foundations for the promotion of innovation, the headquarters will develop employees with advanced digital literacy, establish and enhance systems and data infrastructure, and advance intellectual property strategies that complement open, innovationenabled external collaborations and business strategies.

In accordance with the JR East Group Philosophy, we manage them appropriately and on an integrated Groupwide basis and advance intellectual property activities that create value in the form of trust and enrichment. Policies\n\n- 1.  We will implement intellectual property activities that support the utilization of information (data), technologies, and brands in initiatives aimed at enhancing the power of our network and which thereby enable innovation and the offering of new lifestyles to our customers.\n- 2.  We will earn the trust of all stakeholders, local communities, and the international community by respecting the intellectual properties (intangible assets) of third parties.\n\n## Intellectual Property Management Structure\n\nThe Intellectual Property Center of the R&D Unit, Innovation Strategy Headquarters, which manages patents, designs, and technical information, and the Legal Division of the Corporate & Legal Strategies Department, which manages trademarks and copyrights, work together to acquire and utilize intellectual property rights, and formulate and implement intellectual property strategies for the purpose of business co-creation and other activities.\n\n## Number of Intellectual Property Rights Held and Applications Filed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNo. of patents, utility models, and designs held (left)\n\nNo. of trademarks held  (left)\n\n- No. of applications (patents, utility models, designs) (right)\n- No. of applications (trademarks) (right)\n\n## System Modernization Initiative\n\nThere are approximately 2,000 systems in operation at the JR East Group. The architecture of these systems has become large and complex due to the cumulative effect of incremental modifications carried\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nout over many years. Using the latest technologies and architecture, we have begun changing over to a systems architecture that enables overall optimization. We will be able to adapt this new platform as our businesses change.\n\nPersonnel from business operations, systems operations, and Group companies will work together and hold a series of discussions on keeping business management and IT integrated as the systems architecture is gradually renovated to make it more agile and flexible.\n\n## Specific Intellectual Property Activities\n\nIn businesses related to Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions, the Intellectual Property Center and the Legal Division are engaged in activities such as intellectual property education and training, the building of intellectual property portfolios through the acquisition of patent rights and trademarks, and the development of personnel with expertise in intellectual property matters.\n\nWith respect to education and training on intellectual property, in accordance with the philosophy described on the left we conduct regular training sessions to ensure that all employees are aware of the proper handling of intellectual properties and to improve intellectual property literacy so that employees are cognizant of intellectual properties while working.\n\nIn building intellectual property portfolios, the Company determines whether or not to apply for and keep patents and other rights based on its policy of enhancing the quality of patents and other rights.

Maintaining safety in transport is our top priority.\n- II. Safety is ensured and achieved through the dutiful and proper observance of established rules and procedures.\n- III.   Safety is ensured by understanding the importance of thorough confirmation and communication.\n- IV.   Safety is ensured through mutual cooperation and going beyond one's official responsibility when necessary.\n- V.   When in doubt, the safest course of action should be taken after thorough and calm consideration of the available options, basing our decisions on the situation at hand.\n\n## Fundamental Concept\n\nSince the establishment of JR East, safety has been the top priority of business management, and we have worked relentlessly to heighten our levels of safety. Earnest efforts to learn from unfortunate accidents in the past have enabled JR East to further the prevention of future accidents through its continued development of both tangible and intangible measures. JR East is committed to steadily improving tangible countermeasures as well as to ensuring that each one of its employees takes all possible intangible measures. Furthermore, by pursuing ultimate safety levels, we will steadily reduce the risk of accidents and thereby build trust, which is the foundation of all business, and provide society with safe, reliable infrastructure.\n\n## Group Safety Plan\n\nJR East has historically implemented a series of five-year safety plans. In November 2023, we formulated our new Group Safety Plan 2028, which is our eighth safety plan.\n\n## Group Safety Plan 2023\n\nUnder the themes of 'Evolution' and 'Move Up,' we developed a variety of initiatives centered on each individual's 'safe behavior.' Countermeasures from both tangible and intangible perspectives and the unrelenting efforts of the entire Group led to steady improvements in safety.\n\nFormulation of Group Safety Plan 2028 to further solidify the safety  foundation we have built and 'reach for safety'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Safety Plan 2028\n\nIn order to respond appropriately to changes in the environment surrounding the JR East Group, we have adopted the theme of 'Taking the nature of railway work to heart, imagine the unexpected, reach for safety!' We will further strengthen our cooperation with everyone involved in the JR East Group, remembering that safety is created by all of these people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Safety Plan\n\n## Overview of Group Safety Plan 2028\n\nThe environment surrounding the JR East Group is in a state of great upheaval, with technological innovation, population decline, changes in lifestyles following the COVID-19 pandemic, and increasingly intense and frequent natural events. In order to eliminate the potential for previously unimagined accidents and incidents, it is necessary for us to respond appropriately to these changes. Group Safety Plan 2028 identifies four key areas to focus on over the next five years, and we will proceed with specific initiatives accordingly.\n\n## Our Changing Circumstances\n\n| Internal Potential risks brought about by changes in workstyle and organization, systems, group administration, and fewer  opportunities to learn from actual accidents   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| External Potential risks related to greater intensity and frequency of natural events, population decline, advance of digital                                             |\n| transformation (DX), new lifestyles resulting from COVID-19 pandemic, and diversification of workstyles                                                                   |\n\nPotential for unprecedented accidents or events.\n\nChanging circumstances we must keep in mind have been divided into four categories:\n\n- 1) Human/machine (or digital) interfaces\n- 2) New workstyles and organization\n- 3) Diversified methods of communication\n- 4) Increased intensity and frequency of natural events\n\nThe need arises to identify specific initiatives from within these four categories and take appropriate action.\n\nDetailed information is available on our website.\n\nGroup Safety Plan 2028\n\nhttps://www.jreast.co.jp/e/data/pdf/group\\_safety\\_plan.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Foreseeing the Unexpected\n\nSignificant changes in the operating environment, both internal and external, have increased the likelihood of 'heretofore unforeseeable accidents or events.' We will increase awareness using undertakings focused on the actual nature of the work at hand, remembering what has been useful in similar circumstances; we will address hazards that were previously unthought of; and we will identify and address issues even when working with new systems due to changes in the environment.\n\nStarting with simple awareness and progressing onto imagining what could happen, we will prepare for hazards accordingly and prevent regrettable outcomes that we could have avoided.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expanding 'the Expected'\n\nPeople tend to limit their thinking when planning or strategizing and focus on 'the expected,' while outside those limits lies 'the unexpected.' But when people widen the boundaries of 'the expected,' that which may have been assumed as unlikely can now be considered as a possible future scenario.\n\nThe first step begins with increasing one's awareness. It is important to consciously increase awareness and widen the boundaries of one's assumptions.\n\n## Increasing Awareness\n\nWe will look at things from a different point of view to increase awareness.\n\nHow to Increase Awareness\n\n- \u00b7  Be extra conscious of unfamiliarity in a situation, especially when it is (1) Something new to you, (2) Something that has changed from before, or (3) Something you have been away from recently* (*called the 3Hs in Japanese: Hajimete, Henk\u00f5, Hisashiburi).\n- \u00b7  Learn from the perspectives of others-everyone has different assumptions.\n- \u00b7  Observe! See how it is done at other workplaces, departments, branches, companies, and industries, etc.\n\n## Increasing Awareness and Expanding the Boundaries of 'the Expected'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\n## Providing Society with Safe, Reliable Infrastructure\n\n## Group Safety Plan\n\n## Four Key Areas\n\nWe have highlighted four key areas going through particularly important changes that will require attention over the five years through 2028. By understanding and reconsidering daily tasks while paying attention to these areas, we will address hazards that were previously unthought of.\n\n## 1) Human/Machine (or Digital) Interfaces\n\n- \u00b7  We must properly understand the mechanics and structures of machines and how they operate in order to make informed judgments on malfunctions or irregular situations that can only be resolved by man power.\n- \u00b7  We must try to foresee unanticipated situations based on our understanding of the above, and carefully consider what is involved when incorporating new systems.\n\n## 3) Diversified Methods of Communication\n\n- \u00b7  We must ensure that crucial details are not overlooked or misunderstood. We must be selective in how we use which communication tools and for what situations, mindful how information is conveyed and/or received.\n\n## 2) New Workstyles and Organization\n\n- \u00b7  We must keep the nature of our job/work in mind when rules and structures are being overhauled and not take it for granted that things will be as they were before. Keep one step ahead and foresee potential hazards.\n- \u00b7  To increase awareness among all employees on the frontlines, we must plan and implement training sessions where each one learns to think critically and independently.\n\n## 4) Increased Intensity and Frequency of Natural Events\n\n\u00b7  We will increase use of meteorological data from outside sources, digitalization, establish new systems, and promote investment in disaster prevention training.\n\n## The Legacy of Our Safety Culture\n\nAt the foundation of our safety initiatives is a culture of safety that the JR East Group has built up over the years. We will continue to cherish and nurture this culture of safety into the future.\n\n## The Origin of Our Safety Culture with the Challenge Safety Movement\n\nWe have been undertaking the Challenge Safety (CS) Movement since September 1988, emphasizing that each employee must take responsibility for safety and the initiative to act.\n\nFour rules of CS activities\n\n1) Present ideas 2) Share with coworkers 3) Discuss with teammates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCS activities in the workplace\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Five Important Habits Resulting from CS Activities\n\nActions rooted in enforcement of the CS philosophy have resulted in the establishment of important habits that have reduced the number of accidents and recurrence of common mistakes. In the Group Safety Plan 2028, we work on our ability to foresee 'the unexpected' based on these five habits.\n\n## Five Habits\n\nThe habit of 'reporting properly'\n\nThis is where safety initiatives begin to take hold.\n\nThe habit of 'noticing'\n\nRecognizing and noticing warning signs and passing them on. Confronting doubts, identify underlying issues to devise realistic countermeasures.\n\nThe habit of 'confrontation\n\nand debate'\n\nThe habit of 'learning'\n\nLearning from incidents to apply lessons and prevent similar situations.\n\nThe habit of 'action'\n\nThinking objectively when taking action is the key to safer resolutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4) Share Groupwide\n\n## A Tried-and-True Code of Conduct for All Group Companies\n\nTrying too hard to keep to schedules sometimes results in not following safety confirmation procedures properly, which jeopardizes safety. The entire JR East Group will commit to implementing our firm Code of Conduct to stop the train when it is unsafe to proceed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTraining on stopping trains\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Three Actualities Principle for Action\n\nAccidents and incidents always occur at the genba . Since they occur at the genba , the sources of accident prevention can also be found at the genba . We not only go to the genba but also link our impressions of it and what we learned there to safety action.\n\nActual locations: Visiting actual locations to\n\nunderstand actual conditions Actual objects: Viewing actual objects (rolling stock, equipment, machinery, etc.) in order to understand actual conditions Actual people: Meeting face-to-face with the people involved to understand actual situations\n\nVisit to the Mikawashima Accident Memorial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Learning and Applying the Warning Signs\n\nIn order to prevent accidents and other events from occurring as well as prevent their recurrence, we have established rules regarding the reporting and classification of accidents and other events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How We Organize Safety Management\n\n## Safety Management Regulations\n\nIn response to a revision of the Railway Business Act, JR East formulated its safety management regulations in October 2006. These stipulate various safety management-related matters such as the responsibilities of top management executives in ensuring the safety of operations and in organizational matters and the selection of chief safety management officer, operation managers, and train crew training managers. To ensure transportation safety, we have built a system to promote operations centered on safety management officers and involving executives responsible for safety through to frontline staff.\n\n## Structures to Promote Safety Measures\n\nIn 1987, we established the Railway Safety Promotion Committee, chaired by the director general of the Railway Operations Headquarters, at head office. This committee aims to enhance railway safety and prevent accidents by elucidating the causes of major accidents, formulating measures to prevent recurrence, and determining and promoting measures for safety-related equipment and rolling stock.\n\nWe also have Regional Safety Promotion Committees, which are chaired by the heads of branch offices and managing organizations. These committees enhance railway safety at branch offices and seek to prevent accidents. They also liaise with the Railway Safety Promotion Committee to implement specific measures.\n\n## Management Structure for Transportation Safety\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (1) Chief Safety Management Officer\n\nSelected from the Director General of Railway Business Headquarters or their equivalent\n\n## (2) Operations Manager\n\nSelected from the Department Director of Mobility Service Department, and the Department Director of the Shinkansen Transport & Rolling Stock Department or their equivalent\n\n## (3) Train Crew Training Manager\n\nSelected from the heads of Drivers & Conductors depots\n\nGrowth Strategies\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors",

In order to improve safety, however, we must work together with the same sense of values. We built JR East Safety Network (JES-Net), and 41 companies have now joined it. JES-Net carries out checks to ensure that safety works have been carried out correctly, facilitates discussions, and works to solve problems and improve safety levels across JES-Net.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConfirmation of work by JES-Net\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KYT Trainers Driving Safety Within the Company\n\nKatsuyuki Iijima Safety Planning Department JR Chiba Railway Service Co., Ltd.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJR Chiba Railway Service Co., Ltd. had been facing a perennial issue of repeated accidents and incidents. To address this issue, as well as to encourage employees to consider potential dangers in their everyday work, the Company introduced KYT (danger prediction training), which has been in use in the construction industry since 2011, and it currently has 88 in-house trained KYT trainers who are actively working in their respective workplaces. KYT trainers conduct training by focusing on recurring events and considering various scenarios to prevent hidden dangers during work, such as by implementing role-playing using actual vehicles.\n\nBy conducting a range of KYT-based training in this way, safety awareness has increased throughout the company, and we were able to achieve zero 'vehicle operation-related accidents and incidents' in fiscal 2024. We will continue to work to enhance our safety levels.\n\nKYT trainer training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmergency response training planned and operated by KYT trainers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety Initiatives for BRT Services\n\nIn the Kesennuma Line/Ofunato Line BRT service, we are working to ensure safety in cooperation with our two subcontractors, Miyako Bus Co., Ltd., and Iwate Kotsu Co., Ltd. In addition to various training using actual vehicles and joint information\n\nTsunami evacuation drills\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexchange meetings between the three companies, we also share and solve issues as well as work to strengthen collaboration through BRT Safety Meetings, where safety officers exchange opinions on site.\n\n## Preparedness Against Natural Disasters\n\nNatural disasters have been intensifying throughout Japan. For example, in March 2022, the Tohoku Shinkansen derailed due to the 7.4-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, and Hokuriku Shinkansen carriages were submerged at the Nagano Shinkansen Rolling Stock Center when the Chikuma River flooded during Typhoon No. 19 in 2019. We are therefore implementing a range of measures and initiatives to prepare for such intensifying natural disasters.\n\n## Our Measures Against Earthquakes\n\n## Seismic Reinforcement Measures\n\nLearning from earthquake damage in the past, we are systematically conducting seismic reinforcement of our structures to prepare for large-scale earthquakes such as an earthquake striking the Tokyo metropolitan area directly, which is expected to happen in the near future.\n\n## Evolution in Seismic Reinforcement Measures\n\n- January 1995: Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake\n- Implementation of emergency seismic reinforcement measures\n- May 2003: Sanriku-Minami Earthquake\n\nExpansion beyond the area of the emergency seismic reinforcement measures\n\n## October 2004: Niigata Chuetsu Earthquake\n\n## March 2011: Great East Japan Earthquake\n\nCommencement of seismic reinforcement measures in preparation for an earthquake striking directly below Tokyo\n\nExpansion of countermeasure areas and addition of further measures based on the latest knowledge\n\n## March 2022: Earthquake off the coast of Fukushima\n\nReview of reinforcement plans for 'ramen' rigid frame viaduct abutments, utility poles, etc.\n\nSeismic reinforcement of elevated reailway tracks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStructural reinforcement of utility poles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KPIs\n\n* Target for FY2026\n\n| KPIs (Numerical Targets for FY2028)                                                       | KPIs (Numerical Targets for FY2028)   | FY2024 Results          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Countermeasures for major  earthquakes (seismic                                           | Shinkansen  100%*                     | Shinkansen 38%          |\n| reinforcement): Rigid-frame  viaduct abutments (subject to  ministerial ordinances, etc.) | Conventional lines  100%              | Conventional lines  21% |\n\n## Measures for Emergency Stopping of Trains\n\nWe are constructing systems to ensure that high-speed trains can stop as quickly as possible in the event of an earthquake. Since the opening of the Shinkansen line, these systems have undergone various improvements, including the addition of more seismometers, improved methods for estimating earthquake information, and the use of external earthquake information such as the Japan Meteorological Agency's Earthquake Early Warning System and the ocean-floor seismometers of the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience. In 2023, we improved the process for estimating earthquake magnitude after earthquake detection. Verification of 13 earthquakes over the past three years has shown that the revised estimation method reduces the time required to stop power transmission after detection of the first weak tremors from an average of 3.9 seconds to an average of 1.3 seconds, a reduction of 2.6 seconds. All Shinkansen seismometers have been improved, and we have been using them since March 2024.\n\nUsing the seismic information provided by this Shinkansen system, we have also installed an early earthquake warning system on conventional lines to provide emergency stop notification if large-scale earthquakes are observed.\n\n## Shinkansen Early Earthquake Detection System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures to Prevent Derailment on Shinkansen\n\nWe have measures in place to prevent Shinkansen trains from deviating too far from the track even in the event of derailment due to an earthquake. In addition, in response to the derailment of a Shinkansen train caused by the March 2022 earthquake off the coast of Fukushima, we are considering new derailment prevention measures, such as further improving derailment prevention effectiveness and creating a vehicle structure that exerts strong damping force against strong lateral shaking and decreases the likelihood of derailment.\n\n## L-Shaped Car Guide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nL-shaped car guide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nL-shaped car guide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Preventing Breaks at Glued Insulated Joints\n\n## Rail Rollover Prevention Devices\n\nBefore improving glued insulated joints\n\nAfter improving glued insulated joints\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## General Emergency Drills\n\nEvery year, we conduct comprehensive disaster-preparedness drills, assuming an earthquake has struck, most notably during disaster prevention week, which includes September 1st. In the fiscal 2024 training, fire drills were also conducted, taking into account the fact that this was the 100th anniversary of the Great Kanto Earthquake. In addition, at stations and other locations at risk of flooding, we are working with relevant parties to conduct drills simulating flooding at stations that are prone to such risk.\n\nOn-site disaster countermeasure headquarters operational drill\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFirefighter drill for rescuing passengers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Implementation of Rescue and First Aid Drills and Preparation of Kits\n\nIn the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake, JR East conducts its own rescue and first aid training courses with the aim of ensuring passenger safety and teaching our employees first aid to administer as first responders in the event of a major earthquake. We also prepare kits to meet various rescue needs.\n\nJR East rescue/lifesaving course\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRescue kits\n\n## Measures Against Tsunamis\n\nBefore the Great East Japan Earthquake, we had set operational restriction methods and tsunami danger zones for each location, prepared manuals, and were holding study sessions and conducting drills on guiding passengers to alight from trains for evacuation. We believe that these efforts led to the prompt evacuation of passengers away from tsunami danger zones at the time of the earthquake.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTsunami evacuation manual\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDrill to guide passengers in alighting from a train in an evacuation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors",

Gather information by yourselves and if communication lines are disconnected, make your own decisions for evacuation. (Do not hesitate because you are worried about evacuating and then later realizing that a tsunami has not in fact occurred.)\n- (2) H aving decided to evacuate, judge the conditions of passengers, and promptly guide passengers to evacuate.\n- (3)  In alighting from trains, evacuating, and gathering information, ask passengers and local people to cooperate.\n- (4)  Even after evacuation, keep moving toward higher places without assuming that you are high enough to be safe.\n- (5)  Stay evacuated with customers and do not return to field offices or trains while tsunami warnings are still being issued.\n\n## Tsunami Evacuation Navigation System\n\nLearning from the tsunami evacuation at the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake, we have developed and introduced tools to help crew on trains in operation to guide passenger evacuations in unfamiliar locations.\n\nTsunami evacuation navigation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures for Rainfall\n\nTo prevent landslides due to rainfall, we are systematically implementing disaster prevention measures along slopes and other areas throughout the railway network.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCutting slope protection (spray framework)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmbankment slope protection (spray framework)\n\nIn recent years, rainfall disasters have become more severe as well as more frequent, and localized heavy rains are on the rise. In response, in June 2023, we introduced new operational regulations using precipitation radar on conventional lines. On Shinkansen as well, to prepare for the increased risk of disasters due to recordbreaking rainfall and other future anticipated events, since fiscal 2022 we have been proceeding with rainfall disaster prevention work. In addition, in 2020, we introduced new regulations requiring detailed assessment of rainfall volumes using weather radar and the temporary suspension of Shinkansen operations in the event of heavy rain to confirm safety.\n\n## Conceptualization of Train Operation Restrictions Using Precipitation Radar on Conventional Lines\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u21d2 Extraction of radar rainfall with 1 km x 1 km mesh overlapping our railway lines\n\n\u21d2\n\nFor each station, the stricter of\n\n\u2776\n\nor\n\n\u2777\n\nabove is applied.\n\n## Initiatives to Address Flooding\n\nWe have been working to enhance flood-response measures, having suffered significant damage from Typhoon No. 19 in October 2019, when overflowing rivers caused damage to railcars on the Hokuriku Shinkansen.\n\nFor railway facilities, we have been setting priorities for each facility and implementing hardware measures. In addition, utilizing hazard maps, we have introduced a Vehicle Evacuation Judgment Support System at rail yards where there is a risk of flooding, to promptly evacuate vehicles in the event of a disaster. With this system, we have developed indicators to support decisions on vehicle evacuation, and when each indicator reaches the set value, an alarm sounds to notify the people concerned.\n\n## Vehicle Evacuation Judgment Support System\n\n## Decision support indicators for vehicle evacuation\n\n- (1)  Forecast river water level (large rivers)\n- (2)  Forecast river basin rainfall volume index (small and medium-sized rivers) (3)  Basin rainfall forecast (all rivers)*\n\n* Prepared by JR East\n\nOutside weather companies\n\nData aggregation\n\n(1)  River water\n\nlevel forecast\n\n(2)  River basin\n\nrainfall volume\n\nforecast\n\nRainfall forecast\n\nJR East\n\nAlarm activated\n\nwhen specified\n\nvalue exceeded\n\nDedicated terminals\n\n(On-site disaster countermeasure\n\nheadquarters, etc.)\n\n- Note:  The evacuation of railcars is judged based on comprehensive consideration of the system and general meteorological information.\n\n## Indicators to Aid Decisions About Evacuating Railcars\n\n## River water levels\n\nRiver water level near rail yards\n\n## Basin rainfall index\n\nIndicator quantifying the potential for river flooding near rail yards\n\n## Basin rainfall\n\n## Amount of rainfall\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote:  We determine the level of urgency of flood disasters by comparing the basin rainfall index publicized by the Japan Meteorological Agency with flood warnings and other standard values.\n\nRiver basin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJapan Meteorological Agency indicator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: In addition to these indicators, we use general meteorological information to make a comprehensive decision on railcar evacuation.\n\nPreparation of\n\nflood forecast\n\ninformation\n\n(3)  Basin rainfall\n\nforecast\n\nInformation\n\ndissemination\n\n## Protecting Against Strong Winds and Gusts\n\nSince a train accident on the Uetsu Main Line in December 2005, we have introduced the major wind-related initiatives described below.\n\n## Increased Number of Anemometers (Wind Meters)\n\nWe typically install multiple anemometers on sections where wind-based operating restrictions are in effect. We have also increased the number of anemometers in locations where windbreak fences have been installed. To ensure accuracy, we\n\nUetsu Main Line, between Sagoshi and Kita-Amarume\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nare also moving toward the installation of dual anemometers.\n\n## Installation of Windbreak Fences\n\nWe install windbreak fences to protect railcars from the wind.\n\n## Utilizing Meteorological Information for Operation Control\n\nWe have developed a method to restrict operations using meteorological information, such as rain intensity measured by the Japan Meteorological Agency's weather radar and the agency's 'nowcasts' on the likelihood of tornadoes, to predict gusts of wind that could be generated by cumulonimbus clouds. We are currently using this system along sections on the Sea of Japan in winter.\n\n## Display Image of Operation Control Area Using Meteorological Information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operation Control Method Against Wind Gusts Using Doppler Radar\n\nThe system uses a Doppler radar to detect vortices that cause wind gusts by observing the movement of raindrops and other objects in the sky, and it issues an alarm when a train track is located within the predicted path of the vortex. This system was jointly developed with the Japan Meteorological Agency's Meteorological Research Institute and has been in operation on the Uetsu Main Line and in some sections of the Rikuu West Line since winter 2017. Since then, we have continued to expand the scope of train operation regulations and to improve the accuracy of vortex detection using AI.\n\nDoppler radar installed at Kuromori, Sakata\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operation Control Method against Wind Gusts Using Doppler Radar\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives for Volcanic Eruptions\n\nThe main characteristics of volcanic disasters are the impacts of volcanic mudflows and ash fall, and in particular even a small amount of volcanic ash fall can potentially impact train operations. JR East uses volcanic hazard maps issued by local governments to identify those railway lines and sections that will likely be affected, and, if there is a risk of a volcanic eruption, we set up a countermeasures headquarters to determine whether train operations can continue and whether evacuation is necessary.\n\n## Initiatives Related to the Use of Weather and Disaster Prevention Information\n\nWe have assembled JEMAPS, a digital twin platform that automatically collects a vast amount of internal and external data related to railway operations and weather and natural disasters, which have become increasingly severe in recent years, from systems, data infrastructure, and other sources, and displays it on a single map. We began putting JEMAPS into use in June 2022.\n\nes\n\nFeatur\n\n## Method of use\n\n- \u00b7  Visualizes information in an easy-to-understand way\n- \u00b7  Reflected on the platform in real time\n- \u00b7  Collected data is stored in database with searchable history\n- \u00b7  Confirmation of railway operation status, warnings, advisories, landslides, inundation damage, flood risk distribution, etc., in the event of heavy rain or an earthquake\n- \u00b7  Used as reference information for customers and employees to make evacuation decisions, in combination with information obtained on-site\n\nJEMAPS aerial view of the Tokyo metropolitan area: 'Railway operations + local heavy rain'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

We are steadily installing these detectors with newly improved features that set higher standards for detection performance and reduce false positives caused by falling particles such as rain and snow.\n\nRegarding level crossing warning lights to notify the approaching of a train, we are replacing conventional warning lights with omnidirectional warning lights so that they can be easily seen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nby elderly people with lower sight lines and automobile drivers who enter level crossings from roads.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLevel Crossing Obstacle Alarm Devices (Emergency Buttons) We are installing emergency buttons to notify train operators of danger if vehicles, etc., get stuck at a level crossing. So far, we have completed the installation of these devices at all level crossings within a 100 km radius of Tokyo where vehicles pass, as well as at level crossings susceptible to tsunami damage. In fiscal 2018, we also improved the visibility of all emergency buttons and standardized guide signs.\n\nLevel Crossings for Easier Passage In addition to elevating and widening roads at level crossings, where necessary, we are using colored pavements or adopting other approaches for roads that cross railways, such as building pedestrian overpasses, and making improvements as dictated by local conditions.\n\n## Safety Measures at Level Crossings\n\n## Campaigns and Other Activities Aimed at People Using\n\n## Railway Level Crossings\n\nWe collaborate with police and other relevant organizations to encourage accident prevention at level crossings and schools.

We aim to complete construction by the end of fiscal 2032, one year earlier than previously planned, by introducing lightweight Smart Platform Doors \u00ae and reducing the construction period through a review of design loads.\n\n- *1  The number of stations is counted by line, e.g., Yurakucho Station is counted as two stations, one on the Yamanote Line and one on the KeihinTohoku Line.\n\nKPI\n\n| KPI (FY2032 Numerical Targets)        | KPI (FY2032 Numerical Targets)   | FY 2024 Results                          |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Railway stations and                  | 330 railway                      | 117 railway stations, 233                |\n| tracks with automatic  platform gates | stations, 758                    | tracks (approximately  31%* 2  progress) |\n|                                       | tracks                           |                                          |\n\n*2 Based on the number of tracks\n\n## Railway Lines Where Platform Doors are Scheduled for Installation by the End of Fiscal 2032 (Announced in April 2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Campaigns and Other Activities for Customers Using Our Railways\n\nIn addition to customer care and assistance carried out by station staff and guidance provided through station broadcasts, we conduct the year-round Assistance and Support campaign, which solicits the cooperation of not only JR East Group employees but also general customers using our rail services to assist customers in need, including those with visual impairments.\n\nIn addition, together with various companies and agencies, we are jointly implementing campaigns such as Zero Platform Accidents, and Stop Using Smartphones While Walking.\n\n## Investment in Safety Facilities\n\nSince its establishment, JR East has prioritized investment in safety. In its Group Safety Plan 2028, JR East expects to invest approximately \u00a51.3 trillion in safety. Through ongoing comprehensive risk assessments that take into account environmental changes, we will continue to make effective safety investments, enhance safety equipment, and develop technologies that contribute to increased safety.\n\n## Trends in Safety Investment and Other Capital Expenditures (JR East's Non-Consolidated Figures)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccident prevention poster\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improvement of Transportation Services Quality\n\n## Safe and Reliable Transportation That Meets Customer Expectations\n\nBased on the Vision for Service Quality Reforms 2027, all employees of the JR East Group are united in their efforts to improve service quality from the customer's perspective.\n\nAs an important part of social infrastructure that supports the daily lives of customers and Japan's economy, railways must provide safe, reliable transportation. However, we have also experienced transportation disruptions caused by the JR East Group due to increasingly severe natural disasters and breakdowns in vehicles and equipment, and we are therefore working to prevent the spread of such disruptions and their impact on our customers.\n\nTo further improve our transportation services, we are promoting initiatives from the following perspectives.\n\n## Preventing Transportation Disruptions\n\nWe will promote cooperation within each department and within the Group, analyze the causes of transportation disruptions, and identify and implement priority countermeasures.\n\nMinimizing the Impact on Customers\n\nWe make our customers our top priority and seek to minimize the impact of any incident on them by working out the best way to resume operations as quickly as possible.\n\nProviding Information in the Event of Transportation Disruptions We will see things from the customer's perspective and provide prompt and specific information that will help them decide on their next action.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| KPIs (Numerical Targets for FY2028)                                                  | KPIs (Numerical Targets for FY2028)               | FY2024 Results                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Transportation disruptions due to internal causes                                    | Transportation disruptions due to internal causes | Transportation disruptions due to internal causes |\n| (1)  Conventional lines within 100 km of Tokyo                                       | 55% reduction                                     | 8% reduction                                      |\n| (2) JR East Shinkansen                                                               | 75% reduction                                     | 31% reduction                                     |\n| Total delay time due to internal causes, conven- tional lines within 100 km of Tokyo | 70% reduction                                     | 16% increase                                      |\n\nTargets and results are compared to FY2019\n\n## Preventing Transportation Disruptions\n\n## Initiatives to Address Transportation Disruptions Caused by the JR East Group (Internal Causes)\n\nWe will improve the reliability of equipment by strengthening systems, ground equipment and others, and identifying signs of failure using condition-based maintenance (CBM) monitoring technology. We will also work to prevent transportation disruptions by repairing weak points in equipment where transportation disruptions have occurred in the past.\n\n## Dealing with Natural Disasters\n\nAs part of our measures to deal with natural disasters, we are implementing hardware maintenance such as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTrack facility monitoring\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverhead wire inspection work\n\nstrengthening civil engineering structures, reinforcing earthquake resistance, installing snow melting machines, and taking anti-flooding measures. In addition, we prioritize systematic tree felling prior to typhoon and snowfall seasons to prevent disruptions due to fallen trees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Minimizing the Impact on Customers\n\n## Initiatives to Minimize the Impact on Customers after Transportation Disruptions Occur\n\nWe strive to minimize the impact on customers by implementing turn-back operations at stations along operable line segments, and by switching to separate lines in sections where train lines run parallel to each other.\n\n## Initiatives for Prompt Resumption of Operations and Customer Aid\n\nThrough drills that simulate various transportation disruptions, the Group is working together to improve its response capabilities, such as early resumption of operations and rescue of customers from trains that are stopped between stations. It also conducts drills for helping passengers off trains, assuming the presence of customers who require special care, such as customers with physical disabilities or the elderly.\n\nTurn-back operation\n\nSeparate line operation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExit guidance drills\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Providing Information in the Event of Transportation Disruptions\n\n## Announcement of Train Service Resumption Times\n\nWe work to announce the expected resumption of operations within approximately 30 minutes of the occurrence of a transportation disruption.\n\n## Information Enhancement\n\nWe promptly communicate information on train delays and cancellations to our customers through announcements at stations and on trains. We also provide information on service information and train operation plans among others through various channels such as our website, the JR East app, social media (Official Operation Information, X, Weibo), and others.\n\n## Notice of Special Arrangements and Initiatives Concerning Train Operations\n\nWe have created the JR East Naruhodo Q&A Guide and related videos about things we want our customers to know, such as what to do in the event of a natural disaster or emergency and questions about train operation, and published them on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJR East official website\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJR East Naruhodo Q&A Guide: Emergencies\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

Railway accidents with casualties accounted for approximately 70% of the total number of railway accidents. There were zero train accidents in the fiscal year under review.\n\n## Occurrences of Railway Accidents\n\n| Train accidents                          | Train collisions, derailments, and train fires                                            |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Level crossing accidents                 | People or vehicles being hit by trains                                                    |\n| Railway accidents with casualties        | People killed or injured by train operation excluding  suicide                            |\n| Railway accidents with material  damages | Railway accidents resulting in material damage of   \u00a55 million or more by train operation |\n\n*  From the third quarter of FY2014, incidents which cannot be determined as suicides are classified as level crossing accidents or railway accidents with casualties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Administrative Guidance\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we received two instances of administrative guidance.\n\n## Collision of Tokaido Line train with electric pole resulting in personal injury and consequent transportation disruption\n\nOverview: On August 5, 2023, a Tokaido Line train collided with a utility pole inside Ofuna Station while in operation, injuring passengers and crew. In addition, train service was suspended for a long period of time, and many passengers had to be helped off the train.\n\nCountermeasures: When cracks occur like those in the affected pole, we will systematically carry out reinforcement or reconstruction of poles where there is the risk that such cracks will fail to close. We have also added a new procedure for promptly instructing passengers to disembark from multiple trains.\n\n## Damage to railway property caused by overhead line failure on the Tohoku Shinkansen line and consequent transportation disruption\n\nOverview: On January 23, 2024, a train entered a section of the Tohoku Shinkansen between Ueno Shinkansen No. 1 Depot and Omiya Station where overhead wires were hanging down, thereby damaging the train and overhead wire equipment. In addition, an employee of an affiliated company was electrocuted while preparing for restoration work. Consequently, trains on the Tohoku, Joetsu, and Hokuriku Shinkansen lines were suspended for the entire day. Countermeasures: We will reinforce or replace the equipment that maintains the tension of overhead wires to prevent the wires from sagging. In addition, we have established new rules for handling cases where sagging wires are identified.\n\n## Incidents\n\nIn fiscal 2024, there was one incident recorded.\n\n- \u00b7  Tohoku Main Line Between Shin-Shiraoka and Kuki Stations: Event in which a barrier failed to descend when the train passed (the cause was a malfunction in the equipment controlling the crossing).\n\nIncidents:\n\nSituations where it is recognized that there is a risk of a railway operation accident, as stipulated by the Railway Accident Reporting Regulations (Ordinance of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism)\n\n## Transportation Disruptions\n\nJR East recorded 1,639 cases of transportation disruption in fiscal 2024.

In urban areas, the JR East Group will link its various services and promote the development of comfortable and attractive cities by providing new value. In addition, the JR East Group will pursue the achievement of both tangible and intangible barrier-free living to achieve an inclusive society where all people live together in harmony.\n\nThrough these efforts, we hope to bring prosperity to local communities and further strengthen the trust of our customers and local residents.\n\n## Efforts for Sustainable Community Development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Yu Kato\n\nYokote & Omagari General Management Center Akita Branch Office (Current position: Railway Operations Department, Akita Branch Office)\n\nUtilizing unused space at Yokote Station, we supported the opening of Stella, a gelato shop run by local high school students. With the support of Sail on Japan, a general incorporated\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nassociation that provides career education to students, these high school students are taking on practical business challenges, from running a store to planning, producing, and selling gelato using local ingredients and vegetables and fruits they have produced themselves. It is highly rewarding to see these high school students grow and achieve their goals. Youth out-migration is an issue for Akita prefecture but we hope to help young people rediscover the charm of their hometowns and support their dreams of wanting to work hard and contribute to their hometowns. We will continue to work with the local community to create exciting and thrilling stations and bring vitality to the area.\n\n## Attractive Urban Development in the Aomori Station Vicinity through Regional Collaboration\n\nThe Aomori Station East Entrance building, which utilizes the former station site, fully opened in July 2024.

As of the end of March 2024, the regional collaboration IC cards had been adopted in 14 areas.\n\n## Solving Local Issues with MLP\n\nJR East provides the MLP system to GunMaaS, which is operated by Gunma Prefecture. By linking transportation IC cards with Individual Number Cards, we are creating a variety of services that support the lives of local residents. In these and other ways, we are working to solve local issues.\n\nSuica/Individual Number Card linkage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiscount for citizens\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building a Sustainable Transportation System for Local Lines\n\nLocal lines have seen a significant decline in usage since the Company was established, and it is expected that the situation regarding passenger volumes will become even more severe as populations continue to decline. Going forward, we will continue to streamline operations by slimming down our facilities and simplifying train operations, while also to contribute contributing to the revitalization of areas along our railway lines by leveraging the JR East Group's strengths not only in transportation services but also in tourism, Lifestyle services, and Suica and MaaS.\n\nOn the other hand, for lines with low passenger usage, where the average number of passengers is less than 2,000 people per day, we have been reporting the revenues and expenditures by line since July 2022, allowing local residents to understand the actual state of the business. We recognize that maintaining local public transportation in a sustainable manner is an extremely important issue to consider. Having no fixed policy whether to maintaining railways or converting to bus lines, we will continue to engage in discussions with local residents to gain their understanding and cooperation, and to work together to build a sustainable transportation system. Since maintaining a sustainable transportation system is our important management mission, we will continue to seek the understanding and cooperation of people living along our lines, and partner with local governments to work out the most suitable transportation system for the region and build a sustainable transportation system.\n\n## Conducting Demonstration Experiments Aimed at Improving Convenience on the Yamada Line\n\nOne of our goals is to promote the use of public transportation services, such as by enticing passengers away from using their own cars or rental cars and improving convenience in the central and coastal areas of Iwate Prefecture. To that end, we are conducting a demonstration trial in collaboration with a local bus company that allows passengers to board and transfer to parallel bus routes using a JR East ticket.\n\nThis is our first modal mix initiative involving a parallel transportation mode in addition to railways.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Comfortable Cities\n\n## Goals\n\n- \u00b7  One-stop provision of various high-value-added services\n- \u00b7 Realization of seamless, stress-free travel\n\n## Policy\n\nPursue alliances with local governments and various other stakeholders, and promote integrated DX encompassing local services and JR East Group operations.\n\n## KPIs\n\nTabi-CONNECT is a Mobility as a Service (MaaS) platform that packages the common functions of regional and tourism-oriented MaaS from MLP and can be provided to external organizations.

As of June 2024, we began providing congestion information for conventional line Green Cars. As of June 2024, the app has been downloaded 10.31 million times.\n\nIn February 2023, we built a real-time data integration platform. We will continue to expand the number of participating transportation operators and deepen collaboration with transportation information service providers who supply the platform with data. We will also leverage this to boost revenue by adding a link to eki-net on the route search results screen.\n\nJR East App screen image\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Real-Time Data Integration Platform\n\nYosuke Murakami Strategies & Business Platform Department\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarketing Headquarters\n\nThe real-time data integration platform (RT-DIP) aggregates and utilizes real-time operational data such as train locations and delay times across multiple transportation operators and also provides this data to transportation information service providers.\n\nIt is very rewarding to see that with the expansion of participating companies we are now able to provide information in collaboration with multiple transportation operators, not just our own company, and we have also seen the creation of new services that utilize real-time data and a wide range of content that can be used by many customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe aim to improve the overall convenience of public transportation by deepening collaboration with railways and buses and other transportation operators in the Tokyo metropolitan and eastern Japan area, and by promoting the expansion of RT-DIP through the participation of more transportation information service providers.\n\n## JRE POINT\n\nJRE POINT, the Group's shared reward program, connects customers with various services\n\nJRE POINT STAGE\n\nEarn and use JRE POINT, and enjoy our great benefits .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the JR East Group.

We will remake Tokyo into a world-class, cutting-edge, and attractive city and establish a profit base for the JR East Group. In our approach to urban redevelopment, we are using electricity from renewable energy sources and introducing energy sources with high environmental performance, to realize a sustainable city that has zero environmental burden and maximizes urban activity. Additionally, we will pursue sustainable urban development by constructing facilities for people who are unable to return home due to a disaster, and by promoting town management aimed at creating new vitality.\n\nNotably, at TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY, we have established Station City Energy Create Co., Ltd. as an energy supplier, and we are working in sync with supply and demand to create a zero-carbon, sustainable, environment-friendly town through initiatives such as local production for local consumption of energy and area-wide energy use. The JR East Group also plans to utilize the knowledge gained from TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY in future developments.\n\n## Environment-Friendly Urban Development at TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY\n\nMoeta Hamai Community Development Coordination Department Marketing Headquarters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe JR East Group has formulated a long-term environmental goal, Zero Carbon Challenge 2050, through which it aims to achieve net zero CO2 emissions. At TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY as well, we will achieve net zero CO2 emissions through renewable energy and energy creation, conservation, and management, and we will work to create an environmentfriendly city.\n\nFor renewable energy, we will be developing solar and wind power generation, while for energy creation, we will be developing the East Japan area's first built-in biogas facility.\n\nIn terms of energy conservation, we will install a district heating and cooling facility (DHC) and a cogeneration system (CGS) in the basement of THE LINKPILLAR 2. Through the introduction of one of Japan's largest heat storage tanks, the DHC will achieve a highly efficient energy supply. In the event of a disaster, the water from the heat storage tank can be used for emergency water, such as toilet water for temporary shelters and for firefighting. In addition, by introducing a highly efficient CGS, waste heat generated during power generation will be converted into thermal energy and used by the DHC, thereby achieving effective energy utilization.\n\nFurthermore, we anticipate that the creation of a wide-area startup ecosystem will lead to the creation of new business models to address social and environmental issues once the facility opens.\n\n## Inclusive Society\n\n## Goals\n\n- \u00b7  Development of hospitality-minded employees\n- \u00b7  Improvement in service quality through dialogues with people with disabilities\n- \u00b7  Promotion of understanding of an inclusive society through parasports experience and support activities\n\n## Policies\n\n- \u00b7  We will work to develop employees with the knowledge, skills, and mindsets to realize an inclusive society.\n- \u00b7  We will actively promote initiatives to foster mutual understanding with customers with disabilities and local residents and use this understanding to improve our services.\n- \u00b7  By supporting parasports, we will collaborate with customers and local residents to foster barrier-free attitudes.\n\n## KPIs\n\n| KPIs (Numerical Targets for FY2028)                  | KPIs (Numerical Targets for FY2028)                                     | FY2024 Results       |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Rate of obtaining 'Care-Fitter'  Certifications      | 50%                                                                     | 44.3%                |\n| No. of exchanges involving people  with disabilities | 100 or more per year                                                    | 77 per year          |\n| No. of parasports events                             | At least once a year   at each regional  organization and   head office | 1 per   organization |\n\nindicates figures for JR East only\n\n## Promoting Obtaining Care-Fitter Certifications\n\nInitiatives to Develop Hospitality-Minded Employees Related to Care-Fitter Certifications\n\nAs part of our efforts to develop hospitality-minded employees, we are encouraging employees to obtain Care-Fitter certifications.\n\nBy the end of fiscal 2024, 44.3% of employees in the JR East Group had obtained this certification, and they have been\n\nStudy sessions aimed at maintaining assistance techniques\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nable to use the skills and hospitality spirit they have acquired to assist customers. In addition, each workplace holds study sessions to maintain assistance techniques and improve employees' ability to deal with a diverse range of customers. Each workplace also holds disability simulation sessions.\n\nWe will continue to work together as a Group to achieve a symbiotic society so that all our customers can continue to use our services with peace of mind.\n\n## Promote Mutual Understanding with People with Disabilities and Implement Service Improvements Based on Their Needs\n\n## Social Events Involving People with Disabilities\n\nWe work with customers with disabilities, local residents, organizations and schools to hold trial sessions for using railway facilities, conduct training for responding to transportation disruptions, and exchange ideas. These efforts form the\n\nTraining to help guide dog users off the train\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfoundation for mutual understanding between the JR East Group and\n\nour customers. They also enable us to understand the advice we receive from our customers and the problems and concerns that customers and local residents have when using railways, and we use this advice to improve our services and the customer service skills of our employees.\n\nFurthermore, by helping customers understand railway facilities and our efforts through these initiatives, we hope to deepen mutual understanding that will help resolve any problems and address any concerns customers may have.\n\nThe JR East Group will work together with customers and local communities to create a society in which everyone can live comfortably.\n\n## Promoting Understanding of DE&I through Support for Parasports\n\n## Support for Parasports\n\nThe JR East Group promotes and supports parasports such as boccia to realize an inclusive society in which everyone can play an active role regardless of whether they have disabilities. By continuing to hold the JR East Group Boccia Championship, we are working to deepen understanding of an inclusive society throughout the Group.\n\nWe also sponsor the Japan Boccia Association and the Elementary School Boccia Tournament organized by NHK Enterprises, and are committed to supporting athletes by providing a practice environment for the Japanese Boccia national team training camp in the run up to the Paralympics, as well as promoting parasports. Furthermore, we are working toward regional revitalization by collaborating with local governments and other organizations to provide experiences such as parasports at a local level.\n\nElementary School Boccia Tournament Awards\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProviding a training environment for the Japanese Boccia national team\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors",

We will also lead efforts to realize a recyclingbased society and biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Carbon Neutrality\n- \u00b7 Circular Economy\n- \u00b7 Nature Positivity\n\n## Basic Concept\n\nIncreasingly severe natural disasters pose various risks to the JR East Group's business. Preserving the global environment is essential to maintaining the Group's business foundations. Furthermore, a rich natural environment not only mitigates business risks, but also generates tourism resources and many types of businesses.\n\nIn recent years, environmental initiatives have become an increasingly critical corporate social responsibility, and maintaining the environmental advantages of our business will lead to stronger credibility and a competitive advantage for the JR East Group.\n\nFor this reason, we will tackle environmental issues from various angles, gain greater trust from our customers and local communities, and leverage these assets to ensure sustainable growth for the Group.\n\n## Note: External Assurance on Environmental Performance\n\nKPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd. has been engaged in providing external assurance on a set of selected environmental performance indicators (see pages 77-84) so that the reliability of the data is ensured. The particular indicators that have been assured are marked with a star ( ) for clarity.\n\n## Carbon Neutrality\n\n## Goals\n\n- \u00b7 Zero Carbon Challenge 2050\n- \u00b7 Utilization of diverse energy\n\n## Policy\n\nWithin the transportation sector, railways are an environmentfriendly transportation mode with relatively low-level CO2 emissions per transportation volume, but they also consume a large amount of energy. We are working to improve the environmental advantages of railways so that they will continue to be chosen in the future.\n\n## KPIs\n\n| KPIs (FY2031 Numerical Targets)                      | KPIs (FY2031 Numerical Targets)        | FY2024 Result   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| CO2 emissions (for all JR East  Group companies)     | 50% reduction   (compared with FY2014) | 14.7% reduction |\n| Acquisition of renewable  energy-based power sources | 700,000 kW                             | 153,000 kW      |\n\n## Formulation of Science Based Targets and a\n\n## Roadmap\n\nIn 2020, we formulated our long-term environmental goal, Zero Carbon Challenge 2050. Below is the JR East Group's roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality in 2050.\n\nCO2 emissions for fiscal 2024 were 2.26 million tons, about the same level as the previous year, as a result of the implementation of measures such as making the Senseki Line CO2-free, installing LED lights and increasing the efficiency of air-conditioning equipment on the one hand, but also the increased use of electricity to operate trains as a result of increased Shinkansen train services, etc., on the other. In addition, in terms of renewable energy development, the Seto Solar Power Plant in Aichi Prefecture started operating in June 2023.\n\nFurthermore, in order to set more scientifically grounded targets, in August 2023 we further made a commitment to set Science-Based Targets (SBT) in 2023. SBT is a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target scientifically consistent with the target set by the Paris Agreement. By making science-based revisions to our GHG reduction targets, we aim to formulate reduction targets by August 2025. In addition, we will contribute not only to the reduction of GHG emissions by the JR East Group but also to the reduction of GHG emissions throughout the supply chains of all of the Group's businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Energy type   (CO2 Emissions   Breakdown)   | 2024

consumption and CO2 emissions is JR East alone and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## Calculation Methods\n\nCO2 emissions are calculated in accordance with the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures (Global Warming Countermeasures Act), and CO2 emissions resulting from electricity supplied from external sources, including electricity used for rail transportation, are calculated using the adjusted emission coefficients of each power company.\n\nFiscal 2024 Results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1  Electricity: Both electricity generated in JR East's power plants for

Power supplied by our own power plants and electric companies is used for train operation, station, office lighting, and air-conditioning. Diesel fuel and kerosene, etc., are also used to operate diesel trains, stations, and office air-conditioning.\n\n* Including BRT (Bus Rapid Transit)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Boundary of Data\n\n## Calculation Method\n\nAlthough in principle the boundary for energy consumption and CO2 emissions volumes is only JR East, it includes energy consumption for the applicable operations of the companies to which we entrust station operations. On the other hand, the energy consumption of shops on station premises which are operated by JR East Group companies is not included in the boundary. We match the boundary for the energy consumption for the entire JR East business with that of transportation, plants, and others defined by the Act on Rationalization of Energy Use and Shift to Non-fossil Energy (the Energy Saving Act).\n\nEnergy consumption was calculated by the method defined by the Energy Saving Act. Also, CO2 emissions attributable to electricity purchased from external suppliers are calculated based on adjusted emission factors. Moreover, starting with this compilation, the calorific value conversion coefficient for electricity has been changed from the primary energy conversion coefficient set by the Energy Saving Act to 3.6 MJ/kWh.\n\n- *3   CO2 emissions attributable to electricity purchased from external suppliers are calculated based on adjusted emission factors.\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

We have engaged in undertakings driven by the enthusiasm of employees hoping to see the Tohoku Area Headquarters take the initiative in these efforts, and we have taken up the goal of achieving 100% renewable energy for the Tohoku Area Headquarters Building.\n\nFocusing on the fact that more and more renewable energy facilities will be facing feed-in tariff (FIT) period expiration, we wondered whether we could achieve our goal by using renewable electricity generated in the Tohoku area more effectively. Through collaboration with the local Tohoku Electric Power Co., Inc., we succeeded in supplying the Tohoku Area Headquarters Building with green electric power that combines environmental value with electricity from Akita Prefecture-based wind power, thus achieving an off-site corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) using post-FIT wind power. This was a first, not only for the Company but also for the entire Tohoku area.\n\nFurthermore, in terms of our daytime electricity demand that cannot be met by wind power, by utilizing the renewable energy options offered by Tohoku Electric Power, we have achieved 100% renewable energy for the Tohoku Headquarters Building. We have also addressed the issues with wind power generation (namely 24-hour power generation) using a method unique to the Company, whereby any unused nighttime electricity is utilized at Sendai Station and Fukushima Station.\n\nThrough this initiative, we believe that in addition to achieving carbon neutrality we have also contributed to the sustainable development of the local community, and we will continue to implement such efforts, including fostering environmental awareness among our employees.\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

One is physical-for example, the intensification of weather-related disasters caused by global warming. The other is a transition in the social environment-for example, the strengthening of regulations and technological progress aimed at mitigating climate change. We have identified the following items as the main climate change risks and opportunities for our core transportation business. We are also working on identifying risks and opportunities for our other major businesses.\n\n| Main Risks and Opportunities                                               | Main Risks and Opportunities                                                                                   | Business  Impact* 2   | Timing of  Manifestation* 3   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Physical risks                                                             | Damage to railway facilities and equipment, and  suspension of operations due to windstorms, floods,  etc.     | Large                 | Short  term                   |\n|                                                                            | Decrease in passenger volume due to extreme weather  (heavy rain, heat)                                        | Small                 | Long  term                    |\n| risks                                                                      | Increased costs due to the introduction and strength- ening of carbon pricing                                  | Not rated             | Medium  term                  |\n| Transition                                                                 | Decrease in passenger volume due to competition from  other modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles | Large                 | Long  term                    |\n| Decrease in passenger volume due to damage or  change in tourism resources | Not rated                                                                                                      | Long  term            | Medium  term                  |\n| Opportunities                                                              | Greater passenger volume due to preference for lower  CO2-emitting modes of transportation                     | Not yet  assessed     | Long  term                    |\n\n- *2  Scale of business impact: Large: Events with a financial impact of \u00a5500 million or more in revenues and expenses.

In order to ascertain the financial impact of these factors and to verify the appropriateness of our business and environmental strategies, we conducted the following scenario analysis for fiscal 2051.\n\n## Scenario Analysis Methodology (Overview)\n\n(1) Estimated Change in Future Passenger Revenue Trends Based on Business Area Demographic Projections\n\n(2) Estimated Financial Impact of Severe Weather Disasters\n\n(3)\n\nFinancial\n\nImpact\n\n## (1)  Estimated Change in Future Passenger Revenue Trends Based on Business Area Demographic Projections\n\nWe have estimated changes in passenger revenue up to fiscal 2051 based on data such as population and gross domestic product (GDP)* 5 from the Japan Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)* 4 , which are quantitative scenarios for future socio-economic conditions.\n\n- *4  Japan Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) population scenarios by city, ward, town, and village (2nd edition).\n- *5  Population trend data is from Japan SSP's population estimates by city, ward, town, and village, National Institute for Environmental Studies and GDP data is from Global dataset of gridded population and GDP scenarios, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA's).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n=\n\n## (2) Estimated Financial Impact of Severe Weather Disasters\n\nUp until now, we have conducted scenario analyses assuming flooding of Class A rivers flowing through the Kanto region, focusing on the Tokyo metropolitan area and its surrounding areas, where major railway assets and lines are concentrated. The following disclosure, however, describes two newly conducted scenario analyses.\n\n## I.  Flooding Due to Overflowing of Class A Rivers Whose Drainage Basins Are Home to Shinkansen Rolling Stock Centers in the Nagano, Niigata,  and Tohoku Areas\n\nThe results of scenario analyses we have conducted to date show that the financial impact of more extreme weather disasters would be particularly heavy if Shinkansen trains parked in rolling stock centers were affected. Therefore, in terms of scenario analysis outside the Kanto region, we have chosen the potential flooding of rolling stock centers, due to the overflowing of the Class A rivers in whose drainage basins they are situated, in the Nagano (Hokuriku Shinkansen), Niigata (Joetsu Shinkansen), and Tohoku (Tohoku Shinkansen) areas. II. Kawasaki Thermal Power Plant Flooded by Storm Surge It is expected that rising sea levels due to climate change will increase the depth of flooding caused by storm surges. Therefore, in terms of facilities that could suffer heavy storm-surge damage, we have selected potential typhoon-driven storm surges (assuming both current conditions as well as elevated sea levels) affecting the Kawasaki Thermal Power Plant for scenario analysis.\n\nThe results of the quantitative evaluation performed using the above procedure are as follows.\n\nRegarding I, in the Nagano area (flooding of the Chikuma River), the financial impacts of climate change in 2050 are greater under RCP8.5 (4\u00b0C increase) than under RCP2.6 (2\u00b0C increase), and the cumulative financial impact is expected to increase by approximately \u00a514.6 billion from 2021 to 2050 (without inundation measures). We found that inundation measures yield a loss reduction effect of approximately \u00a514.4 billion, and that vehicle evacuation and flood prevention measures at the Nagano Shinkansen Rolling Stock Center have a significant loss reduction effect.\n\nMeanwhile, regarding the Niigata and Tohoku areas, as a result of studies conducted based on flood risk maps and projected amounts of rainfall, we found that the Shinkansen rolling stock centers are not expected to be affected by flooding. We therefore conducted quantitative assessments of scenarios that anticipate a certain degree of financial impact, including flooding of the Shinano River for the Niigata area and the Iwai River (a tributary of the Kitakami River) for the Tohoku area. We found that the financial impacts in these areas would be smaller than those in the Nagano area.\n\nBased on the results of these assessments of the financial impact of climate change, we will continue to implement natural disaster countermeasures from both tangible and intangible perspectives in accordance with the degree of importance of facilities, mainly in floodprone areas that are susceptible to heavy impacts.\n\n## I.  Estimated Financial Impact Due to Flooding of Class A Rivers Whose Basins Are Home to Shinkansen Rolling Stock Centers in the Nagano, Niigata, and Tohoku Areas\n\n| Climate Change  Scenarios   | Flood

stop due to flooding, the electricity needed to operate the railway could be supplied by power companies, and there would be no loss of passenger revenue. On this basis, we estimated the occurrence of restoration costs for power plant assets, the increased cost of purchasing electricity from utilities, and the decrease in fuel costs due to the suspension of power generation. As a result, we estimate the increase in financial impact in 2050 under RCP8.5 (4\u00b0C increase) at approximately \u00a530 million. This is a smaller impact than those in scenario analyses we have conducted so far (damage to railways due to the flooding of Class\n\nA rivers flowing through the Kanto region), and we found that there would be no substantial impact on our financial plans.\n\n## II.

We will further promote a sustainable circular economy by collecting waste generated from the business activities of the JR East Group, recycling it using new technologies and external collaboration, and utilizing it within the Group.\n\nIn specific examples, we are working to create a 'double recycling loop' that recycles food waste into both electricity and agriculture. We are implementing an 'electricity recycling loop' in which food waste from station buildings and other locations is converted into biogas at the Yokohama Plant of J Bio Food Recycle Co., Ltd. and the Sendai Plant of Tohoku Bio Food Recycle Co., Ltd., and the renewable energy generated is used at Group facilities.\n\nThe Company also produces fertilizer using the fermentation residue generated during the biogasification of food waste, and in the future aims to create an 'agricultural recycling loop' in which crops grown with this fertilizer will be used by JR East Group restaurants and other establishments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

We are working to reduce environmental impact by using plastic bottles collected at stations in these sound-absorbing panels and reusing them along railways.\n\nPET bottles collected at stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area are sorted by JR East Environmental Access Co., Ltd. and then taken away by a variety of processing companies, making it difficult to track the processing route. Another issue has been that PET bottles often have leftover drink residue in them, making it difficult to process them into sound-absorbing material.\n\nTherefore, we worked with Group companies and manufacturers to clarify the disposal route for PET bottles and to develop technology for cleaning and fiberization.\n\nThis initiative has won rave reviews, and was awarded the 2023 Environmental Design Award* by the Institute of Noise Control Engineering of Japan.\n\nWe are currently conducting feasibility studies on expanding the uses of the material to include sound-absorbing panels for conventional railway lines and as insulation for railroad heaters.\n\n- *  The four companies that received the award are East Japan Railway Company, JR East Environmental Access Co., Ltd., BSTECHNO Techno Co., Ltd., and Mitsui Chemicals Asahi Life Materials Co., Ltd.\n\nRecycling PET Bottles Collected at Stations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRailway heater\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEki PET rail heater insulation material prototype railway heater\n\n## Chemical Substance Management and Reduction\n\nJR East is classified as a business operator handling over a certain amount of specified chemical substances under Japan's pollutant release and transfer register (PRTR) system.* Accordingly, eight of our sites reported emissions and transfer amounts to the relevant local government bodies in fiscal 2024.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on ecosystems, we are working to reduce and substitute chemical substances, for example, by introducing stainless steel railcars that do not require painting.\n\n- *  This is a system whereby companies notify their releases and transfers of chemical substances as required by the Act on the Assessment Releases of Specified Chemical Substances in the Environment and the Promotion of Management Improvement. It encourages the monitoring and control of toxic chemical substances emitted into the environment and measures to prevent negative impacts on the environment.\n\n## Nature Positivity\n\n- \u00b7 Preservation of biodiversity\n\n## Policy\n\nThe JR East Group operates a wide range of businesses, but its railways in particular have various impacts on the natural environment through train operations and the construction of necessary facilities. Initiatives to preserve biodiversity are necessary to build a sustainable management foundation, and we will achieve nature positivity by continuing to implement a range of initiatives.\n\n## Maintaining Biodiversity\n\nWe will ascertain and analyze the dependencies and impacts of our business on environmental assets as well as the risks and opportunities based on the recommendations of the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures (TNFD), and we will disclose appropriate information. We will also clarify and continue to engage in activities essential to nature positivity.\n\n## Hometown Forest Planting Program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Yusuke Nagai\n\nDepartment Director of Corporate Planning Department Corporate Strategies Headquarters (Current post:  Mobility Strategy Department\n\nRailway Business Headquarters)\n\nIn order to preserve biodiversity and contribute to a sustainable society, the JR East Group has been carrying out a Hometown Forest Planting program since 2004, in which we plant tree species that are native to each area and\n\nFiscal 2024 reforestation activity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nregenerate forests using the power of nature. To date, we have conducted tree planting in seven cities, towns, and villages across four prefectures and planted 175,000 seedlings together with JR East Group employees, their families, and local residents.\n\nThe trees planted at the Adatara Hometown Forestation in 2004 have grown tall and are absorbing approximately 27 tons of CO2 per year. In addition, the Shima Furusato no Mori-Zukuri event, which began in fiscal 2020, has been steadily implementing biodiversity conservation initiatives while also promoting tourism in Gunma Prefecture, where the event was held, as well as deepening collaboration with local high schools. In addition, we have been working to strengthen relationships with the local community and develop human resources, such as by creating opportunities for our field staff to gain experience in planning work, and we have been working on initiatives that will lead to the sustainable growth of our Group.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to take on initiatives to enrich ecosystems, including Hometown Forest Planting, in order to foster nature positivity and enhance our corporate value.\n\n## Goals\n\n## Tidal Flat Environmental Restoration and Creation of a Place for Learning\n\nIn an effort to protect ocean biodiversity, we are working at Takeshiba tideland, which is adjacent to the WATERS Takeshiba development, to revitalize the environment of Tokyo Bay Edomae and create a place for learning. In fiscal 2024, we held monthly Tidal Flats Open Days, where participants were able to experience making lamps from sea urchin shells, making eco-bags using plant-based dyes from the tidal flats, and goby fishing at marine-life workshops, and to take outdoor disaster prevention courses using the tidal flats. These events enable many people to experience the role of tidal flats in biodiversity. We hosted a total of 11 such event days with approximately 600 participants.\n\nTidal Flats Open Day\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Maintenance of Railroad Forests\n\nThe Company manages approximately 3,900 hectares of railway forests throughout Japan with the aim of protecting railways from snowstorms, avalanches, and the like. By continuing to thin out forests appropriately and plant species suited to the functions of each individual forest, we contribute to the preservation of ecosystems while ensuring disaster prevention functions.\n\nRailway forest (Semboku City, Akita Prefecture)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Harmony with the River Environment through the Construction of Fishways\n\nThe Shinanogawa Power Station (Tokamachi City and Ojiya City, Niigata Prefecture), which uses water taken from the Shinano River, aims to function in harmony with the river environment and coexist with the local community through such measures as installing fishways to make it easier for fish to swim upstream and releasing salmon fry into the river.\n\nConstruction of fishways (Miyanaka Intake Dam)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives in Response to the Recommendations of the TNFD\n\nThe JR East Group has been working on the regeneration of nature and ecosystem conservation for some time now in order to achieve 'Enriching the global environment,' one of its six material issues. To better understand and manage the impact of its business on natural capital and biodiversity, the Group expressed its support for the disclosure recommendations published by the TNFD in September 2023, and in March 2024 became the first railway operator to be registered as a TNFD Adopter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will continue to make efforts to foster biodiversity and increase corporate value, and work to identify and disclose nature-related risks and opportunities in line with the TNFD recommendations.\n\n## Overview of Information Disclosure Based on the Recommendations of the TNFD\n\n| Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | JR East Group Initiatives                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Under the same governance structure as the TCFD (see page 23), we oversee and make decisions regarding our dependence on ecosystem services,  our impacts on nature and local communities, and risks and opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Governance                                        |\n| As a Group with multiple businesses, sales regions, and business locations, we conduct scoping of our dependencies and impacts on nature and  ecosystems, select high-priority businesses and regions, and then analyze and evaluate them in accordance with the LEAP approach.                                                                                                                                                                     | Strategy                                          |\n| Within the framework of risk management, we identify aspects that have an impact on nature and ecosystems and take specific measures to avoid or  mitigate them.

As a result, we positioned the Transportation Business, which is the core business of the Group with a medium level of dependencies and impacts on environmental assets, as a high priority and proceeded with our analysis in line with the LEAP approach.* 2\n\n- *1  A tool developed by UNEP-FI and others to assess the dependencies and impacts of a company's business activities on nature.\n- *2  A process proposed by the TNFD for systematically assessing nature-related risks and opportunities (LEAP: Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare).\n\n## Table 1: Relative Comparison Results of the Relationship between Dependencies and Impacts\n\nTable 3 Nature-Related Risks and Opportunities and Existing Initiatives of JR East\n\n| Business                      | Dependency   | Impact   | Size of Business/   Area   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Transportation business       | Medium       | Low      | Large                      |\n| Retail & Services business    | Low          | Low      | Medium                     |\n| Real Estate & Hotels business | Medium       | Low      | Medium                     |\n| Renewable Energy business     | High         | High     | Small                      |\n\n## Locate: Identifying Priority Areas in the Transportation Business\n\nRegarding the main bases and sections of our Transportation business, namely (1) railway lines, (2) the Shinanogawa Power Plant, and (3) the Kawasaki Thermal Power Plant, we assessed them from the perspectives of both material locations* 3 and sensitive locations.* 4 As a result, we have identified the Shinanogawa Power Plant located in Tokamachi City and Ojiya City, Niigata Prefecture, as a priority location* 5 for our Transportation business (Table 2).\n\n- *3  Areas where a company has operations or assets and that have been identified as having significant dependencies or impacts on nature, or risks or opportunities\n- *4  Areas surrounded by the following characteristics: 1) areas of high importance for biodiversity, 2) areas with high ecosystem integrity, 3) areas where ecosystem integrity is rapidly declining, 4) areas with high physical water risk, and 5) areas important for providing ecosystem services\n- *5 Location that meet both the conditions of material location and sensitive location\n\n## Layout of  Nature-Related Issues at the Shinanogawa Power Plant\n\n## Evaluate\n\nAssessment of the relationship between business and nature (dependencies and impacts)\n\n## Table 2: Summary of 'Locate' Results for the Shinanogawa\n\n## Power Plant\n\n| 'Locate'  Perspective   | Reasons for Identifying the Shinanogawa Power Plant as a Priority Location                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Material  location      | provides one-quarter of the electricity used by the Group and  supports rail transport. \u00b7  The Shinanogawa Power Plant's business is based on water  intake from the Shinano River, and it is necessary to consider its |\n| Sensitive  location     | \u00b7  There are areas around the Shinanogawa Power Plant with rela- tively high index values for 'areas of high importance for biodiver- sity' and 'areas important for providing ecosystem services.'                     |\n\n## Evaluate: Evaluate the Relationship between Business and Nature  (Dependencies and Impacts)\n\nWe have outlined the relationship between our business and nature from the perspective of the ecosystem services on which our business depends and the impact our business has on the state of nature. Based on the dependency and impact relationships compiled using ENCORE and the description of hydropower in the TNFD sector guidance, water use was suggested as an important impact driver. The Shinanogawa Power Plant uses a lot of water from the Shinano River to generate electricity. In addition, The Shinanogawa Power Plant has long placed importance on preserving the ecosystem in the Shinano River basin through dialogue with the local community.\n\nHence, we assessed that water use, which brings about changes in river flow, is an important impact driver, and that maintaining habitats and growth environments, which are necessary for the reproduction and growth of aquatic organisms, is an important ecosystem service. These items are marked with an asterisk in Table 3.\n\n## Assess: Assessment of Nature-Related Risks and Opportunities Based on Dependencies and Impacts\n\nBased on 'Evaluate,' we identified nature-related risks and opportunities at the Shinanogawa Power Plant. A summary of major risks and opportunities is provided on page 88 (Table 3).\n\n## Assess\n\nAssess nature-related risks and opportunities based on dependencies and impacts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risks and Opportunities Related to Dependencies and Existing Initiatives\n\n| Ecosystem Services                             | Risks                                                                                                                           | Opportunities                                                                                       | Existing Initiatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maintaining soil and  sediment                 | \u00b7  Damage to facilities and equipment due to  landslides                                                                        | -

In addition, there is a risk that the ecosystem will be affected by water use in the power generation business. Furthermore, if the habitat and growth environment deteriorates and the preservation of the ecosystem is put in jeopardy, we could risk losing the trust of our stakeholders.\n\nRelease of salmon fry into the Shinano River\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assessment of Existing Initiatives\n\nFor many years, the JR East Group has been observing and evaluating the impact of water withdrawal on the natural environment of the river basin and publishing the results of its observations. We also participate in conferences such as the Shinano River Midstream Water Environment Improvement Review Council, and continue to engage in dialogue with the local community about the harmony between our business activities and the natural environment of the midstream Shinano River. Furthermore, we are also working to preserve the ecosystem in the midstream Shinano River, which may be affected by the project. For example, we are carrying out thorough maintenance of the fish ladder installed beside the Miyanaka Intake Dam so as not to impede the upstream or downstream migration of fish that live in the Shinano River, and we are also conducting research and monitoring to further improve the fish ladder. Every spring, we release salmon fry into the Shinano River together with the local fishing association and elementary school students. We believe that such existing initiatives not only mitigate the impact on the ecosystem, but also represent a win-win situation for both nature and business.\n\nThe Group will continue to assess nature-related risks and opportunities using the LEAP approach based on TNFD recommendations, and will continue to promote activities to harmonize its power generation business with nature in the midstream Shinano River basin. In cooperation with stakeholders such as local communities and river managers, the entire Group will work toward becoming nature positive.\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

While continuing our efforts to hire, retain, cultivate, and promote female employees, we will add 'active participation' as an aim and strengthen our support for autonomous career development, especially in terms of active participation.\n\n## Third General Employer Action Plan Fiscal 2025-Fiscal 2028  (JR East only)\n\n- (1) 35% or more of recruits joining the Company will be women\n- (2)  85% or more retention rate for female employees hired during the period nine to 11 fiscal years earlier\n- (3) 85% or more of male employees take childcare leave, etc.\n- (4) 10% or more of management positions in the Company will be women\n- (5)  25% or more women among employees taking part in application-based training programs that contribute to independent career development\n\n## Basic Concept\n\nThe strength of the Group lies in the diverse perspectives and wide variety of values that reflect the attributes, knowledge, and skills of our employees, such as work experience, age, and gender. We will create new engagement between employees and the Company through a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment through work, and leverage the power of human resources with diverse values and flexible imaginations to facilitate fundamental transformation of our business, innovation through new ideas, and improved productivity through more sophisticated work.\n\nFor a diverse workforce to make maximum use of their respective abilities, it is essential that they are physically and mentally healthy. We will promote the health of our employees and the creation of safe, comfortable, and accident-free workplaces.\n\n*  For details on Human Resource Strategies, please see pages 51-52.\n\n## Supporting Employees with Childcare or Nursing Care Responsibilities\n\nTo provide further support for balancing work with childcare and/or nursing care, we have introduced programs that exceed the legal standards, expanding these with the implementation of the following reforms in fiscal 2024.\n\n## New Maternity Gift System\n\nA flat rate of \u00a5200,000 is paid for each child born.\n\n## Increase in Dependent Allowance for Children\n\n| Number of Children          | Up through September 30, 2023   | Since October 1, 2023   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1st child                   | \u00a510,000                         | \u00a510,000 (no change)     |\n| 2nd child                   | \u00a510,000                         | \u00a515,000 (+\u00a55,000)       |\n| 3rd and subsequent children | \u00a510,000                         | \u00a520,000 (+\u00a510,000)      |\n\n## Increase in Dependent Allowance for Family Members with Serious Illnesses or Disabilities\n\n| Eligible Family                    | Up through September 30, 2023   | Since October 1, 2023   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Children                           | \u00a512,000                         | \u00a520,000 (+\u00a58,000)       |\n| Family members other than children | \u00a510,000                         | \u00a520,000 (+\u00a510,000)      |\n\n## Further Flexibility in Workstyles for Employees Raising Children with Serious Illnesses or Disabilities\n\n| Work and Leave System             | Up through   September 30, 2023          | Since October 1, 2023                      |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Part-Time Work                    | Until age 3                              | Until third grade  of junior   high school |\n| Reduced days of work              | Until third grade of   elementary school | Until third grade  of junior   high school |\n| Parental leave (5 days per month) | Until third grade of   elementary school | Until third grade  of junior   high school |\n| Parental leave (3 days per month) | Until sixth grade of   elementary school | Until third grade  of junior   high school |\n\nFrom April 1, 2024, there will be no age restrictions for those raising children with serious illnesses or disabilities.\n\n## Interviews with Employees Raising Children with Serious Illnesses or Disabilities\n\nI used the reduced hours work system to care for my disabled child. I considered quitting when the use of reduced work hours expired, but the change in the work system has allowed me to remain in employment. I'm glad I'm able to continue working reduced hours as it means I can stay connected to society through my job.\n\n## Employing People with Disabilities\n\nWe are actively hiring people with disabilities as well as working to create an environment in which employees with disabilities can work actively in various positions. As of June 1, 2024, we have approximately 780 employees with disabilities and an employment rate of 2.76% (2.78% for the four applicable Group Companies), which exceeds the statutory rate of 2.5%. That said, since some Group companies have not met the statutory employment rate, we will continue to actively hire Group employees with disabilities and work to create an environment in which they can fully utilize their capabilities and play an active role.\n\n## Expanding Fields in Which Employees with Disabilities Can Play an Active Role across the Entire JR East Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Yukiyo Furusawa\n\nJob Support Team, General Affairs Department JR East Green Partners Co., Ltd.\n\nAs a special subsidiary of JR East, JR East Green Partners respects the individuality of each employee and strives to create a comfortable working environment for them, while actively working to create jobs that allow employees to fully utilize their capabilities. Through these efforts, we will continue to work hard to improve the competitiveness of our company and expand employment opportunities for people with disabilities.\n\nIn October 2023, we launched a Job Support Team to provide employees with comprehensive support in gaining stable, higher quality employment so that they feel motivated and can thrive in their work.\n\nGoing forward, JR East Green Partners will promote employment of people with disabilities throughout the Group.\n\n## Initiatives to Promote Understanding of LGBTQ+ Employees\n\nThus far, we have expanded the scope of our human resource and benefits systems to include same-sex partners. As well as creating an accepting environment for LGBTQ+ employees to work in, we are building awareness and understanding among all Group employees through universal compliance training. In 2023 we held the first faceto-face networking meeting in four years for those involved, and we took part in the Pride1000 business executive ally network.\n\n## Comments from Mr. Gon Matsunaka, Representative of Good Aging Yells (Certified NPO)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe network association for LGBTQ+ and other sexual minority employees had a very friendly atmosphere, with each employee sharing stories from the workplace and their personal lives in a positive way. While many companies are moving forward with these initiatives, few companies offer opportunities like these. I feel that these are only possible because of the trust between employees and the executives and the managers. Thank you very much for reaching out to me.\n\n## Increasing Diversity in Hiring and Human Resource Management (Fields of Activity)\n\n## Strengthening Recruitment of Experienced People and Welcome Back Hiring\n\nIn terms of hiring experienced personnel and Welcome Back hiring, in fiscal 2024 we introduced year-round recruiting and hiring of experienced personnel, and we are strengthening our recruitment efforts to acquire personnel who can hit the ground running.\n\n## Interview with a Welcome Back Hire Megumi Noguchi Akabane General Management Center Tokyo Metropolitan Area Headquarters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI joined the Company for the second time in April 2023 as part of the first batch of Welcome Back hires.\n\nI had left the Company to focus on raising my two children, but as I watched my children grow up, I also felt that I wanted to take on a new challenge, so I decided to apply.\n\nIn the future, I would like to use this experience to work in human resource development.\n\n## Promoting the Active Participation and Achievements of Employees of Foreign Nationalities\n\nWe strive to employ the best candidates regardless of nationality, and as of April 2024, we employ more than 100 foreign nationals in a wide range of areas. Based on feedback we received in discussions with foreign employees, we are working to create an environment where they can make the best of their abilities, such as by allowing them to bring dictionaries to internal promotion exams and answer questions in English.\n\n## Initiatives to Secure and Retain Talented Personnel\n\n## New Special Measure for Doctoral Degree\n\nTo achieve sustainable growth, we have established a special measure for people with doctoral degrees so that we can secure and retain talented employees with the specialized knowledge to drive the Company's transformation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* Paid to experienced hires as well as employees who have obtained a doctorate after joining the Company\n\n## New Scholarship Loan Reimbursement Support Program\n\nTo secure talented personnel and improve working conditions for young employees who will lead the Company into the future, JR East has adopted a scholarship loan reimbursement support (proxy repayment) program, under which the Company repays part of the student loans of selected employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Workstyles That Allow Employees to Maximize Their Capabilities\n\nIn addition to leave of absence and vacation systems that allow employees to balance work with life events such as childbirth, childcare, and elderly care, we encourage flexible and well-balanced work styles that utilize flextime and remote working to improve efficiency and productivity. In addition, as one of our diverse workstyles, we have been promoting the spread of workations and an increase in the number of users through our in-house Workation@JRE system.\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

Based on a growth cycle centered on on-the-job training (OJT), the Group is working together on people-focused human resource development that responds to the diverse aspirations and bold challenges undertaken by employees and that supports their growth.\n\nThrough various initiatives, we aim to foster a shared mindset among every Group employee as Group innovators who combine a sense of participation in management with the ability to take action, who embody career autonomy, with a sense of job satisfaction, and who always strive for greater heights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KPIs\n\n| KPIs (Numerical Targets for FY2028)                                     | KPIs (Numerical Targets for FY2028)   | FY2024 Results   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|\n| No. of participants in self-develop- ment courses on new value creation | 25,000 in total                       | 5,169 in total   |\n| Assignment of personnel to key  growth fields                           | 2,000 or   more in total              | 408 in total     |\n\nindicates figures for JR East only\n\n## Groupwide Human Resources Development\n\nFrom the perspective of pursuing Group management and integration and collaboration, we provide group training and internal and external correspondence courses for JR East Group company employees in a wide range of roles, from general staff to managers.\n\n## Example of Group Training\n\n- \u00b7  JR East Group Career Design Training: Broadening the horizons of young people and supporting their career development\n- \u00b7  Practical Manager Development Training: Developing the next generation of managers\n\n## Internal and External Correspondence Courses\n\n- \u00b7  53 internal courses: Railways, Lifestyle services, etc.\n- \u00b7  285 external courses: Management, Digital transformation, Qualification certification, etc.\n\nPractical Manager Development Training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStudy guide for correspondence course\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JR East 'Move Up' Forum\n\nSince fiscal 2024, we have been holding the JR East Group 'Move Up' Forum in collaboration with Group and partner companies, to share and exchange examples of change and integration and collaboration.

As of fiscal 2024, a total of approximately 300 employees are engaged in side businesses.\n\nInterview with Employees Trying Out Side Businesses Yoshihiko Hirakawa Ueno Transportation District Tokyo Metropolitan Area Headquarters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI have learned new things and gained insights that I would not have been able to experience working as a train crew member, and I am aware that this is helping me grow as a person each day. I will continue to create people-focused services as a challenge for the new era.\n\n## Value Creation Program\n\nTo create new value and solve problems, in fiscal 2023 we established the role of Innovative Staff at our operational sites. To support these Innovative Staff, we held a new Value Creation Program training course for a total of eight days, in which\n\nValue Creation Program Participants\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nparticipants learned about value creation schemes and fieldwork to seek solutions to problems faced by local governments.\n\n## Participating in the Value Creation Program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tsukasa Niguma\n\nNagano General Management Center Nagano Branch Office\n\nA total of 30 people participated in the Value Creation Program for Innovative Staff.\n\nThroughout the training period, we took on various challenges, repeatedly engaged in dialogue and thought exploration, verbalized our goals, and performed the roles expected of us, and we gained a genuine sense of the process of highquality consensus building and its results. I will continue to use what I have learned to act as a leader driving new value creation, while also working to train the next generation of employees and contribute to the further growth of the Group.\n\n## Expanding Employee Fields of Activity Through Organizational Restructuring\n\nSince 2022, we have been reviewing the nature of work and organization within the Company in order to achieve integration of operations, flexible workstyles, and flexible organizations (workplaces), whether it be in our in-field workplaces or planning departments.\n\nTo enable speedy value creation and problem solving in close proximity to our customers, we are implementing the transfer of\n\n## Library Portal\n\nWe have taken video content, including highly specialized training lectures, special lectures by Company managers, and lectures by external presenters on management and other topics, and posted it on a centralized in-house portal site, thus providing an online system that allows employees to learn at their own pace.\n\nThe portal currently holds 480 videos, including 320 in-house training videos and 160 videos by external lecturers. In addition to being used for self-development, the videos are also used in workplace study sessions.\n\n## Enhancing Communication with Employees\n\nWe are incorporating one-on-one meetings in each workplace as a tool to support our employees' ability to grow and their career autonomy as well as to increase engagement.\n\nSo that they understand the purpose of one-on-one meetings and can implement them effectively, we are holding training for managers and posting related video materials for managers and subordinates on our Library Portal to foster the creation of opportunities for twoway communication.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA one-on-one meeting in a workplace\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA training session for managers\n\nauthority and the integration of planning departments with operational sites as well as the integration of individual dedicated divisions so as to expand the fields of activity for all employees and create more flexible workstyles and career development.\n\nThe creation of workstyles that transcend the traditional division of duties and flexible workplaces where each employee can take on a variety of challenges and thrive, allows employees to actively participate in new initiatives and achieve growth through a cycle of participation and growth.\n\nAn example of revising duties and organization (fusion of station operations and train crew operations)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n!\"#$%&'()*+,-\n\n!./0123456789:,;<2=>,+,-\n\n## Examples of Organizational Reconfiguration at Operational Sites\n\n- \u00b7  Establishment of General Management Centers that combine stations and crew workplaces: In addition to traditional station and crew duties, these centers undertake problem solving and value creation.\n- \u00b7  Transfer of the Planning Department's operations in rolling stock workplaces to operational sites: We are working to conduct effective business operations and maintain and improve technical capabilities.\n- \u00b7  Establishment of an Equipment Technology Center at our equipment workplaces that integrates the duties of our in-field worksites and branch offices: We are creating an environment where employees can make the most of their capabilities.",

Projects have set budgets, allowing us to quickly implement ideas from our frontline employees who are closest to our customers. The Aizu-Wakamatsu Area Project was launched in December 2019 to leverage the appeal of the Aizu region of Fukushima Prefecture to the fullest extent through a cross-organizational project. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, we planned and operated the running of the special Fuku ga Kurukuru FruiTea train, which uses the FruiTea Fukushima carriages on weekdays when they are not normally in service.\n\nOur project team has been planning special trains since fiscal 2021. This time, we took advantage of this experience to focus on establishing operations on multiple weekdays. In addition, although we have collaborated with smaller local companies on previous projects, this time we had the idea of working with Hoshino Resorts Bandaisan Onsen Hotel, so our project team members reached out directly to the international hotel operator, which graciously agreed to the idea of collaboration.\n\nDuring the planning phase, Hoshino Resorts and our project team had numerous frank discussions. As suggested by Hoshino Resorts, we held trial runs, rehearsing the handling of customer service on an actual train, and going beyond established precedents and frameworks to provide the best possible service. Also, because there were concerns about attracting customers to a weekday train service, we approached television stations and newspapers and other media to get the word out to as many people as possible about our special plan.\n\nWe ended up running the service seven times over four days in fiscal 2023 and 14 times over seven days in fiscal 2024, attracting a total of 579 passengers. The success of the project both increased profitability and created value by helping revitalize the Aizu region and building momentum for FruiTea Fukushima 's final run in December 2023.\n\nI believe we owe the success of this project to our ability to utilize the mechanisms of this cross-organizational project effectively and quickly put team members' ideas into practice. In addition, the valuable experience gained through this project also led to the personal growth of each individual member of the project team. We will continue to leverage the experience and connections we have built up as a team to create new work and value, and thereby further enhance the Aizu region.\n\n## Basic Approach to Risk Management\n\nFor the Group to improve profitability and undertake structural reforms to speed up 'Move Up' 2027, we recognize the importance of broadview risk management that considers risk* not only from the perspective of reducing negative factors such as avoiding losses but also from the perspective of proactively increasing the value of the Group.\n\nWe have established and operate internal controls in accordance with the Companies Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act to ensure stable and proper business operations, while also working to develop the Group and support and encourage the taking on of bold challenges aimed at enhancing value and growth.\n\n- *  These include not only risks related to compliance, safety assurance, and natural disasters, among others, but also those related to market changes, the direction our competitors are going in, social and economic conditions in Japan and overseas, and management decisions related to new businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Management Initiatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1  Challenge risks are risks that should be considered when implementing new measures or entering new businesses.\n- *2  Environmental change risks are risks that increase in importance with changes in the business environment.\n- https://www.jreast.co.jp/company/governance/internal\\_control.html (Japanese only)\n\n## JR East Group Compliance Initiatives\n\nBased on the Policy on Legal and Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Ethics, the JR East Group has established a Compliance Action Plan that outlines how we should behave as a corporation and as members of society. While building trust with all stakeholders, we comply with all related laws in our various business fields, such as Mobility services and Lifestyle Solutions services, and we conduct business in

It generally meets monthly to deliberate on statutory requirements, other basic business policies and strategies for the entire Group, important matters for Group management, and other key operational matters, and to supervise overall business operations.\n\nThe Board of Directors has established a Corporate Planning Committee consisting of seven directors (excluding outside directors and Audit and Supervisory Committee members) and 10 senior executive officers. The committee generally meets once a week to deliberate and report on matters to be decided by the Board of Directors and other important Group management issues.\n\nIn addition, the Group Strategy Planning Committee, chaired by the president and CEO, was formed to develop strategy across the entire Group and, with membership including directors and senior executive officers, it meets as required to discuss issues pertaining to the formulation and implementation of Group business strategies.\n\n## Method for Ensuring the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nWe perform an analysis and assessment of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors once a year.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Board of Directors is assessed from the perspective of the Board's roles and responsibilities, including transparent, fair, quick, and decisive decision-making.\n\nRegarding the assessment method, all directors independently evaluate the Board of Directors' effectiveness. The results of this evaluation are analyzed, outside directors are consulted on their opinions, and the matter is discussed at a Board of Directors meeting. In light of those results, the Board of Directors' methods of operations may be revised, if necessary.\n\nResults of the Analysis and Assessment of the Board of Directors' Effectiveness\n\nBased on self-evaluations by all directors and discussions with outside directors, in May 2024, the Board of Directors confirmed that the Board of Directors appropriately considers matters for deliberation,\n\n## Approach to Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\n## Effectiveness Evaluation Process\n\n| Self-Assessment  by Board of  Directors Meeting  Attendees  (February 2024)   | Evaluation items \u00b7 Decision-Making Related to Business Execution  Discussions on strategic direction, agenda setting \u00b7 Supervision of the Execution of Duties by Directors  Reporting on job execution status  Compliance and risk management systems \u00b7 Management of the Board of Directors  Discussion time, advance provision of information,  director training   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Solicitation of  Opinions from  Outside Directors  (March 2024)               | Exchange of Opinions Between Outside Directors and  the Chairman and Representative Directors \u00b7 Main Topics for Discussion  Consultation on strategic agenda items  Securing time for consultation  Preliminary explanation of Board meeting agenda                                                                                                                   |\n| Meeting  (May 2024)                                                           | Report Survey Results and Discussion Content Discussion of future plans based on the previous year's  efforts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Discussion at the  Board of Directors                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\nconducts sufficient reporting to fulfill its role in supervising business execution, and that it has an appropriate compliance system in place.

In addition, said directors receive performance-linked remuneration based on management performance, shareholder dividends, their degree of contribution to operating performance and the achievement of our medium-term management vision, and ESG-related initiatives during the fiscal year.\n\nIn consideration of their job responsibilities, outside directors (excluding Audit and Supervisory Committee members) receive no performance-linked remuneration. They receive base remuneration for business execution within the scope of the remuneration amount resolved at the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nRatio of Base Remuneration to Performance-Linked Remuneration The ratio of base remuneration to performance-linked remuneration for directors (excluding outside directors and Audit and Supervisory Committee members) is 3:2, excluding the variable portion for an individual director's performance. In addition, the variable portion for individual directors' performance-linked remuneration is added to or subtracted from the basic amount for each position within the range of +40% to -40%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndices for Performance-Linked Remuneration and the Reason for Their Selection\n\nAt JR East, we comprehensively evaluate metrics and other items related to performance-linked remuneration and reflect them in our calculation of remuneration amounts. To assess performance during the year, level of contribution, and ESG-related efforts, the president and CEO conducts goal-setting and tracing interviews with individual directors regarding the achievement of annual plans and 'Move Up' 2027. Performance-linked remuneration is paid as cash remuneration at a fixed time each year.\n\nNo non-monetary remuneration is paid.\n\n## Breakdown of Director Remuneration\n\n|                                                                | Number      |              | By Type Performance-Linked  Compensation   | By Type Performance-Linked  Compensation   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Officer Classification                                         | of Officers | Total Amount | Base  Remuneration                         |                                            |\n| Directors (excluding Audit and  Supervisory Committee members) | 13          | \u00a5528 million | \u00a5324 million                               | \u00a5204 million                               |\n| Directors and Audit and  Supervisory Committee members         | 4           | \u00a572 million  | \u00a572 million                                | -                                          |\n| Auditors                                                       | 5           | \u00a523 million  | \u00a523 million                                | -                                          |\n| Total                                                          | 22          | \u00a5624 million | \u00a5420 million                               | \u00a5204 million                               |\n\n(Note 1)  In June 2023, JR East transitioned to a company with audit and supervisory committee system of governance. Remuneration for members of the Board of Corporate Auditors pertains to the pre-transition period, and remuneration for Directors (Audit and Supervisory Committee members) pertains to the post-transition period.\n\n(Note 2)  Base remuneration for directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee) and Board of Corporate Auditors members includes the amount paid to two directors and two members of the Board of Corporate Auditors who retired at the conclusion of the 36th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 22, 2023. Total remuneration includes \u00a5128 million in remuneration paid to eight outside directors (including one who retired at the 36th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 22, 2023).\n\n## Succession Plans\n\nJR East has a performance evaluation system in place for inside directors (excluding Audit and Supervisory Committee members) and a target management system that sets targets for managers and other employees who are candidates for executive positions. It considers these systems, along with efforts toward training at each level, to constitute succession plans for the role of president and CEO and other officer positions.\n\nThe Personnel Deliberation Committee deliberates on succession plans for the president and CEO and reports to the Board of Directors, so that the committee will be proactively involved in the formulation and implementation of those plans while at the same time appropriately supervising the development of successor candidates in a systematic manner.\n\nThe Board of Directors also supervises whether successor training for the president and CEO is being conducted appropriately by obtaining reports on succession plans and reviewing the status of efforts to achieve management targets such as the Group Management Vision and annual management strategies to ascertain the details of succession plans and the accomplishments of directors and executives.\n\n## Succession Plans Concept Chart\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Auditing\n\nJR East conducts Audit and Supervisory Committee audits, internal audits, and accounting audits. The Audit and Supervisory Committee, the Internal Audit Department, and the Accounting Auditor endeavor to conduct mutually efficient and effective audit activities through the sharing of the following information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audits by the Audit and Supervisory Committee\n\nThe Audit and Supervisory Committee specifically reviews the audit policy, methods, division of duties and plans, the appropriateness and operational status of the resolutions of the Board of Directors regarding the system for ensuring the appropriateness of operations, and the appropriateness of the accounting auditor's audit methods and results. In accordance with the policies determined by the Audit and Supervisory Committee, each committee member attended meetings of the Board of Directors and other important meetings, listened to reports on the status of the execution of duties from directors and employees, inspected important approval documents, audited the status of business and financial assets of the head office and key offices, listened to reports on the status of execution of duties from the accounting auditor, with whom they also discussed key audit matters, and consulted regularly with the representative director and outside directors. Notably, the full-time Audit and Supervisory Committee members endeavored to strengthen the audit and supervisory functions of the committee by attending meetings such as the Sustainability Strategy Committee and collecting information from individual divisions within the Company. In addition, regarding Group companies, the committee worked to communicate and exchange information with Group company directors and corporate auditors and obtained reports as needed on the operations of Group companies. The Company has appointed approximately 10 dedicated staff members to assist the Audit and Supervisory Committee.\n\n## Internal Audits\n\nInternal audits are conducted by a dedicated team of staff in the Audit Department at head office and in Audit Offices at each branch office to evaluate and make recommendations on the status of business execution, risk control, and management of measures to realize the JR East Group Management Vision 'Move Up' 2027 from the perspectives of effectiveness, efficiency, legality, and adequacy. Guided by an audit plan, the dedicated staff audit the head office, branch offices, and operational sites. Where there is need for improvement, the team asks for a report on the situation and provides advice.\n\nIn addition, Group companies assign internal audit staff to conduct audits, and the parent company also conducts audits on a regular basis.\n\nThe results of these audits are reported to the president and CEO approximately once a quarter and to the Board of Directors and the Audit and Supervisory Committee once every half year.\n\n## Accounting Audits\n\nAccounting auditor KPMG AZSA LLC, which has an audit agreement in place with the Company, conducts audits during and at the end of the fiscal year.\n\n## Policy on Shareholdings in Selected Companies\n\nThe Company will hold shares in selected companies that will contribute to its corporate value, in order to maintain and strengthen stable business relationships and close cooperative relationships with such companies over the medium- to long-term. The Company's policy regarding policy shareholdings is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  The Company will exercise its rights as a shareholder of a company by examining the details of proposals for each general meeting of shareholders of said company.\n- \u00b7  With the aim of continuously reducing the overall scale of policy shareholdings, the Company will examine the medium- to long-term economic rationale and outlook of its shareholdings in each of the selected companies in light of their operating results, capital cost, and other such criteria.\n- \u00b7  When a policy shareholder proposes to dispose of Company shares, the Company will take no action to inhibit such disposal\n- \u00b7  Regarding shares in selected companies held as of fiscal 2024 year-end, the Company individually examined those shareholdings at the Board of Directors meeting held on June 12, 2024, and resolved to continue to hold only those stocks where the rationale for holding them has been confirmed.\n\n## Areas Subject to Internal Audits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoundtable Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nData",

        "page_content": "Iwamoto I was involved in the business management of JR East when it had a company with board of corporate auditors corporate governance structure, and I have seen the progress of the Company's governance reforms. I believe that the governance of JR East functioned appropriately when it had the previous corporate governance structure. Since the change in institutional design, however, discussions have become livelier because a company with audit and supervisory committee corporate governance structure allows Audit and Supervisory Committee members to exercise voting rights at Board meetings.\n\nAs for the content of discussions, accident prevention and safety has become a more important theme than ever due to the occurrence of several major accidents in fiscal 2024. The Board exchanged opinions on the reported circumstances of the accidents and the lessons to be learned from them, reaffirming that safety and customers are the first priority as well as the importance of training in preventing recurrence. Our discussions on the operation of the countermeasures headquarters and information sharing continued and were also very meaningful. Further, training that reflected feedback from the discussions was rapidly held, and I was present at some of the training. By seeing actual training firsthand, I gained a better understanding of the Company.\n\nAnother important theme is the future of the JR East Group. We have reaffirmed the need to accelerate business management based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions. Endeavors to promote the growth of Lifestyle Solutions and develop globally are ambitious initiatives for the Group. I am committed to contributing to these endeavors by drawing on my own experience and knowledge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJR East transitioned to a company with audit and supervisory committee corporate governance structure one year ago. Outside Director Toshio Iwamoto, Outside Director and Audit and Supervisory Committee Member Kimitaka Mori, and Chairman of the Board of Directors Yuji Fukasawa participated in a roundtable discussion that focused on changes in the Company's governance over the past year and best practices with respect to internal control, internal auditing, and risk management.\n\nThe transition to a company with audit and supervisory committee corporate governance structure has further heightened the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.\n\nFukasawa In June 2023, the Company made the decision to change the institutional design of JR East's corporate governance structure from a company with board of corporate auditors to a company with audit and supervisory committee. The main aims of this change were the acceleration of decision-making and operational execution and the reinforcement of auditing capabilities. The change was also intended to increase the pace of implementing initiatives focused on the realization of the JR East Group Management Vision 'Move Up' 2027, which was established in 2018 when I became president and CEO. In line with 'Move Up' 2027, we aim to reflect population decline and other changes in the business environment by switching over to a path that leads to the creation and provision of new value. Our goal is to achieve a shift in emphasis from supply-side business activities centered on railway infrastructure to a more demand-side driven, people-focused perspective. We want to incorporate the perspectives of multiple\n\nstakeholders, not just customers but also local communities, shareholders, and employees. With this shift in mind, we have transformed our organization and workstyle so that decision-making and operational execution are closer to the customer. A further motivation for changing our institutional design and accelerating transformation was to adapt to the faster paced changes in the business environment that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn making changes, we have revised the Board of Directors' agenda criteria and taken other measures to delegate authority and expedite decision-making, further strengthened supervision, and realized livelier discussions. To enhance discussions on matters of importance to the management of the Group, the authority to make decisions on operational execution has been transferred from the Board to the directors, with the exception of particularly important matters relating to fundamental management policies and strategies for the entire Group. The executive side is also moving forward with the delegation of authority to locations close to frontline operations, and organizational transformation is beginning to operate more efficiently in the Company as a whole.\n\nMori This is my eighth year in office, including the period when I was a corporate auditor. Since the beginning of my tenure, I have observed lively discussions at Board of Directors' meetings. Even when JR East had a company with board of corporate auditors corporate governance structure, both decision-making and supervisory functions were realized, and governance operated well. On the other hand, given capital market trends, there was an increasing need to review the way the Board operated. As JR East aimed to expedite decision-making and business execution and strengthen the supervisory function, a company with audit and supervisory committee corporate governance structure was deemed more appropriate for the Company.\n\nAt Board meetings, I contribute to discussions based on my knowledge as a certified public accountant. Since the change in JR East's corporate governance structure, deliberations on single matters are fewer, while discussions on the Group's vision for the future, business strategies, and risk management have increased. Rather than merely approving or confirming financial results and other results, we now analyze results and hold discussions that take into consideration strategy and risk management. The best practices in Board operations are changing with the times, and I believe that the Company's governance will continue to evolve further.\n\nFukasawa Each outside director has their own fields of expertise, allowing us to receive advice from a wide range of expert perspectives. Mr. Iwamoto has extensive knowledge of systems, security, overseas business, and M&As, while Mr. Mori has in-depth knowledge of finance, accounting, and international trends. They give us very specific advice, helping us to identify the points on which we should focus. The incorporation of perspectives different from those we have developed in the railway business is extremely beneficial.\n\n## We will establish governance that helps to enhance corporate value.\n\nFukasawa The Group aims to grow through business management based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions. To achieve this aim, I feel that we must make further progress in our peoplefocused transformation. Instead of providing discrete Transportation, Lifestyle, and IT & Suica services, we must think in a people-focused way and promote integration and collaboration among our businesses. We have also been promoting integration and collaboration among our organizations in order to realize creativity in operational areas that are closer to customers. Our employees are taking on the challenge of this new initiative enthusiastically. On the other hand, as the transition to a flatter organization progresses through the delegation of authority, the establishment of appropriate governance and internal control is important. This effort does not mean stipulating what is not allowed but rather entails building systems that further encourage Group employees to take on new challenges boldly.\n\nIwamoto In becoming a company based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions, there are high barriers to overcome. A radical change of mindset is necessary not only for employees but also for directors. Establishing a vision is easy, but realizing it is not simple.\n\nAt Board meetings, the deliberation of business strategy is of fundamental importance. When analyzing strategy, risks must also be discussed. It is not possible to set out on a new path simply by avoiding risk. Based on my experience, I offer advice aimed at risk control that avoids the reckless pursuit of initiatives while encouraging appropriate risk-taking.\n\nMori As a corporate auditor, I have observed management since the formulation of 'Move Up' 2027. I believe we were able to achieve steady business management even during the COVID-19 pandemic because at an early stage we began looking to the future and working on transformation. When we were formulating the management vision, Mr. Fukasawa emphasized from the outset that each Group employee would play a leading role. This emphasis greatly encouraged employees to take on challenges and motivated them to pursue various initiatives during the pandemic.\n\nWhen I worked at an auditing firm, I was in charge of auditing major corporations as the lead auditor. In my advisory work in support of organization building, I was also involved in the establishment of many governance and internal control systems. In addition, I participated in the establishment of Japan's Corporate Governance Code as a committee member. The original purpose of the Code was to enhance corporate value and promote sustainable growth. It was formulated with the aim of creating an effective braking mechanism that would allow companies to firmly step on the accelerator. The essence of internal control is to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of operations and to share information in-house so that each employee understands the senior management team's thinking and participates in business management as a leading player. At the JR East Group, efforts to develop the Group and increase its value and to boldly take on challenges for growth are viewed as being consistent with internal control in the broad sense of the term. Accordingly, we are moving forward with the establishment of systems that allow employees to step firmly on the accelerator. We have to establish an internal control system that enables all employees to take on challenges with a sense of participation in business management.\n\nData",

        "page_content": "## Risk-taking is the key to medium- to long-term growth.\n\nMori To assess whether internal control is functioning, in-depth audits are necessary. Audits have three stages of development. The first stage is an inspection of compliance and clerical adequacy. The second stage is a risk-based approach in which risks are viewed as new chances and growth opportunities and are appropriately identified and managed. The third stage is the themed audit, in which themes are determined and audits are conducted based on them. Having proceeded through the first and second stages, JR East is ahead of other companies in conducting third-stage audits, which it refers to as management audits. We evaluate the status of management execution in each department. That is to say, we confirm that businesses are taking appropriate steps with respect to the establishment of goals, the establishment of processes for their achievement, and risk management. At the same time, we identify improvements needed to support measures for these requirements.\n\nIn achieving business strategies and upgrading risk management even further, it is important we ensure the implementation of the improvements that we have identified as necessary.\n\nIwamoto There is no doubt that risks can also become opportunities. With respect to risk management, the Group deserves praise for its establishment of a management audit system that collects information from frontline operations and controls risk on a Groupwide basis. Over the past year, I have confirmed that this system is functioning effectively.\n\nNonetheless, as we are in an era of rapid changes in the business environment, rather than just maintaining the status quo, the Group must constantly seek further improvement. I believe that we will need to look at risk from a broader perspective. For example, the emergence of generative AI and geopolitical risks is having a global impact. We must consider the effect that all kinds of factors will have on the Group in the future. Rather than analyzing risks individually, we have to take a more integrated approach. Generative AI has the potential to replace human intellectual labor. If we promptly grasp such risks and tackle them ahead of time, we will have an advantage. We need to constantly examine whether our current efforts are sufficient from the perspective of risk management for the future beyond 2027.\n\nFukasawa In order to realize business management based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions through risk-taking and the transformation of our business portfolio, we must also consider how to leverage our strengths, which are the basis for value creation. The utilization of human capital is a key area. For this reason, we are promoting measures to maximize the capabilities of Group employees. How to move forward with the utilization of data is also important. Therefore, we must ensure that our management and governance of data are appropriate. We are working on ID integration of various digital services and the in-house use of generative AI. However, we need to do more with respect to data-related assets. I believe that if we skillfully utilize human capital and data-related assets. we can turn risks into major opportunities.\n\nOf course, the most important thing is to pursue ultimate safety levels to ensure that we continue earning stakeholders' trust, which is the foundation of all our businesses. The occurrence of a major accident could shatter this trust at a stroke. In April 2024, we launched a new safety plan. To respond to various changes in our business environment, including the increased severity of natural disasters, we are strengthening our safety measures based on the concept of 'foreseeing the unexpected.' Safety is the top priority of business management and continues to underpin all the Group's businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We are endeavoring to formulate and improve succession plans.\n\nIwamoto April 2024 saw the appointment of former executive vice president Yoichi Kise to the position of president and CEO. The Personnel Deliberation Committee system has been adopted to ensure objectivity, competence, and transparency in the approval of proposals for the appointment and dismissal of directors and the president and CEO. After discussing proposals from the executive side, the committee reports its conclusions to the Board of Directors. Our main focus when discussing and considering the recent presidential changeover was the ideal JR East president. Candidates are selected based on this ideal and then evaluated.\n\nI believe that presidents must have a suitable personality. Personality reflects an individual's innate character. An impressive personal track record and skill set are obviously necessary, but in my view it is an individual's personality that is the deciding factor. In this regard, we are able to communicate directly with candidates in-house. Also, JR East offers many opportunities for personnel to talk with various people inside and outside the Company. Such day-to-day dealings with people further our understanding of candidates' personalities.\n\nFukasawa As we build a foundation of trust through safety and reliability, it is necessary for the president and CEO to continue appropriately controlling the railway business, which is a highly specialized, disciplined organization. Therefore, the committee has been holding discussions to the effect that, at the present juncture, the in-house development and selection of a president is important. On the other hand, advancing business management based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions calls for experience and connections with local communities not only in Mobility but also in Lifestyle Solutions. In addition, the Company requires personnel who have the flexibility to cope with rapid changes in the business environment. In the recent selection of a new president, such requirements were taken into account when considering candidates.\n\nAlso, in fiscal 2025 we have introduced management based on business units with the aim of maximizing cash flows in 14 different business units. Under the system introduced, we compare each\n\nbusiness unit with industry peers. Growth strategies are then formulated and implemented. President Kise will manage this system, which I think is a more weighty responsibility than ever.\n\nIwamoto In order to realize a business portfolio balanced between Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions, we must open up new fields without compromising the foundation of safety. Having the ability to break through is important. The president's job is to realize what he has envisioned. Therefore, I would like President Kise to balance risktaking and braking while giving shape to JR East's vision for the future.\n\nMori For a president, having a personality that makes people want to follow them is essential. In addition, ultimate safety levels have become intrinsic to the overall JR East Group brand. They are fundamental not only in Mobility but also in Lifestyle Solutions. In growing Lifestyle Solutions, ultimate safety levels differentiate the Company from competitors and offer opportunities for breaking into new fields. I hope that JR East leverages such strengths in its efforts to rapidly advance business management.\n\nIn our respective roles, we will focus on utilizing our competence to contribute to the continued evolution of governance.\n\nIwamoto The Group's vision and purpose have already been set out. However, their realization will require a continuous process of trial and error. I believe President Kise is searching for answers in this regard. Railways have a high entry barriers, but many companies will enter fields such as real estate, lifestyle services, and Suica. To prevail in such conditions, I believe that the Group has to build original bridgeheads in these fields. In the process of doing so, the Group will face considerable barriers. Consequently, I want to use my experience to support the Group in taking on ambitious initiatives.\n\nMori We need to show the kind of value that the Group will create. Safety and reliability are readily understandable forms of the value JR East provides. However, if we are aiming for business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmanagement based on the two pillars of Mobility and Lifestyle Solutions, we must present a clear picture of what business management will look like. I hope that the Board continues to discuss how to present this picture of business management and engage in intense debate on business strategy and risk management. While population decline is inevitable, demand for mobility will not disappear. The wealth of assets and technologies that the Group possesses as well as the trust and relationships it has fostered with local communities are invaluable strengths. When I participate in events organized by the Group in local communities, I feel strong trust from the communities. Such trust is proof that the Group is deeply rooted in communities. I would like to give advice on how to make the most of and enhance the significance of these strengths.\n\nIt is paramount that the senior management team's vision is well understood by frontline employees and reflected in their actions. As an Audit and Supervisory Committee member, I will continue to offer a range of advice and support.\n\nFukasawa During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent considerable time thinking about the sustainability of the Group and the trust it has garnered. Our business has a social responsibility. I was always mindful of whether the value we provided was beneficial to society and whether we were providing value that inspired trust. Even though our business portfolio has changed, the weight of this responsibility remains the same. I hope that the outside directors will continue to boost the Group's long-term development and provide us with advice based on a broad range of perspectives.\n\nThe JR East Group has frontline sites that operate 24 hours a day, and recently it has focused on overseas development. With that in mind, I hope our outside directors have opportunities to see the Group's diverse frontline sites.\n\nAs chairman of the Board of Directors, I want to continue to actively visit frontline sites so that I can directly convey our goal of giving each employee a leading role.",

We conducted our engagement in accordance with the 'International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' and the 'ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse  Gas  Statements'  issued  by  the  International  Auditing  and  Assurance  Standards  Board.  The  limited  assurance engagement consisted of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other procedures, and the procedures performed vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance provided is thus not as high as that provided by a reasonable assurance engagement. Our assurance procedures included:\n\n- \uf06c Interviewing the Company's responsible personnel to obtain an understanding of its policy for preparing the Report and reviewing the Company's reporting criteria.\n- \uf06c Inquiring about the design of the systems and methods used to collect and process the Indicators.\n- \uf06c Performing analytical procedures on the Indicators.\n- \uf06c Examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the generation, aggregation and reporting of the Indicators in conformity with the Company's reporting criteria, and recalculating the Indicators.\n- \uf06c Visiting two of the Company's domestic business sites selected on the basis of a risk analysis.\n- \uf06c Evaluating the overall presentation of the Indicators.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Indicators in the Report are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Company's reporting criteria as described in the Report.\n\n## Our Independence and Quality Management\n\nWe have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. In accordance with International Standard on Quality Management 1, we design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n/s/ Kazuhiko Saito Kazuhiko Saito, Partner, Representative Director KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd.
