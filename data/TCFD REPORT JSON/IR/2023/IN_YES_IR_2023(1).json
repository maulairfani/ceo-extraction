This  collaboration  is  ingrained  with  a  deeper  commitment, not just to the athletes, but also to the spirit of our nation's aspirations and dreams.\n\nThe partnership aims to demonstrate the strength an  ecosystem  plays  in  nurturing  Olympic  talent. In line with this, YES BANK launched the campaign 'Milkar  Jitayenge' , highlighting  the  shared  effort behind  every  victory.

It is the unspoken dedication  of  families,  friends,  coaches  and  the support staff that lays the foundation for a champion.\n\nTo rally the nation in a chorus of support for our Paris-bound Olympic athletes, we proudly launched\n\nthe  microsite yesteamindia.com. This  platform empowers well-wishers of Team India from within and  outside  the  country  to  send  their  heartfelt best wishes to our Olympians. The microsite was ceremoniously  inaugurated  by Dr.  P.T.  Usha, President  of  the  Indian  Olympic  Association and Hon'ble Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha , during  a  spirited  send-off  ceremony  organised by the IOA.\n\nTo further honour this collaboration and empower our athletes, we  are  delighted  to  introduce ' YES Glory ', a special savings account proposition for the Indian Olympic contingent heading to Paris.

The  collective  spirit and  ability  to  steer  through  these challenging periods is a testament to the dedication of the staff, the loyalty of our customers, and the support of our shareholders and regulatory authorities.  As  we  move  into  the financial  year  2025,  I  feel  that  YES BANK is well placed to continue to thrive and make further progress in the ever-changing banking landscape.\n\n## Macroeconomic Scenario\n\nThe global macroeconomic scenario  for  2023-24  reflected  a complex interplay of challenges and opportunities, marked by cautious optimism.\n\nThe geopolitical conflicts heightened the  uncertainties  in  global  energy markets,  affecting  oil  prices  and regional stability. These  conflicts, along with trade tensions and shifting alliances, underscores the need for  diversified  supply  chains  and strategic economic partnerships.\n\nDespite  these  geopolitical  tensions and monetary policy tightening, the  global  economy  demonstrated resilience, with global GDP expanding  by  3.2%  in  CY  2023.\n\nAdvanced economies GDP  grew at  1.6%,  while  the  emerging  and developing economies grew at 4.3%.\n\nIn  the  midst  of  global  headwinds, India  has  emerged  as  a  pocket  of resilience.  The  GDP  growth  stood at  8.2%  in  FY  2023-24,  supported by government-led capex spending, robust  urban  and  rural  demand, and proactive measures by the RBI stabilising inflation at 5.4%.\n\nThe government's emphasis on infrastructure development and digital transformation has been pivotal in attracting investments and fostering economic resilience.\n\nThe  latest  Financial  Stability  Report highlights that Indian Banking Sector  continues  to  remain  stable, with  profitability  and  asset  quality indicators  at  their  'decadal  best' levels with adequacy of liquidity and capital buffers in the banking system. Moreover,  RBI's  macro-stress  tests revealed that Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) are well-capitalised and capable of absorbing macroeconomic shocks even in the absence of any further capital infusion.\n\n## YES BANK in FY 2023-24\n\nDuring FY 2023-24, YES BANK progressed well on its key strategic objective of Profitability Improvement and  made  further  advancements across most key financial and operating metrics.\n\nThe  Bank's  balance  sheet  crossed ' 4.0  lakh  crore  mark  with  robust accretion  to  Deposits  at ' 2.6  lakh crore. The Bank judiciously expanded\n\nANOTHER KEY HIGHLIGHT WAS THE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESSION IN ACHIEVEMENT OF TARGETS OF LENDING TO PRIORITY SECTOR LENDING (PSL) ACHIEVED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF ORGANIC EFFORTS AS WELL BUYING OF PSL CERTIFICATES.\n\nits  branch  network  and  added  85 branches in FY 2023-24.

RBI  issued  a  Framework for  acceptance  of  Green  Deposits aimed at channelising flow of funds  to  climate-aligned  activities. The  Central  Bank  also  released  a 'Draft Disclosure Framework on Climate-related Financial Risks', based on the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.  Regulators  have highlighted that climate-related risks pose  significant  challenges  to  the banking  sector  and  overall  financial stability, and  financial  institutions need  to  set  up  mechanisms  to integrate  climate  aspects  into  their business strategy, factor the effects of climate change into financial planning, and evaluate and disclose the impact of climate-related risk drivers on the overall enterprise risk profile.\n\nSEBI  also  expanded  its  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework by introducing  BRSR  Core  disclosures and expanding the scope of\n\nIN FY 2023-24, YES BANK CONTINUED ITS JOURNEY OF INNOVATION IN THE DIGITAL BANKING SPACE AND INTRODUCED MULTIPLE NEW PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS AIMED AT ENHANCING CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE AND ACCESSIBILITY.\n\ndisclosures  to  the  value  chain  of listed  entities.  YES  BANK  views  the emerging focus on ESG as a significant opportunity and aims to not just keep pace but stay ahead of the curve in this area. As the only Indian banking signatory to the UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking, YES BANK is  committed  to  align  its  business with the objectives of the UN SDGs and  the  Paris  Climate  Agreement. The Bank has already set up a robust governance structure for integrating ESG and climate considerations into its business with oversight from the Board-level CSR and ESG Committee.\n\nIn FY 2023-24, the Bank strengthened this commitment by  undertaking  significant  actions, and  progressing  on  its  targets  of reducing its financed emission",

The Bank continued  to  make  steady  progress on  its  core  strategic  objective  of improving  profitability and  made further  improvements  across  key operating metrics. In FY 2023-24, YES BANK reported a net profit of ' 1,251 crore, a 74.4% increase compared to the previous year. Our balance sheet crossed ' 4  lakh  crore,  registering  a growth  of  ~14%  over  the  previous year's size of ' 3.55 lakh crore as at March 31, 2023.\n\nIn this promising environment, YES  BANK  expanded  its  physical and  digital footprint, significantly reduced its Net Non-Performing (NPA)  and  the  net  carrying  value of  Security  Receipts  (SRs),  gained a  higher  incremental  CASA  share, and addressed the shortfall in lending to Priority Sector (PSL). This  progress  is  a  testament  to the  responsible  banking  franchise that we have been building through  strategic  interventions  and investments over the last four years. Our refreshed brand identity and  our  commitment  towards  our stakeholders - customers, employees, and shareholders have been pivotal  in  this  journey.  The  Bank made substantial progress on PSL compliance and concluded FY  2023-24  with  NIL  shortfall  in overall PSL  as  well  as  its  subcategories  of  small  and  marginal farmers, and weaker section.\n\nBefore delving further into our performance  for  the  financial  year, let me share a brief of the operating environment.  The  global  economy demonstrated  resilience  in  CY  2023 despite  facing  significant  challenges such as elevated inflation rates, tight monetary  and  financial  conditions, escalating geopolitical tensions, and high public debt burdens. Emerging markets in particular, experienced  robust  growth  driven by  strong  domestic  demand  and technological advancements.\n\nOn the domestic front, India emerged as the fastest-growing major  economy  in  the  world  with FY 2023-24 GDP growth rate of 8.2%.\n\n## Key Highlights of FY 2023-24\n\nDuring FY 2023-24, the Bank continued to leverage its key business levers,  including  optimising  the  mix within retail assets, strengthening its value proposition in the SME/Business Banking  segment,  and  maintaining leadership in the payment ecosystem. Additionally, the  Bank  scaled  its digital and transaction banking services and  utilised its branch distribution  network  as  the  fulcrum of  its  business.  The  Bank  continued to  strengthen  its  governance  and compliance standards, bolstering the balance  sheet  through  granularity, building  a  strong  retail  asset  and liability  franchise  and  expanding  its customer base.\n\nDuring FY 2023-24, YES BANK originated  new  loans  and  sanctions of  more  than ' 1.14  lakh  crore.\n\nDURING FY 2023-24, THE BANK CONTINUED TO LEVERAGE ITS KEY BUSINESS LEVERS, INCLUDING OPTIMISING THE MIX WITHIN RETAIL ASSETS, STRENGTHENING ITS VALUE PROPOSITION IN THE SME/BUSINESS BANKING SEGMENT, AND MAINTAINING LEADERSHIP IN THE PAYMENT ECOSYSTEM.\n\nAs at March  31, 2024, Bank's Advances stood at ' 2.28 lakh crore,  registering  a  robust  growth of  13.8% 1 over  the  previous  year, driven  by  sustained  momentum  in SME  and  Mid-corporate  Advances (25%+ Y-O-Y growth) and the resumption  of  growth  in  corporate segment.  The  Bank  maintained  the ratio  of  retail  and  SME  advances  to Wholesale Advances (Mid and Large Corporate) at 62%:38%.",

It  offers a moment to reflect on our progress.\n\nIndia's economic  resilience  stood out amid global uncertainties. Its GDP grew at an impressive 8.2% in FY 2023-24, becoming one of the fastest-growing major economies. This growth has been underpinned by strong performance by the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, catalysed by technology and data-analytics-driven lending. The government's focus on enhancing infrastructure and digital transformation  has  been  pivotal, with initiatives such as PM GatiShakti and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI). The  Reserve  Bank  of  India (RBI)  introduced  several  initiatives in retail banking this year, including the introduction of CBDC UPI interoperability, revolutionising digital payments  and  making  transactions seamless and inclusive.\n\nThese  developments,  alongside  a stable political environment and progressive  policies,  underscore  a year of innovation and expansion for YES BANK, as we continue to support the evolving needs of our retail and MSME customers.\n\nBefore I deep dive into the performance  aspect  of  our  retail business,  I  want  to  reflect  on  our refreshed  brand  identity  that  was launched in May 2023. The refreshed identity emerged from a well-thoughtout strategy, developed through in-depth interactions with all\n\nstakeholders. This process led to a visual representation that accurately reflects YES BANK of today.  The new logo, evolving from a tick to a soaring bird,  represents  our  ambition  to achieve  greater  heights  and  our promise  to  deliver  a Seamless, Intuitive  and  Effortless banking experience. The bright colours and the  new  form  factor  are  digitally friendly, complementing our digital prowess.\n\nThe  refreshed  identity,  now  visible across all customer  touchpoints, including our branch network, digital assets,  and  payment  instruments, has received very positive feedback from all key stakeholders. Along with our  brand  ethos  \"Life  ko  Banao Rich\",  the  new  visual  identity  has shown almost instant results. Independent studies have indicated a  significant  8-10%  growth  in  our spontaneous awareness and brand consideration  scores  over  just  two quarters.  Additionally,  our  website traffic increased by 18%, with 3.1 million unique visitors.\n\nAnother significant and proud achievement  in  this  financial  year was  us  joining  hands  with  the Indian  Olympic  Association  as  the Official  Banking  Partner  for  Team India for Paris Olympics 2024.  This partnership is a continuation of our brand philosophy, 'Life Ko Banao Rich' , as it emphasises how as our athletes compete globally, their achievements contribute  to  our  national  memory and  pride,  creating  a  legacy  of shared  experiences.  Our  campaign #MilkarJitayenge emphasises\n\nAS WE ENTER THE 5 TH YEAR OF OUR JOURNEY OF YES BANK OF TODAY, ON ACCOUNT OF BUSINESS CALIBRATION, WE ARE A FULL SPECTRUM RETAIL BANK GROWING WITH A STRONG MOMENTUM, DEDICATED TO REDEFINE INDIA'S BANKING LANDSCAPE, ACCELERATING AS A DIVERSIFIED, GRANULAR RETAIL FRANCHISE, WITH STRONG FOCUS ON TRANSACTION BANKING.\n\nthe idea that behind every Olympic athlete lies a community  which encompasses local coaches,",

The  International  Monetary  Fund (IMF) forecasts global growth at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025, driven by the United States, key emerging markets, and fiscal support in China.\n\nIndia  remained  one  of  the  fastest-growing  economies of  the  world  during  the  year,  and  exhibited  sound macroeconomic  fundamentals.  While  urban  demand remained  strong,  the  rural  sector  also  recovered  after the  initial  struggle.  Capex  spends  by  the  government (both Centre and state) played a pivotal role in sustaining growth momentum. Barring a few sectors, private capex continued  to  lag  despite  healthy  balance  sheets  of banks and corporates, although recent surveys hint at a resurgence in capex. As per the government estimates, India's GDP is projected to have clocked 8.2% growth in FY 2023-24, compared with 7% in FY 2022-23.\n\nWhile global headwinds posed risks to India's economy, macroeconomic  stability  is  anchored  by  moderating inflation  and  the  ongoing  fiscal  conditions.  Headline  CPI inflation dropped to 5.2% in the second half of FY 2023-24, from  5.5%  in  the  first  half  of  FY  2023-24,  averaging  at ~5.4% for the financial year 2023-24. Trade gap improved slightly in FY 2023-24, compared to FY 2022-23 even as moderation was witnessed in exports and imports.\n\nDespite  a  challenging  global  environment,  the  Indian banking sector remained stable, with improving profitability and asset quality, adequate level of liquidity and capital buffers. Moreover, RBI's macro-stress tests revealed that Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) are well capitalised and  capable  of  absorbing  the  most  adverse  economic shocks even without capital infusion.\n\n## Our Response\n\nThe  Bank  closely  monitored  global  and  domestic economic trends, and adjusted its actions according to the country risks and sector-specific impacts. In context, Bank  also  hosted  'The  Growth  Summit',  fostering insightful discussions with diverse stakeholders, aimed at propelling India towards a USD 10 trillion economy.\n\nAmidst  the  macro-economic  backdrop,  the  Bank continued  to  drive  growth  with  improvement  in profitability with a focus on retail asset mix optimisation, strong growth within SME and Mid-Corporate segments,  and  further  improving  the  share  of  its branch  distribution,  by  leveraging  the  network  to offer  a  full  spectrum  of  products.  The  Bank,  through its comprehensive  strategy, reported reductions in  shortfalls  in  PSL  categories  and  sub-categories. The Bank further fortified its balance sheet through a significant reduction in its Gross NPA and Net NPA.",

Further, the regulator also issued Master Directions on IT Governance, Risk, Controls, Assurance Practices and Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Management.\n\n## Enhancing  Customer  Service  and  Fair  Lending Practices\n\nRBI issued a comprehensive framework for strengthening and  improving  the  efficacy  of  the  grievance  redressal mechanism and customer service provided by the Credit Institutions (CIs) and Credit Information Companies (CICs) along with a framework for compensation to customers for  delayed  updation/rectification  of  credit  information. The central bank also issued various guidelines to ensure reasonableness and transparency in disclosure of penal interest  to  promote  fair  lending  practices  amongst regulated entities.\n\n## Improving Asset Quality and Investment Practices\n\nIn  response  to  the  high  growth  seen  in  consumer credit  and  increasing  dependency  of  NBFCs  on  bank borrowings,  RBI  increased  the  applicable  risk  weights in certain components of consumer credit and advised banks and NBFCs to strengthen their internal surveillance mechanisms, address the build-up of risks, and institute suitable safeguards. The Regulator also issued instructions restricting investments by a regulated entity (RE) in any scheme of Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs) which has downstream investments either directly or indirectly in a debtor company of the RE, to curb situation of possible evergreening through investments in units of AIF.\n\n## Our Response\n\nThe Bank is committed to complying with RBI's guidelines and regulations, ensuring a robust compliance culture that prioritises customer protection, risk management, and sustainable practices. The Bank has implemented comprehensive policies and controls to reflect the latest directives, including those related to IT governance, customer service, green deposits, asset quality, and investments.  The  Bank's  leadership  is  dedicated  to fostering a culture of compliance, regularly evaluating and updating our policies to embrace best practices and align with RBI's vision for a resilient and sustainable banking system.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The endorsed recommendations included mechanisms to ensure the timely and adequate mobilisation of resources for  climate  finance  while  supporting  transition  activities tailored to individual country circumstances. The UNFCCC CoP-28 forum urged Parties to intensify global climate ambition by the end of the decade through decisive actions. India also called for a clear roadmap for climate finance as an essential element for achieving the quantified goals. Operationalisation of The Loss and Damage (L&D) fund at CoP-28, became a pivotal moment in climate justice for countries grappling with climate change impacts.\n\nAligned  with  its  Nationally  Determined  Contributions (NDCs), India showcased its climate ambition at CoP-28 by launching the Green Credit programme, which incentivises voluntary pro-planet actions, under its LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) initiative. Allocations under the interim Union Budget 2024-25 reaffirmed India's commitment to Net Zero by 2070 by highlighting measures in four key areas: green\n\nenergy, electric vehicles, bio-manufacturing & bio-foundry, and blue economy. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), also took significant steps to boost green investments  by  prescribing  additional requirements for  issuing  transition  bonds  to  prevent  mis-allocation and pioneering the framework for ESG rating providers. In April 2023, RBI issued a framework for acceptance of Green Deposits which aims to direct the flow of funds to sustainable projects and initiatives, protect the interest of the depositors and address greenwashing concerns.\n\nThe  year  also  witnessed  significant  regulatory  initiatives to promote ESG governance. The central bank intensified  efforts  to  develop  policy  interventions  aimed at  building  resilience  within  the  Indian  banking  sector and  outlined  clear  supervisory  expectations  through  a draft  disclosure  framework  on  climate-related  financial risks.  SEBI  introduced  the  BRSR  Core  standards  which expands the scope of BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability  Report)  reporting  framework  by  including transparency in the value chain of listed entities. SEBI's glide path for companies to adopt the BRSR Core disclosures aims to ensure that emissions across the value chain are adequately accounted and reported.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Bank has published its BRSR as part of its Integrated Annual  Report  (refer  to page  328)  and  aligns  its ESG disclosures with benchmark reporting frameworks such  as  the  GRI  Standards  and  the  Task  Force  on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures recommendations.\n\nFor  its  comprehensive  ESG  and  climate  disclosures, YES  BANK  achieved  the  highest  score  among  Indian Banks, with a S&P Global ESG score of 74 (out of 100)*. The Bank maintained its rating of 'A-' (Leadership Band) by  CDP,  making  it  the  highest-rated  Indian  Bank  for climate disclosures. The Bank has established a robust climate  governance  framework,  with  Board-level  and Executive-level committees overseeing its climate strategy. It strives to align its business with the goals of the Paris Agreement and India's net zero transition. YES BANK has pledged to reduce GHG emissions from\n\nits operations to Net Zero by 2030. In FY 2023-24, the Bank increased the share of renewable energy in  the  Bank's  electricity  mix  to  12.31%  resulting  in approximately 5,254 tCO 2 e in avoided emissions.\n\nIn line with its climate commitments, the Bank has started developing its capacity for scenario analysis and  is leveraging scenario-based  target  setting approaches  to  develop  long-term  climate  resilient strategies and roadmaps. To start with, the Bank has measured  and  reported  the  financed  emissions  of its fund-based electricity generation portfolio. It has set  decarbonisation  targets  to  reduce  the  financed emissions intensity of its electricity generation loan portfolio, in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  well-below  2-degree  scenario,  striving  for  a 1.5-degree scenario. YES BANK continues to support climate-aligned sectors such as renewable energy and electric vehicles and has developed targeted products for  green  financing,  such  as  YES  Kiran  rooftop  solar loans for SMEs.\n\n*YES BANK achieved the highest S&P Global ESG score amongst Indian banks based on the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) 2023. The Bank's S&P Global ESG score stood at 74 (out of 100) as at February 16, 2024. The Bank's S&P Global CSA Score stood at 73 (out of 100) as of December 1, 2023",

Consequently, security risks and related complexities have also emerged, which may result in breach of confidentiality and compromise of customer's classified data. Therefore, staying ahead of the curve in cyber security measures has become crucial for financial institutions to maintain a secure digital environment for their customers.\n\n## Our Response\n\nYES  BANK's  comprehensive  information  security programme ensures utmost confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its infrastructure. The Bank maintains continuous oversight over this issue through a Board Level  Committee,  a  management-level  'Security Council'  and  independent  audits  by  the  Internal Audit Team and an external third-party. The Bank has adopted Global Information Security Standard ISO 27001:2013 and implemented Board-approved Information Security Policy and Cyber Security policy, as directives to protect its information assets.\n\nThe Bank has adopted a risk-based approach and follows defence-in-depth to protect its information systems  against  cyber-attacks.  It  has  adopted  a Cyber  Security  Resilient  Framework  to  manage cyber  security  risk.  The  Bank  has  established  a 24x7 Security Operations Center (SOC) to monitor cyber-related risks and keep a vigil on suspicious network traffic and enables proactive threat detection and  response.  The  Bank  has  also  embraced  the principles of Security/Privacy by Design to embed privacy safeguards in all its processes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Improper management  of liquidity risk will also result in the Bank having to borrow at higher rates to meet  its  obligations,  thereby  eroding  its  profitability, and thereby capital.

It encompasses not only technological solutions, but also policies, procedures, and awareness initiatives designed to mitigate risks and vulnerabilities.\n\nInformation security risk refers to the potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and critical systems with in our environment. These risks encompass various scenarios, including cyber-attacks, data breaches, insider threats, regulatory non-compliance and operational disruptions. This can result in financial losses, reputation\n\ndamage, regulatory sanctions and broader implications for the stability of the financial system.\n\nEffectively  managing  information  security  risks  involves identifying, assessing, prioritising, and mitigating potential threats to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of  information  assets.  This  is  essential  for  maintaining trust,  protecting  assets  and  ensuring  the  resilience of  banking  operations  in  an  increasingly  digital  and interconnected landscape.\n\n## Governance Framework\n\nInformation Security Risk is monitored and reviewed by the Security Council on overall basis and for customer transactions by Fraud & Suspicious Transaction Monitoring Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Bank believes in engaging closely with all its key stakeholders in order to better understand and address their needs, and  incorporate  their  feedback  into  the  Bank's  overall business strategy. The Bank follows a robust stakeholder engagement model, employing a combination of structured,  and  need-based  engagement  mechanisms\n\nto reach out to these stakeholder groups on a periodic basis. The Bank has set up dedicated grievance redressal mechanisms  and  set  up  specialised  business  units, through  which  stakeholders    can  redress  any  of  their grievances.  Critical  concerns  voiced  by  stakeholders are  communicated  to  relevant  Board-level  committees, periodically. In FY 2023-24, the Bank continued to engage with its critical stakeholder groups through various means, a summary of which is provided below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With India emerging as the world's foremost growth engine, the Bank's business not only contributes to the country's economic progress, but also plays a key role in the nation's sustainable development agenda.\n\nThe Bank's operations, business activities, products and services, and relationships touch a multitude of stakeholders across the country and help advance India's national priorities. Cognisant of the impacts its business can have across economic, environmental and social dimensions, YES BANK proactively carries out a materiality assessment exercise triennially to identify and mitigate negative impacts and advance positive impacts, originating from its business activities. The Bank's material topics represent its most significant impacts across its operations, business, products and value chain. In FY 2023-24, the Bank conducted a fresh materiality assessment. The material topics identified as part of the materiality assessment are considered pertinent areas of interest to the Bank's stakeholders, forming a key input to the management's strategy and approach towards sustainability, and guiding the Bank's sustainability-led disclosures in this Integrated Annual Report.\n\n## Methodology: Materiality Assessment FY 2023-24 1\n\nThe Bank's materiality assessment exercise for FY 2023-24 followed a comprehensive 5-step methodology based on the requirements of benchmark sustainability disclosure frameworks  such  as  SEBI's  Business  Responsibility and  Sustainability  Reporting  (BRSR)  framework,  GRI Standards (2021), and the international <IR> framework.\n\nTo holistically assess the impacts of its business activities, the Bank  adopted  the  double-materiality concept, analysing both the impacts that its business has on the economy, environment, and people, including impacts on their human rights; and the impact of current sustainability issues on the Bank's own enterprise value creation process.\n\n## METHODOLOGY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact Identification\n\n- y Undertaking  a  comprehensive  desk-research,  BFSI sector peer benchmarking, and internal deliberations to curate an extensive list of impacts that arise or may arise from the Bank's business\n- y Covering impacts that could positively or negatively affect the economy,  environment,  and  people, (including impacts on their human rights), and impacts that in-turn could affect the Bank's enterprise value creation process\n- y 83 impacts were identified, categorised, and clubbed under 15 potential material topics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\n- y Roll out of a stakeholder engagement programme to gather insights from the Bank's key stakeholders on the materiality of the impacts identified\n- y A  digital  survey  was  curated  to  collect  stakeholder ratings on the materiality of all impacts\n- y The  survey  covered  11  key  internal  and  external stakeholder  groups:  Top  Management,  Regulators, Employees,  Customers,  Shareholders  &  Investors, Financial &  ESG  Analysts,  Business  Associates, Suppliers, Media, Industry & Peers, and Community groups",

The change in the number of material topics from 10 to 11 from the previous financial year was due to the addition of 'advancing sustainable finance' as a separate material topic. Other minor changes were due to changes in the nomenclature of some material topics for the purpose of enhancing the topic's coverage and coherence.\n\nIMPORTANCE TO ENTERPRISE VALUE CREATION\n\nFor detailed information on the Description, Impacts and Management of each Material Topic - refer to the following sections 1 :\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact Significance\n\n- y Each identified impact was evaluated as positive or negative and actual or potential and  assigned  a  'significance' score  based  on  its  severity, likelihood, scale and scope, and impact  on  human  rights.  The Bank's  top  management  and senior  leadership  reviewed  the 'significance' rating of the impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact Prioritisation\n\n- y The  stakeholder  ratings  (step  2) and the significance scores (step 3) were mapped to arrive at the prioritisation of the identified impacts  and  the  corresponding 15 potential material topics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality Matrix\n\n- y The ratings of each topic were plotted on two axes, 'importance to enterprise value  creation'  and  'importance  to external stakeholders'\n- y The median rating was taken to be the materiality threshold for both aspects\n- y 11 out of 15 topics rated on or above the median were determined as the Bank's most significant material topics\n- y The final materiality ratings and material topics were approved by the Sustainability Council and the CSR and ESG Committee of the Board",

The Bank has an effective post-meeting follow-up procedure and mechanism to track important decisions taken at the Board/Committee meetings and track closures of such decisions. The Bank has put in place an Action Tracker System, to track actionables emanating from Board/Board-level Committee meetings. The Action Taken Report on decisions taken in a meeting are placed at the succeeding meeting(s) of the Board/Board-level Committees. A report on ongoing actionables (Action Taken Report) are placed before the meeting of the Board/ Board-level Committees from time to time. The key matters for the Board's discussion during FY 2023-24, included:\n\n- Capital raising activity\n\nBudgets\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance performance and climate strategy\n\nOperations, risk\n\nmanagement and business\n\nFinancial results\n\nMinutes of the Board and Committees of the Board\n\n## Board nomination and selection process 1\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Board  is  driven  by  various requirements of the Bank such as qualification, knowledge, skill  and  experience  of  the  directors.  At  the  time  of appointment/re-appointment, the Bank's Board-level Nomination & Remuneration Committee (N&RC) reviews the  qualification,  knowledge,  skill  sets  and  experience of  the  directors.  Upon  its  review,  if  the  N&RC  finds  that the  directors  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Bank,  it makes further recommendation to the Board for their appointment/re-appointment.\n\nFurther, the N&RC on an annual basis, also assesses the various skill sets and experience of the Board members and evaluates the same as against the Bank's requirements based on business and regulatory norms. If the N&RC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nforms an opinion that there is a need for induction of a new director with a specific skill or experience to bridge the gap, it makes a recommendation to the Board for induction of a new director. In such cases, the Bank follows the procedure laid down in the policy with regard to Fit and Proper Criteria for induction of a director.\n\nThe appointment of the Chairman and Executive Directors are subject to prior approval of the RBI and final approval by the Bank's shareholders.",

The Bank has a separate Total Rewards Policy articulated  in  line  with  relevant  RBI  guidelines  which inter alia deals with the Compensation & Benefits of the Managing Director & CEO and the Whole-time Directors.\n\nThe N&RC recommends to the Board the remuneration for  the  Chairperson,  Non-Executive  Directors  (NEDs), and Executive Directors. NEDs are paid sitting fees within the  permissible  limit  prescribed  under  the  Companies Act,  2013,  Listing  Regulations  and  other  regulatory guidelines,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  The  N&RC recommends  changes  in  sitting  fees  based  on  factors such as performance parameters of the Bank, industry benchmarking,  etc.  which  is  approved  by  the  Board. The  Bank  may  also  pay  NEDs  a  fixed  remuneration  in\n\naccordance to the RBI circular no. RBI/2021-22/24 DOR. GOV.REC.8/29.67.001/2021-22 dated April 26, 2021.\n\nThe remuneration of all Executive Directors are governed by the Bank's Board-approved 'Total Rewards Policy' which includes fixed  pay  and  variable  pay,  performance  bonus and  stock-linked  incentives,  terms  and  conditions  of termination (including payments), malus/clawback clauses as per the Bank's policy, and retirals such as Provident Fund and Gratuity.\n\nThe  remuneration  payable  to  the  Chairperson  and Executive Directors is subject to the prior approval of RBI and final approval of the shareholders.\n\nRemuneration  is  benchmarked  for  every  role  against market data provided by Bank's appointed remuneration consultant. A reputed and credible third party organisation has been onboarded as remuneration consultant.\n\nThere were no proposals related to change of remuneration of Directors sent to the Board in FY 2023-24. The remuneration for Chairman and Executive Director were approved in FY 2022-23, details of which are available on page 268 of the Bank's Integrated Annual Report for FY 2022-23 which can be accessed here:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhttps://www.yesbank.in/pdf?name=integrated\\_ annual\\_report2022\\_23.pdf\n\n## Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer's Compensation\n\nThe  remuneration  for  the  Bank's  MD&CEO  is  in  line with  the  guidelines  stated  in  the  RBI  circular  dated 04  November  2019  (Ref.  RBI/2019-20/89,  DOR.APPT. BC. No. 23/29.67.001/2019-20). The Bank has a process of defining measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for MD & CEO under financial & non-financial parameters. Financial  KPIs  include  metrics  such  as  profitability,  asset quality, deposit growth etc. while non-financial KPIs include metrics on governance and compliance, ESG and climate change, human resources etc.\n\nThe  MD&CEO's  Variable  pay  consists  of  performance bonus  and  stock-linked  Incentive.  The  variable  pay  is governed by regulatory guidelines which includes deferral arrangement.  While  part  of  performance  bonus  is deferred over subsequent three performance periods, the stock-linked incentive vests over 42 months from the grant date. The entire variable pay is subject to Malus/Clawback clauses as per the Bank's policy.\n\nThe ratio  of  the  remuneration  of  the  MD&CEO  to  the  median  remuneration  of  the  employees  for  the financial year is 71.4x*. The ratio of the percentage increase in the annual total compensation of the MD & CEO to the median percentage increase in annual total compensation for all employees stood at 1.95 1 .\n\n*Remuneration includes fixed pay, perquisite value, performance bonus paid and value of stock options granted during the year (this ratio is calculated in accordance to the requirement of GRI 2: General Disclosures Standard 2021 - Disclosure 2-21 and is different from the ratio mentioned in Annexure I to the Directors' Report on page 254)",

The Bank has set up a Strategic Procurement Unit (SPU) staffed with executives, skilled in responsible sourcing practices across categories, functions and domains. The Bank's SPU has adopted a robust decentralised procurement model which aims to strike the right balance between cost, agility and governance in its procurement practices.\n\n## Supplier base\n\nIn  FY  2023-24,  the  Bank  transacted  with  over  7,700+ suppliers  for  provision  of  goods  and  services  across all its offices  and  branches.  The  Bank  has  formed strategic  relationships  with  eminent  Indian  and  global companies,  however,  significant  portion  of  transactions and procurements are done through domestic vendors. As the Bank is spread across the country, it also procures from local vendors for localised consumption  of products and services.\n\n## Governance and risk management\n\nThe Bank has established a clearly defined risk management framework for its suppliers based on the risk profile of the vendor and item category. In order to mitigate the risks for the Bank, control and governance parameters have been constructed,  implemented  and  reviewed  on  a  periodic basis.  Additionally,  the  Bank  has  implemented  Vendor Performance  Evaluation  Framework  wherein  periodic vendor  performance  reviews  are  conducted  based  on vendor category. The Bank has also put in place processes to ensure Vendor Redundancy/Business  Continuity Planning (BCP) for critical spend categories. In additional to  assessing  vendors'  credibility,  capability  and  cost  to deliver,  YES  BANK  has  implemented  well-established vendor guidelines, outlining its vendor selection criteria in compliance with the law. This has been further enhanced with the introduction of SAP Ariba e-Sourcing Platform which has improved fairness and transparency in sourcing processes.  While  the  e-sourcing  platform  has  already become an integral part of its sourcing process, the Bank is continually looking to enhance the institutionalisation of the implemented system-based workflows.\n\nAs part of the Bank's stated objective and commitment to implementing best practices in corporate governance, the Bank has a Whistle-blower portal - the 'Corporate\n\nWhistle-blower Initiative' (CWI), which is an independent online  reporting  service  aimed  at  facilitating  secure and  confidential  communication  of  any  concerns  faced by  its  vendors  to  the  designated  and  independent Whistle-blower Committee constituted by the Bank.\n\n## Skill development and continuous improvement\n\nDuring the year, SPU continued to identify cost management initiatives  based  on  spend  analytics  to  optimise  cost structures  and  collaborated  with  various  operational/ functional  units,  to  identify  opportunities  for  value engineering and innovative solutions. Given the need for continual improvement and innovation, skill development has been a key focus area within the procurement team. In FY 2023-24, the team collectively clocked more than 139 man-days of learning and development engagements on functional and cognitive skill development. This also includes participation in conferences and seminars for knowledge enhancement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Bank  has  instituted  a Board-approved Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy  (ABAC  Policy),  which  reflects  the  Bank's  and  its management's  commitment  to  maintaining  the  highest ethical standards, while conducting its business in an open, fair and accountable manner, in line with best practices in  corporate  governance.  The  ABAC  Policy  has  been developed in alignment with the Bank's Code of Conduct, various policies, rules, and regulations adopted by the Bank in conformance with the legal and statutory framework of anti-bribery  and  anti-corruption  legislation  prevalent  in India.

The Bank has instituted a Board-approved, Know Your Customer  and  Anti-Money  Laundering  (KYC  &  AML) Policy, which provides a broad framework for adherence to national and local regulatory requirements related to knowing your customer, anti-money laundering practices and directives for combating the financing of terrorism.\n\nFacilitation payments\n\n- Political contributions\n\nAbuse of\n\nentrusted power\n\n- Dishonest or fraudulent misappropriation of official property\n\nKickbacks\n\nThe KYC Policy and AML Policy and procedural requirements are  subjected  to  an  independent  review  by  the  Audit function and also forms a part of periodic reporting to the top management of the Bank.

There  were  no  incidents/violations  related to  corruption  that  led  to  terminations/non-renewal  of contracts during the year 1 .\n\nThe Bank continues to take steps towards assessing the ESG awareness and preparedness of its suppliers in a phased  manner  and  educating  them  about  ESG  best practices through webinars and surveys. The assessments will  enable  the  Bank  to  score  vendors  on  their  ESG performance and identify areas for improving controls and limiting potential negative impacts of its supply chain. In FY 2023-24, the Bank's ESG awareness initiatives covered over 175+ vendors, representing nearly 60% of the Bank's procurement-led spends.",

Over the years, the Bank has strengthened its customer experience measurement process by investing in digital platforms, making it real time and based on contextual conversations with customers.\n\n## Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nThe Bank has also institutionalised Net Promoter Score (NPS) as a key metric to drive superior service experience, customer loyalty and advocacy, across its various channels. NPS is a metric for measuring customer experience and is a predictor of customer loyalty. It has been adopted by  several  global  organisations  to  improve  customer\n\nexperience across products and services. NPS is calculated by  subtracting  the  percentage  of  customers  who  are Detractors (i.e. customer rating between 0 and 6) from the percentage who are Promoters (i.e. customer rating 9 or 10). Continuous focus and commitment to customer experience has resulted in reduction in Detractors and an increase in Promoters resulting in improved Net Promoter Scores across channels. The Bank's Net Promoter Score for  FY  2023-24  stood  at  70  (an  improvement  over last  year's  NPS  of  68).  The  overall  Retail  Banking  NPS journey  is  on  an  increasing  trend  and  scores  for FY 2023-24  have  seen  significant  improvement  of 18 points over the last 3 years. Along with measuring NPS,  the  Bank  has  established  a  robust  Detractor Management process which includes service recovery of Detractors,  close  looping  customer  feedback,  winback initiatives to retain Customers, and further collaboration with  the  Promoters.  NPS  trends,  Consumer  insights (VOC), Detractor Analysis are reviewed periodically with respective  stakeholders  across  channels  and  various improvement  initiatives  across  People,  Process  and Technology  are  taken  to  provide  superior  banking experience to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Bank's OHSMS system is applicable to all YES BANK facilities (excluding ATMs). In line with ISO 45001, the Bank has identified objectives and targets and works towards  minimising  OHS  risks.  The  Bank's  ISO  45001 certification currently covers two major facilities, corporate office YES BANK House (Santacruz) and YES Fintech Centre (Airoli).  As  part  of  the  certification,  monthly  safety  audits and annual Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment (HIRA) exercises are carried out by the Bank to eliminate risks applying hierarchy of controls, covering YES BANK HOUSE and YES Fintech Centre. Employees can report work-related hazards by reporting them through the Infrastructure and Facilities Management (IFM) Helpdesk or YES Serve portal. Regular consultation between employees and IFM teams are also conducted through regional IFM council meets, where work related hazards can be highlighted. The Bank's OHSMS has been certified ISO 45001 compliant.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  overall  occupational  health,  safety and well-being of its employees and contractual workers, the Bank has put in place emergency preparedness and response mechanisms, with individual locations having a designated  'Emergency  Handling  Team'.

YES  BANK,  as part of its ISO 14001 Environmental Management System implementation, considers fire as a significant aspect and has  put  in  place  onsite  Emergency  Preparedness  and Response procedures. There are periodic trainings and feedback  sessions  conducted  for  employees  (including contractual workers) and security personnel to equip them to deal with fire-related emergencies. Individual locations are  required  to  mandatorily  conduct  a  fire  evacuation drill  once  in  every  six  months,  with  participation  of  staff and contractual employees. During the year, there were no incidents that resulted in any reported injuries/lost time.  The  Bank's  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  (OHS) Policy is available on its website. The Bank's OHSMS is not based on any legal requirement and has been voluntarily implemented by the Bank in line with best practices in occupational health and safety.\n\nThe  Bank  provides  free  medical  support  services  for employees  at  five  key  locations  YES  BANK  HOUSE (Santacruz),  YES  FINTECH  Centre  (Airoli),  Noida  office, NOC Gurgaon and NOC Chennai.

It provides a formal recognition platform to reward excellence at YES BANK, and  in  turn,  creates  a  culture  of  appreciation.  All  YES BANKers have the option to appreciate and wish their colleagues on account of professional achievements or personal  occasions.  Reporting  managers  can  nominate team members for rewards on the basis of performance. In FY 2023-24, over 11,000 employees received rewards and 15,000+ appreciation messages/wishes were exchanged through the Rewards & Recognition portal.\n\nLong Service Recognition: In an endeavour to nurture the 'Culture of Appreciation', a Commendation Certificate and  personalised  memento  is  presented  under  the Bank's Long Service Recognition programme, to employees completing 5, 10 ,15 and 20 years of meritorious service with the Bank.\n\n## Employee Performance Management\n\nThe  annual  performance  review  for  the  Bank  begins with  self-assessment,  followed  by  Reporting  Authority (Manager) and Reviewer (skip-level Manager) Assessment,  and  concludes  with  a  Committee  Review. Committees  comprising  cross-functional  leaders  and Human  Capital  representatives  review  the  assessment of  senior  executives  and  sign-off  their  performance descriptors. This stage of the process ensures objectivity, transparency, and collaboration. The performance assessment  of  executives  is  based  on  performance descriptors and their definitions, employing a two-pronged approach which includes weightages to both business/ team goals and employees' personal development goals. The definitions not only focus on executive's achievements vis-\u00e0-vis expectations of the Bank, but also emphasise on the need to uphold core values of the Bank and consistently adhere to regulatory compliance and governance norms. The focus is not only on the Results (What), but also on the process of achieving them (How).\n\n## Rewards and Recognition for FY 2023-24\n\n| Category          | Count   |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Spot On           | 4,324   |\n| Trailblazer       | 2,768   |\n| Rising Star       | 1,574   |\n| Team of Champions | 939     |\n| Y-Star            | 925     |\n| Young Leader      | 536     |\n\nThe performance review process has been aligned further with the Bank's priorities. The Management team's goals include  Governance  and  Compliance  Key  Performance Indicators ('KPI') along with their respective functional/ business KPIs. Further, with a view to provide an impetus to the Diversity and Inclusion charter of the Bank, starting FY 2024-25, women employees embarking on Maternity Leave during the Performance year will be given a default 'Meets Expectation' performance descriptor. As ESG is an important  element  of  our  strategy,  domain-specific  ESG KPIs such as KPIs related to enhancing gender diversity, emission reduction and EMS  implementation  and ISO  14001:2015  certification  have  been  dovetailed  into goal sheets of relevant executive management.",

The Return on Assets (RoA) for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was at 0.5% vis-\u00e0-vis 0.2% in quarter ended March 31, 2023. The Bank's management has clearly identified financial imperatives which are likely to uplift the trajectory of its Return on Assets (RoA) profile, which include: resolution of Priority Sector Lending (PSL) shortfall related drag, improving the Advances Yield through product mix optimisation, reducing cost of deposits by increasing proportion of CASA deposits, further enhancing the fee income intensity and improving cost efficiency to align with the best-in-class in the industry.\n\nTowards  this  end,  the  Bank  has  identified  several  business  levers  as  enlisted  below,  which  will  aid  in  achieving these  financial  imperatives.  To  further  ensure  the  rigor  of  execution,  the  Bank  has  set  up  a  dedicated  Strategy  and Transformation vertical to drive these initiatives in a focussed manner.\n\n## MATERIAL TOPIC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Description and Impacts\n\nProgress on profitability refers to the Bank's commitment towards building a long-term sustainable franchise which delivers profitable growth on a consistent and predictable basis. This includes building a  robust  income engine with sustainably superior Net Interest Margins (NIM) and best-in-class fee generation, coupled with an optimum cost structure, which aids in generating superlative operating profits. At the same time, ensuring a strong credit and risk management culture to minimise credit costs, leading to maximisation of RoA profile.\n\n## Impacts on Stakeholders\n\n- y Higher  profitability  can  result  in  maximising shareholder returns PPL \u015a\n- y It can also aid in significantly improving perception among stakeholders including customers, credit rating agencies, vendors and suppliers etc. PPL \u015a\n\n## Impacts on Enterprise Value Creation\n\n- y A strong profitable franchise provides adequate cushion to capital position and balance sheet from external / internal shocks PPSC\n- y Generating efficiencies from cost optimisation can create headroom for suitable investments PASR\n- y Absence  of  an  efficient  cost-structure  may result in unwanted cost growth and sub-optimal profitability NPSC\n\n## Linkages\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given the considerably lower yield (average realised yield of 2.97% in FY 2023-24) generated on these deposits, the consequent drag on Net Interest Margins (NIM), Operating Profits, Cost to Income and Return on Assets (RoA) is significant.\n\nIn  order  to  address  this,  the  Bank  had  formulated  a comprehensive strategy to address the PSL shortfalls and has significantly progressed along the path of execution. The intervention areas include focussed Acceleration on Organic Sourcing in PSL sub-categories of: SMF (Small & Marginal  Farmers),  NCF  (Non-Corporate  Farmers)  and WS (Weaker Sections) assets via expanding distribution, manpower, and productivity expansion of BC (Business Correspondent) partnership models and inorganic interventions such as purchase of PSL Certificates (PSLCs) / Inter Bank Participation Certificate (IBPC) / Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) / Direct Assignments (DAs)\n\n## Substantial rise in organic balances and negligible shortfall in PSL sub-categories in FY 2023-24\n\n## Rising on Balance Sheet Amounts (excludes inorganic interventions and deposit)\n\n(All Figures in ' crore)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2,551\n\n2,761\n\n3,152\n\n4,042\n\n10,175\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5,443\n\n5,764\n\n6,370\n\n7,452\n\n14,325\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2,551 2,761 3,152 4,042 10,175\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reduction in overall subcategory Shortfalls (includes inorganic interventions)\n\n(Avg.

The  Bank's  Internal  Capital  Adequacy  Assessment Process  details  its  importance  within  the  framework, alongside other Pillar II risks. In line with the Financial Stability  Board  (FSB)'s  Taskforce  on  Climate-related Disclosures  (TCFD)  recommendations,  the  Bank  has classified  these  climate-related risks as Transition Risks and  Physical  Risks.  Through  desk  research,  the  Bank enlisted  material  climate-related  risks  faced  by  the\n\nfinancial sector, including Current Regulation, Emerging regulation, Technological Risk, Legal Risk, Market Risk, Reputational  Risk,  Acute  Physical  Risk  and  Chronic Physical  Risk.  The  climate-related  risks  were  ranked by the senior management, in the order of relevance to the Bank in the foreseeable medium-term. Based  on  this  survey,  top  ranking  climate-related risks,  with  maximum  potential  to  generate  significant change  in  the  Bank's  business  operations,  revenue or  expenditure,  were  identified  to  establish  a  climate risk profile.\n\nThe top three risks identified for the Bank are:\n\n## Enhanced Disclosure Policies\n\n## Stringent Environmental Regulation\n\n## Increased Severity of Extreme Weather Events\n\nIntroduction of enhanced disclosure policies by the government and/or regulatory bodies may result in legal proceedings or penalties for organisations failing to comply with the enhanced disclosure requirements.\n\nWith growing awareness on Environmental & Social (E&S) issues globally, countries have established robust E&S regulations that specify requirements for operating licenses, occupational health and safety standards, and emission/discharge limits. Stricter environmental regulations may affect repayment capability of clients who fail to meet the enhanced regulations.\n\nIn recent years, severe climatic events such as droughts, cyclones, high temperatures and floods, have impacted India's economy, especially in sectors such as agriculture and allied industries. Climate change may increase the frequency and severity of climatic events, which can adversely affect employee & client performance, and therefore the Bank's revenues.\n\n<!-- image -->",

YES BANK broadly categorises climate risks into physical and transitional risks. Physical risks are a consequence of direct physical impacts of climate change and range from acute risks (such as extreme weather events) to chronic risks (like gradual rise in sea level and temperature). Transition Risks arise from external efforts to address climate change including, but not limited to, regulatory and policy changes, technological advancement or shifts in investor sentiment and consumer behaviour. The Bank considers climate risk as a material Pillar II risk in its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) document  and  in  it  details  its  overall  governance  and control framework.\n\nIn line with its sustainability-focussed vision and commitments, YES BANK has put in place systems for managing  climate-related  risks  at  the  organisational, project and portfolio levels.\n\n## Organisational level\n\n- 1.  The  Bank  has  a  formal  process  in  place  for  the identification of climate  risks  and  opportunities. ESG and climate change related risks and opportunities are  evaluated  by  Risk  Management,  Infrastructure and Facilities Management  (IFM)  and  Strategic Procurement  Units,  for  the  projects  and  initiatives under respective domains.\n- 2.  In FY 2018-19, 'Climate risks' were added to the Bank's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), which  is  an  integral  part  of  the  management  and decision-making process in the Bank. Climate-related risks are reviewed annually to establish adequacy of measures taken by the Bank, along with the ongoing annual review of the ICAAP.\n- 3.  The  Bank  has  also  constituted  an  Executive  level Sustainability  Council  to  ensure  deeper  integration of  sustainability  into  all  aspects  of  business  and banking. The Council helps develop formal structures and  actionable  frameworks  to  include  risks  and opportunities  arising  out  of  climate  change  and sustainable development.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  manage  any  potential  service  disruptions  due to climate change, YES BANK has a robust Business Continuity Plan which is ISO 22301 certified, an International Business Continuity Standard. In  FY  2022-23,  YES  BANK  continues  to  have  the highest  number  of  locations  certified  under  ISO 14001:2015 Environment Management System (EMS) standard, globally. The recertification is based on the Bank's Environmental Management Policy released in 2016, which commits to reducing the Bank's carbon emissions through broad-level actions.\n- 5. Recognising the importance of enhanced transparency and  disclosures,  the  Bank  has  been  proactively reporting  on  its  triple  bottom  line  performance through its annual and sustainability reports. These  sustainability  disclosures  are  aligned  with benchmark reporting frameworks, including Integrated Reporting, GRI Standards, TCFD recommendations and Principles for Responsible Banking.\n\n## Project level\n\n- 1.  At a project level, E&S risk assessment is integrated into its overall credit approval framework. As part of the Bank's Environment & Social Management System (ESMS),  a  Board-approved  Environment  &  Social Policy  (ESP)  mandates  appropriate  assessment  of E&S risks for project finance. The Bank has dedicated E&S experts housed within the Credit Risk Unit who are  responsible  for  implementing  the  provisions  of the  ESP.  These  experts  undertake  preliminary  E&S assessment  of  projects  basis  the  severity  of  risk. Further  detailed  Environment  and  Social  Impact Assessment  is  conducted  against  IFC  Performance Standards (A number of cross cutting topics such as climate change, gender, human rights, and water are addressed  across  multiple  Performance  Standards) by internal/external E&S Risk experts and appropriate covenants are included in the credit documents which are monitored throughout the credit cycle.\n- 2.  Further,  for  identified  high  risk  projects,  the  Bank includes  climate  risk  screening  as  a  part  of  the Environment and Social Due Diligence. Bank has also put  in  framework  for  readily  capturing  information on key physical and transition risk related indicators from clients in preliminary assessment checklist for all projects/project related loan (sanctioned amount above a threshold)\n\n## Portfolio level\n\n- 1. At  a  portfolio  level,  the  Bank  has  identified  climate sensitive sectors and is taking a sectoral approach to measure and mitigate climate risk. It has initiated measurement  of  financed  emission  of  its  carbon intensive portfolio.\n- 2. Further,  the  Bank  is  leveraging  scenario-based assessment to develop roadmaps for building climate resilience of portfolio. As a starting point, the Bank has specifically focussed on its energy exposure, as the sector is at the centre stage for climate action globally. The Bank has analysed the financed emission intensity in the energy sector and developed internal targets to reduce the sectoral emission intensity, in line with global de-carbonisation pathways.\n- 3. The  Bank  is  in  the  process  of  quantifying  financed emission of rest of its portfolio, to identify carbon intensive  holding  and  develop  emission  reduction targets (intensity/absolute) in line with the Paris  Agreement,  as  per  availability  of  data  and methodologies.\n\n(For  details  on  the  Bank's  risk  management  systems, policies and processes, including risk strategy, and audit & compliance - please refer to section - Risk Management Governance Framework on Page 68)",

The  Bank  has  measured financed  emission  of  its  electricity  generation  portfolio & cement (manufacturing) portfolio (covering corporate loans, investment (treasury), project finance) and is striving to scale up  the  approach  to  climate intensive sectors.\n\n| Sector                                                    |   Asset Classes | Portfolio  Coverage in % (Outstanding)*   | Attributable emissions  (ktCO 2 e)   | Emission  Intensity      | Data quality Score   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Corporate loan Project Finance investment (treasury)      |            1.02 | 719.3                                     |                                      | 0.479 (tCO 2 e/MWh) 2.04 | Power  generation**  |\n| Cement  (manufacturing)*** Corporate loan Project Finance |            0.53 |                                           | 1010.4                               | 0.670 (tCO 2 e/ Tonne)   | 2.19                 |\n\n*Portfolio coverage is a function of portfolio outstanding (Advances and Investment)/ Total Portfolio outstanding (Advances and Investment) of the Bank\n\n***Where client emission data are not available publicly, Bank has utilised 'Climatiq data explorer version 13.13, Source: CBAM 2023 Region India' for emission intensity of cement manufacturing sector.

Considering  base  year  of  FY  2021-22,  the Bank has developed interim target of reducing financed emission intensity of its electricity generation portfolio, at least by 50%, while striving for achieving 75% reduction by FY 2031-32. The Bank has developed an internal roadmap of mix of non-renewable energy and renewable energy, that has been incorporated in risk appetite. Further, Bank has  developed  internal  additional  criteria  for  financing towards non-renewable energy sector.\n\nIn FY  2022-23,  the  emission  intensity  of  electricity generation fund-based portfolio (corporate loans, project finance,  investments)  declined  significantly  from  0.628 tCO 2 e/MWh in FY 2021-22 to 0.404 tCO 2 e/MWh due to decline  in  fossil  fuel-based  energy  generation  portfolio from a mix perspective, on account of stringent internal lending criteria as well as sale of stressed non-renewable energy portfolio to the ARC.\n\nIn FY 2023-24, there was a slight increase in emission intensity  of  electricity  generation  fund-based  portfolio (corporate  loans,  project  finance,  investments)  from 0.404    tCO 2 e/MWh  to  0.479  tCO 2 e/MWh.  The  increase in emission intensity is primarily due to the increase in output of clients in terms of electricity generation and thus, associated emissions per unit of ' crore exposure and slight increase in exposure towards non-renewable energy  generation.  Emission  intensity  of  FY  2023-24 remains within the trajectory of SBTi well below 2 degrees as  well  as  SBTi  1.5-degree  pathway  and  meeting  the bank's interim intensity target for the electricity generation sector for the year.\n\nIn  the  Indian  context,  there  are  challenges  regarding availability and reliability of emission data. Further, there remains challenges in availability of generic sector specific financed emission intensity (such as financed emission per revenue or finance emission per unit of production). As the ESG reporting ecosystem in India evolves, disclosure on these aspects would further help the Bank to improve data quality of its financed emissions. The Bank would also be exploring other approaches for some of the sectors/ asset classes to measure degree of alignment with the Paris Agreement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Rising  cultivation costs, inadequate price support, and limited market access have compounded farmers' challenges. Besides overuse of chemicals, environmental threats, and neglect of soil health  have  further  exacerbated  food  insecurity  and livelihood  concerns.  Limited  knowledge  of  innovative agricultural practices and challenges in accessing water for irrigation throughout the year has prompted a significant portion of the population to engage in seasonal migration. Women  and  artisans  are  also  susceptible  to  cycle  of economic  vulnerability  and  need  specific  interventions encompassing skill enhancement and market linkages.\n\nRural  entrepreneurship  is  a  key  growth  driver  for  any economy. YES BANK, through YES Foundation, works with small and marginalised farmers in Rajasthan and Gujarat to promote sustainable livelihood by combining traditional and scientific methods. The Bank strives to strengthen rural economies by enhancing income generation opportunities through  farming  extensions,  agricultural  inputs  and promotion of handicrafts and handlooms. 6,000 farmers in FY 2023-24 received training on various climate resilient farming  techniques  and  gained  access  to  enhanced irrigation support  facilities.  The  work  in  watershed development has ushered a newfound hope for a lot of farmers and reversed migration of youth in the region.\n\n*The Bank's local operations refer to its operations within India.\n\n'In my 2-acre plot, I used to cultivate grains and vegetables. This farming, however, only fetched me an annual income of around ' 40,000, posing a challenge to make ends meet. Thanks to interventions like mulching, drip irrigation, and training in scientific tomato cultivation, I saw a significant increase in our agricultural yields.

Through this process, the Bank\n\narrives at the net disposable income for the household which is one of the key determinants for deciding loan eligibility and sanction amount\n\n- y Limit of total indebtedness: To avoid over indebtedness of the customer, a loan is only sanctioned for cases where total indebtedness is less than ' 2 lakh (basis the MFI Credit Bureau report)\n- y Loan applications are screened basis combined credit report (CCR) of the household: In addition to  the  total  indebtedness  limits,  screening  is  also done basis delinquency in microfinance, agri as well as retail loans\n- y Loan eligibility based on customer categorisation: Loan  eligibility  limits  are  also  set based on categorisation of New to Credit (NTC), New to Bank (NTB) and Existing to Bank customers. The limit for NTC and NTB is deliberately set lower taking a conservative approach towards their credit exposure\n- y Promoting  responsible  usage  of  loan: At  the time of Compulsory Group Training (CGT) and Group Recognition Training (GRT), customers are advised to utilise the loan that will be sanctioned for productive purposes.

In FY 2023-24, the Bank's EMS was certified ISO 14001:2015 compliant for the 11 th year in a row. Additionally, the Bank increased the number of ISO 14001 certified facilities to 1,186 from 833 from the previous year. During the year, two of YES BANK's major facilities  also  renewed their Green Building Certifications - YES BANK House received Platinum certification and the Bank's Okhala Office received Gold certification as per the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) standard.\n\n## Energy consumption and transition to renewables 1\n\nCognizant  of  its  use  of  energy  to  power  its  facilities and  operations,  YES  BANK  has  undertaken  a  focussed approach to monitor and reduce its energy consumption by  enhancing  energy  efficiency  and  promoting  energy saving practices amongst its employees. The Bank has completed its migration to 100% light-emitting diode (LED) lighting all its facilities, across India. The Bank is also in the process of phasing out air conditioning systems that are over 10 years old and that use R22 refrigerants. This year,\n\nthe Bank replaced 685 R22 air conditions in 167 branches totalling  956  in  tonnage  with  energy-efficient,  inverter units, resulting in energy  savings  of  approximately 29,48,711 MJ*. The Bank's focussed energy conservation initiatives  helped  reduce  the  Bank's  energy  intensity per rupee of turnover by approximately 18% from the previous  year,  even  as  its  overall  energy  consumption for FY 2023-24 increased by a marginal 1.57% over the previous year, due to the addition of new facilities.\n\n## Reducing emissions 1\n\nThe carbon emissions from its use of energy, represent one of the Bank's most significant environmental impacts. YES BANK is cognizant of its climate-related impacts and strives to align its business to the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise. Towards this, the Bank aims to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions with a target of reaching net zero by 2030. To achieve its net zero target, the Bank has begun migrating most of its facilities to renewable energy. In FY 2023-24, the share of renewable energy in the Bank's electricity mix increased to 12.31% resulting in approximately 5,254 tCO 2 e in avoided emissions. Currently, three of the Bank's offices, YES BANK House,  YES  Fintech  Centre,  Airoli  and  Vaman  Centre, Andheri),  along  with  43  of  the  Bank's  92  Branches  in Mumbai have been switched to renewables. In FY 2023-24, the  Bank  reduced  its  emission  intensity  (per  rupee  of turnover) by 19.55%, from the previous year.\n\n## KEY HIGHLIGHTS - YES BANK'S ISO 14001:2015 CERTIFIED EMS\n\n## World's first bank to have as many as 1,186 facilities under its ISO 14001:2015 certified Environmental Management System\n\n- y Inclusion of environmental risks into the Bank's operational risk assessment tool\n- y Introduced  processes  for  stringent  tracking  of environmental  compliances  through  quarterly undertaking from respective Business Unit heads\n- y Ensuring fulfilment of environmental compliances by  landlords  of  leased  facilities  as  part  of lease agreements\n- y Streamlining  waste  management  practices  by onboarding  pan-India  vendors  with  relevant consents from PCBs\n- y Simplifying  processes  to  procure  Green  Power from  the  grid  by  taking  advance  consent  from landlords as a part of lease agreements\n\n*Energy savings have been calculated using an estimate of 44% energy saved by Inverter ACs, as per a research paper from the Springer publication. Running period has been estimated as per purchase date of the AC units. Energy consumption from non-inverter ACs has been used as a baseline for calculating savings.",

At an organisation level, the Bank has  estimated  an  implicit  price  of ' 1,026  per  tCO 2 e emissions, i.e. to avoid one unit tCO 2 e emissions, annual cost  or  required  expenditure  is  of  around ' 1,026. The  estimation  is  based  on  the  internal  roadmap  to achieve its ambition of net zero target covering Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and annual expenditures required to achieve the reduction. The implicit carbon price varies for  different  facilities  in  different  geographical  locations. Facility  level  estimates  range  from  implicit  price  of ' 422 per tCO 2 e emission to ' 2004 per tCO 2 e emission,\n\nwith the overall carbon price at an organisational level estimated at ' 1,026 per tCO 2 e emissions emitted. The Bank will relook and re-calibrate its carbon price on a periodic basis  to  consider  emerging  alternatives  and  evolving ecosystem. The implicit price enables the Bank to drive low carbon investment, energy efficiency and change internal behaviour and in turn meet stakeholder expectation of doing  business  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  way. The implicit carbon price enables the Bank for a faster transition  to  energy-efficient  equipment  and  renewable energy sourcing, through inclusion of the cost of carbon abatement in its investments and expenditures, reflecting the holistic cost-benefit analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Towards this, the Bank has instituted an Environment and Social Risk Management System (ESMS) to assess and mitigate Environment and Social (E&S) risks of its financing activities, centred around its Environment and  Social  Policy.  The  Bank's  Environment  and  Social Policy (ESP), implemented in 2006, serves as a structured approach towards responsible lending.\n\nThe ESP, as an integral part of the Bank's Environment & Social Management System sets out the overarching framework for identification and management of potential and/or existing E&S risks commensurate with the nature and  scale  of  transactions  and  their  potential  impacts. Through this policy, the Bank integrates environmental and  social  risks  into  its  overall  credit  risk  assessment framework,  which  goes  beyond  financial  risk  mitigation. It has voluntarily adopted the policy, based on international frameworks such as IFC Performance Standards. The ESP is a crucial part of the Bank's credit risk appraisal process and the Bank further continues to mainstream environment and social considerations across its lending by strengthening ESP integration with the overall credit risk  assessment  framework.  The  policy  encompasses all the lending transactions of the Bank integrating E&S considerations in its financing activities and establishes a\n\nrisk-based approach where high value transactions that carry high ESG risks are subject to enhanced evaluation and  approval  through  a  specialised  team  of  internal/ external E&S risk assessment experts.\n\nThe policy provides for a 'list of prohibited activities' that the Bank does not finance. The list is derived from the IFC's exclusion list and includes sectors or activities that have a  highly  negative  impact  from  Environment  and  Social lens. The policy identifies and classifies the Bank's lending activity  into  various  segments,  and  accordingly  advises the  applicable  procedures  for  E&S  risk  assessment. Typically,  for  project  finance/project  related  corporate loan  transactions  as  defined  in  the  policy,  the  E&S  risk team undertakes an initial assessment to determine the degree of adverse environmental or social impact arising from business activities of the borrower and accordingly categorises transactions based on the level of E&S risks involved. For projects with significant E&S risks, the Bank conducts  enhanced  due  diligence/assessment  in  line with  IFC  PS  and  national  regulations  through  internal/ independent E&S risk analysts and develops corrective action plans with the borrower, performance on which is monitored throughout the credit cycle. The Bank strives to  positively  influence  borrowers  by  engaging  them  in adopting appropriate sustainable practices to meet higher ESG industry expectations.",

There were no project-related corporate loan transactions.\n\n## CASE STUDIES\n\n## Solar Energy Project\n\nThe  Borrower  approached  the  Bank  to  seek  term loan facilities for setting up a 100 MW solar energy project. As per the provisions of the E&S Policy, the Bank conducted a preliminary desk-based assessment to  determine  potential  adverse  environmental  and/ or  social  impacts  arising  from  business  activities  of the  Project.  The  preliminary  assessment  highlighted need of a detailed E&S due-diligence (E&S DD) in line with IFC Performance Standards (IFC PS) requirements and  verifying  compliance  with  applicable  Indian  E&S regulatory  framework.  Accordingly,  a  detailed  E&S DD  assessment  was  commissioned  by  the  Bank  to identify  and  mitigate  potential  E&S  risks  associated with the Project. The E&S DD recommended improving legal  compliances  of  the  sub-contractors  engaged in  on-site  activities  and  revising  the  existing  formal Grievance  Redressal  Mechanism  (GRM)  to  reflect  site specific scenarios. The Bank is in consultation with the Borrower to finalise an Environmental & Social Action Plan  (ESAP)  addressing  key  concerns  identified  in  the E&S DD assessment.\n\n## Sponge Iron Manufacturing Unit\n\nThe Bank sanctioned facilities to a Borrower for setting up a sponge iron manufacturing unit. The preliminary desk-based  assessment  indicated  the  need  for  a detailed Environment & Social Due-Diligence (E&S DD).\n\nThe  E&S  DD  assessment  highlighted  the  need  for improving the over-all on-site health and safety (H&S) aspects  during  the  construction  phase.  The  Bank engaged with the Borrower to develop and implement on-site H&S aspects such as work permit system, EHS training calendar. Improvements were also made to the existing on-site firefighting and first-aid facilities.\n\n## Hybrid (solar and wind) Renewable Energy Project\n\nThe Borrower and the Bank had been in engagement to participate in loan facilities for setting up a hybrid (wind and solar) renewable energy project. As per the provisions  of  the  E&S  Policy,  the  Bank  conducted  a preliminary desk-based assessment to determine the potential adverse environmental and/or social impacts arising from business activities of the Project.\n\nEnvironmental  &  Social  Due  Diligence  (E&S  DD)  was conducted by an independent E&S Consultant for both the wind and solar components of project.\n\nFor the solar component of the project, the E&S DD assessment  identified  environmental  monitoring  and biodiversity conservation as key areas for improvement. Environmental monitoring has been conducted by the borrower at the site for parameters such as ambient air quality, ambient noise, drinking water quality etc. to assess adverse impacts on the local environment. All  the  relevant  parameters  were  observed  to  be within  the  prescribed  levels.  Awareness  training  on conservation  measures  of  local  species  has  been initiated at the site. Carcass monitoring is also being conducted at the site on regular intervals. The data collated during the monitoring is documented and shall be  evaluated  to  assess  requirements  of  appropriate mitigation measures to protect the local species.\n\nThe key recommendations of the ESAP enclosed in the E&S DD assessment report for the wind component of  the  project  included  improvement  to  the  on-site health and safety practices, labour management and implementation of the bio-diversity management plan. The Bank along with other project lenders are in  discussion  with  the  Borrower  on  the  compliance measures implemented for mitigating above mentioned aspects.",

According to the latest estimates, India would need over USD 10 trillion of financing to achieve its net zero by 2070 target, with investments of over USD 8.4 trillion needed by the power sector alone. A majority of this financing will have to be driven by domestic financial institutions to support the technology shifts that would be required if India has to become net zero. The financial sector  led  by  banks  can  support  this  transition  by redirecting  finances  from  climate-negative  sectors  like coal, and channelise them to climate-aligned, low-carbon activities. YES BANK is focussed on estimating its financed emissions from carbon-intensive sectors and developing sectoral  targets  for  decarbonisation  in  line  with  global best practices. In FY 2021-22, the Bank became the first in  its  sector  to  measure  and  report  financed  emissions of  its  fund-based  electricity  generation  portfolio  and develop targets to reduce its financed emission intensity, dovetailing them into a targeted mix for its non-renewable energy  and  renewable  energy  portfolio.  Additionally, the  Bank  continues  to  support  climate-aligned  sectors like renewable energy and electric vehicles and develop targeted products for green financing such as its loans for rooftop solar for MSMEs.\n\n## Clean and renewable energy lending\n\nIn  FY  2023-24,  YES  BANK  sanctioned  debt  facilities  of ' 3,819 crore for supporting renewable energy projects including solar, wind, hybrid projects of around 637 MW, and  power  transmission,  InvIT,  and  smart  metering projects.  YES  BANK  continues  to  offer  innovative  and responsible solutions to the power industry and support the country's transition to a net zero carbon emission by 2070 through its business activities.\n\nThe  Bank  has  continued  to  channelise  its  efforts  in meeting the country's sustainability goals by sanctioning debt  facilities  amounting  to ' 39,469  crore,  towards ~7.90 GW since 2015. Projects underwritten by the Bank have  found  a  healthy  appetite  in  the  financing  market with  a  significant  portion  of  projects  being  successfully downsold/  refinanced.  The  Bank  continues  to  have  a positive outlook on the renewable and transmission sector and is now exploring growth in smart metering as well as domestic solar module manufacturing/assembly space.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Bank's lending book size for renewable energy generation stood at ~ ' 2,110 crore with corporate advances representing ~97.26%.\n\n## Avoided emissions\n\nThrough  its  financing  of  renewable  energy,  YES  BANK contributes  to  avoidance  of  emissions  in  electricity generation and assists in decarbonising India's electricity generation  sector.

YES BANK continues to be the only Indian Founding signatory amongst 230 global Banks that have joined PRB's call to action. The PRB framework  calls  upon  banks  to  undertake  an  impact analysis of their portfolios in order to assess how their businesses interact with and impact the 17 SDGs, and to minimise negative impacts and maximise positive impacts of their businesses.\n\nIn  FY  2021-22,  the  Bank  used  the  amended  UNEP  FI PRB Portfolio Impact Assessment tool v2, (published on July 16, 2021), to assess its portfolio. The tool assesses the  potential  impacts  of  the  Bank's  exposure  towards various sectors on 22 key impact categories, derived from\n\ncore elements of SDGs (as defined in the UNEP FI Impact Radar),  in  the  context  of  India's  need  and  challenges. These impact categories include availability and quality of water, food, education, employment, housing, health & sanitation, energy, climate change, resource efficiency, waste, information, culture & heritage, mobility, air, soil etc.\n\nTo understand and take into account India's environmental, social, and economic context, in which the Bank operates, Bank has utilised the tool to identify the level of need at national level, with regards to 22 impact categories. Considering the scope, scale of exposure, context and relevance in the impact assessment, Bank has identified and  prioritised  Climate  Change  and  Financial  Inclusion as  most  significant/material  areas,  to  pursue  focussed approach  driven  by  specific,  measurable,  actionable, relevant  and  time  bound  targets,  in  consultation  with top management.",

Prompt actions undertaken by the regulatory authorities helped mitigate potential risks to the financial sector that emanated from the deteriorating health of select banks in the United States and Europe.\n\nElevated interest rates in the world's major economies led to inflation falling faster-than-expected from its 2022 peak. Oil prices displayed some moderation in the first half of FY 2023-24 which was followed by some upward bias owing to geo-political tensions, extension and deepening of production cuts by OPEC (Oil Producing and Exporting Countries), US government's announcement to replenish its  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve.  Rising  trade  barriers, increased sanctions, technology decoupling and migration restrictions were some other highlights of the fiscal.\n\nWhile the global economy demonstrated broad resilience, significant  growth  divergences  were  observed  across various economies.  According  to  the  International Monetary Fund (IMF), global GDP grew ~3.2% in CY 2023. Advanced Economies grew by ~1.6%, compared to ~4.3% growth in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies.\n\nGoing ahead, last-mile efforts to bring the inflation down to target levels is likely to pose further challenges. IMF doesn't expect  most  major  economies  to  reach  their  targeted growth levels before CY 2025. Amidst this backdrop, IMF expects  the  global  economy  to  deliver  a  growth  rate  of ~3.2% in CY 2024, similar to that in CY 2023. Growth rate of Advanced Economies is expected at ~1.7%, while on the other hand, emerging market economies are expected to grow by ~4.2%.\n\nOn  the  domestic  front,  the  Indian  economy  remained one of the fastest growing economies of the world and continued to exhibit strong macroeconomic fundamentals.",

Capex  spending  by the central and state governments played a critical role in driving and sustaining the growth momentum.\n\nHeadline  CPI  inflation  remained  below  5%  in  Q1-FY 2023-24 before it peaked to the level of 7.4% in July 2024. However,  inflation  containment  measures  undertaken by the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) resulted in bringing down of Headline CPI inflation in the second half, averaging at ~4.9% for FY 2023-24.\n\nRBI  remains  committed  to  further  bring  inflation  down to 4% levels, and therefore, kept policy rate unchanged at  6.5%,  and  maintained  its  stance  of  'withdrawal  of accommodation'.\n\nFurther measures such as Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR), Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) and Variable Repo Rate (VRR) auctions were also undertaken to balance the system-wide liquidity during the year. Core inflation, on the other hand, averaged at ~4.4% in FY 2023-24, drifting from 5.3% in April 2023 to 3.3% by March 2024.\n\nThe Indian banking system continued to be resilient as evidenced through the findings of RBI's Financial Stability Report (Dec'23) with Scheduled Commercial Banks' (SCBs) Capital-to-Risk Assets Ratio (CRAR) remaining at 16.8%, Gross  Non-Performing  Assets  (GNPA)  ratio  falling  to  a multi-year low of 3.2%, and Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) ratio to 0.8% as on September 30, 2023, even while the Provisioning Coverage Ratio (PCR) steadily increased to 75.3%. RBI's stress test results revealed that SCBs are well-capitalised and capable of absorbing macro-economic shocks, even with no further capital infusion.\n\nWith growth conditions being resilient, RBI continues to remain focussed on bringing down inflation to a target of 4% on a durable basis.

Strong services exports and remittances have been crucial in  providing  stability  to  Current  Account  Deficit  (CAD). Importantly,  services  exports  remained  resilient  amidst the global slowdown fears with the increasing contribution from non-software exports.\n\nThe trade gap improved slightly in FY 2023-24 vis-\u00e0-vis FY 2022-23 even as moderation was witnessed in both exports  and  imports.  Consequent  to  the  above  trends, the ratio of CAD as a percentage of GDP is expected to improve to 0.7% in FY 2023-24, from 2.0% in FY 2022-23. Further,  capital  flows  remained  robust,  with  inflows from Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) increasingly being determined by geopolitical alignments and inward-looking strategies of various  economies.  Thus,  inward  FDI declined by 3.6% between April 2023 and January 2024, compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.  However,  External  Commercial  Borrowing  (ECB) registrations and disbursements improved during\n\nthe  same  period.  Net  Foreign  Portfolio  Investment (FPI)  inflows  stood  at  USD  57.6  billion  in  FY  2023-24. The  pace  of  FPI  investments  picked  up  significantly  on the debt side following the announcement of India being included in JP Morgan's widely tracked Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets.\n\nUncertainties  in  the  global  monetary  policy  dynamics associated with the resilience of the US economy and relative growth paths of the Advanced Economies (AEs) led to wide moves in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). In July 2023, DXY touched a low of 99.7, but swiftly turned around to peak at around 107 by early October. Thereafter, it again moved down to around 101 by late-December 2023 before finishing the year at 104.60. However, USD/INR experienced a ranged move, and tended to be on an appreciation mode in the last quarter of FY 2023-24. Consequently, it moved in a narrow range of 81.76-83.40 during the year. By the end of April 2024, foreign exchange (FX) reserves were at a healthy ~USD 638 billion.\n\n## RETAIL BANKING\n\nThe Retail business in India's banking sector witnessed robust growth during the year with system-wide share of retail loans (personal loans) at 32.4%, which increased 17.7% Y-O-Y (excluding HDFC and HDFC Bank merger impact).\n\n| Retail (Y-O-Y growth %)       | Mar'23   |      | Apr'23 May'23   | Jun'23   | Jul'23   | Aug'23   | Sep'23   | Oct'23   | Nov'23   | Dec'23   | Jan'24   | Feb'24   | Mar'24   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Credit Card Outstanding       | 32.5     | 29.7 | 29.9            | 36.0     | 31.2     | 30.0     | 29.9     | 28.0     | 34.2     | 32.6     | 31.3     | 31.0     | 25.6     |\n| Education                     | 17.1     | 18.0 | 18.3            | 19.4     | 19.9     | 20.2     | 20.8     | 20.6     | 22.8     | 21.9     | 22.9     | 23.4     | 23.3     |\n| Other Personal Loans          | 26.7     | 24.0 | 23.2            | 26.1     | 24.2     | 23.2     | 22.7     | 22.3     | 21.7     | 20.5     | 21.0     | 19.7     | 18.7     |\n| Housing (incl.

Whilst, in the first year, the focus was on rebuilding the Bank, in the second year, we swiftly shifted our focus on growing the Bank, in the third year, we achieved critical milestones of equity capital raise from two global marquee Private Equity investors, transfer of legacy stressed asset pool to ARC which was by far the single largest transaction of  sale  of  non-performing  assets  in  the  Indian  Banking System. Through the fourth year 2023-24, the Bank has continued to build on a strong momentum on both our asset  and  liability  with  focus  on  granularity  and  in  risk calibrated manner. The Bank now has a dedicated focus towards  improving  the  profitability  profile  of  the  Bank, thereby enhancing the shareholder returns. The Directors are  pleased  to  inform  the  shareholders  that  the  Bank's Total Assets in FY 2023-24 crossed ' 4 lakh crore, with deposits crossing ' 2.6 lakh crore and CASA ratio at 30.9%. At the same time, the Return on Assets (RoA) for FY 2023-24 expanded  to  0.3%  from  0.2%  in  the  previous  year,  and the  annualised  RoA  for  the  Quarter  ended  March  31, 2024 was at 0.5%.\n\nThe  Bank  has  further  progressed  on  its  transformation journey and has emerged as a re-energised, recapitalised and recalibrated organisation, by leveraging on a unique opportunity  to  learn  from  past  challenges  and  become stronger, while continuing to fulfil its unwavering commitment  towards  its  customers  and  stakeholders. The Bank is on track to achieve its longer-term Strategic Objectives  and  none  of  this  would  have  been  possible without  the  confidence  reposed  on  the  Bank  by  our customers,  depositors  and  investors.  The  confidence of  stakeholders  has  not  only  been  seen  through  the improving  financial  performance  of  the  Bank  during the last year, but also through external validation in the form  of  Credit  Rating  upgrades,  continuing  momentum on  new  client  acquisition,  several  marquee  strategic partnerships  and  re-inclusion  of  the  stock  in  marquee indices amongst others.\n\nImportantly,  during  the  year,  the  Bank  has  dedicatedly focussed  on  executing  its  profitability  improvement roadmap by leveraging the core and key business levers of 1) retail asset mix optimisation, 2) SME and Mid-Market strong  value  proposition,  3)  leveraging  Digital  and Transaction  Banking  capabilities  and  partnerships  and, lastly  4)  fully  sweating  Branches  as  the  fulcrum  of  the business to drive higher cross sell and lower costs going forward. This is being driven alongside a focused Priority Sector Lending (PSL) strategy.\n\nAs  a  part  of  its  transformation,  the  Bank  unveiled  its refreshed brand identity on May 30, 2023, as a part of which a  vibrant  new  logo  was  launched  which  carries  forward the  visual  DNA  of  the  Bank  and  builds  on  it.

        "page_content": "row,  which  is  a  reflection  of  Bank's  high-trust  and  high performance culture.\n\nKey highlights during FY 2023-24 included:\n\n- A dedicated  Strategy  &  Transformation  Office was  setup,  aimed  at  accelerating  the  Profitability profile of the Bank.\n- Senior  Management  Appointments  during  the  year included: Mr. Manish Jain as Country Head - Wholesale Banking,  Mr.  Pankaj  Sharma  as  Chief  Strategy and  Transformation  Officer,  Mr.  Tushar  Patankar as  Chief  Risk  Officer,  Mr.  Rajat  Chhalani  as  Chief Compliance Officer.\n- The  Bank  received  Credit  Rating  Upgrades  from CRISIL,  India  Ratings  &  CARE  for  its  Basel  III  Tier  II Bonds & Infrastructure Bonds which were upgraded to A from A- / BBB+.\n- The  Bank  also  topped  amongst  Indian  Banks  with highest S&P Global ESG Score in 2023.\n- YES  BANK  is  the  first  Bank  globally  with  an  ISO 14001:2015  certified  Environmental  Management System covering 1,186 facilities.\n- The Bank was also included in BSE Next 50, BSE 100 as well as FTSE4Good indices during the year.\n- The  Bank  is  the  Principal  Sponsor  -  Indian  Olympic Association (IOA) as their Official Banking Partner for Team India for Paris Olympics 2024.\n- The  Bank  entered  into  a  Strategic  Partnership  with PayTM: wherein the Bank will provide services as a PSP Payment Bank to existing & new consumers of UPI consumer App, UPI collections services to existing & new merchants and offering of settlement services.\n- The  Bank  received  several  awards  in  the  MSME Banking  Excellence  Awards  2023,  organised  by CIMSME:  Awarded  Best  Bank  for  Promoting  Govt. Schemes in private sector, runners-up for Best MSME Bank in the private sector.\n- YES BANK was the first Indian Bank to conduct Export Finance Transaction on RXIL's (Receivables Exchange of  India  Limited- a TReDS platform with JV between SIDBI  and  NSE)  ITFS  (International  Trade  Finance Service) platform.\n\nThe  Bank  continued  its  efforts  towards  building  a stronger  retail  franchise  with  contribution  of  retail advances  compared  to  total  advances,  increased  to ~46%  in  FY  2023-24  compared  to  45%  in  FY  2022-23. Digitisation remains the Bank's key pillar to grow the Retail,\n\nSME and the Transaction Banking businesses. The Bank has  seen  new  sanctions/disbursements  of  ~ ' 1,14,000 crore in FY 2023-24 with Retail Assets disbursements of ~ ' 42,000 crore. The Bank has significant presence within the new-age payments space with the highest market share of 34.5% in UPI transactions (by volume) in FY 2023-24.\n\n## STATE OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE BANK\n\nThe  Bank's  fundamentals  have  strengthened  and  it  has emerged  as  a  financially  sound,  well  capitalised,  well governed institution, with customer centricity and digital at the heart of its strategy. The Bank remains focused on its priorities and looks to continue this momentum onwards and upwards so that it can deliver on its strategic objectives while creating superior value for all its stakeholders.\n\n## BUSINESS OUTLOOK\n\nAs we progress into Fiscal 25, the overall business outlook remains healthy. The Banking sector in India has exhibited remarkable  resilience  in  the  face  of  many  adversities. The latest Financial Stability Report (December 23) indicates that  the  domestic  financial  system  remains  stable,  with sound balance sheets of financial institutions, and which is expected to continue to support the funding needs of a growing economy. On a y-o-y basis, one should expect some moderation in the credit growth from the banking system  that  accounts  for  a  high  base  of  the  last  year and relative expected moderation in GDP growth rate to around 7% in Fiscal 25.\n\nThe Government is expected to continue with its reforms momentum and keep up the pace of capex investments. Various  surveys  have  indicated  that  likely  crowding-in of  private  investments  which  may  further  boost  credit demand. With the RBI increasing the risk weight of some of the segments of personal loan, the impact was already visible in the last four months of Fiscal 24 and we expect the  pace  of  growth  in  this  segment  to  slow  down  going forward; with some offsets likely to continue to come from sustained growth in Housing segment.\n\nAs we may see rate cut cycle beginning to unfold at some point in Fiscal 25, it is expected that financial markets may exhibit  some  volatility.  A  falling  interest  rate  scenario  is expected to be detrimental for the net interest margins (NIMs) for the banking sector as transmission of rate cuts on the asset side is generally faster than on the liability side. Continued global geopolitical tensions could, on the other hand, temper the growth outlook and hence lead to moderation in credit growth. Geopolitical risks also raise the fear of a rise in commodity prices and could also lead to hampering economic growth and hence credit growth.",

BANK'S PHILOSOPHY ON CODE OF GOVERNANCE 1\n\nAt YES BANK, we are driven by a deep purpose and relentless  commitment  to  our  path  to  Corporate Governance. Our differentiated approach to governance is  built  on  sound  governance  practices based on conscience, openness, fairness, professionalism,  and  accountability.  This  approach helps in building confidence of its various stakeholders and thereby paving the way for its long-term success. The Bank believes in sustainable corporate growth that emanates  from  the  top  leadership  down  through the  organisation  to  the  various  stakeholders  which is  reflected  in  its  sound  financial  system,  enhanced market reputation and improved efficiency.\n\nTransparency and Accountability are the fundamental principles  to  sound  Corporate  Governance,  which ensures  that  the  organisation  is  managed  and monitored in a responsible manner for 'creating and sharing value'.\n\nThe  Bank  regularly  upgrades  its  systems,  policies, and processes to meet the demands of a dynamic and  challenging  business  environment,  providing reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  maintenance of  proper  internal  controls  and  the  monitoring  of operations,  thereby  enhancing  transparency  and accountability. YES BANK is committed to adhere to highest standards of ethics, transparency, disclosures and governance and to protect the interest of all its stakeholders.  The  Board  is  focused  on  ensuring continuous improvements in both Corporate Governance and Risk Controls of the Bank.\n\nYES BANK's  Corporate  Governance  Framework ensures  that  timely  disclosures  are  made  and accurate information is shared regarding the financial performance, operations, material events as well as the leadership and governance of the Bank.\n\nDuring  the  recent  past  years,  certain  Corporate Governance  issues  were  raised  by  Stakeholders and Regulators.\n\nTaking a positive note of such observations, the Bank has worked effortlessly to strengthen its governance and  disclosure  practices  and  promises  to  continue to be on the progressive path to nourish Corporate Governance practices to make it more effective from regulatory and market perspective.\n\n## Environmental, Social & Governance Rating\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance refers to the non-financial performance of an  organisation  on  crucial  issues  such  as climate  change,  environmental  sustainability,  social responsibility,  ethics,  institutional  frameworks,  and transparency, amongst others.\n\nGlobally,  there  is  an  emerging  awareness  that  an organisation's  overall  performance  is  linked  to non-financial,  yet  financially  material  issues,  which pose significant material risks to long term returns. This  has  led  to  the  emergence  of  ESG,  a  set  of non-financial  metrics  or  parameters,  which  along with financial metrics, provide a holistic assessment of an organisation's impact on three fronts - Profits, People and Planet.\n\nYES  BANK  views  the  emergence  of  ESG  as  an important development for the corporate sector both from an ethical and financial perspective. The Bank continuously strives to integrate ESG principles into its  core  business  strategy,  adopt  best  practices  in ESG and align its business to global frameworks on sustainability such as the United Nation's Sustainable Development  Goals  (SDGs),  the  Paris  Climate Agreement, and the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB).  The  Bank  has  set  up  a  robust  governance structure for integrating ESG considerations into its business by constituting a Board level CSR and ESG Committee to oversee the Bank's ESG agenda, and an  Executive  level  Sustainability  Council  chaired  by the  Managing  Director  &  CEO  which  oversees  the implementation of the Bank's sustainability strategy and performance. The Bank further strengthened its ESG governance by including ESG in its a Board level Committee  and  renaming  the  same  as  CSR  &  ESG",

Provide the following details related to water discharged 1 :\n\nGiven YES BANK's nature of business, water consumption and discharge is minimal and is not considered a significant environmental aspect for the Bank. The Bank currently only monitors the amount of water discharged from its corporate office YES BANK House and has set up a zero liquid discharge facility at this office. At other tenanted facilities, discharge is managed by the landlords and treated through respective municipal treatment facilities, across geographies.\n\n| Parameter                                                             | FY 2023-24 (Current Financial Year)                                   | FY 2022-23 (Previous Financial Year)                                  |                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Water discharge by destination and level of treatment (in kiloliters) | Water discharge by destination and level of treatment (in kiloliters) | Water discharge by destination and level of treatment (in kiloliters) | Water discharge by destination and level of treatment (in kiloliters) |\n| (i)   To Surface water                                                | Nil                                                                   | Nil                                                                   |                                                                       |\n| -  No treatment                                                       | -                                                                     | -                                                                     |                                                                       |\n| -  With treatment - please specify level of treatment                 | -                                                                     | -                                                                     |                                                                       |\n| (ii)   To Groundwater                                                 | Nil                                                                   | Nil                                                                   |                                                                       |\n| -  No treatment                                                       | -                                                                     | -                                                                     |                                                                       |\n| -  With treatment - please specify level of treatment                 | -                                                                     | -                                                                     |                                                                       |",

If Yes, then provide details.\n\nIn order to align with the net zero pathways suggested by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Bank has pledged to reduce GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) from its operations to net zero by 2030. To achieve its net zero target, the Bank plans to migrate most of its facilities to renewable energy. In FY 2023-24, the share of renewable energy in the Bank's electricity mix is around 11% resulting in approximately 4,609.35 tCO 2 e in avoided emissions. Currently, three of the Bank's offices (corporate office, YES BANK House, YES Fintech Center, Airoli and its office in Vaman Centre, Andheri), along with 43 of the Bank's 92 Branches in Mumbai have been switched to renewables. The Bank also aims to reduce its energy consumption by enhancing its energy efficiency. The Bank has completed its migration to light-emitting diode (LED) fixtures at all its facilities and is in the process of switching to star-rated air conditioners and equipment in all its offices.",

For these categories, in addition to reporting actual data from select major offices, the Bank has also included estimated data for the remainder of its offices and branches, based on facility-wise headcount. The amendments have been applied retrospectively to the corresponding data points for FY 2022-23 and the data for plastic waste and other non-hazardous waste, have been restated. Accordingly, the plastic waste and other non-hazardous waste generated for FY 2022-23, have increased by 1.31 Tonnes and 381.45 Tonnes, respectively. For FY 2023-24, information for plastic waste generated / disposed includes actual data (from YES BANK HOUSE (Santacruz), YES FINTECH (Airoli), Goregaon office, and NOC Chennai) and estimated data for the remainder of offices and branches, calculated based on facility-wise headcount. Other non-hazardous waste includes dry waste (cups, paper, cartons, stationary, tissue paper etc.) and wet waste (leftover food, vegetable peels, fruits etc.). FY 2023-24, information for dry waste and wet waste generated / disposed includes actual data (dry waste from YES BANK HOUSE (Santacruz), YES FINTECH (Airoli), Goregaon office, and NOC Chennai, and wet waste from YES BANK HOUSE (Santacruz)), and estimated data for the remainder of offices and branches, calculated based on facility-wise headcount 1 .\n\n# Bio-medical waste includes data from five major offices, YES BANK HOUSE (Santacruz), YES FINTECH (Airoli), NOC Chennai, NOC Gurugram and Max Tower Noida, which have an in-house medical center\n\n\u20ac Other hazardous waste consists of residue oil from Diesel Generators\n\n^PPP conversion rate used is 22.88 INR / USD as published by the World Bank for India, for the year 2022\n\n@ For FY 2023-24, MT of waste recovered / total waste generated is 0.31 (0.26 for FY 2022-23). For FY 2023-24, MT of waste disposed / total waste generated is 0.69 (0.74 for FY 2022-23)\n\nIndependent reasonable assurance for the above disclosure has been carried out by BSI Group India Private Limited, in accordance with the BRSR Core - Framework for assurance and ESG disclosures for value chain.

Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.\n\nIn  line  with  its  Environmental  Management System, the Bank has instituted robust mechanisms for responsible collection, recycling, and disposal of its waste. The Bank has partnered Viagreen to recycle paper used at key facilities including  its  corporate  office.  YES  BANK  House  is  equipped  with  a  composting  unit  and  a  zero  liquid  discharge facility to minimize the environmental impacts of its operations. The Bank has also appointed central vendors to collect, recycle and responsibly dispose e-waste from all its facilities and to buy back its lead acid batteries used in its uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems.",

Essential Indicators\n\n## 1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.\n\nYES BANK has a Board approved Grievance Redressal Policy which is available on the Bank's website. Customers can visit the Bank's Branch, call the call center or write to YES Touch for any query /request/ complaint. Further, the Bank has put in place a 3-Level Grievance Redressal Mechanism. To ensure timely resolution of Customer Complaints, all complaints are logged into the Bank's Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and each CRM issue type has a system defined TAT. As mandated by the Reserve Bank of India, YES BANK has implemented a mechanism of Internal Ombudsman wherein all customer complaints which are denied/ partially denied by the Bank are referred to the Internal Ombudsman, prior to Bank's final decision.\n\nOn the wholesale side, the Bank has a comprehensive service infrastructure for corporate customers especially for transaction intensive businesses. In addition to relationship and product sales teams, corporate servicing is focussed through the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Corporate Service Delivery (CSD) Branches which take care of operations and in person contact based services\n- \u00b7 Priority Service Relationship Managers (PSRM) are allocated to high transactions/ business volume customers to act as single point of contact/ access/ attention\n- \u00b7 The Bank also has a dedicated email ID and Virtual Contact Centre for receiving, record keeping and resolving customer service issues. All customer service issues are tracked and monitored for suitable redressal with due oversight in a multi-level structure, across senior management\n\n## 2.

The Bank has however undertaken various initiatives to integrate environmental parameters into its customer-facing processes and operations -\n\n- 1. The  Bank  has  adopted  an  Environment  and  Social  Policy  (ESP)  which  serves  as  a  structured  approach  towards responsible lending. The ESP is an integral part of the Bank's Environment and Social Risk Management System (ESMS) which sets out the overarching framework for identification and management of potential and/ or existing environment and social (E&S) risks commensurate with the nature and scale of transactions and their potential impacts.  Through  this  policy,  the  Bank  integrates  environmental  and  social  risks  into  its  overall  credit  risk assessment framework.",

Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.\n\nDisruption in services of the Bank (planned and unplanned) does have the potential to cause grave reputational damage. Keeping this in view, the Bank's Corporate Communication is entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating the Bank's communication strategy, based on the severity of the situation. Appended below, are some steps taken by the Corporate Communication team to mitigate the risk that could arise as a result of service disruptions\n\nUnplanned/Planned Downtimes: In case of a downtime, the Bank's Corporate Communication team works with the Bank's Business and Digital Technology Solutions Group (BDTS) team to assess the cause of the disruption. The team then frames a communication that not just acknowledges the issue, but also provides a fair idea of the time required to restore normalcy. Post relevant approvals, the communication is disseminated to customers in the following ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Press Release: We may issue a brief press release to the media which talks about the downtime and carry other relevant details like services that got impacted, services that remain intact, as well as the time it will take to restore normalcy. Depending on the magnitude of the issue, we may choose to restrict the issuance of the release to a certain geographical region\n- \u00b7 Social Media: This is a critical strategy wherein we acknowledge the downtime by proactively putting up a social media notification on all of the Bank's handles. Typically, the post should also carry details about the issue in brief and the services that have been impacted as well as the ones that are working seamlessly\n- \u00b7 Online  Reputation  Management  (ORM): A  gist  of  the  press  release  is  shared  with  the  ORM  team which  then  uses  it  as  reference  to  respond  to  customer  queries/escalations  on  social  media,  emails  and telephonic conversations\n- \u00b7 WhatsApp/SMS: Considering customers are significantly more active in accessing information on their phones, we also make it point to communicate all critical information to customers through WhatsApp and SMS'\n\nThe strategies listed above are purely planned and executed basis the degree of impact and may not involve activating all four channels of communication every time.",

IT  controls  are stated in Entity Level Controls (ELC), IT General Controls (ITGC)  and  IT  Application  Controls  (ITAC).  Such  controls contribute to risk mitigation of erroneous output data.\n\n- We have planned, designed and carried out the desired audit  procedures  and  sample  checks,  taking  into consideration the IT systems of the Bank. As part of our IT controls testing, we have tested ITGC as well as ITAC for selected critical applications.  The focus of testing of ITGCs was based on the various parameters such as Completeness, Validity, Identification/ Authentication, Authorization,  Integrity  and  Accountability.  On  the other hand, focus of testing automated controls from applications was  whether  the  controls  prevent or  detect  unauthorized  transactions  and  support financial objectives including completeness, accuracy,  authorization  and  validity  of  transactions.\n\n- Test checked advances to examine the validity of the recorded  amounts,  loan  documentation,  examined the statement of accounts, indicators of impairment, impairment  provision  for  non-performing  assets, and  compliance  with  income  recognition,  asset classification and provisioning pertaining to advances in terms of applicable RBI guidelines;\n- Tested,  selected  restructured  accounts  on  sample basis and their compliance with relevant RBI guidelines;\n- For the  selected  non-performing  advances,  we assessed  Management's  forecast  and  inputs  of recoverable  cash  flows,  borrower's  audited  financial statements,  valuation  of  underlying  security  and collaterals,  estimation  of  recoverable  amounts  on default and other sources of repayment;\n- Tested the Bank's processes for making provision on advances  for  compliance  with  RBI  regulations  and internally laid down policies for provisioning;\n- Undertaken the walkthrough for the automated E-NPA system and tested the core functionality for selected samples considering the audit universe.\n- Validated the parameters used to calculate collective provisions  with  reference  to  IRAC  norms,  and Regulatory Package;\n- Tested  provision  created  for  fraud  accounts  as  at March 31, 2024 as per the RBI circular;\n- Re-performed,  for  a  sample  of  retail  and  corporate portfolios, as part of our substantive audit procedures the  calculation  of  provisions,  to  determine  the accuracy of the same; (Collective for standard portfolio and case specific for non performing portfolio)\n- Assessed the adequacy  of  disclosures against the RBI Guidelines\n\n<!-- image -->",

The IT environment is complex and the design and operating effectiveness of IT controls have a direct impact on its financial reporting process.  Such controls provide assurance on the integrity and completeness of data processed through various IT applications which are used for the preparation of financial reports.\n\nThe  procedures  adopted  by  us  are,  in  our  opinion, adequate  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  on the  adequacy  of  IT  controls  in  place.  The  areas  for improvement as and when noticed are communicated for suitable actions to the Bank as part of our audit. The corrective steps / alternate controls deployed by the Bank are tested on sample basis.\n\n## Information  other  than  the  standalone  financial statements and Auditor's Report thereon\n\nThe  Bank's  management  and  Board  of  Directors  are responsible for the Other  Information.  The  other information  comprises  the  Management  Discussion  and Analysis, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Directors' Report forming part of the Annual Report, but does  not  include  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements, Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  our  auditor's report thereon and the Pillar III Disclosures under Basel\n\n- In ITGC  testing,  on  sample  basis,  we  reviewed control  areas  such  as  User  Management,  Change Management,  Systems  Security,  Cyber  Security, Interface  Testing,  deployment  of  new  applications, Incident  Management,  Physical  &  Environmental Security,  Creation  and  maintenance  of  edit  logs, Backup  and  Restoration,  Business  Continuity  and Disaster Recovery, Service Level Agreement.\n- For ITAC, we carried out on sample basis, compliance tests  of  system  functionality  in  order  to  assess  the accuracy of system calculations. We also carried out procedures  such  as  validations  and  limit  checks  on data  entered  into  applications,  approvals,  process dependencies,  restriction  on  time  period  in  which transactions  may  be  recorded  and  GL  mapping  for financial accounting.\n- Tested the control environment  using  various techniques  such  as  inquiry,  walkthroughs  in  live environment,  testing  in  UAT  environment,  review  of documentation  /  record  /  reports,  observation  and re-performance.\n- Wherever  deviations  were  noted  either  the  same were  explained  to  our  satisfaction  or  we  tested compensating  controls  and  performed  alternate procedures, where necessary, to draw comfort.\n- In addition, we  have  also  relied  on  IS  audit conducted by internal audit department, and also the testing of Internal Financial Control conducted  by  the  Operational  Risk  Management department of the Bank.\n\nIII  Capital  Regulation,  Leverage  Ratio,  Liquidity  Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio. The Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  standalone  financial statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  Other",

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting  records  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of  the  Act  and  the  RBI  Guidelines  for  safeguarding  of the assets of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal financial  controls  that  were  operating  effectively  for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements,  the Management  and  Board  of  Directors  are  responsible for  assessing  the  Bank's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the  Bank  or  to  cease  operations,  or  has  no  realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose  Board  of  Directors  are  also  responsible  for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or  error,  and  to  issue  an  Auditor's  Report  that  includes our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance  with  SAs  will  always  detect  a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the basis of these standalone financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  whether due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error, as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i)  of  the  Act,  we  are  also  responsible  for expressing  our  opinion  on  whether  the  bank  has adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to  financial  statements  in  place  and  the  operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures in the standalone financial statements made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and  Board  of  Director's  use  of  the  going  concern basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty",

Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  Auditor's  Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and content  of  the  standalone  financial  statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  we identify during our audit.\n\nWe  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with a statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant ethical  requirements  regarding  independence,  and  to communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and  other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nThe Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March  31,  2023,  have  been  audited  by  one  of  the predecessor  auditors  M.P.  Chitale  &  Co.  and  continuing joint  statutory  auditors  Chokshi  &  Chokshi  LLP,  whose report dated April 22, 2023 had expressed an unmodified opinion.

Accordingly, our audit is carried out centrally based on the records and data made available to us at Head Office. During the course of our audit, we have visited and  performed  select  relevant  procedures at 56 branches;\n- (d) The profit and loss account shows a true balance of profit for the year then ended\n- 3) As  required  by  Section  143(3)  of  the  Act,  we report that:\n- (a) we have sought and obtained all the information and  explanations  which  to  the  best  of  our knowle  dge  and  belief  were  necessary  for  the purposes of our audit;\n- (b) in  our  opinion,  proper  books  of  account  as required  by  law  have  been  kept  by  the  Bank so  far  as  it  appears  from  our  examination of those books;",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to  the  Bank's  policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its  assets, the  prevention  and  detection  of  frauds  and  errors,  the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act').\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank's internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  standalone\n\nfinancial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing ('the Standards'), issued by the ICAI and deemed to be, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to financial  statements  were  established  and  maintained and  whether  such  controls  operated  effectively  in  all material respects.\n\nOur  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain audit  evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements and  their  operating  effectiveness.  Our  audit  of  internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  standalone  financial statements  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  standalone financial  statements,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the  assessed  risk.

The moratorium granted  to  the  borrowers  based  on  RBI  guidelines  is  not  accounted  as  restructuring  of  loan.  The  RBI  guidelines  on 'Resolution Framework for COVID-19-related Stress' provide a prudential framework for resolution plan of certain loans. The borrowers where resolution plan was implemented under these guidelines are classified as standard restructured.\n\nIn respect of loans reported as fraud to RBI the entire amount is provided for over a period not exceeding four quarters starting from the quarter in which fraud has been detected. In respect of loans where there has been delay in reporting the fraud to the RBI, the entire amount is provided immediately.\n\nThe Bank makes additional provisions as per RBI guidelines for the cases where viable resolution plan has not been implemented within timelines prescribed by RBI, from the date of default. These additional provisions are written back on satisfying the conditions for reversal as per RBI guidelines.\n\nAs per the RBI guidelines a general provision is made on all standard advances, including provision for borrowers having unhedged foreign currency exposure and for credit exposures computed as per the current marked to market values of  interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts. The general provision also includes provision for stressed sector exposures and provision for incremental exposure of the banking system to a specified borrower beyond Normally Permitted Lending Limit (NPLL) in proportion to the Bank's funded exposure to specified borrower.

Income and expenditure items of integral foreign operations are translated at the daily average closing rates and of non-integral foreign operations (foreign branches) at the monthly average closing rates.\n\nPremia/discounts on foreign exchange swaps that are used to hedge risks arising from foreign currency assets and liabilities are amortized over the life of the swap.\n\nMonetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date at rates notified by the Foreign Exchange Dealers' Association of India ('FEDAI'). Foreign exchange contracts are stated at net present value using risk-free rates ('RFRs')/SWAP curves of the respective currencies with the resulting unrealised gain or loss being recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and correspondingly in other assets (representing positive Mark-to-Market) and in other liabilities (representing negative Mark-to-Market ('MTM')) on a gross basis.\n\nFinancial conduct authority ('FCA') of the United Kingdom has phased out London interbank offered rate ('LIBOR') on December 2021, replacing it by Alternate Reference Rate ('ARR').

While the daily settlement prices is computed on the basis of weighted average price of such contract, the final settlement price is taken as the RBI reference rate on the last trading day of the future contract or as may be specified by the relevant authority from time to time. All open positions are marked to market based on the settlement price and the resultant marked to market profit / loss is daily settled.",

Under this method, the determination is based on actuarial calculations, which include assumptions about demographics, early retirement, salary increases and interest rates.

Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') in exercise of its powers conferred under Section 36ACA of the BR Act  superseded  the  then  Board  of  Directors  and  appointed  an  Administrator  to  manage  the  affairs  of  the  Bank w.e.f. March 5, 2020. Subsequently on March 13, 2020, through the 'YES Bank Limited Reconstruction Scheme, 2020' ('the  Yes  Bank  Reconstruction  Scheme'),  the  relevant  authorities  (i.e.,  Central  Government  in  consultation  with  RBI) decided to 'reconstitute' the Bank. Further, in terms of the Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme, the Administrator was to continue in office until the Board of Directors mentioned in the Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme assumed office, i.e., on March 26, 2020.\n\nIn light of the above, the Administrator, on behalf of the Bank, consequent to the invocation of Section 45 of the BR Act, and to protect the interest of the Bank and its depositors, was constrained to write down ( ' 84,150 million) two tranches of the Additional Tier 1 Bonds ('AT-1 Bonds') issued in 2016 and 2017, in compliance with the contractual covenants and applicable RBI guidelines, on March 14, 2020.\n\nAggrieved by the said write down of AT-1 Bonds, AT-1 Bondholders filed various writ petition(s), civil  suit(s),  criminal and consumer complaint(s) across India challenging the decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds since 2020. The same are pending adjudication, save and except the batch of writ petition(s) filed before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court and one writ petition before the Hon'ble Madras High Court (as mentioned below).\n\n## Judgment dated September 30, 2020 of the Hon'ble Madras High Court ('MHC'):\n\nThe RBI Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations, in so far as it relates to issuance and write down of AT-1 Bonds, was challenged before the Division Bench of the Hon'ble MHC in the Writ Petition titled Piyush Bokaria Vs. Reserve Bank of India and Ors., (being W.P. (Civil) 12586 of 2020). The Hon'ble MHC vide its judgment dated September 30, 2020 upheld the validity of the RBI Master Circular in relation to the AT-1 Bonds. Additionally, with respect to the aspect of writing down of AT-1 Bonds, the Hon'ble MHC observed that one of the features of AT-1 Bonds is that they can be written-down before the equity shares bear losses and considering that the Petitioners purchased the AT -1 Bonds in the secondary market, they cannot claim to be ignorant of the terms and conditions thereof. The Hon'ble MHC also noted the loss absorbency feature of the AT-1 Bonds and dismissed the Writ Petition.\n\n## Judgment dated January 20, 2023 of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court ('BHC'):\n\nMultiple  writ  petition(s)  were  filed  before  the  Hon'ble  BHC  challenging  the  write  down  of  AT-1  Bonds  and  the  stock exchange intimation dated March 14, 2020 made in relation to the write down. The Hon'ble BHC vide its judgment dated January 20, 2023 set aside the stock exchange intimation and decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds ('Judgment'). At the request of the Bank, the Hon'ble BHC stayed the order for a period of 6 (six) weeks.\n\n## Proceedings before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India ('Supreme Court'):\n\nAggrieved by the Judgment of the Hon'ble BHC, the Bank, the RBI and the Central Government have filed separate Special Leave Petition(s) ('SLPs') before the Hon'ble Supreme Court challenging the Judgement of the Hon'ble BHC. On March 3, 2023, the Hon'ble Supreme Court issued notice and extended the stay granted by the Hon'ble BHC, subject to the final orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The SLPs are pending hearing.\n\nGiven that the write down of the AT-1 Bonds was in accordance with the relevant regulations and as RBI and Central Government ('relevant authorities' in terms of the RBI Master Circular) have also filed SLPs challenging the Judgement of Hon'ble BHC, the Bank has estimated that there should not be any material financial impact of the matter under litigation.",

        "page_content": "## Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2024\n\n## Qualitative disclosures:\n\n- a) Purpose: The Bank uses Derivatives including Forwards & swaps for various purposes including hedging its currency and interest rate risk in its balance sheet, customer offerings and proprietary trading. The management of these products  and  businesses  is  governed  by  Market  Risk  Policy,  Investment  Policy,  Derivatives  Policy,  Derivatives Appropriateness Policy, Hedging Policy and Asset Liability Management (ALM) policy.\n- b) Structure: The Board of Directors of the Bank have constituted a Board level sub-committee, the Risk Management Committee ('RMC') and delegated to it all functions and responsibilities relating to the risk management policy of the Bank and its supervision thereof.\n- c) As part of prudent business and risk management practice, the Bank has also instituted a comprehensive limit and control structure encompassing Value-at-Risk (VAR), Sensitivity, Greeks, Stop loss & credit limits for derivative transactions including suitability and appropriateness framework. The Bank has an internal reporting mechanism providing regular reports to the RMC as well as to the management of the Bank. Such a structure helps the Bank to monitor and mitigate market risk across FX and interest rates.\n- d) The  Bank  has  an  independent  Middle  Office  and  Market  Risk  functions,  which  are  responsible  for  monitoring, measurement, and analysis of derivative related risks, among others. The Bank has a Credit Risk Management unit which is responsible for setting up counterparty limits and also a treasury operation unit which is responsible for managing operational aspects of derivatives including settlement of transactions. The Bank is subject to a concurrent audit  for  all  treasury  transactions,  including  derivatives  transactions,  a  monthly  report  of  which  is  periodically submitted to the Audit & Compliance Committee of the Bank.\n- e) In addition to the above, the Bank independently evaluates the potential credit exposure on account of all derivative transactions, wherein risk limits are specified separately for each product, in terms of both credit exposure and tenor. As mandated by the Credit Policy of the Bank, the Bank has instituted an approval structure for all treasury/ derivative  related  credit  exposures.  Wherever  necessary,  appropriate  credit  covenants  are  stipulated  as  trigger events to call for collaterals or terminate transaction and contain the risks.\n- f) The Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts has been notified by the RBI through circular dated March 30, 2021. The Bank has computed capital adequacy as well as exposure on account of these contracts as per Current Exposure method considering each transaction as separate netting set on conservative basis. The Bank shall work progressively over the period on classification of multiple permissible transactions into a netting set which may result in reduction in capital requirement and exposure due to these transactions. There is no change in Current Exposure Method (CEM) computation for Non-Bilateral Counterparties & Quasi Central Counter Party (QCCP) trades.\n- g) The Bank reports all trading positions to the management on a daily basis. The Bank revalues its trading position on a daily basis for Management and Information System ('MIS') and control purposes and records the same in the books of accounts on a monthly basis.\n- h) For derivative contracts in the banking book designated as hedge, the Bank documents at the inception of the relationship  between  the  hedging  instrument  and  the  underlying  exposure,  the  risk  management  objective  for undertaking the hedge and the ALCO monitors all outstanding hedges on a periodical basis. Further the Bank's 'Hedging Policy' has stipulated conditions to ensure that the Hedges entered into are effective.",

The gross value of exposures transferred to JC Flowers ARC was ' 437,157.89 million which included exposures worth ' 151,980.93 million earlier written-off by the Bank. The net book value ('NBV') of these exposures in the Bank's books as on the date of assignment was ' 49,817.57 million and the final consideration received was ' 80,458.68 million under 15:85 cash and security receipts structure.\n\nFor stressed loans transferred to ARC for a consideration lower than the NBV at the time of transfer, the shortfall of ' 6,086.09 million to the Bank was debited to the Profit and Loss Account during the year ended March 31, 2023 spread equally over the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The realized profit amounting to ' 5,113.81 million where the cash recovery was exceeding the net book value of stressed loans was credited to Profit and Loss Account in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For stressed loans where the consideration received was higher than that net book value at the time of transfer and the cash recovery is lower than the net book value, such excess amount of ' 31,613.38 million was not reversed in the Profit and Loss Account. The Bank has continued to carry forward the same as provision against these security receipts. In effect the Bank has reflected such sale in a manner that the value of security receipts is not higher than the net book value of the loans transferred to JC Flowers ARC. The same is being assessed for the provisioning requirements as per the extant RBI guidelines on each reporting date also taking into account the principle that there should be no provisioning arbitrage between the provisioning on Security Receipts vis-\u00e0-vis the provisioning requirements on the underlying exposure, had it stayed in the books.",

The Bank has adopted the fair value method based on Black- Scholes Pricing Model, for pricing and accounting of options. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the grant date and is recognised under employee cost over the vesting period. As a result, 'Employees cost' for the year ended March 31, 2024 is ' 312.56 million (Previous year: ' 216.26 million). The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended March 31, 2024 was ' 4.07 per option (Previous year: ' 3.73 per option).\n\nIf the Bank had adopted the Fair Value for all the options granted till March 31, 2021, the net profit after tax would have been lower by ' 220.82 million (Previous year: lower by ' 229.19 million). The basic earnings per share would have been ' 0.43 per share (Previous year: ' 0.27 per share) instead of ' 0.44 per share (Previous year: ' 0.27 per share) and diluted earnings per share would have been ' 0.42 per share (Previous year: ' 0.26 per share) per share instead of ' 0.43 per share (Previous year: ' 0.27 per share) due to the impact of the aforesaid mentioned difference between the Intrinsic Value of the Options and the Fair Value of the Options.\n\nThe following inputs and assumptions have been used for computation of the fair value based on method of BlackScholes Pricing Model for the options granted during the year:\n\n| Inputs                  | For the year ended  March 31, 2024   | For the year ended  March 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Risk free interest rate | 7.04%-7.42%                          | 6.53%-7.57%                          |\n| Expected life           | 1.5 yrs-7.5 yrs                      | 1.5 yrs-7.5 yrs                      |\n| Expected volatility     | 24.61%-47.07%                        | 24.18%-49.38%                        |\n| Expected dividend yield | 1.10%                                | 1.10%                                |\n\nRisk free interest rates over the expected life of the option are based on yield of the government securities in effect at the time of the grant. The expected life of an option is estimated based on the vesting period plus expected exercise period after vesting based on exercise behaviour of the employees who receive the option. Expected exercise behaviour is estimated based on the historical stock option exercise pattern of the Bank. Expected volatility during the estimated expected life of the option is based on historical volatility determined based on observed market prices of the Bank's publicly traded equity shares. Expected dividend yield during the estimated expected life of the option are based on industry average.\n\n## Other Disclosures\n\n## 17.5.57 Disclosure on Remuneration\n\n- (a) Composition of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (N&RC) of the Bank as on March 31, 2024 is as follows:\n\n| Ms. Nandita Gurjar          | Independent Director (Chairperson)                        |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mr. Atul Malik              | Independent Director                                      |\n| Ms. Rekha Murthy            | Independent Director                                      |\n| Mr. Rama Subramaniam Gandhi | Independent Director (Part-time Chairperson of the Board) |\n| Mr. Sandeep Tewari          | Nominee Director (of SBI)                                 |\n| Ms. Shweta Jalan            | Non-Executive Non-Independent Director                    |",

There is a direct correlation between the quantum of Variable Pay payout and level of risk exposure and level and role of an employee in the organisation.\n- 4. To assess and incorporate the future risk, deferral arrangements have been incorporated for the payout of Variable Pay,  where  a  certain  proportion  of  Variable  Pay  (Cash  and  Non-Cash)  is  deferred  over  a  period  of  time  for  the Senior Executives of the Bank. The Bank assesses through the Business Unit Head/ Risk/ Compliance/ Audit/ Finance function for any adverse outcomes in the case of organisational or business unit or individual level prior to the payment of the deferred portion.\n\nIn the event of a negative contribution or adverse outcomes, deferred compensation is subject to appropriate malus/ claw-back arrangements as decided by the Board Remuneration Committee.\n\n- (d) Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance during a performance measurement period with levels of remuneration.\n\nThe  Bank's  performance  management  process  and  compensation  philosophies  are  structured  to  support  the achievement of the Bank's Key Strategic Objectives (KSO) such as Governance Compliance, Liability Generation, Cost Management, Customer Service, Strengthening Systems, Controls & Processes and Human Capital Development. The Bank has a comprehensive process towards defining measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for MD & CEO/ WTDs/ MRTs, which are set against the financial and non-financial KSOs of the Bank, and the goals framed for the performance year have a linkage with these KSOs. The targets for these are determined at the Bank, Business Unit and Individual level. Achievement of targets is assessed during the Annual Performance Review and the performance assessment outcomes have an impact on the remuneration.",

As per the regulatory guidelines, Banks are required to maintain minimum LCR at 100% i.e., maintain HQLA of a minimum 100% for Net Cash Outflows as assessed based on the regulatory guidelines.\n\nThe Bank has implemented robust process to compute and report the LCR in line with regulatory guidelines and is monitored at consolidated level. Further, the Bank also monitors its liquidity requirements in USD.\n\nThe Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz. Retail (which include deposits from individuals), Small  Business  Customers (those with deposits up to ' 7.5  crore)  and  Wholesale  Customers  to  determine  the  cash outflows for LCR. Within Wholesale, deposits on account of Operational activity by the customers through clearing, custody, and  cash  management  services  of  the  Bank  are  classified  as  Operational  Deposits.  Non-Operational  Deposits  from wholesale customers are further segregated within Non-Financial Corporates and Others to compute the corresponding Cash Outflow for LCR. The Bank also includes other contractual funding including a portion of other liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30-day time frame in the cash outflows. These classifications, based on regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank's LCR framework. Expected derivative cash outflows and inflows from outstanding contracts are considered for computation of Net Cash Outflow. The Bank considers the other expected inflows in next 30 days as prescribed in the regulatory guidelines to compute the Net Cash Outflows for LCR.\n\nHQLA maintained by the Bank primarily comprises of cash reserves in excess of required CRR, Government Securities i.e.,  Treasury  Bills,  dated  securities  issued  by  the  Central  &  State  Government along with eligible Corporate Bonds & Commercial Papers that qualify as Level 2 HQLA. Further, securities forming part of HQLA maintained by the Bank is well diversified across various marketable instruments, which shall provide the Bank adequate and timely liquidity to meet the Net Cash Outflow as & when required.\n\nThe Bank endeavors to meet the LCR requirement and adequacy of LCR remains a conscious strategy of the Bank. The Bank has placed stringent threshold as risk appetite for maintenance of LCR to maintain sufficient liquidity and compliance to LCR on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  has  empowered  the  Asset  Liability  Management  Committee  i.e.  ALCO  (Top Management Executive Committee) to monitor and strategize the Balance Sheet profile of the Bank within overall Board approved Strategic and Risk framework. In line with the business strategy, ALCO forms an Interest Rate/Liquidity view for the Bank with the help of the economic analysis. ALCO of the Bank channelizes various business segments of the Bank to target good quality asset and liability profile to achieve an optimal funding mix which is consistent with prudent liquidity, diversity of sources and servicing costs and meet the Bank's profitability as well as Liquidity requirements with the help of robust MIS and Risk Limit architecture of the Bank. BSMG (Balance Sheet Management Group) of the Bank estimates daily liquidity requirement of the various business segments and manages the same on consolidated basis as per ALCO guidance.\n\nThe daily average LCR for the quarter ending March 31, 2024 is 116.96% (for the quarter ending March 31, 2023 was 120.12%), which is well above the prudential requirement of 100%.",

Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was one of the important reform proposed in order to ensure resilience of the Banks over a longer term and stable liabilities to fund their business activities. NSFR was subsequently prescribed by the RBI to enhance resilience of the Indian Banking system.\n\nNSFR  ensures  that  the  Bank  has  sufficient  stable  funding  available  to  fulfill  the  funding  requirements  by  restricting the  reliance  on  unstable  short-term  funding  to  finance  potentially  illiquid  long-term  assets.  NSFR  reduces  long-term refinancing risk over longer-term time horizon (over 1 year) of the Bank by measuring the extent of stable sources of funds with the Bank to fund its long term assets.\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is defined as amount of Available Stable Funding (ASF) to fulfil the amount of Required Stable Funding (RSF).\n\n- Available Stable Funding (ASF) is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over 1 year period. The amount of available stable funding is a function of the source and type of liability along with residual maturities of the various liabilities.\n- Required Stable Funding (RSF) is defined as the funding required for assets and off-balance sheet exposures over 1 year period. The amount of required stable funding is a function of the underlying liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of the various assets.\n\nNSFR was implemented w.e.f. October 01, 2021 by the RBI with stipulation of minimum NSFR maintenance at 100%.\n\nThe Bank has implemented robust process to compute and report the NSFR in line with regulatory guidelines and is monitored at consolidated level. The Bank endeavors to meet the NSFR requirement and adequacy of NSFR remains a conscious strategy of the Bank. The Bank has placed stringent threshold as risk appetite for maintenance of NSFR to maintain sufficient liquidity and compliance to NSFR on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Bank have empowered Asset Liability Management Committee i.e. ALCO (Top Management Executive Committee) to monitor and strategize the Balance Sheet profile of the Bank within overall Board approved Strategic and Risk framework. In line with the business strategy, ALCO forms an Interest Rate/Liquidity view for the Bank with the help of the economic analysis. ALCO of the Bank channelizes various business segments of the Bank to target good quality asset and liability profile to achieve an optimal funding mix which is consistent with prudent liquidity, diversity of sources and servicing costs and meet the Bank's profitability as well as Liquidity requirements with the help of robust MIS and Risk Limit architecture of the Bank. BSMG (Balance Sheet Management Group) of the Bank estimates daily liquidity requirement of the various business segments and manages the same on consolidated basis as per ALCO guidance.\n\nNSFR as at March 31, 2024 is 122.68% (as at March 31, 2023 was 109.95%), which is well above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%.",

Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance  with  SAs  will  always  detect  a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.

A  Bank's internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  consolidated financial statement includes those policies and procedures that\n\n- 1) pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of the Bank;\n- 2) provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made  only  in  accordance  with  authorisations  of management and directors of the Bank; and\n- 3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or  timely  detection  of  unauthorised  acquisition, use, or disposition  of  the  Bank's  assets  that could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Inherent  Limitations  of  Internal  Financial Controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nBecause  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or improper  management  override  of  controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  consolidated financial  statement  may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nOur  aforesaid  reports  under  Section  143(3)(i)  of  the Act  on  the  adequacy  and  operating  effectiveness  of  the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in so far as it relates to one subsidiary company, is based on the corresponding report of the auditor of this company.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## For G.M.

Investments which are intended to be held for more than one year are classified as long-term investments and investments which are intended to be held for less than one year are classified as current investments. Long-term Investments are stated at cost after deducting provision made, if any, for other than temporary diminution in the value. Current Investments are stated at lower of cost and market/ fair value.\n\nPurchase and sale transactions in securities are accounted on settlement date.\n\n## a) Cost of acquisition\n\nCosts such as brokerage pertaining to investments, paid at the time of acquisition and broken period interest are charged to the profit and loss account as per the RBI guidelines.\n\n## b) Basis of classification\n\nSecurities that are held principally for resale within 90 days from the date of purchase are classified under the HFT category. Investments that the Bank intends to hold till maturity are classified under the HTM category, or as per RBI guidelines. Securities which are not classified in the above categories are classified under the AFS category.\n\n## c) Shifting among categories\n\nReclassification of investments from one category to the other, if done, is in accordance with RBI guidelines. Transfer of scrips from AFS / HFT category to HTM category is made at the lower of book value or market value. In the case of transfer of securities from HTM to AFS / HFT category, the investments held under HTM at a discount are transferred to AFS / HFT category at the acquisition price/book value and investments placed in the HTM category at a premium are transferred to AFS/ HFT at the amortized cost.\n\nOn  transfer  from  HTM  to  AFS/HFT  category,  securities  are  immediately  revalued  and  resultant  depreciation,  if any, is provided.\n\nTransfer of investments from AFS to HFT or vice versa (in exceptional circumstances), is done at the book value and  with  the  approval  of  the  Board  of  Directors/  Asset  Liability  Committee  (ALCO)  /Investment  Committee). Depreciation carried, if any, on such investments is also transferred from one category to another.\n\n## d) Valuation\n\nInvestments categorized under AFS and HFT categories are Marked to Market (MTM) on periodical basis as per relevant RBI guidelines. Net depreciation, if any, in the category under the classification mentioned in Schedule 8 ('Investments') is recognised in the profit and loss account. The net appreciation, if any, in the category under each classification is ignored, except to the extent of depreciation previously provided. The book value of individual securities is not changed consequent to periodic valuation of investments.\n\nInvestments  received  in  lieu  of  restructured  advances  scheme  are  valued  in  accordance  with  RBI  guidelines. Any diminution in value on these investments is provided for and is not used to set off against appreciation in respect of other performing securities in that category. Depreciation on equity shares acquired and held by the Bank under restructuring scheme is provided as per RBI guidelines.\n\nInvestments  classified  under  the  HTM  category  are  carried  at  their  acquisition  cost  and  any  premium  over the  face  value,  paid  on  acquisition,  is  amortised  on  a  straight  line  basis  over  the  remaining  period  to  maturity.",

Where  in  the  opinion  of management, a diminution, other than temporary in the value of investments classified under HTM has taken place, suitable  provisions  are  made.  Profit/loss  on  sale  of  investments  in  the  'Held  to  Maturity'  category  is  recognised in the profit and loss account and profit is thereafter appropriated (net of applicable taxes and statutory reserve requirements) to Capital Reserve.\n\nTreasury Bills, Commercial Paper and Certificates of deposit being discounted instruments, are valued at carrying cost.\n\nPTCs purchased for priority sector lending requirements are valued in accordance with RBI guidelines.\n\nThe market/ fair value applied for the purpose of periodical valuation of quoted investments included in the AFS and HFT categories is the market price of the scrip as available from the trades/ quotes on the recognised stock exchanges and for Subsidiary General Ledger ('SGL') account transactions, the prices as periodically declared by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd. (FBIL).\n\nThe market/ fair value of unquoted government securities included in the AFS and HFT category is determined as per the prices published by FBIL. Further, in the case of unquoted bonds, debentures, PTCs (other than priority sector) and preference shares, valuation is carried out by applying an appropriate mark-up (reflecting associated credit risk) over the Yield to Maturity ('YTM') rates of government securities. Such mark up and YTM rates applied are as per the relevant rates published by FIMMDA/FBIL.\n\nThe Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central Government dated securities in accordance with RBI guidelines. The short position is reflected as the amount received on sale which is categorized under HFT category and is netted in the Investment schedule. The short position is marked to market and loss, if any, is charged to the Profit and Loss account while gain, if any, is ignored. Profit / Loss on settlement of the short position is recognised in the Profit and Loss account.\n\nInvestments in unquoted Alternative Investment Funds (AIF)/ Venture Capital Funds (VCF) are categorised, at the discretion of the Bank, under HTM category for an initial period of three years and valued at cost during this period. Such  investments  are  transferred  to  the  AFS  category  after  the  said  period  of  three  years.  Investments  in  AFS category are valued at Net Asset Value (NAV) shown by the AIF/VCF as per the financial statements. The VCF/AIF are valued based on the audited financial statements once in a year. In case the audited financials are not available for a period beyond 18 months, the investments are valued at ' 1 per VCF/AIF.\n\nQuoted equity shares are valued at their closing price on a recognised stock exchange. Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up value if the latest balance sheet is available, else, at ' 1 per company, as per relevant RBI guidelines.\n\nFor stressed loans transferred to Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) where the consideration is lower than the net book value (NBV) at the time of transfer, the shortfall is debited to the Profit and Loss Account and spread equally over the financial year. The realised profit, where the cash recovery exceeds the NBV of the stressed loans, the same is credited to Profit and Loss Account. For stressed loans where the consideration received was higher than the NBV at the time of transfer but the cash recovery is lower than the NBV, such excess amount is not reversed in the Profit and Loss Account and the Bank continues to carry forward the same as provision against the Security Receipts (SRs). In effect, the value of SRs is reflected in a manner that the value of SRs is not higher than the NBV of the loans transferred to ARC. The provisioning requirements is as per the extant RBI guidelines applied on each reporting date, taking into account the principle that there should be no provisioning arbitrage between the provisioning on security receipts vis-\u00e0-vis the provisioning requirements on the underlying stressed loans, had it stayed in the books. SRs/ PTCs which are not redeemed as at the end of resolution period are fully provided in books of accounts.",

The exercise price of the Bank's stock option is the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options.\n\nYSIL measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options using the intrinsic value method. Compensation cost in case of YSIL is measured by the excess, if any, of the fair value of underlying YSIL shares as on issue date over the exercise price.

The Bank has adopted the fair value method based on Black- Scholes Pricing Model, for pricing and accounting of options. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the grant date and is recognised under employee cost over the vesting period. As a result, 'Employees cost' for the year ended March 31, 2024 is ' 312.56 million (Previous year: ' 216.26 million). The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended March 31, 2024 was ' 4.07 per option (Previous year: ' 3.73 per option).\n\nIf the Bank had adopted the Fair Value for all the options granted till March 31, 2021, the net profit after tax would have been lower by ' 220.82 million (Previous year: lower by ' 229.19 million). The basic earnings per share would have been ' 0.43 per share (Previous year: ' 0.27 per share) instead of ' 0.44 per share (Previous year: ' 0.27 per share) and diluted earnings per share would have been ' 0.42 per share (Previous year: ' 0.26 per share) per share instead of ' 0.43 per share (Previous year: ' 0.27 per share) due to the impact of the aforesaid mentioned difference between the Intrinsic Value of the Options and the Fair Value of the Options.\n\nThe following inputs and assumptions have been used for computation of the fair value based on method of BlackScholes Pricing Model for the options granted during the year:\n\n| Input                   | For the year ended March 31, 2024   | For the year ended March 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Risk free interest rate | 7.04%-7.42%                         | 6.53%-7.57%                         |\n| Expected life           | 1.5 yrs-7.5 yrs                     | 1.5 yrs-7.5 yrs                     |\n| Expected volatility     | 24.61%-47.07%                       | 24.18%-49.38%                       |\n| Expected dividend yield | 1.10%                               | 1.10%                               |\n\nRisk free interest rates over the expected life of the option are based on yield of the government securities in effect at the time of the grant. The expected life of an option is estimated based on the vesting period plus expected exercise period after vesting based on exercise behaviour of the employees who receive the option. Expected exercise behaviour is estimated based on the historical stock option exercise pattern of the Bank. Expected volatility during the estimated expected life of the option is based on historical volatility determined based on observed market prices of the Bank's publicly traded equity shares. Expected dividend yield during the estimated expected life of the option are based on industry average.",

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Bank has not repaid any Tier I or Tier II instruments (Previous Year ' 17,630 million). The Bank has repaid Additional Tier-I capital of ' 2,800.0 million during the year ended March 31, 2024, however the same was not considered for regulatory capital for the year ended March 31, 2023 basis guidance received from RBI.\n\n## Write Down of AT1 Bonds\n\nOn March 5, 2020, Central Government in terms of Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 ('BR Act') imposed moratorium on the Bank. Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') in exercise of its powers conferred under Section 36ACA of the BR Act  superseded  the  then  Board  of  Directors  and  appointed  an  Administrator  to  manage  the  affairs  of  the  Bank w.e.f. March 5, 2020. Subsequently on March 13, 2020, through the 'YES B ANK Limited Reconstruction Scheme, 2020' ('the  YES BANK Reconstruction  Scheme'),  the  relevant  authorities  (i.e.,  Central  Government  in  consultation  with  RBI) decided to 'reconstitute' the Bank. Further, in terms of the Yes BANK Reconstruction Scheme, the Administrator was to continue in office until the Board of Directors mentioned in the YES BANK Reconstruction Scheme assumed office, i.e., on March 26, 2020.\n\nIn light of the above, the Administrator, on behalf of the Bank, consequent to the invocation of Section 45 of the BR Act, and to protect the interest of the Bank and its depositors, was constrained to write down ( ' 84,150 million) two tranches of the Additional Tier 1 Bonds ('AT-1 Bonds') issued in 2016 and 2017, in compliance with the contractual covenants and applicable RBI guidelines, on March 14, 2020.\n\nAggrieved by the said write down of AT-1 Bonds, AT-1 Bondholders filed various writ petition(s), civil  suit(s),  criminal and consumer complaint(s) across India challenging the decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds since 2020. The same are pending adjudication, save and except the batch of writ petition(s) filed before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court and one writ petition before the Hon'ble Madras High Court (as mentioned below).\n\n## Judgment dated September 30, 2020 of the Hon'ble Madras High Court ('MHC'):\n\nThe RBI Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations, in so far as it relates to issuance and write down of AT-1 Bonds, was challenged before the Division Bench of the Hon'ble MHC in the Writ Petition titled Piyush Bokaria Vs. Reserve Bank of India and Ors., (being W.P. (Civil) 12586 of 2020). The Hon'ble MHC vide its judgment dated September 30, 2020 upheld the validity of the RBI Master Circular in relation to the AT-1 Bonds. Additionally, with respect to the aspect of writing down of AT-1 Bonds, the Hon'ble MHC observed that one of the features of AT-1 Bonds is that they can be written-down before the equity shares bear losses and considering that the Petitioners purchased the AT -1 Bonds in the secondary market, they cannot claim to be ignorant of the terms and conditions thereof. The Hon'ble MHC also noted the loss absorbency feature of the AT-1 Bonds and dismissed the Writ Petition.\n\n## Judgment dated January 20, 2023 of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court ('BHC'):\n\nMultiple  writ  petition(s)  were  filed  before  the  Hon'ble  BHC  challenging  the  write  down  of  AT-1  Bonds  and  the  stock exchange intimation dated March 14, 2020 made in relation to the write down. The Hon'ble BHC vide its judgment dated January 20, 2023 set aside the stock exchange intimation and decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds ('Judgment'). At the request of the Bank, the Hon'ble BHC stayed the order for a period of 6 (six) weeks.",

On March 3, 2023, the Hon'ble Supreme Court issued notice and extended the stay granted by the Hon'ble BHC, subject to the final orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The SLPs are pending hearing.\n\nGiven that the write down of the AT-1 Bonds was in accordance with the relevant regulations and as RBI and Central Government ('relevant authorities' in terms of the RBI Master Circular) have also filed SLPs challenging the Judgement of Hon'ble BHC, the Bank has estimated that there should not be any material financial impact of the matter under litigation. Upon final verdict of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, financial impact, if any, on the results and/or other financial information shall be accounted for in future reporting periods. The matter is tentatively scheduled for hearing on May 10, 2024.\n\nSeparately, Securities and Exchange Board of India ('SEBI') issued a Show Cause Notice dated October 28, 2020 to the Bank and other noticee(s) (ex-employees of the Bank) alleging violation of provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. Thereafter, SEBI vide its order dated April 12, 2021 imposed penalty of ' 250 million on the Bank under Section 15 HA of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 for the alleged mis-selling of AT-1 Bonds in the secondary market. SEBI also imposed penalties on other noticee(s). Aggrieved by the above-mentioned SEBI order, the Bank and other noticee(s) preferred separate Appeal(s) before the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai ('SAT'). SAT heard the Appeal(s) and the effect and operation of the SEBI order dated April 12, 2021 has been stayed.
