In essence, assets are built, owned and operated by the Group to achieve /financial returns as well as create various other non/financial values. These  include socio-economic and environmental outcomes as per the Group's Vision, Mission and its sustainability goals which  are  aligned  to  the  United Nations  Sustainable  Development Goals ('SDGs').\n\nThe Group utilises its design and construction capabilities to develop  a  wide  range  of infrastructure assets. These assets are either developed for project owners, in which case Sunway  derives project management  and construction/development  fees  or  developed and later sold for revenues. In many cases, assets are developed to be owned by the Group towards  generating  recurring  income  streams and to ensure the creation of desired strategic value creation outputs and outcomes.\n\nThis approach is exempli/fied in the development and  ownership  of  speci/fic  retail,  healthcare, leisure and hospitality assets, which in turn complement and support the development of the Group's townships. The ownership of these assets sees Sunway also operating these assets towards  ensuring  effective  management  that delivers the desired value creation results, and in ful/filling speci/fic strategic objectives.\n\nIn ensuring the seamless execution of the BOO business  model,  Sunway's  capabilities  are augmented by its access to resources, materials, skills and assets, and synergies provided through the Group's various business divisions.\n\nBy  constantly incorporating the views of stakeholders  into  the  overall  strategy  mix, adopting technology and innovation to deliver increased ef/ficiencies and constantly seeking to provide solutions to emerging and existing challenges,  the  BOO  model  is  continuously revitalised  and  improved  on.  The  model  is designed  to  be  robust,  competitive  and  is premised on the simple focus of 'what value do we create' and 'how can we generate /financial and business returns while serving the society'.\n\n## Support Functions / Enablers\n\n- \u00b7 Landbank acquisition\n- \u00b7 Masterplanning and design\n- \u00b7 Supply chain functions\n- \u00b7 Raw materials\n- \u00b7 Talent and expertise\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating Model\n\nWithin the BOO model, Sunway employs several other sub models, including:\n\n## BUILD TO SELL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway constructs properties and sells the properties for revenue and retains selected assets for recurring income to support a sustainable community/township.\n\nPrimarily involves Sunway's Property Development division, where landbank is developed into townships or standalone developments.\n\n## BUILD FOR OTHERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway designs and builds assets owned by others and the Group collects project management and construction income.\n\nPrimarily undertaken by SunCon, the Group's Construction division. SunCon designs and builds assets for others, but is increasingly also progressing into asset management and ownership.\n\n## BUILD AND MANAGE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway  constructs  assets  owned  by  others  and  postcompletion,  manages  the  said  assets  for  a  stipulated period.\n\nThis approach involves SunCon together with other divisions that undertake asset management and operations, though the asset is not owned by the Group.\n\n## BUILD, OWN, OPERATE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway designs and builds assets that are owned and thereafter managed by the Group.\n\nManagement of these assets are aimed at providing speci/fic services or enabling Sunway to venture and establish its presence in selected industries. Divisions involved include Leisure, Hospitality, Property Investment and REIT and Healthcare.\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR BUSINESS MODEL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!--

It contributes to the overall supply amidst rising demand for affordable, quality housing from a growing middle-income mass segment of Malaysians. These addresses rising prices and ensures that properties remain within the reach of the buying public, which then enables property developers to continue launching properties into the market.\n\nThese features are well re/flected through the thriving township of Sunway City Kuala Lumpur and in the future, Sunway City Iskandar Puteri.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nREVIEW\n\nEXEMPLARY\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR APPROACH TO VALUE CREATION\n\n## A DYNAMIC MARKET DRIVEN MODEL\n\nSunway's BOO business model does not exist in a vacuum and Sunway is cognisant that its ability to create /financial and non-/financial values can be signi/ficantly in/fluenced by a wide range of factors.

This mindset or consciousness have always been a mainstay of the Sunway business philosophy since its inception /five decades ago. It is this approach of linking purpose with pro/fit that continues to drive Sunway onward. The focus on de/fining value beyond /financial metrics and acknowledging the linkages between non-/financial capitals to business and operational results remains pivotal to the Sunway Build, Own, Operate ('BOO') business model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout Sunway's 50-year journey, the Group has been at the forefront of generating, sustaining and enhancing both /financial and non/financial values. This is evident, notably in Sunway's transformation of a derelict tin mining area into a model, urban township, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur. The urban regeneration success story typi/fies the Sunway business philosophy of creating positive values. The township demonstrates the Group's ability to harness business and operational synergies; leveraging the respective core competencies of its business divisions towards successfully undertaking urban renewal on an unparalleled scale and sustaining the vibrance and relevance of the township well into the future.\n\nThe value creation approach conceptualised 50 years ago holds true till today and continued to be reinvented and revitalised through new ideas, technological development, social/market trends and increasingly, focus on environmental impacts and performance.\n\nThe Group measures its performance against the targets set within the 2030 Sustainability Goals to enable the Group to meet stakeholders' expectations and to ensure that the Group make reasonable efforts to mitigate its environmental impacts, empower the people and community, and uphold robust governance practices. The Sustainability Scorecard tracks and reports the Group's progress annually in the Sustainability Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease refer to our Sustainability Report 2023 for more information on the 2030 Sustainability Goals and Sustainability Scorecard of the Group.\n\n## ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## CLIMATE ACTION: NET ZERO BY 2050\n\nThe focus on climate change is indeed driven by the urgency to address the many and adverse impacts of climate change on our physical, our environment and our society.\n\nImpacts such as rising sea water levels, increasing temperatures, drought and /flash /floods continue to be core themes upon which Sunway as a responsible business continues to pay close attention to. The distinction, however, is that Sunway's focus on these and other climate related impacts are not just on how society and the natural environment is affected, but also in terms of the impacts on Sunway's BOO model and the operations of the Group's various business divisions. In short, climate change continues to be regarded from both impact and /financial materiality perspectives.\n\nDriven by this integrated thinking perspective, the drive to reduce carbon emissions as per Sunway's net zero carbon emissions by 2050 Roadmap is not just driven by the desire to realise a greener and cleaner future for posterity, but also in ensuring the business remains resilient, ready and competitive to operate in a new zero carbon business environment going forward.\n\nGiven that climate change is arguably, the world's single most existential macro-trend affecting our planet, the focus on developing (and implementing) a comprehensive and strategic pathway enables a systematic approach to effectively navigate the various risks and opportunities arising from climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The risks posed by water shortage, however, leads to opportunities in driving water ef/ficiency, developing alternative water sources and also how such alternatives can contribute to improvements in terms of the /financial bottom line.\n\nAll relevant business divisions in Sunway have upped their focus towards ensuring operational water security, guided by the Group's Water Management Policy to enhance water security and manage water consumption and disruptions ef/ficiently, reducing use of potable water for non-potable uses where possible and having more than one water source. This includes the development of water consumption scenarios in the event of acute and prolonged disruptions, chronic situations of undersupply or lack of access and more.\n\n## Sources of water\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MUNICIPAL POTABLE WATER\n\nWater  withdrawn  from  municipal  sources are assured of their quality and is compliant with  the  Drinking  Water  Quality  Standards, published by the Ministry of Health (MOH). Air  Selangor,  one  of  our  municipal  water source, regularly monitors the quality of raw and treated water at various sampling points, through  in-house  laboratories  which  have been accredited with ISO 17025 (Laboratory Accreditation) Certification.\n\nWe ensure that we consume water efficiently through:\n\n## Water-saving initiatives\n\nAll business operations within the Group must  actively  participate  in  reducing water  consumption  to  conserve  water. Among the water saving initiatives implemented are installing motion sensor taps  and  waterless  urinals,  conducting regular checking of tap and pipe leakages and  increasing  public  awareness  about water conservation.\n\n## Water Crisis SOP\n\nEvery Sunway-managed property has a water crisis SOP in place to address water  disruptions  effectively.  It  covers emergency  planning  to  mitigate  water disruptions  should  they  occur  during business operating hours.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LAKE WATER\n\n## WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nWater from our treatment plant is treated using a hybrid of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis processes  to  meet  the  quality  standards  of potable drinking water.\n\nThe water treatment plant in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur supplies water to various commercial and residential buildings within the township. The Sunway South Quay lake has been used as a water catchment area since 2019. Our RM18 million water treatment plant converts excess water into potable water and directs it to our buildings as an alternative water source. This has helped us to rely less on municipal water supply and serves as backup water supply during water shortages.\n\n## LANDSCAPING\n\nWe  also  extract  water  from  the  Sunway South Quay lake for the purpose of township landscape watering.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  also  withdraw  water  from  various  alternative sources for non-essential activities that do not require the quality standards of potable drinking water such as landscaping and cleaning. This is to conserve water consumption from the potable water supply.\n\n## RAINWATER HARVESTING\n\nWe  have  installed  rainwater  harvesting  tanks at our properties for activities such as cleaning outdoor areas, maintaining landscapes and flushing toilets.\n\n## GROUNDWATER\n\nIn Sunway Lagoon Theme Park, the groundwater is used for cleaning common walkways and watering the landscape.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINVESTMENT CASE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINTEGRITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ensuring suf/ficient talent in terms of capabilities and expertise as well as manpower requirement is integral for effective execution of the business model.\n\nKey approach to talent management is to attract, develop, motivate  and  retain  the  high-performing  talents  to  build  a sustainable  competitive  advantage  and  drive  performance through integrated people management practices. Prioritising talents has also led to improvements in employee satisfaction and morale, which also contributed to lower attrition and higher employee productivity.\n\nWhile it is acknowledged that there are many other factors in/fluencing turnover, satisfaction and employee related indicators, the continued effort in addressing all aspects of the talent management - recruitment, retention, reward and remuneration,  training  and  development  as  well  as  career pathway development yields signi/ficant positives for Sunway. The comprehensive approach to talent has been cascaded and implemented across all business divisions.\n\nReduces Costs and Risk related to Attrition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnhances employee productivity\n\nDelivers far-reaching socio-economic multiplier effects\n\nIn addition, focusing on talent enables Sunway to realise or contribute to many of its social aspirations. Providing employment enables job security and raises the income levels of families, thus elevating quality of life and providing access to better healthcare, education, lifestyle and more.\n\nA signi/ficant number of jobs in Sunway are highly-skilled, high-paying jobs, which supports the employment of local knowledge workers and professionals. The Group's investment is typi/fied in its total spend on human capital, with the increasing spend on training re/flecting the strong prioritisation of talent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrioritising Talent Management\n\nRetains company knowledge and experience and intellectual capital\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nREVIEW\n\nEXEMPLARY\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HARNESSING COLLABORATION TO ENHANCE OUR VALUE CHAIN\n\nAs Sunway continues to focus on its own operations, the Group increasingly looks to expand its efforts towards downstream and upstream stakeholders. Upstream stakeholders typically comprise supply chains, while downstream mainly comprises customers, clients and other end product/service users.\n\n## The strategic thinking of stakeholders' inclusion in the value creation journey centres on the following considerations:\n\nThe group can play a role in addressing environmental and social impacts occurring outside of its direct operational control, which have a bearing on /financial and business performance. This is essential in achieving most of its value creation goals as well as being successful in respect of decarbonisation, waste management, smart building development, sustainable consumption and more.\n\nEffectively addressing impacts which the Group is indirectly responsible for is vital towards truly achieving net zero carbon, mitigating physical and transition risks associated with climate change and developing greener supply chains.\n\nDeveloping improved insulation from supply chain risks such as non-compliant suppliers which could lead to /fines or penalties to the Group, tarnished reputation and other negative impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarbon  emissions  is  an  example  that demonstrates  the  importance  of  supply chain engagement  and  collaboration. While an organisation can typically address Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, there is the challenge of addressing Scope 3  emissions.  Tracking  Scope  3  can  be challenging  simply  due  to  the  lack  of oversight,  support  and  data  on  supply chains as the bulk of emissions which an organisation is responsible for, mainly emanates from its supply chains.\n\nAt Sunway,  we  have  established  an embodied carbon emissions roadmap to guide us in the declaration of the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) for the Building Materials and Quarry products by 2024. Subsequently, the divisions will prepare the  Environmental  Product  Declaration (EPD) to ensure that its products have minimal negative environmental impacts.\n\nHence, in delivering the fullest impact, the value creation espoused by Sunway unequivocally requires extension to a wide range  of  stakeholders,  principally,  the supply  chain  and  consumers/customers/ clients.\n\nOUR\n\nINVESTMENT CASE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, Sunway's efforts as implemented by its business divisions aside from good governance, is to drive cost and operational bene/fits and to ensure access, availability and affordability of goods and services. A further focus is transitioning to more eco-friendly selection of materials, which also requires customer buy-in and support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Greener, Leaner, Resilient, Future-Ready Supply Chains\n\n## Purchase of Eco-label Products\n\nSunway's  malls  source  toilet  paper exclusively from  Forest Stewardship Council  ('FSC')-managed  forests  and FSC-certi/fied mills. This dedication contributes  to  the  preservation  of  a sustainable cycle, ensuring responsible harvesting and replanting practices that uphold  the  ecological  balance  of  the forests.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainable Construction Materials\n\nIn our journey towards constructing sustainable and green developments, buildings and  townships,  we  integrate sustainable construction materials into our developments. Sustainable buildings are the future of construction, as they have minimal environmental  impact  and  lower  cost  of building operations.\n\nWe use alternative materials  that  are environmentally friendly, such  as recyclable raw materials, which also reduce the\n\n## 100%\n\nprojects use green and/or recycled materials in ongoing developments\n\ncarbon footprint of material sourcing and ensuring the durability of the materials.\n\nCerti/fied green building products have also been  selected  when  choosing  materials and /fittings for development. These include waterproo/fing, skim coating, timber /flooring and  the  materials  used  for  the  ceiling, tiles, paints, pavers and others. The usage of these materials vary with the different developments.\n\n## Sustainable Products\n\nWithin  our  Building  Materials  division, we  integrate  an  innovative  selection  of environmentally conscious products that adhere  to  eco-friendly  label  standards, such as SIRIM ECO 023:2016 and SIRIM ECO 033:2019. All our building materials strictly adhere to the speci/fications outlined in MS1380,  MS1314  and MS1601.\n\nFurthermore, our operational sites for the Building Materials division have earned ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certi/fications, underscoring our commitment to delivering products, services and systems of exceptional quality, safety and ef/ficiency.\n\nOur eco-friendly offerings include Environmental Pavers, which is recognised as a MyHIJAU green-certi/fied product in Malaysia. It holds the prestigious Green Label  certi/ficate  in  Singapore.  Another noteworthy product is NeuPave, a waterpermeable  paver  designed  to  mitigate /flooding, encourage groundwater recharge, and prevent soil erosion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability Collaboration Alliance Network (SCAN) is a /five-way partnership linked up with United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development at Sunway University (JSC), Malaysia Retail Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA).\n\nSCAN  is  the  /first  alliance  network in Malaysia to solely focus on sustainability in the retail industry. Its aim  is  to  encourage  environmentally responsible practices while nurturing a thriving business community.\n\nWith the essential stakeholders of mall operators, retailers and sustainability experts under SCAN, a 3-tier learning programme,  known  as  ReX  (Retail Extended Learning) has been curated to  bring  sustainability  awareness  to stakeholders within the retail industry.\n\nThe launch of the Green Lease Partnership Programme by Sunway REIT in 2022 marked a new approach in involving and rewarding tenants for participating in the journey towards practicing more sustainable business practices. The onset of Green Lease Partnership Programme, essentially mandates tenants to adhere to, or achieve mutually agreed ESG performance goals, which then entitles them to speci/fic bene/fits.\n\nTo Sunway, the bene/fits include reduced environmental footprint that brings the Group closer to realising its net zero carbon goal, the progressive transformation of more assets into green assets (which then enables the Group to leverage green /financing and various other business advantages) and achieve reduced energy and other costs, including resource consumption and maintenance costs.\n\nThis re/flects the pertinence of working closely with our tenants through collaborations and partnerships to minimise our environmental footprint and adopt responsible resource management, as we advance towards net zero.\n\nThe Retail and Commercial segments and the Hospitality division actively participate  in  the  programme  to promote  adoption  of  international best practices in sustainability. It is just  one  example  of  how Sunway leverages social capital i.e. stakeholder engagement to continue creating  value  and  to  accelerate progress on its path to net zero.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The role of technology grows in pervasiveness as technology serves in enhancing the effectiveness of existing strategies and enabling new strategic approaches. Technology combined with facilitative mechanisms such as skilled human capital, supportive systems and infrastructure and budgetary allocations can provide signi/ficant shifts in value creation across all capitals.\n\nTechnology is not without its drawbacks as wrong selection of technology or ineffective implementation could lead to values being eroded or inability to achieve the desired outcomes. Nevertheless, technology retains its signi/ficant potential bene/fits to the business model. Sunway continues to adopt necessary mitigation measures to pare down risks while leveraging the immense potential that arti/ficial intelligence ('AI'), Big Data Analytics ('BDA'), Internet of Things, Federated Learning, Blockchain and digitalisation brings to all business divisions.\n\n## DIGITALISING OUR VALUE (SUPPLY) CHAIN\n\nDigitalisation of the supply chain enables improved traceability, allowing Sunway to track the point of origination of products/ services. This eventually promotes better understanding of related Scope 3 emissions and embodied carbon of products and services and the ability to ascertain the sustainability credentials of sourced products and services.\n\nDigitalisation automates data collection and disclosures, provides clear internal processes and controls, and creates a transparent information environment. From this, a wide range of insights and strategic information can be accessed to support more informed and strategic decision making.\n\nDigitalisation enables more real-time collection of information as well as communication. The system fosters closer interaction and collaboration between suppliers and Sunway, and with the greater emphasis on traceability and compliance, encourages the supply chain to also rethink their business approaches.\n\n## e-Procurement\n\nSunway's e-procurement system streamlines the electronic processing of all procurementrelated approvals and documents encompassing purchase requisitions (PR), purchase orders (PO), and goods received.\n\nAdditionally, the system features e-catalogues for Sunway users, facilitating the electronic purchase of items. It supports pre-negotiated pricing, thereby minimising the  time  required  for  users  to  locate frequently  purchased  items.  This  enables different business divisions to collectively leverage the advantages of volume purchases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## e-Invoicing\n\nSince  2015,  Sunway  has  transformed  the manual  process  of  supplier  paper  invoice handling into an automated and paperless accounts  payable  (AP)  process  solution. Further enhancement and revolutionary change was introduced in 2019 when Robotics Process  Automation  was  embedded  in  the automated AP process. As such, we now have a fully automated AP solution that integrates Sunway's enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems,  enabling  straightforward  supplier invoicing and payment processing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## e-Applications\n\nOur organisation established e-Applications to shift from conventional /filing system to online platforms. This not only cut down on rented space, but also increased productivity through seamless /file retrieval systems as well as reduce the usage of paper.\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OPTIMISING INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ACCELERATE GROWTH\n\n## PIONEERING A DIGITALISED APPROACH TO HEALTHCARE\n\nWhile technology is pervasive in the /field of healthcare, one distinctive  approach  adopted  by  Sunway  Healthcare  is  the promotion of health screening packages online. On Sunway Medical Centre Velocity's webpage, the hospital offers health screening packages which customers can select their desired health screening packages, make an appointment and have options to make payment immediately or to pay after they've been examined.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore than 2,200 health screening packages were sold in 2023, amounting to total sales of approximately RM2 million.\n\n## REDESIGNING THE PROPERTY PURCHASE EXPERIENCE\n\nFrom virtual showrooms, digital marketing, electronic documentation  and  virtual  property  handovers  as  well  as submission  of  defects  and  various  aspects  of  property management,  technology  continues  to  reshape  the  property purchase  process  for  both  developers  and  buyers.  The development is novel as it debunks perception that traditional brick and mortar processes such as buying properties cannot be successfully digitalised.\n\nDigitalisation reduces various costs associated with the property sales and purchase process. It enables swifter response, even customised approaches, while reducing the need for various hard copy documentation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on the Group's supply chain digitalisation initiatives are provided in Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUNWAY SUPER APP - A LIFESTYLE COMPANION\n\nSunway  Super  App  is  a  loyalty  programme  that  rewards customers with loyalty points and other special privileges on all spending from our participating merchants and selected Sunway businesses. Customers can enjoy privileges and redeem loyalty points at over 1,000 merchants at Sunway's malls, theme parks, medical centres, properties, and other Sunway businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The outdoor educational membership programme with Flexi Classes and Classes Alive for children aged 5-12 years, endorsed by the Education Ministry, was developed to inculcate not just a strong sense of environmental consciousness, but to also provide children with the knowledge to become future pioneers, trailblazers and to ultimately take on the mantle in charting a more sustainable path for the country and the world.\n\nSince 2022, weekly educational wildlife classes are held at both theme parks' locations: Sunway Lagoon at Sunway City Kuala Lumpur and Sunway Lost World of Tambun at Sunway City Ipoh. The programme had garnered over 500 active members and was renewed for another year in 2023 (Explorer Rangers 2.0).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CREATING VALUE THROUGH NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES\n\n## DEVELOPMENT OF HOMEGROWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nAs the present operating environment necessitates/encourages rethinking of conventional business models and operational activities, it inevitably promotes the development of new business ideas and techniques.\n\nNotably, through the implementation of new technologies such as AI, BDA, Internet of Things, Federated Learning, Blockchain and more, it is highly feasible to envision and realise paradigm shifts in businesses.\n\nSuch innovation can become the intellectual property of Sunway. To evolve from a follower into a technological creator and leader, investing into intellectual capitals is necessary, especially in maintaining a competitive edge in a globalised, competitive world.\n\nBeyond just existing processes, technology will be used to develop new business and create new business possibilities which includes enhancing the thriving township concept. The utilisation of technology offers several advantages, but also carries inherent risks and may require substantial upfront investments and recurring costs.\n\n## REDEFINING AGED LIVING THROUGH SUNWAY SANCTUARY\n\nIn June 2023, Sunway Healthcare proudly launched Sunway Sanctuary, its /flagship integrated senior living community in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, marking a ground-breaking milestone in aged care and living. Situated adjacent to Sunway Medical Centre Sunway City, Sunway Sanctuary stands as Malaysia's pioneering facility, seamlessly integrating healthcare and senior living to rede/fine standards in elderly care. Sunway Sanctuary provides elegant living lifestyle for seniors with thoughtful facilities, holistic wellness and curated experiences to cater to the needs of today's af/fluent senior population.\n\nAs Malaysia's aged population grows, there is an increasing requirement for quality care facilities supported by suf/ficient, trained aged care professionals, which Malaysia presently continued to lack. Hence, the launch of Sunway Sanctuary is designed to meet the needs of an increasing ageing society, while creating new revenue streams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 A heated, saltwater in/finity pool with panoramic views of the cityscape at Sunway Sanctuary\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

One of these is the emerging potentials of the Group's Healthcare division, Sunway Healthcare Group ('Sunway Healthcare' or 'SHG').\n\nA  con/fluence  of  socio-demographic  factors,  the  rapid  recovery  in  post pandemic medical tourism and growing societal awareness on the importance of healthcare to longevity and wellbeing have provided a signi/ficant impetus in the continued growth of the domestic and regional healthcare industry. SHG, given its long-standing and inherent positioning as a trusted healthcare provider is well poised to leverage the many opportunities coming to the fore for healthcare players.\n\nSHG's strategy is to leverage on a hub and spoke approach to optimise opportunities towards further penetrating existing and new markets, both locally  and  abroad,  driving  patient  acquisition  and  expanding  market presence. Beyond rapidly building new hospitals in new locations, the focus is on emphasising the quality of healthcare, developing suf/ficient talents to support growth plans and establishing clear brand leadership amidst a competitive marketspace.\n\nCapitalising on existing synergies within the Sunway Group further enhances SHG's capability to develop medical tourism and wellness offerings by working with the Leisure and Hospitality divisions, as well as working with the Property Development and Construction divisions to plan and develop new hospitals and other healthcare facilities.\n\nFactors contributing to growth in the domestic and regional healthcare industry\n\n## Ageing society, ageing nation\n\nIncreasing elderly population drives increased demand for high quality healthcare.\n\n## Rising af/fluence and changing lifestyle preferences\n\nGrowing disposal incomes among certain societal segments, sees shift to increased emphasis of quality living and wellbeing, with healthcare being a key aspect of quality living.\n\n## Shift to private sector healthcare over government provided services\n\nIncreasing number of Malaysians opting for private healthcare providers.\n\n## Strong growth in medical tourism sector\n\nPost pandemic, Malaysia sees a return of healthcare travellers to the country due to its affordable costs, excellent medical and facilitating  infrastructure  and  high-calibre  doctors  and  other medical professionals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DEVELOPING NEW ENGINES OF GROWTH: REVITALISING THE BOO MODEL\n\nThe hub and spoke business model address the entire healthcare ecosystem. The model leverages on the proven expertise, track record and capabilities of SMC Sunway City, which then enables the development of additional hospitals/medical facilities to bring the value proposition to new markets. This fuels customer acquisition, geographical expansion and brand exposure and development. SMC Sunway City is the nexus at the core of the hub and spoke model. The best practices and methodologies of the hospital serves as the solid bedrock upon which SHG would replicate in other hospitals, albeit with localised differences based on the requirements of the respective local communities.\n\nThe development of hospitals and specialist centres are aimed at providing a wide range of medical services and care, with each hospital within the network leveraging off the strengths of each other.\n\nThe hub and spoke business model delivers the following bene/fits:\n\n- \u221a Generate cross-referrals from network hospitals to boost utilisation and drive complex tertiary and quaternary care patients to SMC Sunway City.\n- \u221a Increase patient volumes from the network to attract top doctors.\n- \u221a Enhance synergies within the network through centralised operations.\n- \u221a Appeals to insurance companies and corporate payors with its nationwide network.\n\nSHG has also focused on other healthcare niche sectors including ambulatory care centres (ACCs), home healthcare, fertility centres, senior living and alternative medical treatment options such as Traditional and Complementary Medicine. Besides that, SHG is poised to tap into the growing healthcare tourism sector which has regained its momentum post pandemic. Malaysia's relatively affordable prices, infrastructure, quality of medical professionals and other facilitating factors continue to enable the country to emerge as a preferred destination for regional healthcare travellers.\n\n## UNLOCKING SHARED VALUE\n\nOne of the key aspects of Sunway's BOO model is the unlocking of value, creating shared wealth creation for stakeholders and this is evident in the strong growth story of SHG. A model well proven with SunCon and Sunway REIT is the possibility of progressing to an initial public offering ('IPO') for SHG, which would enable both institutional and retail investors to bene/fit from the Healthcare division's growth story.\n\nBeyond serving as an exit or pro/fit taking strategy, a prospective IPO as evident with SunCon and Sunway REIT drives the next phase of growth for SHG. It would strengthen corporate governance, improve risk management including internal processes and procedures and support a strong ESG agenda within the division. It would also promote sharing of knowledge, technology and intellectual capitals brought in by institutional investors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FAST TURNAROUND OF NEW HOSPITALS\n\nPlease see page 35 and pages 88 to 91 for the Strategic Snapshot and detailed discussion on the Healthcare division respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSunway City Kuala Lumpur Phase 1: 616 beds (Tower A, B and C) Phase 2: 242 beds (Tower D and E) Phase 3: 223 beds (Tower F)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCheras, Kuala Lumpur Phase 1: 240 beds (Opened) Phase 2: 149 beds (2024)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDamansara, Selangor 334 beds (Q4 2024)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIpoh, Perak 258 beds (Q1 2025)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSeberang Jaya, Penang Phase 1: 180 beds (Opened) Phase 2: 153 beds (Opening 2024)Paya Terubong, Penang 120 beds (Q2 2029*)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKota Bharu, Kelantan 199 beds (Q4 2027*)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIskandar Puteri, Johor 300 beds (Q2 2028*)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* estimated timeline\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Beyond conventional brick and mortar development, the construction industry is transitioning towards more sustainable development, not just in terms of methodologies but in the design and development of buildings and infrastructure itself.\n\nSunCon continues to leverage its growing expertise in this niche but fast expanding sector to grow its order book in delivering sustainable buildings for a more sustainable landscape.\n\nHence, SunCon's increased participation in providing EPCC scope of works for developing green buildings and greener infrastructure such as district cooling systems, thermal energy storage, green data centres and more. These projects have a lower environmental and carbon footprint whilst generating revenues for the business division. Construction of the District Cooling System in Sunway Square, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, commenced in July 2022 and is on track for completion by the end of 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Data centre construction at Sedenak Tech Park, Johor\n\n## OVERSEAS EXPANSION\n\nSunway maintains an expansionary stance with regard to its business model. The Group looks to further grow its geographical footprint into new markets, bringing its value creation approach towards more stakeholders while contributing to the realisation of a brighter and better future.\n\nExpansion plans are driven by the speci/fic business and operational context of the respective business divisions under the Group. Some would leverage on existing presence overseas such as Property Development and Hospitality divisions, while others would be executing a maiden expansion outside of Malaysia.\n\nSpeci/fic expansion plans of individual business divisions are provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis section as well as the Strategic Snapshots of the respective business division.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Indeed, there are trade-offs attributed to the inter-related linkages between different capitals. Hence, at times, the enhancement or creation of value in a particular capital can potentially lead to erosion in another capital.\n\nSunway is cognisant of these intricate relationships and the goal is to develop deeper understanding and insights in terms of the linkages between capitals. The ultimate goal is to achieve value creation, de/fined in outputs and outcomes across all six capitals.

Sunway acquired the 800-acre piece of land with a vision to develop the site into an integrated green, smart, and sustainable township. We rehabilitated the barren land and restored the ecosystem, both physical and social. Today, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur is a vibrant township of more than 200,000 people living, working, playing and studying in a safe, healthy and connected environment.\n\nIn celebrating our 50 th anniversary, Sunway joins a rare category of global companies that have succeeded in marking their golden jubilee. It is a clear indication of our resilience in the face of an ever-changing business environment, and our ability to seize opportunities, overcome challenges, and outpace peers in the business sectors in which we operate. And, we have done so while upholding our commitment to the three-P bottom line of People, Planet and Prosperity.\n\nSunway has grown from strength to strength, anchored by our core values of Integrity, Humility, and Excellence. Our dedication to the people and communities we serve is guided by our /five foundational pillars: People, Sustainability, Business, Community, and Leadership.\n\nThis is underpinned by our /firm belief that no corporations can stand apart from the communities it serves.

The rapid advance of technology, climate change and rising inequality are shaping what some have described as the Age of Disruption.\n\nLet me begin with technology. Ever more powerful computers, sophisticated software and massive data are changing every aspect of our lives and livelihoods. Humanity is struggling to cope with the volume, velocity and variety of information /flows. And now, we have to deal with the potential and threats posed by arti/ficial intelligence. In this context, I /firmly believe that what brought us here will not be enough to take us to where we want to be in the decades ahead.\n\nTowards this end, Sunway has established a Transformation Of/fice within  the  Group  Strategy  Department,  to  map  the  strategic direction and growth trajectory of the Group to help us overcome the challenges we face moving forward. The Transformation Of/fice is headed by Mr. Evan Cheah, who also serves as the Group Chief Executive Of/ficer - Digital and Strategic Investments as well as Alternate Director to the Chairman in Sunway Berhad's Board. The young leadership and team members of the Transformation Of/fice is an acknowledgement that Sunway's future lies in the hands of digital natives rather than digital immigrants.\n\nAt Sunway, we invest in our people. We are committed to fostering, nurturing and developing their potential to /flourish in a culture that promotes meritocracy, diversity, and inclusivity. Let me emphasise that this element of diversity is not just about race, religion, gender, or nationality, but even more important, is inspiring a diversity of perspectives.\n\n## Amplifying Our Sustainability Impact\n\nThe very founding of Sunway Group is based on the concept of  sustainable  development.  We  have  fully  embraced  the  17 Sustainable Development Goals ('SDGs') adopted unanimously by the United Nations in 2015. Sunway has integrated the 17 SDGs in all our business practices and decision-making processes. Sunway aligns the SDGs with our Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG') targets as part of our corporate strategy toward driving the Group's long-term success and deepening our commitment to nation-building. Sunway has set a goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nTo  demonstrate  that  we  walk  the  talk,  Sunway  is  the  /first organisation in Malaysia and among the /first in Asia to implement an internal carbon pricing framework. Starting 2023, business\n\n## CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Launch of Sunway's Golden Jubilee celebrations at Sunway Pyramid Mall\n\n## Building a Shared Future Together\n\nEven as Sunway transforms to meet the challenges of the years ahead, our core values of Integrity, Humility and Excellence and our commitment to sustainability will remain constant. These core values and commitment re/flect my own belief that every individual must have a higher purpose in life. This aspirational nature of the Group also serves to attract top talents from the current generation who overwhelmingly seek to join a corporation that goes beyond a focus on the bottom line and commits to a sense of purpose.\n\nAs many of you are aware, my personal motto is 'I aspire to inspire before I expire'.\n\nI hope that what we are achieving here in Sunway will inspire other corporations and organisations in the region to adopt and advance the sustainability agenda. To reiterate, we can all 'do well by doing good'.\n\n## Appreciation and Acknowledgements\n\nOver the past 50 years, I feel very blessed to have the bene/fit of working with a dedicated and competent team, as well as passionate and like-minded partners throughout this journey. Our people are the core of our success. To my Sunway family, your dedication, hard work, and passion have propelled the Group to where it is today.\n\ndivisions that fail to meet the decarbonisation targets are penalised by having an amount deducted from their bonus pool. This year, we are intensifying our decarbonisation commitment by introducing incentives for renewable energy generation and waste diversion from land/fills. Business divisions that achieve their carbon avoidance targets will be rewarded with a pre-determined amount added to their bonus pool.\n\nOur unwavering commitment to higher level of disclosures and transparency has earned us commendable ESG ratings. Sunway maintained its ranking in the top 10% of the Industry Classi/fication Benchmark (Real Estate) Supersector by FTSE Russell and the top 2% globally with 'Negligible' ESG Risk by Sustainalytics, re/flecting Sunway's low-risk exposure.\n\nGiven the threat posed by climate change to the survival of humanity, Sunway is committed to achieving green certi/fication for the development of all new buildings and townships from 2025 onwards.  Recognising  the  signi/ficance  of  Scope  3  emissions, particularly embodied carbon, Sunway established an embodied carbon emissions roadmap for its Building Materials and Quarry divisions, quantifying the carbon footprint of all products in 2023. Sunway aims to progress towards obtaining an Environmental Product  Declaration  ('EPD')  for  these  products  by  2025, underscoring our commitment to transparency and environmental responsibility.\n\n## 2023 KEY HIGHLIGHTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTAN SRI SIR DR.

The start of FY 2023 was marked by concerns over a potential slowdown in global economic growth, fear of recession, and escalating geopolitical tensions. Nevertheless, the reopening of China's economy delivered an uplift to global marketplace dynamics. As the year progressed into its second half, the global economic outlook improved due to easing in/flation rates and more favourable labour market conditions.\n\nNavigating through these challenges, the Malaysian economy expanded by 3.7% in 2023. The Bank Negara Malaysia's ('BNM') conscientious monetary policy tightening effectively mitigated in/flationary pressures, with headline in/flation peaked at 4.7% in August 2022 and subsequently eased to 1.5% by December 2023. In response to the waning in/flation, BNM paused its monetary policy tightening at 3.00% since May 2023, a move that continues to bolster Malaysia's economic growth.\n\nThe  Group  achieved  a  record-high  revenue  since  Sunway's  merger  and  listing in 2011. Speci/fically, the Group's revenue climbed by 17% to RM6.1 billion in FY 2023, breaching the RM6 billion threshold for the /first time, driven by increased revenue from all core business segments. Similarly, pro/fit before tax ('PBT') rose by 9%, from RM909.2 million in the previous /financial year to RM993.3 million in FY 2023.\n\n## Supercharging Growth in the Southern Region\n\nThe operating landscape for the Property Development division was mixed in FY 2023, in/fluenced by the monetary tightening policy, and various measures within the property sectors in Malaysia, Singapore, and China. In Malaysia, the residential property market demonstrated an overall improvement in 2023, with the volume of residential property overhang dropping to its lowest since 2019 despite a higher number of new residential property launches.\n\nThe Property Development division recorded higher launches and property sales in FY 2023. New property launches in FY 2023 more than tripled, from RM1.0 billion in FY 2022 to RM4.4 billion. Compared to FY 2022, property sales grew by 20% to RM2.4 billion in FY 2023, bolstered by increased sales and progress billings from new and existing local property projects.\n\nThe Southern region of Peninsular Malaysia became a property market hotspot following the announcement of the government-led catalytic special economic zone between Johor and Singapore ('JS-SEZ'). The JS-SEZ is formulated to enhance bilateral economic ties and improve connectivity between the two countries while facilitating smoother movement of people and goods across the border. With the anticipated opening of the Rapid Transit System Link ('RTS') in 2026, which is capable of handling 10,000 passengers per hour, it will signi/ficantly reduce congestion on the Johor-Singapore causeway and the Second Link.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The project is named after Johor's geographic coordinates at a longitude of 103 east of the prime meridian and is the /first fully carbon-neutral logistics facility within SCIP's Free Commercial Zone. With a GDV of RM8 billion, Equalbase Sunway 103\u00b0 marks Sunway's maiden foray into sustainable logistics development in the Southern region of Malaysia. Sunway is excited by this opportunity to establish SCIP as the Group's crown jewel of Malaysia's southern development corridor. Equalbase Sunway 103\u00b0, which spans over 55 hectares, is poised to enhance the vibrancy of SCIP's integrated township ecosystem and can potentially generate at least 13,000 job opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Equalbase Sunway 103\u00b0 Groundbreaking Ceremony at Sunway City Iskandar Puteri\n\n## A Blue-Chip Multidisciplinary Healthcare Group\n\nThe Group's healthcare division, Sunway Healthcare Group ('SHG'), continued to solidify its position as a leading integrated private healthcare group in Malaysia. Its three operating hospitals performed well in FY 2023, underpinned primarily by the strong demand for quality healthcare services. Hence, SHG has ramped up its hospital expansion efforts for these hospitals to better serve the market, and to extend its reach to international patients through medical tourism. SHG has also worked to deepen the Group's healthcare offerings, launching Malaysia's /first dedicated paediatric Accident and Emergency ('A&E') Department at the new tower of Sunway Medical Centre, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur ('SMC SCKL') and Sunway Sanctuary, an integrated senior living community in SCKL in FY 2023.\n\nIn the Northern region, Sunway Medical Centre Penang ('SMC Penang') demonstrated remarkable performance in its maiden year of operations. The hospital opened its doors in November 2022. In the third month of operations, SMC Penang achieved breakeven of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ('EBITDA'). Within one year of operations, SMC Penang achieved PBT breakeven in November 2023. This record is a testament to the effectiveness of SHG's strategy in operating new hospitals and its fast-tracked route to achieving pro/fitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Operating EBITDA, excluding one-off accounting gain from derecognition of lease for SMC Tower A & B\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS FOR CONSTRUCTION DIVISION\n\nOrder Book Replenishment\n\nRM2.5 billion\n\n25%\n\nFY 2023 Target: RM2.0 billion\n\nOutstanding Orderbook\n\nRM5.3 billion\n\n(as of 31 December 2023)\n\nINVESTMENT CASE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn tandem with these achievements, SHG has marked several /financial milestones in FY 2023, with revenue soaring to RM1.5 billion after surpassing the RM1 billion mark in the previous year. This represents the third consecutive year of an over 30% increase in annual revenue for SHG. Similarly, its EBITDA has consistently grew by more than 30% annually in the past three years.\n\nIn another monumental achievement, SMC SCKL has been recognised as among the top 250 hospitals globally in the highly esteemed Newsweek & Statista's World's Best Hospitals 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Sunway Medical Centre, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur\n\n## Pushing New Frontiers in Construction\n\nThe Group continued to pursue opportunities in new areas to achieve long-term sustainable growth to enhance stakeholders' value. Our commitment to continual innovation as a value creation driver is exempli/fied by the Construction division, which has reinforced its standing as a premier vertically integrated construction company in Malaysia by venturing into the advanced technology facilities sector and new geographical markets.\n\nThroughout FY 2023, the Construction division made good progress in expanding its project portfolio in the data centres, global distribution centre warehouses, and renewable energy segments, securing RM677 million worth of such new contracts. Consequently, the Construction division has surpassed its FY 2023 order book replenishment  target  of  RM2.0  billion,  amassing  RM2.5  billion  worth  of  new orders consisting of advanced technology facilities and renewable energy projects, infrastructure projects like the RTS Link, and the Group's internal projects.\n\nOn the international front, the Construction division has substantially completed the Meesurutti-Chidambaram Highway project in India. Additionally, the division intends to deepen its regional footprint in countries like India, Singapore and Vietnam while continuing to explore expansion into new territories.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's Leisure, Hospitality, REIT, Retail, and Healthcare divisions were able to capitalise on the resurgence in tourist arrivals and experienced higher rates of visitation to the Group's theme parks and retail malls, better occupancy rates for the hotels, and increased contributions from medical tourism.\n\n## Delivering Value to Shareholders\n\nIn line with our commitment to deliver value to our esteemed shareholders, the Board declared a total dividend of 5.50 sen per ordinary share for FY 2023, which is on par with the dividend declared in FY 2022. The dividend payout exceeded the Group's dividend payout guidance of 20% of core PATMI. Additionally, the Group declared a preferential dividend of 5.25% per annum based on the issue price of RM1.00 irredeemable convertible preference shares ('ICPS') for the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.\n\nAs a result, Sunway has achieved a total shareholder return of 31% for the /financial year and an impressive 231% since 2011, post merger and listing of Sunway Berhad.\n\nGiven the strong demand for data centres in Malaysia, a slew of new and emerging investments of data centres with over 800MW capacity is projected to come on stream in phases over  the  next  /five  years.  Sunway's  Construction  division, having positioned itself in the high-value construction sector, is poised to capitalise on this opportunity and is forging ahead to grow its advanced technology facilities portfolio such  as  data  centres,  logistics  warehouse  facilities  and semiconductor  manufacturing  facilities.  The  Construction division has raised its order book replenishment target from RM2.0 billion in the previous year to between RM2.5 and RM3.0 billion, as a total of RM90 billion in development expenditure was announced under the Budget 2024, which includes the Mass Rapid Transit ('MRT') 3 and Penang Light Rail Transit ('LRT') projects.\n\nWhile Malaysia's tourism recovery has not kept pace with its neighbours, tourist arrivals are expected to improve further in 2024, boosted by a weak domestic currency, the introduction of 30-day visa-free entry for Chinese and Indian nationals, and improving /flight connectivity and frequency. Consequently, the Group's Leisure, Hospitality, Property Investment, REIT, Retail, and Healthcare divisions are poised to bene/fit from the  anticipated  increase  in  tourist  arrivals  and  spending within Malaysia.\n\n## In Appreciation\n\nSunway's achievements over the past decades would not have been possible if not for the unwavering support of our external and internal stakeholders. On behalf of the Management team, I would like to acknowledge all our stakeholders - our Board of  Directors,  business  partners,  shareholders,  regulators, governing bodies, and customers - for your steadfast support through both the highs and lows over the years. Your trust in Sunway is invaluable.\n\nMy sincere appreciation also goes out to my fellow Sunwayians for your passion, commitment and dedication to pursuing our shared aspirations. Together, we will thrive in the decades ahead, building a shared future together.\n\nTAN SRI DATO' (DR.) CHEW CHEE KIN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPRESIDENT\n\nINVESTMENT CASE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving Prospects with Economic Resilience\n\nThis is a momentous year for Sunway as the Group celebrates its 50 th anniversary in 2024. Since 1974, Sunway has grown from strength to strength, transforming Sunway City Kuala Lumpur from a 'wasteland' to a 'wonderland' and now, one of the leading conglomerates in ASEAN. As we start a new chapter of our journey into the next decades, Sunway continues to pursue regionalisation, investments and merger and  acquisition  opportunities  to  fortify  our  position  as  a leading conglomerate in ASEAN.\n\nThe  International  Monetary  Fund  ('IMF')  anticipates  the global economy to expand at a pace of 3.2% in 2024, driven by  resilience  in  developed  economies  and  /fiscal  support in China. Notably, in/flation has eased from its peak across most regions, re/flecting the effectiveness of the past year's monetary tightening policies and auguring well for the year ahead.\n\nThe Malaysian economy  is  expected  to  maintain  a healthy economic growth in 2024, supported by a stable macroeconomic  outlook,  low  unemployment  rate,  resilient domestic demand, mild in/flation, and higher investments. Both domestic and foreign investments, as well as private and public investments, are expected to bene/fit from the tech upcycle and catalytic initiatives under the New Industrial Master  Plan  2030  and  the  National  Energy  Transition Roadmap.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Property Development division is set to focus on accelerating development in SCIP, our township in  the  Iskandar  region,  expanding  its  industrial  capacity, exploring regional opportunities, and acquire strategic land banks in the Klang Valley and Southern region. This year, the division aims to launch RM2.1 billion worth of properties, predominantly in Malaysia, and has raised its property sales target to RM2.6 billion.\n\nGlobally, the demand for superior healthcare continues to rise, with healthcare spending in Malaysia expected to increase by 7.7% per annum over the next /five years. Supported by this positive outlook, the healthcare division will continue its business expansion efforts for its three operating hospitals to meet this demand, and aims to commence operations for Sunway Medical Centre Damansara in the /final quarter of 2024 and Sunway Medical Centre Ipoh in the /first quarter of 2025. Plans are also underway to develop three more hospitals in SCIP in Johor, Paya Terubong in Penang, and Kota Bharu in Kelantan to expand our reach to these underserved locations.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenue rose 18.1% in the /financial year under review due to higher contribution from most business segments except for the others segment. Pro/fit before tax increased by 9.3% in the current period underpinned by higher pro/fit contribution from most business segments except for the healthcare and others segments.\n\nIn accordance to MFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the development pro/fit from two of the Group's Singapore property development projects will only be recognised upon completion and handover of the projects. In FY 2023, one of the property development project was completed and handed over, which resulted in the recognition of development pro/fit of RM46.3 million. The other property development project is expected to be completed and handed over in the /first half of 2024. As at 31 December 2023, the accumulated progressive pro/fit for the project amounted to RM108.9 million.\n\nDuring the year, Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. ('SunCity'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, had entered into a Share Transactions Agreement with Iskandar Asset Sdn. Bhd. ('IASB') and Sunway Iskandar Development Sdn. Bhd. ('SIDSB'), a joint venture of the Group, to acquire the remaining 40% stake in SIDSB and redemption of non-convertible non-cumulative redeemable preference shares held by IASB for a total consideration of RM85.0 million (as disclosed in Note 19(f) to the /financial statements). The transaction was completed on 21 August 2023 and consequently, SIDSB and its subsidiaries became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Group.\n\nThe /financial effects arising from the remeasurement of the previously held equity interests in SIDSB in accordance with MFRS 3 Business Combinations amounted to a net loss of RM0.5 million. The consolidated net assets from SIDSB mainly comprise of inventories (land held for property development) amounting to RM728.5 million.\n\n|                                                                 | Revenue     | Revenue     | Pro/fit Before Tax   | Pro/fit Before Tax      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                 | 2023 RM'000 | 2022 RM'000 | 2023 RM'000          | 2022 RM'000 (Restated)* |\n| Property Development                                            | 1,414,935   | 1,165,312   | 211,579              | 155,254                 |\n| Property Investment                                             | 898,599     | 689,976     | 293,666              | 235,792                 |\n| (comprises Property Investment, REIT, Leisure and  Hospitality) |             |             |                      |                         |\n| Construction                                                    | 1,688,855   | 1,281,604   | 197,901              | 186,566                 |\n| Healthcare  @                                                   | -           | -           | 152,707              | 176,826                 |\n| Trading & Manufacturing                                         | 954,646     | 902,111     | 45,143               | 41,575                  |\n| Quarry                                                          | 446,263     | 406,167     | 27,491               | 13,675                  |\n| Building Materials                                              | 232,522     | 219,837     | 51,619               | 20,005                  |\n| Others                                                          | 500,379     | 529,941     | 13,235               | 79,515                  |\n| Total                                                           | 6,136,199   | 5,194,949   | 993,341              | 909,208                 |\n\n- * The /financial statements for FY 2022 (Restated) included the effects of transition to MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts which was adopted in FY 2023.\n- @ Please note that the healthcare segment's contribution is based on equity accounting which accounts for the Group's share of its net pro/fit or loss.\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nof net pro/fit in FY 2022 included a RM48.3 million share of a oneoff net remeasurement gain of leases as per MFRS 16, in relation to the early termination of rental arrangement of Tower A and B occupied by Sunway Medical Centre ('SMC') Sunway City.\n\nExcluding the one-off net gain, EBITDA of the division grew by 33.0% in FY 2023, and the share of net pro/fit of RM152.7 million in the current /financial year was higher compared to the adjusted share of net pro/fit of RM140.1 million in the previous year.\n\nThe  improved  underlying  /financial  performance  in  the  current /financial year re/flected stronger operational results contributed by SMC Sunway City and SMC Velocity which mitigated the higher operating costs, the share of start-up operational losses from SMC Penang and Sunway Sanctuary of RM15.9 million, as well as the higher share of additional tax payable of RM18.2 million following the normalisation of SMC Sunway City's tax paying status as its Investment Tax Allowance (ITA) was fully utilised in the previous /financial year.\n\n## Trading and Manufacturing\n\nThe Trading and Manufacturing division registered higher revenue of RM954.6 million and pro/fit before tax of RM45.1 million for the current /financial year ended 31 December 2023, higher by 5.8% and 8.6% respectively, compared to revenue of RM902.1 million and pro/fit before tax of RM41.6 million in the previous /financial year. The improved /financial performance in the FY 2023 was mainly due to higher contribution from the domestic market.\n\n## Quarry\n\nThe Quarry division reported a 9.9% higher revenue of RM446.3 million and a 101% higher pro/fit before tax of RM27.5 million for the /financial year ended 31 December 2023 compared to revenue of RM406.2 million and pro/fit before tax of RM13.7 million in the previous /financial year. The improved performance in the current year was attributed to increased demand from local council and highway projects which resulted in higher sales volumes and average selling prices for both aggregates and premix.\n\n## Building Materials\n\nThe Building Materials division recorded revenue of RM232.5 million and pro/fit before tax of RM51.6 million for the /financial year ended 31 December 2023 compared to revenue of RM219.8 million and pro/fit before tax of RM20.0 million in the previous /financial year, representing an increase in revenue of 5.8% and pro/fit before tax of 158.0%. Higher revenue was mainly due to higher sales volume and selling prices and improved pro/fitability which included the reversal of provision for impairment of assets of RM19.8 million from spun pile operation under the segment.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nPERFORMANCE REVIEW\n\n## SEGMENTAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\n## Property Development\n\nIn FY 2023, the Property Development division reported revenue of RM1,414.9 million and pro/fit before tax of RM211.6 million, compared to revenue of RM1,165.3 million and pro/fit before tax of RM155.3 million in FY 2022, marking an increase in revenue of 21.4% and pro/fit before tax of 36.3%.\n\nRevenue in the current period rose on higher sales and progress billings from new and on-going local development projects and the completion and handover of a local project.\n\nPro/fit before tax in the current period was boosted by the recognition of development pro/fit of RM46.3 million upon the completion and handover of one of the Group's Singapore property development projects during the year.\n\n## Property Investment\n\nThe Property Investment division registered revenue of RM898.6 million and pro/fit before tax of RM293.7 million for the /financial year ended 31 December 2023 compared to revenue of RM690.0 million and pro/fit before tax of RM235.8 million in the previous /financial year, representing an increase in revenue of 30.2% and pro/fit before tax of 24.5%. The improved /financial performance in the current period was attributed to strong performance of the leisure and hospitality businesses with increased visitorships to the theme parks and higher occupancy rates at the Group's hotels, coupled with higher revenue from operations of property investment assets.\n\nMeanwhile, pro/fit before tax for the current period included net fair value gains from revaluation of investment properties and assets of RM67.9 million compared with overall fair value loss of RM22.9 million and net gains on disposal of property investment assets of RM28.1 million reported in the previous /financial year.\n\n## Construction\n\nThe Construction division generated revenue of RM1,688.9 million and pro/fit before tax of RM197.9 million for the /financial year ended 31 December 2023 compared to revenue of RM1,281.6 million and pro/fit before tax of RM186.6 million in the previous /financial year, marking an increase in revenue of 31.8% and pro/fit before tax of 6.1%.

As a result, the Group's net borrowings, calculated as total gross borrowings minus cash and bank balances, was higher at RM7.4 billion in FY 2023 compared to RM7.1 billion in  the  previous  /financial  year.  The  additional  gross  borrowings during the year were mainly utilised for capital expenditures related to acquisition of Property, Plant and Equipment and development of investment properties. The higher borrowings was also attributed to the redemption of the RM600 million Perpetual Sukuk during the year.\n\nTotal assets increased to RM28.6 billion in FY 2023 from RM26.1 billion in FY 2022, underpinned by increase in inventories by RM788.2  million,  increase  in  total  receivables  by  RM598.4 million, higher investment in joint ventures by RM455.2 million, as well as increase in cash and bank balances by RM338.9 million. A signi/ficant contributor to the asset growth, speci/fically on the inventories, was the consolidation of net assets from a joint venture that was reclassi/fied as a subsidiary of the Group during the year, as disclosed in Note 19(f) to the /financial statements. Additionally, the improvement in business operations also supported the increase in total assets.\n\nShare  capital  increased  substantially  to  RM7.1  billion  in FY 2023 from RM6.4 billion in FY 2022, due to the issuance of new ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of warrants amounted to RM676.4 million and completion of Dividend Reinvestment Scheme ('DRS') for the second interim single-tier dividend for FY 2022 which amounted to RM90.5 million during the year. This has partly lowered the net gearing ratio to 0.49x from 0.52x in FY 2022.\n\n| RM'MILLION                  | 2023     | 2022 (Restated)   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------|\n| Gross borrowings            | 9,650.4  | 9,056.2           |\n| Cash and bank balances      | 2,297.0  | 1,958.1           |\n| Net borrowings              | 7,353.4  | 7,098.1           |\n| Gross gearing ratio (times) | 0.64     | 0.67              |\n| Net gearing ratio (times)*  | 0.49     | 0.52              |\n| Shareholders' fund          | 13,850.4 | 12,519.7          |\n| Net assets per share (sen)  | 215.29   | 213.40            |\n\n- *  Net gearing ratio calculations exclude cross currency swap.\n\n## Operating Activities\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities rose to RM459.0 million in FY 2023 compared to RM336.8 million in FY 2022, mainly driven by the Group's improved pro/fitability in FY 2023, particularly  from  property  development,  property  investment, construction, trading and manufacturing and quarry segments.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nIn FY 2023, the Group's funds utilised for investing activities of RM558.4  million  was  lower  compared  to  RM583.2  million  in FY 2022. The lower amount utilised in the current /financial year was mainly due to lower quasi-equity loans advanced to joint ventures by RM198.3 million and higher proceeds received from disposal of other investments compared to FY 2022.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nThe Group generated net cash in/flow of RM415.9 million from /financing activities in FY 2023, compared to an out/flow of RM585.9 million in FY 2022. This was mainly attributed to higher net borrowings drawdown of RM703.4 million coupled with proceeds from  the  exercise  of  warrants  of  RM676.4  million  in  current /financial year. The cash in/flow was partly offset by redemption of perpetual sukuk amounted to RM596.6 million, interest paid and dividends paid in FY 2023.\n\nAs a result, cash and cash equivalents of the Group increased to RM2.2 billion as at 31 December 2023 from RM1.9 billion as at 31 December 2022.\n\n## DIVIDENDS DECLARED\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nIn line with the Group's commitment to deliver value to our esteemed shareholders, the Board had declared a total dividend of 5.50 sen per ordinary share for FY 2023, which is on par with dividend declared of 5.50 sen per ordinary share for FY 2022.\n\nThe full year FY 2023 dividends consist of the followings:\n\ni.\n\nii.\n\n/first interim single-tier dividend of 2.00 sen per ordinary share, which was paid on 12 October 2023 amounting to RM99.1 million, and\n\nsecond  interim  single-tier  dividend of  3.50  sen  per  ordinary share ('Second Interim Dividend'), which was declared on 21 February 2024. The Board had resolved that the dividend reinvestment  scheme  ('DRS'),  which  was  approved  by  the shareholders of Sunway ('Shareholders') at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Sunway held on 26 June 2014, will apply to the entire Second Interim Dividend. The Shareholders will be provided the option to elect to reinvest the entire Second Interim Dividend into new Sunway Shares ('New Shares').\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## ii.

However,  global economic  uncertainties  presented  various  challenges,  including in/flation, higher interest rates and a weakened ringgit. This led to a surge in prices of imported goods and materials, and signi/ficantly impacted housing prices. The Overnight Policy Rate ('OPR') rate which increased to 3% from the low of 1.75%, also affected buyers' affordability. On a positive note, the government's announcement of more relaxed requirements for the Malaysia My Second Home ('MM2H') programme opened up opportunities for more residential property purchases by non-Malaysians.\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nGiven that economic growth is concentrated in high-development areas with more infrastructure and job opportunities, the division capitalised on Malaysia's urbanisation trends by seeking to replenish its landbank and expand geographically to diversify risks across markets. Brand positioning and market leadership was another key focus area to sustain the Group's competitive advantage of being a strong brand associated with the values of quality, trust and reliability. The division also sought to diversify its revenue streams to enhance business resilience across asset cycles.\n\nIn light of the highly competitive nature of the property market, the division adopted a strategy of differentiation by enhancing product innovation through its Sunway Design and Development Architecture ('SDDA') series. This was supported by an innovative approach to managing demographic shifts along with changing consumer preferences. With customer sentiment being mostly cautious and value-seeking in 2023, the division strove to deliver customercentric  innovation  and  engagement  with  its  Sunway  Property+ membership programme. In addition, digital transformation efforts remained an important emphasis across the real estate value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA  membership  programme  offering  services  and  rewards tailored to bene/fit Homebuyers, Sub-sale Buyers, and Tenants across all Sunway Property developments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Savings.

Meanwhile, the property market in China recorded a  steep  drop  in  property  prices  and  sales  despite  continuous government support and relaxation of home purchase restrictions, affecting the country's broader economic recovery.\n\nIn terms of market trends, Malaysia's continued urbanisation meant marked shifts in population growth, age distribution and lifestyle trends,  thereby  increasing  demand  for  quality  homes.  On  the environmental front, growing public awareness of environmental issues along with the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events boosted further demand for eco-friendly properties.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Artist's impression of Sunway Flora Residences in Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur\n\nInternally, the division focused on developing talent capabilities and competencies, including human capital, by strengthening the principles of the Master Community Developer ('MCD') culture throughout the organisation. Maintaining a safe, equal and digni/fied workforce was also of paramount importance, which was reinforced with  the  continued  pursuit  of  ISO  45001:  2018  certi/fication. Additionally, social linkage events were held across the division's nationwide presence to foster better relationships, create a positive work culture and encourage cross-functional engagement outside of the workplace.\n\nIn tandem with the division's commitment to driving the Group's ESG-driven value proposition, sustainability efforts were ramped up.  These  included  transforming  its  portfolios  into  low-carbon sustainable cities by ensuring that all projects were ISO 14001 compliant with certi/fication maintained, improving waste diversion from construction sites and investing in sustainable of/fice space upgrades based on the respective team's needs.\n\nIt  also  advocated  for  a  responsible  value  chain  through  the digitalisation of its supply chain. This involved the introduction of new platforms as well as the ongoing use of existing platforms to streamline and improve communications across the supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 34 for more information on the Property Development division's Strategic Snapshot.",

Overall, the division achieved RM2.4 billion in total sales for FY 2023, exceeding its target of RM2.3 billion.\n\nThe division's 4 residential property launches in Malaysia were Sunway Flora Residences in Bukit Jalil, Jernih Residences in Kajang, Sunway Dora in Penang and Sunway Aviana in Johor, all of which performed well. Most of the projects across Malaysia, including those in the Klang Valley and Penang surpassed a 70% take-up rate, while Sunway Aviana which was only launched in October 2023 managed to surpass a 50% take-up rate in a short time, attesting to the strength of the SDDA framework and the purchasers' trust in the Sunway brand.\n\nThe division also successfully launched the Sunway Signature Series 2023 Campaign featuring these Signature Homes that incorporate  the  four  pillars  of  SDDA,  namely  Sustainability, Innovation, Health & Wellness and Lifestyle & New Experiences with total bookings of RM1.0 billion achieved.\n\nIn  Singapore,  two  private  condominium  developments  were launched in 2023 namely Terra Hills in February 2023 and The Continuum in April 2023. These new projects achieved modest take up rates.\n\nIn China, a new block of condominium at Sunway Gardens Phase 3, Tianjin, was launched in the second half of 2023, offering a housing community which emphasised on Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability ('LOHAS') concept.\n\n## Construction Completion and Handovers\n\nIn FY 2023, the division successfully completed and handed over a few property development projects in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nIn the Klang Valley, the division delivered two blocks of Sunway Serene Phase 1 and Sunway Velocity Two (Plot A) which consist of two 53-storey apartment blocks and a 28-storey of/fice tower. In Sunway City Iskandar Puteri, 128-units of Sunway Citrine Lakehomes  Phase  3  was  completed  and  handed  over  to  its homeowners.\n\nIn Singapore, Parc Canberra's 496-unit executive condominium was completed and handed over in the third quarter of FY 2023, which contributed to a development pro/fit recognition of RM46.3 million to the /financial performance of the division in FY 2023.\n\n## Strategic Landbanking\n\nIn the year under review, the Property Development division added sizeable landbanks into its portfolio. In May 2023, the division proposed to acquire 5.09 acres of prime freehold land in Seri Hartamas, Kuala Lumpur for a purchase consideration of up to RM220 million for a proposed mixed development project with an indicative Gross Development Value ('GDV') of up to RM1.1 billion.\n\nThe division also successfully acquired a large 245 acres of freehold land in Kuang, Selangor to rebalance its landbank mix for a purchase consideration of RM115 million with an estimated GDV of at least RM2 billion. The land was intended for the development of an industrial technology park which will house factories, warehouses and commercial units.\n\nOn 11 September 2023, the Housing and Development Board of Singapore awarded a 4.06-acre lease term land parcel at Tengah Plantation Close to a joint venture collaboration between Hoi Hup Realty Pte Ltd and Sunway Developments Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Sunway, for a tender price of SGD$348.5 million (approximately RM1.2 billion). The land will be developed into executive condominium with a GDV of approximately SGD$730 million (approximately RM2.5 billion), targeted to be launched in early 2025.\n\nWith the landbank acquisitions during the year, the total landbank for the division stood at 2,467 acres with a GDV of RM52.9 billion as at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Environmental Initiatives\n\nAll the residential properties launched in Malaysia in FY 2023 were green renewable energy certi/fied and designed in accordance with the SDDA framework with emphasis on ef/ficient sustainable land, energy and water use. Furthermore, 5.7% of waste was successfully diverted from land/fills in 2023 through the segregation of waste materials by type, such as steel and timber at the construction sites and recycled separately. This is above the initial 2023 target set of 4%. 2023 also marked the 10 th consecutive year of Sunway achieving zero non-conformity in SIRIM's audit report for ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management).\n\n## Property Awards and Industry Recognition\n\nThe division reaf/firmed its position as one of the top developers in the country through numerous industry awards and accolades secured in FY 2023. These include the runner-up ranking at The Edge Malaysia's Top Property Developers Awards 2023, Silver award at the Putra Brand Awards 2023 in Property Development and Top Sustainable Developer in Malaysia as awarded by Green RE. Its property development projects, Sunway Emerald Residence and Sunway Velocity received Gold and Bronze respectively in The Edge Best Managed & Sustainable Property Awards 2023. At the recent FIABCI Malaysia Property Award 2023, Sunway City Iskandar Puteri and Sunway GEOLake Residences were awarded winners in the Master Plan and Residential High Rise categories respectively.\n\nThe division was also awarded the No.1 choice in the Talentbank Graduates'  Choice  Awards  2023  in  the  Property  Developer category.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 13 for more information on the Property Development division's awards and accolades.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nSunway's Property Development division aims to achieve FY 2024 target sales of RM2.6 billion with a robust RM2.1 billion worth of property development projects in the pipeline for launch that are tailored for the current market conditions and the right buyer categories. Planned launches in FY 2024 are mainly developments located in the Klang Valley, Johor, Ipoh and Penang, as well as in China.\n\nDespite economic /fluctuations, the residential property market in Malaysia is showing positive momentum with rising sales volume, successful project completions and the introduction of new property developments.  With  strong  government  support  in  the  form  of property-related initiatives and incentives, especially following the Budget 2024 announcements, as well as strengthened partnerships between developers and /financial institutions to facilitate increased homeownership, the residential market remains cautiously optimistic going into FY 2024.\n\nThe division anticipates the potential risks of supply chain disruptions, market oversupply and construction cost hikes arising from economic uncertainties,  credit  market  conditions  and  government  policy changes in relation to property, land use or taxation, to weigh on its performance in FY 2024. To mitigate these challenges, the division looks forward to diversify its project portfolios and market reach, and has identi/fied new growth region for future developments.\n\nTo this end, Sunway's Property Development division has signed two  memorandums  of  understanding  (MoU)  with  the  Sarawak Foundation and Land Custody and Development Authority ('LCDA') respectively. The /first MoU with the Sarawak Foundation is to jointly explore the transformation of 119 prime acres of land in Kuching into a 'state-of-the-art' Digital Medical Village Development. The second MoU with LCDA is for the proposed redevelopment of a 497acre urban renewal area in Bukit Assek, Sibu. The two projects will take inspiration from Sunway's Build, Own, Operate business model and aspire to emulate the award-winning Sunway City Kuala Lumpur township to revitalise the city with an integrated modern smart city master plan, feasibility studies and design innovations.\n\nAdditionally, the division plans to continue growing its footprint in Singapore and China. The upcoming completion of the Johor BahruSingapore Rapid Transit System Link ('RTS Link'), slated for the end of 2026, is anticipated to boost homebuyers' interest in both Malaysia and Singapore with the promise of smoother connectivity and faster travel times. Other factors including the announcement of the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone is poised to bring about new opportunities in Johor where Sunway has built its largest township yet, Sunway City Iskandar Puteri.\n\nIn November 2023, Sunway partnered with Equalbase to build a logistics facility in a /first fully carbon-neutral free commercial zone with a GDV of RM8 billion in Sunway City Iskandar Puteri. The development is expected to cater to a diverse range of industries in the region, including FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods), retail, e-commerce,  automotive,  pharmaceutical  and  technology.

Hospitals  were  expected  to  record  a  strong performance with a signi/ficant rebound in the number of local and foreign patient visits, with private healthcare in particular poised to continue gaining traction.\n\nAccording  to  a  report  by  the  United  Nations  World  Tourism Organisation, Malaysia's healthcare travel revenue reached RM1.3 billion  in  2022,  outperforming  global  and  Asia-Paci/fic  tourism recovery rates. The strong recovery in the country's medical tourism sector  has  prompted  the  Malaysia  Healthcare  Travel  Council ('MHTC') to revise its healthcare traveller revenue target for 2023 upwards to RM1.7 billion. The country saw an in/flux of healthcare traveller  arrivals  stemming  from  pent-up  demand  during  the pandemic.\n\nDespite this positive forecast, Sunway Healthcare Group ('Sunway Healthcare' or 'SHG') faced its fair share of challenges in FY 2023. Rising interest rates, the weakening of MYR against the USD and EUR, in/flationary pressures and a shortage of nurses led to higher operating and capital expenditure including cost of construction\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\n## Focusing on Business Expansion\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Improving Quality of Care Through Digitalisation\n\nAs part of its business expansion plans, SHG has ramped up progress on the hospital expansions. Its /flagship hospital, Sunway Medical Centre ('SMC') Sunway City added additional capacity with the opening of two new blocks, Tower D and Tower E in May 2023.\n\nOn 6 June 2023, SHG unveiled its maiden senior living residence, known as Sunway Sanctuary, which sits atop Tower D of SMC from Level 15 to 30. It is one of SHG's aspirations to provide an exquisite and conducive post-retirement living facility, anchoring on six key pillars, namely convenient location, holistic wellness, active lifestyle with  curated  activities,  thoughtful  amenities,  elegant  living  and quality healthcare.\n\nConstruction of Sunway Medical Centre Damansara and Sunway Medical Centre Ipoh hospitals are on track to be completed by Q3 and Q4 2024 respectively, with operations expected to commence by the end of 2024 and early 2025 respectively. SHG also plans to add more dedicated wards and operating theatres for selected disciplines to expand its specialised services in the three hospitals already in operations.\n\n## Driving Clinical Excellence and Technological Advancements\n\nSunway remains dedicated to strengthening its digital health offerings and technological advancements in medical treatment. In FY 2023, SHG continued to strengthen its clinical excellence focusing on key disciplines such as Oncology, Orthopaedics, Cardiology, Neurology, Gastroenterology, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Paediatric services. Meanwhile, SMC Sunway City also expanded its lab services in transplant immunology, cytogenetic screening and next generation sequencing. It further strengthened its Quality Assurance Programme that involves regular audits, peer reviews and performance evaluations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Newly opened Tower D Lobby at SMC Sunway City\n\nIn FY 2023, Sunway Healthcare prioritised ongoing implementation and upgrades of digital platforms to boost customer satisfaction through stronger operational ef/ficiency and reduced waiting times. SHG is also eyeing improvements in its data intelligence and analytic capability. SMC Sunway City successfully completed its migration to the new Hospital Information System ('HIS') in August 2023, and aims to transition fully to the Electronic Medical Record ('EMR') system by the /first half of 2024. The EMR system provides healthcare professionals with quick access to accurate, up-to-date, and complete information about patients for more coordinated and ef/ficient care, as well as more accurate diagnosis.\n\nOther digitalisation initiatives implemented include the enhancement of touchpoints on the SunMed Go mobile platform to improve overall patient experience. Automated dispensing cabinets have also been introduced to SHG's hospital wards.\n\n## Growing Medical Tourism and Interstate Market\n\nAs Malaysia's reputation as a medical tourism and interstate market destination grows, SHG has been at the forefront of contributing to its growth. The division focused its efforts in FY 2023 on expanding its geographical reach beyond Malaysia through deep and pioneer outreach in Tier 1 and 2 cities in Indonesia, set-up of referral agents in Indo-China (Cambodia, Vietnam and Yangon) and China, as well as collaborations with international insurance companies and medical assistance  providers.  For  international  health  travellers,  Sunway Sanctuary  provided  the  added  convenience  of  staying  in  close proximity to SMC Sunway City.\n\n## Prioritising Healthcare Talent Development\n\nInternally, SHG placed continued emphasis in FY 2023 on human capital development through talent upskilling and reskilling, strategic leadership training and succession planning. Career advancement opportunities such as nursing sponsorships and post-basic studies are made available to staff, along with enhanced staff welfare and remuneration packages.\n\nStaff also bene/fit from SHG's collaborations and partnerships with world-renown institutions such as Harvard Medical School for the Leadership in Medicine (LiM) programme, and the Royal College of Physicians for the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians (MRCP) Practical Assessment of Clinical Examination Skills (PACES) preparatory course and mock exams.\n\nSHG also continues to look out for staff wellbeing through the provision of mental health support and awareness programmes that focus on counselling, career development advice and stress management, among other areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 35 for more information on the Healthcare division's Strategic Snapshot.\n\nfor new hospitals. The annual medical in/flation rate in Malaysia peaked at 15% in 2023, further denting the average household's private medical care affordability. On a wider scale, the international medical  sector  braced  for  the  signi/ficant  risk  of  a  worldwide slowdown should geopolitical con/flicts escalate, namely in terms of potential supply chain disruptions that would further affect prices of medical equipment, consumables and pharmaceuticals.\n\nTo  counter  these  challenges,  several  initiatives  to  improve  the overall performance of the country's medical sector were launched. The Malaysian government has pledged to gradually elevate public healthcare expenditure to 5% of the country's gross domestic product ('GDP') to help drive health reforms. In June 2023, the Malaysian Parliament passed the Health White Paper, which outlined a 15year plan to structurally reform the national healthcare system.\n\nThe addressable market in healthcare also saw continued growth due to the increasingly ageing population. Furthermore, advancements in medical technologies in diagnosis and treatments have enabled SHG to achieve new breakthroughs, meet demands and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

SMC Penang is the /first hospital in the Northern region to carry out robotic assisted surgery,  which  will  further  enhance  patient  outcomes  for minimally invasive surgeries ('MIS') that offers faster recovery, less  pain,  shorter  hospitalisation,  and  minimal  cuts.  SMC Sunway City has since carried out over 2,000 robotic surgeries to date.\n\nWith a focus on paediatric care, SMC Sunway City is the /first private hospital in Malaysia to introduce a dedicated Children Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department, a one-stop centre that caters to the healthcare needs of infants, children and adolescents. Together with Fourier Intelligence, SMC Sunway City also unveiled Southeast Asia's /first 'TRoom', a special sensory  playroom  with  immersive  technology  and  physical devices designed to help patients by stimulating the senses. The T-Room can be used in medical treatment to assess physical performance and help with learning.\n\n## Giving Back to Communities\n\nSMC  Velocity  launched  the  'Save  a  Number,  Save  a  Life' campaign  in  August  2023  to  educate  the  public  on  the importance of knowing the emergency contact numbers of their nearest  healthcare  institutions.  Through  this  initiative,  SMC Velocity became the /first private hospital in Malaysia to publish a First Aid e-Book that saw close to 3,000 downloads and over 10,000 scans in the /first month of its launch alone.\n\nFollowing that, SHG also published a Paediatric First Aid e-Book and related videos and conducted children's First Aid workshops at SMC Sunway City, attended by nearly 200 children and parents, in February 2024.\n\nIn  a  continuous  effort  to  create  awareness  on  diabetes' management, risks and prevention, Sunway Healthcare launched the KNOW Diabetes risk calculator in 2023 with an accompanying social media campaign and educational videos.

Construction of the District Cooling System in Sunway Square, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, has also commenced and is on track for completion in FY 2025.\n\nRecognising the growing importance of good Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG') management, especially with regards to supply chain practices, SunCon conducted social assessments on all of its contractors and suppliers in FY 2023, with topics ranging from forced and bonded labour to provision of accommodations. It also engaged 2 major commodities suppliers for insights on ESG, emission reduction strategies and transition plans.\n\n## Digitalisation\n\nGiven the growing scope, complexity and ambition of its projects, SunCon has leveraged on the digitalisation approach to optimise the quality, ef/ficiency, and productivity of its work processes. FY 2023 saw digitalisation being fully implemented in project management for all newly awarded projects, as well as the duration of the projects' lifecycle. This was supported by the successful introduction of new communication channels and tools using the Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) software, which facilitates smoother interaction among project stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 HELIOSEL Solar Photovoltaic (PV) System - Package L3 project\n\n## Awards and Recognition\n\nSunCon is proud to be the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions in FY 2023.

A  total  of  RM90  billion  in  development  expenditure  was  also announced under Budget 2024, including the MRT3 and Penang LRT projects. SunCon is poised to capitalise on these opportunities with its full-/fledged integrated capabilities ranging from turnkey, design and build, and engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) to private funding initiatives. The division maintains a healthy orderbook of RM5.3 billion extending into 2025 and is actively working towards replenishing its orderbook.\n\nMalaysia's data sector is expected to see a rapid uptick in its already robust demand. In line with the government's plan to transform Malaysia into a thriving regional data centre hub, a slew of new and emerging investments of over 800MW capacity is projected to come on stream in phases over the next /five years. TNB has also established the Green Lane Pathway, an exclusive and strategic offering for Malaysia's data centre market to provide environmentally responsible solutions for data centre operators, further bolstering Malaysia's  data  centre  market  and  encourage  more  investment into its data centres. SunCon is keen to explore new long-term opportunities to grow its portfolio in this sector in the coming years, along with collaborations in logistics warehouses and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nMeanwhile, the future of the sustainable energy sector looks bright as renewable energy ('RE') adoption surges ahead of the country's RE target mix of 70% by 2050. The government is lending solid support in the form of policies and measures such as the Net Energy Transition Roadmap, lifting of the RE export ban and Bursa Carbon Exchange programmes. SunCon will continue to advance its sustainability journey towards enabling sustainable construction, investing in a fair, safe and inclusive workplace, and ensuring compliance and embracing transparency. This includes recommitting its net zero target by 2040 and reinforcing Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets of 40% reduction by 2030 through the Carbon Reduction Pathway and Strategy. SunCon also plans to undertake a comprehensive climate risk assessment in 2024.\n\nSunCon remains vigilant of potential in/flationary and geopolitical pressures that may affect the pace of economic growth. However, the division is cautiously optimistic for further positive growth and expansion in 2024, bolstered by its strong position and ability to rise to the challenges and opportunities of a highly dynamic industry.\n\n- For a detailed discussion of SunCon's business model, performance, strategies, risk and outlook, please refer to Sunway Construction Group Berhad's Annual Report 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Sunway Square, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Although the world economy remains in a state of /flux with new geopolitical risks emerging, Malaysia's economy remained resilient, anchored by strong domestic demand coupled with strong policies by an increasingly stable government.\n\nLifting of policies that hinder international travel after the pandemic saw the retail segment experiencing a resurgence from pent-up demand for travelling, entertainment and socialisation, especially during the festive and holiday seasons. This shows that malls are still relevant, with the stronger ones seeming to thrive the most, while e-commerce is expected to transform rather than replace the role of physical malls.\n\nHowever, the Klang Valley of/fice market continued to experience downward pressure due to the existing excess supply of old of/fice building space and incoming new supply of of/fice buildings. An in/flux of about 3.5 million sq ft of new of/fice space entering the market in the second half of the year has further heightened competition in rental rates, leasing incentives and occupancy levels of of/fice buildings in the Klang Valley. Many of these new of/fices are green building certi/fied as multinational and local companies have placed increasing importance on environmental and social requirements in building and of/fice designs. Demand for co-working spaces are also increasing among SMEs and MNCs as they will have the /flexibility that allows them to scale up and down quickly and economically.\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nTo safeguard its market position against the in/flow of new retail and  of/fice  spaces,  Sunway's  Property  Investment  and  REIT division was proactive in identifying opportunities to improve the operational performance of their existing assets portfolio, undertaking Asset Enhancement Initiatives ('AEI') and Asset Management Initiatives to expand its Net Lettable Area ('NLA') and  boost  income  and  property  yields.  This  is  particularly important to maintain the relevance of their assets and enhance their property values in a /fiercely competitive real estate market.\n\nAmong the key AEI initiatives undertaken were the RM360 million refurbishment of Sunway Carnival Mall's existing wing, which encompasses optimising the layout, integrating the aesthetics of the external fa\u00e7ade, and providing seamless connectivity for the enlarged mall to meet the burgeoning demand from Penang mainland's growing population. The refurbishment is targeted to complete in 2025 which will see the total NLA of the mall increased to 752,000 sq ft. The division has also set aside close to RM200 million to recon/figure 320,000 square feet of retail space at Sunway Pyramid Mall into specialty stores. The recon/figuration aims to improve and revitalise the tenancy mix to cater to the changing consumers trends and lifestyles and to further elevate the shopping experience at the mall. The target completion and reopening is expected in the /final quarter of FY 2024.\n\nThe tenancy mix at all the malls continued to be refreshed to ensure that trending brands are captured to strengthen the brand position for Sunway's malls to stay ahead of the competition and generate higher footfalls. Some of the new brands which have opened in Sunway's malls are Ralph Lauren, Tai Er, Laem Charoen, Maisen, Gordon Ramsay Street Pizza, Anta Kids and many more.\n\nAt the same time, the division also look for ways to rejuvenate and optimise the spaces in the retail and commercial segments by exploring co-working spaces and experiential hub strategy.\n\nBeyond asset driven initiatives, Sunway's Property Investment and REIT division also worked on initiatives to strengthen its ESG credentials. This includes establishing green /financing options, and exploring ways to support Sunway's malls' retail partners on their sustainability journey. The division also actively pursued green accreditations and ratings, benchmarking its operations to international best practices and global ratings to raise the bar on sustainability. Sunway REIT had laid out a 10-year roadmap to have all its buildings green-certi/fied before 2034 to enhance the competitiveness of its assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 37 for more information on the Property Investment and REIT division's Strategic Snapshot.\n\n## Retail segment\n\nThe retail segment of the Property Investment and REIT division ended FY 2023 on a strong note, surpassing its FY 2022 record performance with a commendable 5% sales growth.  The  achievement  was  attributed  to  the  doubledigit growth by Sunway Carnival Mall, resilient out-of-home dining, and robust festive spending in the /first quarter of FY 2023 across all Sunway's malls which helped to ease the moderation effect of the remaining quarters in FY 2023.\n\nNotably, the replacement of AEON supermarket with Jaya Grocer has strengthened Sunway Pyramid Mall's positioning as a mid-high premium mall, while Sunway Carnival Mall has been enjoying major growth since its expansion, and is poised to be the leading mall in the Northern Region. The well-curated tenancy mix of these two malls successfully drove an increase in its sales and traf/fic, and generated higher rents per square foot. The retail segment boasts 4.9 million sq ft in total NLA.\n\nAt Sunway Putra Mall, in collaboration with Sunway Lagoon theme park, an 80's-themed indoor roller-skating park, Sk8te City opened in April 2023 to provide a new entertainment spot in the city and generate more footfall to the mall. WORQ coworking space had leased over 20,000 sq ft of space in the mall to provide a minimalist workspace with a wide range of amenities and facilities to foster collaboration and connections since January 2024.\n\nIn FY 2023, Sunway's malls continue to be recognised for its efforts to create great customers' experiences. Sunway Velocity Mall was the sole Malaysian mall winner at the International  Council  of  Shopping  Centers  (ICSC)  MAXI Awards 2023 awards that saw 100 finalists from around the world - including from Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, United States, and China. The MAXI Awards recognises innovative  events,  programmes  and  technology  that  add value to the mall industry. The mall won Gold for its Chinese New  Year  2022  '100  Blessings'  under  the  Marketing Excellence Community category and another Gold award for its New Year's Eve Countdown concert celebrating 2023 under  the  Marketing  Excellence  Experiential  category. Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPKM) also awarded Sunway Carnival Mall with a Platinum award for its Cahaya Raya  x  Autsome  2023  event  under  'Best  Experiential Marketing Awards - Category B (Net Lettable Area 500,001 to 999,999 sq ft)'.\n\nPlease see page 14 for more information on the Property Investment and REIT division's awards and accolades.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Currently, Sunway REIT has three new proposed acquisition of assets totalling RM802 million pending completion.\n\n## Digital transformation\n\nBeyond securing reputable tenants and ensuring steady income streams from its property portfolio, the value of the division's assets continued to be enhanced through the adoption of technological advancements  and  sustainability  features.  For  instance,  the introduction of a lift card access system and installation of /fibre optic cables to each of/fice /floor of Sunway Putra Tower effectively increased the building's security and data transmission speed. This supported Sunway Putra Tower's attainment of Stage 1 Malaysia Digital approval on 26 October 2023, elevating its competitiveness in the of/fice segment.\n\nOther  enhancements  such  as  the  implementation  of  Smart Washroom in Sunway Pyramid Mall also earned praise in the social media, as the modernised washroom improved the comfort of visitors while its smart features allowed the mall to track and prevent water leakages, track usage and re/fills of tissues and soap, and improved the overall hygiene of the washrooms.\n\n## ESG initiatives\n\nThe division has implemented various initiatives to reduce the carbon and waste footprints across its malls over the years. These initiatives are showing improved results in FY 2023.\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV) solar panels installed at 5 of the malls' rooftops have generated over 6 million kilowatt hours of solar energy which is worth almost RM2 million in cost savings to partly offset the rising utilities cost for the malls.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Sunway Velocity Mall was the sole Malaysian mall winner at the ICSC MAXI Awards 2023\n\nIn an effort to address food security and provide fresh and diverse food in the city, 2,300 sq ft of space was allocated to urban farming at Sunway Velocity Mall in 2023, adding to the 1,500 sq ft of urban farm which was already in operations at Sunway Pyramid Mall.\n\nThe Green Lease Partnership Programme for all of Sunway REIT's tenants and hotel lessees which was launched in 2022 has seen over 80% take up by the retail and of/fice tenants in FY 2023, a signi/ficant increase from 30% in the previous year. Sunway REIT aims to achieve 100% tenant participation with more than 1,300 tenants in the programme before or by 2030.\n\nSunway's malls have also established itself as a leader and advocate for sustainability within the retail industry, forming a  /five-way  partnership  with  the  United  Nations  Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development (JSC), Malaysia Retail Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to launch the  Sustainability  Collaboration  Alliance  Network  (SCAN)  to spearhead  sustainability  adoption  among  Sunway's  malls' business partners and the retail industry.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nGoing to FY 2024, the growth of the Malaysian economy is expected to trend higher, supported by an increasingly stable domestic environment. While the division looks forward with optimism, it takes cognisance of several key headwind themes in 2024 such as service tax hikes and new taxes, roll-back of subsidies, electricity tariff hikes, persistent in/flationary outlook and the global economic developments which will present both challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe trend of domestic retail mall expansion seen in 2023 is expected to continue into 2024. While new malls introduce competition,  they  also  enrich  Malaysia's  retail  offerings  and enhance the country's appeal as a retail hub. This expansion is anticipated to attract not only local shoppers but also international visitors, hence, bene/fitting the economy and the tourism sector. Moreover,  the  evolving  retail  environment  is  likely  to  entice globally recognised brands to establish a presence in Malaysia, further  bolstering  the  retail  sector.  In  a  highly  competitive market, established malls that adapt quickly to consumer trends and lifestyles are poised to attract premium tenants. The Property Investment and REIT division aims to continue to strengthen its asset portfolios on this front.\n\nIn addition to current AEIs to increase NLAs at the retail malls, two new additions to the retail malls, Sunway Square in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur and Sunway Ipoh Mall in Sunway City Ipoh are currently being constructed and expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and 2026 respectively, further reinforcing the division's commitment to providing quality retail spaces. These new retail malls will add up to 1.3 million sq ft of NLA once in operations.\n\nParallels can be drawn with the commercial sector in Malaysia, which is also seeing an immense amount of incoming supply in 2023 and 2024. The overhang of vacant of/fice space, especially in the Klang Valley, will continue to bear down on rental growth prospects  and  occupancy  levels.  Nonetheless,  the  attractive rentals in Malaysia may become an attribute to entice relocations of more regional of/fices and MNCs to the country.\n\nIn order to attract such tenants, the division is mindful that its properties must embrace green building standards and achieve Malaysia Digital (MD) status to enhance the attractiveness and sustainability of the commercial portfolio as demand remains resilient among more ESG-compliant, wellness-driven and stateof-the art of/fice buildings. To this end, the commercial segment will see two new of/fice blocks at Sunway Square which will enter the market towards the end of 2024 and 2025 respectively, adding a total NLA of close to 980,000 sq ft of commercial space under the division's assets under management in the future. These buildings are designed and built according to Green RE Platinum and LEED Gold ratings to cater to the sustainability conscious market.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Sunway GEO of/fices at Sunway City Kuala Lumpur\n\nBuilding on this understanding, Sunway's Property Investment and REIT division emphasise on the importance of continuing to identify and implement AEIs to bolster the appeal of its retail and commercial portfolios in order to maintain, if not improve, its property yield. The division is keen to explore the adoption of  retention  strategies  and  refurbishment  initiatives  for  its commercial segment, such as the addition of amenities like gyms, common lounges, event spaces and landscaped areas to of/fice buildings to elevate the physical of/fice experience, aimed at boosting productivity and creativity among its occupants to enhance its appeal. The division is con/fident that its ongoing AEIs will contribute to improved asset yields in the coming years.\n\nNonetheless, the division is aware of the potential short-term disruptions and closures associated with these enhancements impacting the /financial performance in FY 2024. With careful planning and barring unexpected events, the division maintains a cautiously optimistic outlook for the prospects and performance in the upcoming year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Additional information on REIT-related performance and outlook are discussed in detail in Sunway Real Estate Investment Trust's Integrated Annual Report 2023.",

The launch of the Sunway Super App mobile application and Sunway Digital Hub during the 2023 STP Mega Roadshow, signi/ficantly boosted brand visibility and sales for both the division's theme parks.\n\nFurthermore, Sunway  Theme  Parks  (' STP ') Studios, in collaboration with Sunway Super App, initiated a monthly live stream as a platform to engage audiences and sell theme park products and branded partner items. By diversifying revenue streams  through  digital  platforms,  Sunway's  Leisure  division demonstrated an ability to navigate challenges creatively and make the most of the evolving consumer trends.\n\nIn the year under review, the Leisure division also focused on brand partnerships, retail rebranding, and community-focused events to navigate the dynamic industry landscape. Partnerships with both local and international brands were pursued for STP Studios, as well as events, and campaigns to elevate the division's pro/file and /financial performance.\n\nNew attractions, such as the Malayana Rooftop in Sunway Lost World of Tambun and the unveiling of a giant Captain Quack statue in the Sunway Lagoon Night Park, were strategically introduced to enhance visitors' experience, along with the addition of four new staycation villas in Sunway Lagoon, re/flecting the division's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. Similarly, retail transformation of STP Kedai Runcit stores across Sunway\n\nLagoon, Sunway Lost World of Tambun and Sunway Lost World Hotel were carried out to increase customer engagement and strengthen overall market positioning.\n\nAside from the strategic business initiatives, the division also recognised the importance of celebrating diversity to cultivate an atmosphere of inclusivity in the multicultural Malaysia. Hence, the division embarked to unite the people of Malaysia through the celebration of the nation's four main festivities, commencing with a grand Deepavali celebration in 2023 with the /first-ever Thirunaal  Kondattam :  Festival  of  Lights  Celebration,  which showcased  the  division's  commitment  to  foster  a  sense  of community during the national celebrations.\n\nAdditionally, in response to growing environmental concerns, the division initiated the Explorer Rangers Programme in FY 2022, a  year-long  educational  effort  designed  to  encourage  greater awareness of sustainable and environmental practices among the  younger  generation.  With  over  500  active  members,  the programme's success led to its renewal for another year in FY 2023. Explorer Rangers 2.0 signi/fied the theme parks' sustained commitment  to  environmental  education  and  community involvement. A sustainable biowaste treatment system was also implemented to compost food waste in Sunway Lagoon theme park, which underscored the division's dedication to sustainability and community well-being.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Please see page 38 for more information on the Leisure division's Strategic Snapshot.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Latest attractions at Sunway Lagoon theme park and Sunway Lost World of Tambun\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite this positive momentum, the sector faced headwinds due to ongoing domestic economic instability, which led to a decrease in international events held in Malaysia, and further impacted by certain government cost-cutting measures, which include limiting of/ficial functions to be held at public facilities.\n\nAdditionally, the division contended with rising operating costs in FY 2023. This included elevated staff remuneration expenses, attributed to a labour shortage and the adoption of a 5-day work week, along with burgeoning procurement costs driven up by in/flationary pressures, a scarcity of raw materials and a depreciating Ringgit.\n\nEmerging trends observed within the sector included guests' growing dependency on gadgets and a corresponding rise in technological adoption within the hospitality industry. A greater embrace of ESG considerations among stakeholders was also noted, which has further pushed prioritisation of environmentally friendly practices and led to more stringent regulatory compliance.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nIn  response  to  the  dynamic  interplay  of  these  multitude  of factors, the Hospitality division adopted a nuanced approach in its strategic response that is rooted in the adaptability and systemic market positioning for its various hospitality offering clusters.\n\nThe  division  employed  an  adaptive  marketing  strategy  with the  implementation  of  variable  rates  at  its  hotels,  enabling continuous rate adjustments based on market demand, supply and the competitive landscape to drive the division's performance in terms of occupancy rate and pro/fit margins. These allow each hotel to /finely tune their pricing and value proposition marketing to  swiftly  adjust  to  shifting  market  forces  and  customer expectations at their respective locations.\n\nAt Sunway Resort Hotel, Sunway Pyramid Hotel and Sunway Lagoon Hotel which are located in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, there were active pitching for national and international level of Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibition ('MICE') events to be held at Sunway City Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe division had also focused their efforts on diversifying revenue streams to shore up the business' resilience against market shocks and other unforeseen events. To this end, the division explored new avenues by tapping into wellness tourism, international weddings and market diversi/fication into emerging markets, while pursuing strategic collaborations to enhance market awareness into these markets. The coordinated appointment of hotel representations in key geographic areas, including Greater China, Singapore and\n\nthe Middle East, further solidi/fied the division's global presence and contributed to heightened market appreciation.\n\nAdditionally,  the  'Book  Direct  &  Save'  website  application continued to be implemented and improved, with its ease of use proving popular among both guests and employees, while guests enjoyed the additional bene/fits and /flexibility it provided.\n\nThe Hospitality division also took the initiative to introduce a range of upgrades and innovations to its hotel offerings which include building facade enhancements at Sunway Putra Hotel Kuala Lumpur and transformation of its coffee house lounge into an exquisite Rumah Makan Nusantara restaurant and introduction of a new Deluxe room category at Sunway Velocity Hotel, among others.  The  hotels  also  leveraged  on  the  Group's  synergistic potential in their room package offerings, such as Sunway Velocity Hotel partnered with Sunway Medical Centre Velocity to provide pre and post-treatment patient accommodation and Sunway Big Box Hotel in Sunway City Iskandar Puteri collaborating with X Park for entertainment space, capitalising on these partnerships to enhance guest offerings and appeal to a more diverse clientele.\n\nThe division also carried out a comprehensive analysis of the talent remuneration and bene/fits plan of the industry and its competitive  landscape,  which  served  to  guide  the  division's compensation  considerations  to  defray  escalating  staff  costs while ensuring alignment with industry standards to facilitate the attraction and retention of top talents.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Please see page 39 for more information on the Hospitality division's Strategic Snapshot.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 The Linkway Cafe, located adjacent to Sunway Resort Hotel lobby, is open daily for dine-in and takeaway\n- \u25b6 Rumah Makan Nusantara at Sunway Putra Hotel is the /first and only authentic Indonesian restaurant located within a hotel setting\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In July 2023, Sunway Resort Hotel completed its refurbishment, creating a full room inventory of 460 rooms.\n\nOccupancy rates at most of the main hotels in Malaysia achieved over 60% which is commendable considering that international tourists' arrivals are still slow.\n\n## Sunway Resort Hotel, Sunway Pyramid Hotel and Sunway Lagoon Hotel, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur\n\nSunway Resort Hotel underwent a transformative phase with a US$60 million investment which was completed in FY 2023, unveiling fresh facilities and family-oriented accommodations. Immersive  experiences  including  Waterventure,  Wonderland Explorers  and  a  rooftop  urban  farm,  in  collaboration  with Sunway XFarms, were introduced, enhancing the family-friendly environment. Special family rooms were also added and the addition of 17 private pool villas in a tropical garden brought a touch of exclusivity. In August 2023, a Spa & Wellness Centre was  introduced,  with  signature  massages  and  treatments using extracts from Bioessentials. The culinary scene was also enriched with the launch of Black Tap Craft Burgers & Shakes in March 2023 and the debut of Gordon Ramsay Street Pizza in September 2023 in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Black Tap Craft Burgers & Shakes opened in March 2023\n\nWith the full opening of all the rooms in Sunway Resort Hotel, the  hotel  introduced  the  Sunway  Moments  programme,  a Sunway Resort Hotel Exclusive Membership Programme which offers exceptional dining, accommodation and lifestyle bene/fits for its members. This is complemented with the launch of the Sunway Hotels & Resorts mobile application, a custom-built application that provides streamlined contactless check-in and check-out, introduced keyless /floor access and allowed guests to manage room settings through their mobile devices. These innovative features further enhanced guest experience at its /flagship hotel.\n\nIn  a  parallel  initiative,  the  division  also  implemented  Hey Sunway, a customer engagement solution, providing an AIenhanced platform for guests to connect live 24/7 on platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and Line applications.\n\n## Other Hotels\n\nThe Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat's renovation of its 4 Grand Garden  Villas  and  1  Royal  Villa  was  not  only  effective  in revitalising its accommodation offerings but also positioned it as a top-tier luxury retreat. During the year under review, The Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat diversi/fied its culinary offerings with the introduction of a Pizza Station, offering 30 different crafted pizzas and a unique gold-plated pizza. Furthermore, the reopening of On the Rocks caf\u00e9, serving as another outlet for a sunset aperitif, seeks to inject local culture to the retreat and also create a new pre-dinner outlet.\n\nUp  north,  Sunway  Hotel  Georgetown  and  Sunway  Hotel Seberang  Jaya  saw  an  improvement  in  their  occupancy rates at 81% and 71% respectively in FY 2023, showcasing positive market positioning and pro/fitability. The hotels forged successful partnerships with nearby business partners such as Entopia by the Penang Butter/fly Farm in Penang island and well-known brand, SuperDry, tailoring these collaborations to offer exclusive bene/fits and enhance guest experiences.\n\nSunway  Putra  Hotel  Kuala  Lumpur  focused  its  efforts  on defending  its  core  domestic  market  by  targeting  certain market sectors for both rooms and event business, while also pursuing  the  Free  Independent  Traveller  ('FIT')  segments from neighbouring countries. The strategy proved successful with  local  guests  contributing  57%  to  its  overall  revenue. Strategic measures like /flexible rates and the 'Book Direct & Save' campaign resulted in an increase in Internet Booking Engine ('IBE') growth for the hotel. These initiatives lowered reemployment costs, maintained staff retention and secured consistent service delivery for the division's hotels.\n\nSunway Big Box Hotel in Sunway City Iskandar Puteri also curated special accommodation packages in collaboration with Legoland Malaysia Resort to cater to its guests' demand and boost hotel occupancy.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nAs the Hospitality division looks toward the future, there is a collective focus on deliberate executions aimed at enhancing operational ef/ficiency, ensuring a consistent guest experience and embracing sustainable practices across its diverse portfolio. Across all the hotels, the deployment of adjustable rates is poised to elevate business yield, backed by accurate statistical reports and advanced monitoring software, while revenue diversi/fication will remain a key driver as the division venture into new markets, attract different guest segments and foster collaborations with reputable F&B vendors for diverse dining options.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  Hospitality  division  recognises  the signi/ficance of the domestic market and aims to capture this through enticing deals and packages via IBE for both business and leisure segments. Tactical advertisements on social media platforms and collaborations with key opinion leaders ('KOL') will further amplify the outreach.\n\nAdditionally, there is a concerted effort to tap into the intra-ASEAN market,  particularly  Singapore  and  Indonesia,  with  targeted packages, planned advertisements, and publicity through media and KOLs. This multifaceted approach is designed to increase bookings, optimise room rates, and maximise revenue.\n\nBeyond marketing and tactical adjustments, the division will maintain  a  disciplined  focus  on  cost  and  energy  savings  to safeguard healthy margins. Simultaneously, a robust strategy for  staff  retention,  encompassing  engagement,  growth  plans, and opportunities, will contribute to sustaining a consistent and exceptional guest experience.\n\nThe Hospitality division is satis/fied that these strategies, and the meticulous plans put in place to mitigate risks from talent attrition and socio-economic shocks, re/flect a sound approach toward sustained growth, operational excellence and heightened guest satisfaction for the division. The commitment to innovation, adaptability, and tactical partnerships will continue to position Sunway's  Hospitality  division  for  continued  success  in  the growing hospitality landscape.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Recognitions for Sunway Resort Hotel at the HAPA AWARDS Malaysian Series 2023-2024\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n## Sustainability Initiatives\n\nSunway's Hospitality division has made signi/ficant strides in adopting sustainable practices across its diverse portfolio. This  is  exempli/fied  by  the  elimination  of  print  media  in Sunway Velocity Hotel and Sunway Big Box Hotel, replacing it with digital directories on information TV systems. Guest feedback collection at Sunway Hotel Georgetown and Sunway Hotel Seberang Jaya have also transitioned to using QR codes for feedback forms in rooms, as well as department heads' lobby engagements, which successfully achieved a response rate of over 98% across platforms.\n\nAdditionally, the hotels continue to stay committed to waste reduction and proper waste channelling by donating used linen and certifying team members in handling scheduled waste. Some of the other sustainability initiatives which have been implemented over the years include the introduction of drinking water in glass bottles and reduction of singleuse  plastic  packaging  in  amenities  by  replacing  it  with larger re/fillable bottles with pump dispensers. These efforts have helped the division to achieve a notable reduction in plastic usage, while collaborations with local authorities and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in enhancing city cleanliness and sustainable food choices further emphasise the hotels' dedication to environmental stewardship.\n\nBeyond operational enhancements, Sunway Putra Hotel placed a strong emphasis on sustainability with the implementation of  solutions  such  as  the  adoption  of  interval-based  room servicing and the recycling of used cooking oil underscore the hotel's commitment to minimising its ecological footprint.\n\nMoreover,  the  division's  commitment  to  inclusivity  and social responsibility is demonstrated through the Job Coach Supported Employment programme at these hotels, resulting in the employment of two persons with disabilities ('PWD'). The receipt of an Energy Audit Conditional Grant for Sunway Pyramid Hotel and Sunway Lagoon Hotel further re/flects the hotels' commitment to energy ef/ficiency.\n\n## Awards and accolades\n\nMost of the hotels under the Hospitality division received TripAdvisor Travellers' Choice 2023 awards which recognised accommodations, attractions and restaurants that consistently earn great reviews from travellers and are ranked within the top 10% of properties on TripAdvisor. Sunway Hotel Georgetown Penang was also named Trip.com's Top Producing Hotel 2023 as a recognition of being the top room nights contributed in the year 2023. Furthermore, at the Talentbank Graduates' Choice  Awards  2023,  Sunway  City  Kuala  Lumpur  Hotels (Sunway Resort Hotel, Sunway Pyramid Hotel and Sunway Lagoon Hotel) were awarded /first runner-up in the Hotels category for Graduates' Choice of Employer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see page 15 for more information on Hospitality division's awards & accolades.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This led to interest rate hikes which in turn meant higher borrowing costs. The stronger US currency also affected import margins, while the slowdown of China's construction industry adversely impacted product demand.\n\nIn Malaysia, the domestic manufacturing sector ended the year on a decline largely due to continued weakness in the electrical and electronics industry, as well as a weaker export-oriented sector. The overall sales value of the domestic manufacturing sector totalled RM1.8 trillion in 2023, marking a marginal growth rate of 0.2% from 2022.\n\nThe Trading and Manufacturing division's strategic focus in FY 2023 centred on boosting sales performance while also adapting to  growing  demand  for  sustainability.  Among  the  strategies implemented  to  increase  the  division's  revenue  stream  was the introduction of new products and expanding its renewable energy product lines to support consumers' conversion to more environmentally friendly products.\n\nIn tandem  with  the  division's business expansion and sustainability  efforts,  workplace  safety  and  wellbeing  were continuously  prioritised.  A  new  Occupational  Health,  Safety and  Environment  ('OHSE')  of/ficer  was  appointed  to  oversee compliance and sustainability efforts for the division.\n\nFY 2023 also saw a noticeable growth in sustainability trends with more businesses adopting green practices, policies and products. However, there is still a signi/ficant gap between the growth of this environmentally friendly shift and the level of consumers' preparedness to adapt to this transition. As such, this gap posed a challenge for the division in terms of marketing the commercial electric  vehicles  (EV).  Internally,  additional  costs  were  also incurred in ensuring optimum sustainability compliance.\n\n- Please see page 40 for more information on the Trading and Manufacturing division's Strategic Snapshot.\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nGoing into FY 2024, manufacturers worldwide are expected to continue to face economic uncertainty along with skilled labour shortage,  supply  chain  disruptions  and  product  innovation challenges in meeting net-zero emissions goals. Technology is poised to play a signi/ficant role in supporting manufacturers through these challenges, with smart factory solutions eyed as key drivers of competitiveness over the next /five years.\n\nOn a positive note, FY 2024 looks to be a stronger rebound year for the domestic manufacturing sector with predicted upswings in  domestic  and  international  trade,  China's  manufacturing activities as well as the international technology sector. Overall, economic experts forecast a growth rate of at least 4% for the domestic manufacturing sector in 2024.\n\nHowever,  global  supply  chain  disruptions,  disintermediation and economic downturn remain ongoing risks. There is also a need to monitor the effects of regulatory changes such as the 6% to 8% service tax hike, which may affect competitiveness. The Trading and Manufacturing division will continue to enforce regular  monitoring  and  work  closely  with  the  other  Sunway Group divisions for synergies, diversify suppliers and establish alternative  supply  chain  routes,  and  explore  streamlining  its operations to optimise ef/ficiency and reduce costs.\n\nIn addition, the division continues to work on the expansion of its network either by acquiring or establishing joint ventures with other companies or even to diversify into new business services. Improved warehouse ef/ficiency is also a priority, with a capital expenditure budget of RM20 million allocated for the Automated Storage & Retrieval System at the new Winstar warehouse in Dengkil, Selangor, which is expected to be completed in 2025.\n\nNew Dongfeng EV and ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) models are in the works, with funding allocated to import more stocks from China to generate more sales.\n\nOn the technological front, the division is tapping into more digital initiatives to improve sales performance and enhance customers' experience. Among these are the development of a mobile ordering application for a smoother sales process. The division is also looking into adoption of the e-invoicing systems for operational ef/ficiencies.\n\nWith these plans in place, the Trading and Manufacturing division is well equipped to continue meeting the evolving product needs of the industry in FY 2024 and beyond.\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nThe Trading and Manufacturing division's product diversi/fication and sales-boosting measures proved to be a successful move as total sales for the year far exceeded the set target.\n\nCASE products have attained their peak performance levels since the acquisition of the CASE agency in 2015. Particularly noteworthy is the remarkable sales growth demonstrated by the CASE soil compactor, elevating its market leadership to the no. 2 spot in the soil compactor market.\n\nSuccessful  introduction  of  Dongfeng's  Light  Duty  Trucks ('LDT'), featuring optimised payload capacity and ef/ficiency, had a positive impact on overall sales for the year, despite experiencing a slight delay in its importation. Efforts to expand renewable energy products such as solar panels and inverters also helped to support the growth of the division's revenue stream in FY 2023.\n\nNotably, the division's effort to convert consumers of diesel forklifts to lithium-ion forklifts paid off with close to 145 units being sold and rented during the year under review, which contributed to over RM10 million revenue.\n\nSunway Winstar saw an increase in its portfolio of blockbuster products, from 15 to 19, attributable to increased market demand, which also enabled the company to surpass its initial sales target for these products by 33%.\n\nBeyond the commendable sales performance, the Trading and Manufacturing division also appointed a new OHSE of/ficer to enhance OSHE compliance and sustainability efforts. As a result, the division achieved an 'Excellent' score in OHSE compliance and 'Platinum' in OHSE best practices for 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Expanding the division's renewable energy products range with Huawei's FusionSolar Residential Smart PV Solutions\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The initiation of substantial infrastructure investments during this period stimulated industry growth, contributing to increased productivity and sales for the quarry division. However, the division encountered challenges due to sporadic road closures and operational restrictions during festive or holiday periods, necessitating temporary halts in quarry and premix operations. These disruptions posed challenges for maintaining consistent supply chains and affected the division's performance during the stoppages.\n\nDespite these challenges, the division demonstrated resilience as economic activities resumed after closures. The quarry division's response to the dynamic conditions led to /fluctuations in demand for products such as aggregates and premix. Navigating a balance between recurrent operational disruptions and increased demand, the division showcased adaptability in a landscape in/fluenced by  both  positive  infrastructure  developments  and  occasional challenges stemming from operational restrictions.\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nThe quarry division strategically navigated market dynamics through initiatives aimed at enhancing /financial performance and overall value creation. Ongoing exploration activities in the Northern region highlight  the  division's  commitment  to  expanding  its  network, fortifying market competitiveness, and growing a diversi/fied customer base. Simultaneously, collaborations with other ready-mix companies to establish new facilities within existing quarries aim to elevate sales capabilities and optimise operational costs, aligns with the division's broader strategy to solidify market positioning and ensure sustainable revenue streams.\n\nConcurrently, the division's proactive steps, such as collaborating with sizeable readymix and precast companies and securing partnerships with bitumen suppliers, exempli/fied its commitment to diversifying product offerings and securing strategic projects. These initiatives position the division as a versatile and competitive player in the construction materials market, contributing to long-term growth and pro/fitability while aligning with evolving market demands.\n\nIn FY 2023, the quarry division has prioritised initiatives to address environmental concerns and promote responsible business practices in line with the Group's sustainability ambitions. One signi/ficant stride was the implementation of drone technology at quarry sites, initiated in December 2023 and slated for completion by Q1 2024. The strategic deployment of drones for rockface surveillance and perimeter security not only contribute to operational ef/ficiency, enhancing site safety but also help in reducing the division's ecological footprint while offering a more precise understanding of operational landscapes.\n\nAdditionally, the quarry division further bolstered its commitment to Health, Safety and Environment with the introduction of the Hazard Spot & Report System (HSRS) across all operating sites in July 2023. This online platform empowers staff to report unsafe acts and conditions, fostering a culture of safety and environmental compliance.\n\nFurthermore,  the  division  embraced  technological  advancements for increased operational ef/ficiency by automating laboratory report preparation. System-generated mix design requests and automatic laboratory reports not only improved customer experience but also contributed to internal productivity gains, further underscoring the division's dedication to sustainability and environmental stewardship.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Please see page 41 for more information on the Quarry division's Strategic Snapshot.\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nIn FY 2023, the quarry division experienced a remarkable upswing in revenue and pro/fit before tax, surpassing the achievements of FY 2022. This can be attributed to a robust surge in demand and higher selling prices for aggregates and premix, particularly notable towards the second half of FY 2023 from the rollout of more construction and road maintenance projects.\n\nBeyond /financial accomplishments, the quarry division was also  recognised  as  a  trailblazer  in  the  Malaysian  quarry industry for its dedication to environmental responsibility. Its  Rawang  and  Hulu  Langat  sites  recently  received  the Malaysian  Government  Energy  Audit  Conditional  Grant ('EACG 2.0'). The EACG 2.0 grant is an energy ef/ficiency programme under the 12th Malaysia plan which provides /financial assistance to eligible commercial and industrial sectors to conduct energy audits in their sites. The grant will be a catalyst for the identi/fication and implementation of a comprehensive 3-year energy improvement plan for the Rawang and Hulu Langat sites.\n\n- By  leveraging  this  grant  to  proactively  address  energy consumption  and  environmental  impact,  Sunway's  quarry division  further  solidi/fies  its  role  as  an  industry  leader, contributing to the sustainable development of Malaysia's quarry sector.\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\nLooking ahead to the future of Malaysia's aggregates and premix industry, the quarry division anticipates promising prospects in FY 2024. Budget 2024 unveiled several commitments to infrastructure projects such as allocation of a substantial RM4.7 billion for the resumption of construction for five Light Rail Transit 3 (LRT3) stations and RM931 million for the expansion of the North-South Highway (PLUS) in Johor, this will augur well for the industry and the demand for aggregates and premix.\n\nThe quarry division is strategically positioning itself to capitalise on the expected growth in the construction and infrastructure sectors and has outlined strategic goals to fortify its position in the industry. A key focus is on mergers and acquisitions, with a commitment to actively seek opportunities that will expand the division's network in the Northern region. The division is also gearing up to strengthen its relationships with local authorities and encouraging robust partnerships to align its strategies with broader  objectives  of  infrastructure  development,  securing projects, and enhancing its standing in the industry.\n\nSimultaneously, the quarry division is committed to innovation in  product  development  and  strengthening  its  sustainability credentials. The division will persist in exploring avenues to enhance the special premix to ensure that the product meets the evolving requirements of high-value applications. Initiatives slated  for  the  upcoming  year  include  the  installation  of inverters for premix operations, which aligns with the division's commitment to reducing electricity costs and promoting ecofriendly practices.\n\nRecognising the integral role of human capital in its success, the  division  will  continue  to  invest  in  talent  development. Collaborations with local universities and institutions is in the works with the aim to attract and retain skilled individuals to the division, ensuring a dynamic and proficient workforce that contributes to the division's growth as it navigates the evolving landscape of the industry.\n\nWith these plans and priorities in place, the quarry division is well positioned to seize opportunities to drive the sustainable growth of the division in the dynamic aggregates and premix industry.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This,  in  turn,  has  directly  spurred  the performance of the Building Materials division.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  however,  the  division  continue  to  face headwinds from domestic and international factors which has slowed Malaysia's economic recovery as well as disruptions in the global supply chain. This has resulted instability in costs of key materials such as gas, fuel, cement, steel, and other raw materials, impacting the division's cost structure.\n\nAdding to the challenges, the current weak Malaysian Ringgit against  most  major  currencies  and  the  increase  in  cost  of /financing, with the Overnight Policy Rate ('OPR') set by Bank Negara Malaysia ('BNM') rising over 2022 and 2023 levels, lead to in/flationary pressures.\n\n## STRATEGIC RESPONSE\n\nIn  response  to  the  rising  costs  of  operations,  the  Building Materials division has adjusted its selling prices to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions and ensure the division's consistent earnings performance. Concurrently, the division has also intensi/fied credit control measures and rigorously assess customers' creditworthiness to manage liquidity risks.\n\nAside from /financial control measures, the division has placed a stronger focus on research and development ('R&D') to boost process ef/ficiency and product distinctiveness. This includes exploring the potential of adopting Arti/ficial Intelligence ('AI'), the Internet of Things ('IoT') and Machine Learning ('ML') technologies to augment internal processes and expand the use of digital collaborative tools to enhance engagement with both staff and customers.\n\nThe division has also sought to deepen its engagement with government agencies, suppliers and customers, particularly on knowledge sharing about Building Materials division's sustainable solutions. This is aimed to obtain early insights into evolving market trends and align swiftly with new government policies and directives, such as the Madani Economy, New Industrial Master Plan 2030 ('NIMP'), Malaysia Budget 2024 and the 12th Malaysia Plan.\n\nBeyond  supporting  national  development  goals,  the  division has also endeavoured to align its operations with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ('UNSDG'), focusing on Clean Water and Sanitation, Affordable and Clean Energy, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Sustainable Cities and Communities,  and  Responsible  Consumption  and  Production. Initiatives in carbon reduction, waste management, R&D and process improvements were pursued to not only enhance the division's brand reputation and market competitiveness, but also its environmental stewardship.\n\nIn addition to environmental and operational excellence, the Building  Materials  division  places  a  high  value  on  Human Capital.  The  division  is  committed  to  fostering  teamwork, engagement, career development, training and talent retention at all levels. Safety at work remains a paramount concern, with the implementation of ISO 45001 and adherence to various Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  ('OSHA') requirements and best practices prioritised at all times. These measures ensure that the working environment is both safe and conducive,  underpinning  the  division's  holistic  approach  to sustainability, operational ef/ficiency and employee well-being.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Please see page 42 for more information on the Building Materials division's Strategic Snapshot.\n\n## FUTURE ORIENTATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 VCP project at Langat Centralised Sewerage Treatment Plant, Kajang\n- \u25b6 Eurotiles: Florana and Cabana\n\nThe Building Materials division enters FY 2024 with cautious optimism,  closely  aligning  its  strategies  with  the  recovery trajectory of Malaysia's economy and staying abreast of new market trends.\n\nDespite  the  challenges  posed  by  local  and  global  economic uncertainties,  the  division  anticipates  an  increase  in  federal and state government spending, which could provide signi/ficant opportunities for growth. Nevertheless, challenges are expected to persist in FY 2024 due to continued supply chain disruptions, raw material price volatility and the rising cost of /financing, exacerbated by the increase in Sales & Service Tax (SST) from 6% to 8% effective from 1 March 2024.\n\nThe division is poised to adapt its strategy to navigate these complexities. Strategic measures to mitigate these risks include enhancing procurement management practices to counter supply chain  disruptions  and  improving  inventory  management  to safeguard pro/fit margins against cost /fluctuations. Strengthening cash /flow management to minimise working capital requirements will also be a priority.\n\nIn FY 2024, the Building Materials division intends to intensify its growth through cost reduction initiatives, exploring alternative markets,  and  deploying  AI,  IoT  and  ML  to  lower  product costs  without  compromising  product  integrity.  Additionally, the  division  plans  to  increase  product  and  brand  awareness through participation in exhibitions and seeking new business partnerships to facilitate entry into overseas markets.\n\nContinued engagement with suppliers, customers and authorities will  remain  a  fundamental  pillar  to  the  Building  Materials division's  growth  strategy.  This  includes  advocating  for  the acceptance of new product speci/fications and quality standards among government agencies for ICP, VCP and Spun Pile products and services. Parallel to these efforts, continuous research and development will be employed to enhance product quality, extend the product range, and increase production capacity to meet rising demands.\n\nThe division will also seek to leverage commercial and business synergies across Sunway's diverse business divisions, utilising the strengths of these entities to derive further cost and operational ef/ficiencies.\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nThe Building Materials division's efforts in pursuing innovation and R&D has yielded signi/ficant bene/fits, leading to reduced production  costs,  enhanced  product  differentiation  and forti/fied brand positioning.\n\nNotably, the division has achieved cost reductions in spun pile production through the use of /fly ash and enhanced the manufacturing ef/ficiency of vitri/fied clay pipe ('VCP') by optimising /firing times and is expected to further improve production ef/ficiency by reducing gas consumption, changes in using inverter motors to reduce the carbon footprint from the production process.\n\nFurthermore, its pavers products were developed with an algae-resistant solution to minimise maintenance expenses and it is also a green product that boast high Solar Re/flective Indexes. These innovative solutions and advantages have led  to  enhanced  product  differentiation  and  heightened product integrity, while the division's adoption of solar energy harvesting further diminished its reliance on grid electricity.\n\nMarketing  initiatives  carried  out  in  FY  2023  have  also enhanced brand loyalty towards its Interlocking Concrete Pavers ('ICP') and Eurotiles products, resulting in increased ICP  sales  conversions  with  various  city  councils  and customers.\n\nCollectively, these strategic endeavours have gone a long way  to  reinforce  the  Building  Materials  division's  image as a corporate leader in environmental responsibility that is attuned to market demands and aligned with national and  global  carbon  reduction  goals,  bolstering  its  market competitiveness and improved margins.\n\nBeyond product innovation and sales achievements, the Building  Materials  division  has  seen  operational improvements through the deployment of digital collaborative tools and the Eliminate, Simplify, Standardise and Automate (ESSA) initiatives, leading to reduced reliance on manpower and enhanced process ef/ficiency.\n\nThe division also reported improved workplace safety and enhanced Occupational Health and Safety (OHSA) compliance over the past year, which facilitated the attainment of ISO 45001 certi/fication for Sunway Paving Solutions Sdn Bhd and Sunway Spun Pile (M) Sdn Bhd.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25b6 Spun pile plant at Batang Kali\n- \u25b6 Spun pile project at Gamuda Cove, Selangor\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is his /firm belief that given the state of the planet and its people, implementing the sustainable development agenda is no longer just an option but an urgent imperative and that 'we can all do well by doing good'.\n\nTan Sri Sir Dr. Jeffrey Cheah's business success enabled him to realise his lifelong dream of setting up a Foundation dedicated to nation-building and giving back to society.\n\nRooted in his conviction that education offers the best route out of poverty and misery, he established the JCF in 2010 by gifting it, in perpetuity, his entire stake in the Sunway Education Group (' SEG ').

To achieve  this,  we  have  established  a  governance  framework that de/fines clear lines of accountability and responsibility, facilitating seamless information sharing, swift decision-making, and focused oversight. Adhering to this framework allows us to maintain transparency, align our actions with our values, and be accountable to our stakeholders.\n\nOur governance systems and processes support the development and execution of our strategy by ensuring accountability and responsibility,  facilitating  information  sharing  for  informed Board decisions, establishing engagement programs with key stakeholders, maintaining a strong system of risk oversight, management,  and  effective internal controls, providing independent  insight  and  knowledge  from  Non-Executive Directors, and facilitating the development and monitoring of key performance indicators.\n\nThe Board adheres to a comprehensive schedule that exclusively reserves certain matters for its approval, as outlined in the Board Charter, available on our website. The Board Charter and the Committees'  terms of reference are regularly reviewed and revised to ensure their effectiveness and compliance with regulators' requirements. To enhance the /flow of information, Directors utilise an advanced electronic Board paper system, ensuring immediate and secure access to crucial documents. The Chairman and committee chairs collaborate with the Company Secretaries to set agendas, ensuring timely, comprehensive, and manageable information for the Board's deliberations.\n\nAll papers presented adhere to a clear and concise format, with supporting materials included as appendices. In some instances, report presenters join Board discussions, enabling Directors to pose questions directly and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matters. Additionally, Directors have access to the Company Secretaries' services and may initiate procedures to obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense, as necessary.\n\n## BOARD ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n| Co-Chairmen                                 | The Executive Chairman provides leadership to the Board and guidance to the Group.

Additionally, they are available to support  all Directors. |\n\n## BOARD KEY FOCUS AREAS AND FUTURE PRIORITIES\n\n## Board Renewal\n\nDuring the year under review, the Board had appointed Datuk Mohd Anuar bin Taib as an Independent Director on 7 July 2023. Tan Sri Jamaludin bin Ibrahim had resigned as an Independent Director on 3 March 2024. The changes in the Board members will refresh and enhance the appropriate balance of experience, expertise and diversity of the Board.\n\n## Compliance Framework of the Group\n\nIn a continuous effort to improve the Group's risk management, the Group had, with the assistance of KPMG Management & Risk Consulting Sdn Bhd, established and adopted a compliance and risk management framework to manage the risks across the Group.\n\n## Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050\n\nThe Group continues with its initiatives to achieve the 'Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050' goal.\n\nThe Group has appointed The Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development (' JSC ') to conduct a Value at Risk (' VaR ') assessment on all its 74 properties to assess the Group's physical risk exposure to climate change. Based on the climate VaR study, Sunway will continue to monitor all properties closely to ensure that they are safe against material climaterelated physical risks (/floods, increased rainfall intensity, landslides) and put in place mitigation measures as appropriate. To prepare for the potential transitional risks from climate-related issues, the Group has established an Internal Carbon Pricing framework and set an internal carbon price at RM15 per tonne of CO 2 e emitted above a threshold level based on the respective business divisions. Management has also included the respective CO 2 e threshold level set as a key performance indicator of the business divisions and any breach of the carbon emission threshold will have an impact on their respective year-end bonus pool.\n\nIn 2023, the Group had introduced incentives under its Internal Carbon Pricing framework for renewable energy and waste diversion as well as appointed the JSC to enhance the VaR assessment through conducting a refreshed /flood risk modelling for the Group's properties and quantify the /financial impacts of climate change.\n\nSunway is committed to deepening our understanding of the climaterelated potential risks and opportunities, and investing in strategies and actions that will prudently mitigate material risks and enhance our business position as a provider of high-quality green and sustainable products and services.\n\n## Executive Directors and Management's Key Performance Indicators ('KPIs')\n\nThe Company has integrated sustainability and carbon pricing into the Executive Directors' and Senior Management's performance evaluations and KPIs that are linked to their remuneration. The KPIs are aligned to the Sunway Sustainability 2030 Goals and Targets.\n\n## Management Advisory Committee on Digital\n\nAs part of the Group's digital transformation initiatives, the Management Advisory Committee will explore and advise the Board on digital initiatives and new digital businesses.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nDirectors are obligated to steer clear of situations that might pose a direct or indirect con/flict with the interests of the Group, whether perceived or real. They must not allow personal or business interests to impede their duties. In adherence to this policy, the Board has instituted a clear and transparent  guideline  that  prohibits  a  Director from participating in the deliberation and voting process  when  a  con/flict/potential  con/flict  of interest arises/may arise.\n\nBefore  each  signi/ficant  Board  decision,  the Chairman ensures that the Directors con/firm the absence of any personal con/flict concerning the matter under discussion. In cases where a con/flict is identi/fied, the concerned Director is excused from  the  discussion,  and  their  declaration  of interest is duly recorded in the meeting minutes.\n\n## INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nThe Board upholds a formalised Code of Conduct and Business Ethics Policy (' Code ') to provide an  ethical  framework  guiding  the  actions  and behaviours of Directors and employees. This Code re/flects the Company's dedication to maintaining the  highest  standards  of  integrity  and  ethical conduct  across  all  operations.  In  addition, the  Company  has  instituted  a  comprehensive Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures, allowing employees and stakeholders to promptly report suspected wrongdoing, inappropriate behaviour, or misconduct related to fraud, corrupt practices, or abuse.\n\nThe  objective  of  this  policy  and  procedure  is to  establish  a  mechanism  for  employees  and stakeholders  of  the  Group  to  report  concerns without fear of retaliation, enabling Management to  take  appropriate  action.  To  facilitate  the disclosure of any improper conduct, employees or members of the public can report such behaviour through  the  designated  channels  outlined  in the policy. The Company values all disclosures and ensures that they are handled with utmost con/fidentiality and sensitivity.\n\n| Whistleblowing hotlines               |\n|---------------------------------------|\n| Tel:  +603 5639 8025                  |\n| E-mail:  whistleblowing@sunway.com.my |\n| Fax:  +603 5639 8027                  |\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a testament to  our  commitment  to  ethical  business  conduct,  we  have implemented  a  comprehensive  Anti-Bribery  and  Corruption Policy and Procedures (' ABC Policy ') alongside an Anti-Money Laundering Policy and Procedures (' AML Policy '). These policies serve  as  guidance  and  outline  procedures  for  all  employees and business associates within the Group, ensuring their full\n\nawareness of obligations and responsibilities in adhering to these policies.\n\nOur employees are mandated to implement measures to prevent money laundering within our businesses, following the guidelines set forth in the AML Policy. To ensure the ef/ficacy of these policies, the Risk Management Committee (' RMC ') provides oversight and monitoring of both the ABC Policy and AML Policy.\n\n- Further details of the Code, Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures, ABC Policy and AML Policy are set out in the Corporate Governance Report (' CG Report '). The Code, Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures, ABC Policy, AML Policy and the CG Report are available at the Company's website at www.sunway.com.my.\n\n## BOARD APPOINTMENTS, SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE\n\n## Appointments to the Board\n\nThe Group is dedicated to ensuring that appointments to our Board are merit-based, comply with the Board's '/fit and proper' policy, with the primary goal of ensuring directors' integrity and  professionalism while maintaining the appropriate balance of  skills,  experience,  and  knowledge  to effectively  shape  the  Group's  strategy. Recommendations  for  appointments  are reviewed  by  the  NRC,  considering  the advantages  of  diversity  in  its  broadest sense,  encompassing  personal  strengths and gender. Our aim is to cultivate a diverse Board, fostering a culture of openness and transparency that we deem crucial to our success  in  a  rapidly  changing  business landscape.\n\n## Professional Training\n\nA robust and agile Board plays a pivotal role in the success of our organisation. At Sunway, we prioritise the composition of our Board, ensuring it consists of a diverse and highly skilled team capable of steering the Group towards longterm growth and prosperity.\n\nOperating in a continuously evolving landscape, it is imperative that our Executive  and  Independent  Directors  possess  the  knowledge  and  skills necessary to navigate forthcoming challenges and opportunities. We are dedicated to keeping our Directors well-informed on the latest developments, trends, and best practices in corporate governance, regulatory compliance, and other relevant areas.\n\nTo ful/fill this commitment, we have implemented various initiatives, including regular  training  sessions,  knowledge-sharing  forums,  and  brie/fings  from subject matter experts.

The potential candidates' readiness was closely tracked through a structured and systematic leadership program in order to provide orderly management succession. All Senior Management have one or more potential successors in one or more of these stages of readiness i.e., ready now, ready soon or ready later.\n\nIn managing talents and succession planning, annual talent  reviews  were  conducted  across  the  Group, culminating in the review of key management positions\n\nby the Talent Council, led by the President. This annual exercise comprehensively reviews the succession plans for all key management positions, including the leadership and growth potential, and development plans for the identi/fied successors. These key management pro/files were reviewed with the Group Chairman prior to the Group Human Resources Of/ficer's presentation to the NRC for endorsement, on 22 November 2023.\n\n- \u00b7  Reviewed and discussed the performance appraisal of the Executive Directors and Key Senior Management for 2023 (i.e. actual results for /first 9 months and forecasted results for the balance 3 months).

An annual performance evaluation is systematically conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. This evaluation ensures that each Director demonstrates a dedicated commitment to his/her responsibilities and possesses the necessary time and competence to ful/fill his/her duties effectively.\n\n## ANNUAL BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEES EVALUATION\n\nThe NRC undertakes an annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Board, the Board Committees and each Director's performance by way of self and peer evaluation. This includes a review of the desirable mix of competencies, quali/fication, knowledge, skills, expertise and personal traits of the Directors in order to identify any gaps that may exist in the optimum mix of skills required for the Board. In addition, Directors were subject to /fit and proper assessment to ensure each individual Director has the necessary integrity and honesty to govern the Company.\n\nSince the Board had engaged an independent consultant to conduct the Board & Directors Effectiveness Evaluation exercise for the /financial year 2021, the evaluation process for year 2023 was assessed internally and facilitated by the Company Secretaries. As part of the process, survey questionnaires were sent to the Directors, and the results were aggregated and reported to the NRC. All assessments carried out by the NRC were properly documented, summarised and reported to the Board. The results of the survey and recommendations of the NRC were discussed by the Board and follow-up improvements were taken, where necessary, with a view to enhancing its effectiveness.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The assessment criteria and outcome are summarised as follows:\n\n| Evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Assessment Criteria   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Board mix, composition and development, Board dynamic and effectiveness, conduct of  board meetings, roles and responsibilities, company performance, performance of Chairman,  performance of President, Board sustainability matters. | Board Evaluation      |\n| Board Committee Evaluation Committee composition, quality, skills and competencies, roles and responsibilities, effective                                                                                                               |                       |\n| Director's Peer Evaluation Director's /fit and proper criteria, contribution and performance, individual competencies and                                                                                                               |                       |\n| Independent Directors'  The criteria set under paragraph 1.01 of the MMLR of Bursa Securities.                                                                                                                                          | Self-Assessment       |\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nThe Directors concluded that the Board was effective in its governance and strategic roles and had ful/filled its statutory responsibilities ef/ficiently.

All the Board Committees were assessed to be effective in discharging their roles and responsibilities in accordance to the approved TORs.\n\nMajority of the Board members had shown their time commitment by attending all the meetings scheduled. Directors who were not able to attend due to urgent unforeseen circumstances were kept abreast of the matters discussed. The Board planned to engage independent experts to facilitate its annual assessment every three (3) years.\n\n## REMUNERATION\n\nThe Group acknowledges the importance of offering a fair and competitive remuneration package to attract and retain Executive Directors and Senior Management. This package is designed to align with their quali/fications, experience, skills, responsibilities, performance and contributions as well as benchmark with industry peers. To determine this remuneration, the Group considers the framework and guidelines provided by an independent consultant, incorporating market data on remuneration practices among comparable peers in the industry. The structure is based on linking rewards to both corporate and individual performance. The performance and remuneration package of the Executive Directors are subject to the evaluation of the NRC.\n\nFor Independent Non-Executive Directors, including the Non-Executive Chairman, their remuneration re/flects their knowledge, experience and level of responsibilities. Additionally, it is benchmarked against industry peers of similar size and complexity with the Group's businesses. The remuneration for Independent Non-Executive Directors comprises /fixed annual Directors' fees, Board Committees' fees, and meeting allowances for each Board or Board Committee meeting attended.\n\nThe determination of fees for the Non-Executive Directors is undertaken by the Board, with individual Directors abstaining from decisions regarding their individual remuneration. Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (' AGM ') of the Company approve the fees and allowances payable to Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Chairman receives an annual Directors' fee of RM360,000, while other Non-Executive Directors are entitled to RM120,000 per individual per year. Meeting allowances are set at RM1,000 per individual per meeting.\n\nIn addition to the Directors' fees, the Chairperson and members of the following Board Committees are entitled to the following fees in respect of their roles and responsibilities as outlined in their respective terms of reference, as approved by the shareholders at the Eleventh AGM of the Company held on 14 September 2021:\n\n|     | Chairperson   | Member   |\n|-----|---------------|----------|\n| AC  | RM25,000      | RM15,000 |\n| RMC | RM10,000      | RM5,000  |\n| NRC | RM10,000      | RM5,000  |\n\nThe Board Committees' fees are subject to the shareholders' approval at the AGM. The fees will be reviewed as and when the need arises. The Board Committees' fees are payable annually together with the payment of the Directors' fees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe details of the Directors' remuneration for the /financial year 2023 are disclosed in the CG Report which is available in the Company's website at www.sunway.com.my.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Key audit matters were matters of most signi/ficance in the audit of the /financial statements of the Group and the Company. The AC had reviewed the process and procedures performed and was satis/fied that the accounting estimates and signi/ficant judgement applied were appropriate. For the /financial year under review, the External Auditors had identi/fied the following as key audit matters:-\n\n- i)   Revenue recognition for property development\n\nRevenue from sale of properties under development is  recognised  over  the  period  of  contracts  with customers using the input method by reference to the costs incurred for work performed to-date against the  estimated  costs  to  completion.  Management is required  to  exercise  signi/ficant judgements in  determining  the  satisfaction  of  performance\n\nobligations as stated in the contracts with customers, transaction price allocation and costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time.\n\nDuring the review of quarterly management accounts and quarterly /financial results to be released to Bursa Securities,  the  AC  reviewed  and  discussed  with Management, the basis used for the recognition of revenue from the sale of properties under development for all its signi/ficant property development activities both local and overseas projects. At each meeting, the  CFO  highlighted  the  areas  where  signi/ficant estimates  and  critical  judgements  were  made  in ascertaining  the  quantum  and  timing  of  revenue recognised.\n\n- ii)  Revenue recognition for construction contracts\n\nRevenue from construction contracts is recognised over the period of contracts with customers using the output method which recognises revenue on the basis of certi/fication of contract work performed todate over the estimated total contract sum.\n\nManagement  is  required  to  exercise  signi/ficant judgements  in  estimating  the  progress  towards complete  satisfaction  of  performance  obligations and determining whether there is any exposure to Liquidated  Ascertained  Damages  (' LAD ')  based on  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  relevant construction projects, including projects that had been served with certi/ficates of non-achievement for project delays, if any.\n\nDuring the review of quarterly management accounts and quarterly /financial results to be released to Bursa Securities,  the  AC  reviewed  and  discussed  with Management, the basis used for the recognition of revenue  for  construction  contracts  under  Sunway Construction Group Berhad. Management continued to  closely  monitor  relevant  indicators  including potential  exposures  to  project  delays  and  LADs, supply chain disruption and labour shortage which would in/fluence the estimates used in arriving at the  Group's  reported  revenue  from  construction contracts. At each quarterly meeting, the CFO had highlighted areas where there were potential LADs and areas where signi/ficant estimates and critical judgements were made in ascertaining contract sums including variation orders, claims or contingencies.\n\n- iii)  Valuation  of  derivative  liabilities  on  exit  clauses in  relation  to  the  partial  divestment  of  Sunway Healthcare  Holdings  Sdn  Bhd  (' SHH ')  and  its subsidiaries (' SHH Group ')\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDerivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial  divestment  of  SHH  Group  represent  the  exit clauses attached to the Shareholders' Agreement and Share  Subscription  Agreement  entered  between  the Company, Sunway City Sdn Bhd (' SunCity '), SHH and Greenwood Capital Pte Ltd (' Greenwood ') following the divestment of 16% equity interest in SHH to Greenwood by  SunCity.  Management  is  required  to  exercise signi/ficant judgements in determining the fair values of the derivative liabilities on the exit clauses and is subject to estimation uncertainty as subjective variables need to be used by Management in order to derive the fair values.\n\nDuring the review of quarterly management accounts and quarterly /financial results to be released to Bursa Securities, the AC  reviewed  and  discussed  with Management, the basis used for the determination of the fair values of the derivative liabilities on the exit clauses.

Audit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group  Internal  Audit  Department  ('GIAD')  carries  out internal audits on divisions and operating units of the Group based on a risk-based audit plan approved annually by the AC. Quarterly reports are submitted to the AC highlighting observations, recommendations, and action plans to improve the Group's internal control system. The AC reviews and deliberates on any matters relating to internal control highlighted by the External Auditors in the course of their statutory audit of the /financial statements of the Group. Additionally, subsidiaries accredited with certi/fications are audited by auditors of relevant certi/fication bodies. Results of these audits are reported to management.\n\n## 3. Risk Management\n\nThe  Group's  risk  management  framework  is  benchmarked against  the  ISO31000:2018  Risk  Management-Guidelines, and is designed to embed Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') into key activities, initiatives and processes of the Group.\n\nOperating subsidiaries are tasked with reporting major risks on a quarterly basis to management as it aims for a holistic approach towards risk management. The respective operating subsidiaries being risk owners of their immediate sphere are responsible to develop the appropriate actions and strategies to mitigate risks.\n\nIn providing assurance to the RMC and the Board, the Group Risk and Compliance Department ('GRC'), continues to review the quarterly risk reports to assist in identifying and mitigating all  major  risks  of  the  operating  subsidiaries  in  the  Group. The quarterly risk reports from all operating subsidiaries are consolidated and reported to the RMC, highlighting major risks and mitigating controls carried out.\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL\n\n## Components of the Internal Control System\n\nThe reporting structure is as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe RMC meets quarterly to deliberate on top risks identi/fied, and the Chairperson subsequently updates the Board on proceedings from the RMC. Internal control and risk related matters are recommended to the Board for deliberation or approval, while matters and decisions made within the purview of the RMC are escalated to the Board for notation.\n\nThe GRC is accountable for effectiveness of the risk management framework and is independent of the risk owners. The risks owners i.e., the respective heads of operating subsidiaries have insights of respective businesses and are able to actively identify, mitigate and monitor the identi/fied risks through decisions and actions.\n\nConsequently, the GRC undertakes the role of assisting operating subsidiaries by identifying, quantifying, managing and mitigating critical risks, in addition to monitoring and reporting action plans prepared by the operating subsidiaries. In line with the Group's governance process, the GRC also collaborates with other support functions such as Group Brand Marketing & Communication,\n\nGroup Finance, Group Internal Audit, Group IT, Group Legal, Group Procurement, Group Secretarial and Group Sustainability.\n\nIn  2022  the  RMC  and  the  Board  had  recommended  the appointment of KPMG Management & Risk Consulting Sdn Bhd, to establish the Group Compliance Framework with an aim to review the Group's compliance towards all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies, operational guidelines and procedures.\n\nThis  was  followed  by  KPMG's  maturity  assessment  and  gap analysis in 2023 to identify the resource requirement, industry benchmarks and an application roadmap. Improvement opportunities were identi/fied towards key components of the Group's  existing  compliance  functions  such  as  governance, culture, policies and procedures, compliance processes, people and skills and training. This roadmap was endorsed by the Board in August 2023 and its application is in progress.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These were presented to the RMC where controls, mitigating plans and monitoring mechanisms were highlighted.\n\n## External Risks\n\nThe external risks to the Group are competition, disruption to the supply chain, inflation, interest rate and foreign exchange.\n\nThe disruption to global trade and supply chain brought by the US-China trade tension and geopolitical conflicts in Europe and Middle East resulted in increase in fuel prices and building material, increasing costs of doing business. In mitigating this risk, the Group took measures such as reviewing its supply chain, adding alternative suppliers, improving its efficiency in doing business and enhancing synergies within the Group.\n\nInflationary pressures impacted the disposable incomes and spending patterns of consumers. The Group, especially property development, leisure and hospitality, addresses this risk through targeted and value adding offerings and products that meet the requirements of customers.\n\n## People Risks\n\nThe  Group  continues  to  focus  on  attracting,  developing and  retaining  talent  as  part  of  its  succession  planning and strengthening of the leadership pipeline. Emphasis is placed to promote and provide learning and development opportunities,  to  further  improve  the  Group's  talent management structure and for the employees to achieve their full potential.\n\nIn 2023, the Group's efforts in mitigating human capital risks include the creation of pipelines with technical schools and community colleges to counter the shortage of frontline and skilled workers. Human Resource systems were updated and enhanced with process automation to encourage self service to increase productivity and upskilling on digital capabilities.\n\nOccupational  Health,  Safety  and  Environment  ('OSHE') remains an integral part of the Group's operational values. The Group's OHSE Policy was /first announced in 2021, which set a roadmap to drive OHSE-related dialogues and\n\nThe  change  in  weather  patterns  that  led  to  increased rainfall,  less-predictable  dry/wet  season,  flooding  and soil  movements  present  risks  to  the  Group's  assets, property development and construction businesses. The Group continues to mitigate these through enhanced risk management framework in areas such as site selection, civil, structural and architectural designs and maintenance management philosophy.\n\nSynergistically, the Group stand to gain via competitive costs and pricing while offering bespoke, enhanced quality, value added and sustainable products and services. The Group remains committed to enhance its position as a model corporation in sustainable development, as seen by the transformation of its three integrated townships into low carbon sustainable cities.\n\nefforts across the Group. Guided by the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994, the policy outlines the roles and responsibilities of every staff across all levels, as well as to establish international best practices as the foundation of Sunway's safety culture.\n\nIn place is a robust process in identifying and mitigating operational safety risks. Accident statistics, site inspection reports, and employee feedback are used to conduct hazard identi/fication. The risk assessment and risk control reports highlight  work-related  hazards  which  may  cause  highconsequence injuries.\n\nThe  Group  OHSE  Council,  chaired  by  Sunway  Group President  undertakes  and  oversees  the  development  of the OHSE framework, including the setting of the OHSE direction, objectives, targets and guidelines and procedures. The Council meets once every 3 months to address OHSE matters at Group and business division levels.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL\n\n## Value Chain Risks\n\nThe Group's borrowings and foreign exchange exposures are updated to the RMC on a quarterly basis. For the /financial year under review, the loan covenants are within the set requirements, while interest rate and foreign exchange risks are mitigated.\n\nThe Group's interest rate risk arises primarily from interest bearing  borrowings.  The  Group  manages  its  interest  rate exposure by maintaining a mix of /fixed and /floating rate borrowings. The Group also entered into interest rate swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the /floating  rate  interest  payable  on  certain  borrowings.  The Group closely monitors the interest rate and foreign exchange movements arising from the respective interest rate benchmark reforms in various jurisdictions. For the period under review, the Group's interest rate swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts are not materially affected by any interest rate benchmark reforms.\n\nThe Group is not signi/ficantly exposed to foreign currency risks as the majority of the Group's transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in Ringgit Malaysia except for foreign currency risk arising from certain foreign subsidiaries' operations. These include the Singapore Dollar, United States Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Australian Dollar, British Pound Sterling and Indian Rupee. Foreign currency exposures in transactional currencies other than functional currencies of the operating entities are kept to an acceptable level. Wherever possible, the Group applies a natural hedge, by borrowing in the currency of the country in which the property or investment is located or by borrowing in currencies that match the revenue stream to be generated from its investments.\n\nMaterial foreign currency transaction exposures are hedged, primarily with derivative /financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts. Cross  currency  swap  contracts  are  entered  to  manage foreign currency risk exposures arising from foreign currency borrowings and minimise interest costs.\n\n## Regulatory Risks\n\nThe  Group  remains  committed  in  mitigating  risks  of  noncompliance to all applicable rules or regulations which its business units or joint ventures are subjected to, such as, interalia, anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism /financing, competition, personal data protection, economic sanctions and environmental and health and safety laws. Impact from new laws and regulations or updates to existing laws and regulations are assessed to ensure compliance under normal operative conditions. Policies and procedures which form part of the Internal Control System are periodically reviewed to ensure relevance, applicability and to reduce the Group's exposure to potential legal liabilities and minimise any adverse impact arising from non-compliance.\n\nThe Group adopted a multi directional effort in establishing policies and roadmaps to mitigate value chain risks such as potential  supply  chain  disruptions,  use  of  non-sustainable materials which could impact the Group's drive in sustainable practices and non-compliance of suppliers and vendors against the Group's practices or policies. The Group's Sustainability Policy was developed and communicated to stakeholders to align the Group's practices and activities with the core pillar of ensuring business, social and environmental sustainability. The Group remains focused on minimising its contribution towards climate change and environmental impact through responsible resource  management,  pollution  control  and  Group-wide awareness and accountability.\n\nDigitalisation of the Group's value chain processes has enabled risk mitigation in terms of process integration, data management and  security,  increased  ef/ficiency  and  enhanced  decision making. This enabled seamless and improved coordination with suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers.\n\n## Digital Infrastructure Risks\n\nThe Group's digital infrastructure is constantly updated and innovated  upon  to  ensure  the  Group  remains  competitive, compliant, and relevant. The Group Cybersecurity function plays a crucial role in establishing strategic governance, mitigating risks, and ensuring cybersecurity compliance across the Group. The cybersecurity measures of the Group are managed by the respective Business Units' IT functions, which are responsible for implementing and adhering to the Group Cybersecurity Policy to ensure a robust security posture throughout the entire Group. Both the IT functions and Group Cybersecurity report to the Group Chief Information Of/ficer (CIO).\n\nSunway Digital Hub is certi/fied with ISO 27001:2013, an international standard for Information Security Management System (ISMS). This standard provides a framework of policies and procedures that determine legal, physical and technical controls in Sunway's information risk management. To ensure the Group's Information Security is effective, Sunway Digital Hub conducts regular assessments, phishing simulation and an annual disaster recovery simulation test to examine the ef/ficacy of the disaster recovery plan. Sunway Digital Hub is audited internally and by an external third party, as required by ISO 27001:2013.\n\nIn 2023, the Group Cybersecurity Policy was formulated in view of increasing cyber threats and attacks that could potentially endanger the Group. The policy covers all information system environments  which  includes  documentation,  physical  and logical controls, personnel, hardware, cloud workloads, software and information. The policy outlines the responsibilities at Group Cybersecurity, business divisions, employees and third parties to ensure compliance towards this policy.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nIndependence and Other Ethical Responsibilities\n\nWe are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ('By-Laws') and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ('IESBA Code'), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## (a) Revenue recognition for property development\n\nRevenue from sale of properties under development during the financial year as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements is RM1,378,094,000.\n\nWe determined this to be a key audit matter because it requires management to exercise significant judgements in determining the satisfaction of performance obligations as stated in the contracts with customers, transaction price allocations and costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time.\n\nThe Group identifies performance obligations that are distinct and material, which are judgmental in the context of contracts. Transaction prices are determined based on estimated profit margins prior to its allocation to the identified performance obligations.\n\nThe Group also estimates total contract costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time. In estimating the total costs to complete, the Group considers the completeness and accuracy of its costs estimation, including its obligations to contract variations, claims and cost contingencies.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations is measured using the output method, which is based on contract work certified to date over the estimated total contract sum.\n\nIn estimating the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations, the Group considers the estimated contract work completed to date and the completeness and accuracy of its estimated total contract sum, including contract variations, claims and contingencies.\n\n## Audit response\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- (i) inspected documentation to support the estimated total contract sum and correspondences from contract customers in relation to variations and claims to corroborate key judgements applied by management;\n- (ii) inspected documentation certified by professional consultants to support the contract work performed by the Group to-date;\n- (iii) recomputed the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations determined by management for revenue recognition based on contract work certified to-date and budgeted total contract sum;\n- (iv) inquired in-house operational and financial personnel of the Group to assess the merits of extension of time submitted to the contract customers for assessing the exposure to LAD; and\n- (v) inspected relevant correspondences and reports, including on-going negotiations with contract customers for the late delivery of contract works.\n\n## Key Audit Matters (contd.)\n\n- (c) Valuation of derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of Sunway Healthcare Holdings Sdn. Bhd. and its subsidiaries ('SHH Group')\n\nDerivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group represent the exit clauses attached to the Shareholders' Agreement ('SHA') and Share Subscription Agreement ('SSA') entered between the Company, Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. ('SunCity'), SHH and Greenwood Capital Pte. Ltd. ('Greenwood') following the partial divestment of 16% equity interest in SHH to Greenwood by SunCity as disclosed in Note 26 to the financial statements. The Company, SunCity, SHH and Greenwood had entered into a SHA to define the rights and obligations of the shareholders of SHH. As at 31 December 2023, the fair value of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group amounted to RM223,868,000.\n\nThe determination of the fair values of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group is a key audit matter because it involves significant judgements and is subject to estimation uncertainty as subjective variables need to be used by management in order to derive the fair values. The key inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair values include the probabilities of occurrence of the Proposed IPO, probabilities of achieving the desired Proposed IPO valuation, timing of the occurrence of Proposed IPO and discount rate.\n\n## Audit response\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- (i) read and discussed with management on the contractual terms of the SSA and SHA to gain an understanding of the terms in the SSA and SHA;\n- (ii) evaluated the appropriateness of the key inputs and assumptions used in deriving the fair values of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group;\n- (iii) obtained computations of management in deriving the fair values of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group and compared the key inputs used against observable market data, where applicable; and\n- (iv) re-computed the fair values of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group based on the above key inputs and exit clauses assumptions as at the end of the reporting period.\n\nWe have determined that there are no key audit matters to be communicated in our auditors' report of the audit of the separate financial statements of the Company.\n\n## INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDITORS' REPORT THEREON\n\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with MFRSs, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- (a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- (b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control of the Group and of the Company.\n- (c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.\n- (d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group or of the Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: (contd.)\n\n- (e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- (f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 50 to the financial statements.\n\n## OTHER MATTERS\n\nThis report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BDO PLT\n\n201906000013 (LLP0018825-LCA) & AF 0206 Chartered Accountants\n\nKuala Lumpur 4 April 2024\n\nLee Wee Hoong 03316/07/2025 J Chartered Accountant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nGOVERNANCE WITH\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nSHAREHOLDINGS'\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, divestment of the Group's non-core assets, which provides low returns are also made to optimise the capital structure of the Group.\n\nThe Group and the Company monitor capital utilisation using the gearing ratio. This ratio is used to assess the appropriateness of the Group's debt level, hence its capital structure. The ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt includes total borrowings and hire purchase with financial institutions net of cross currency swap, and perpetual sukuk less cash and bank balances.\n\n|                                           |      | Group        | Group                  | Company      | Company                 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|--------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|\n|                                           | Note | 2023  RM'000 | 2022 RM'000 (Restated) | 2023  RM'000 | 2022  RM'000 (Restated) |\n| Borrowings                                | 35   | 9,650,112    | 8,455,744              | 320,000      | -                       |\n| Add: Perpetual sukuk                      | 39   | -            | 600,000                | -            | 600,000                 |\n| (Less)/Add: Cross currency swap           | 35   | (12,870)     | 23,004                 | -            | -                       |\n| Net borrowings after cross currency swap  |      | 9,637,242    | 9,078,748              | 320,000      | 600,000                 |\n| Hire purchase with financial institutions | 38   | 244          | 434                    | -            | -                       |\n| Less:                                     |      |              |                        |              |                         |\n| Cash and bank balances                    | 31   | (2,297,002)  | (1,958,054)            | (27,796)     | (10,705)                |\n| Net debt                                  |      | 7,340,484    | 7,121,128              | 292,204      | 589,295                 |\n| Total equity                              |      | 15,000,337   | 13,551,465             | 7,692,070    | 7,191,066               |\n| Gearing ratio                             |      | 49%          | 53%                    | 4%           | 8%                      |\n\nPursuant to the requirements of Practice Note No. 17/2005 of the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad, the Group is required to maintain a consolidated shareholders' equity of more than 25% of the issued and paid-up capital (excluding treasury shares) and such shareholders' equity is not less than RM40.0 million.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 4. CAPITAL, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTD.)\n\n## (b) Insurance and financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group's financial risk management policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Group's businesses whilst managing its interest rate risks (both fair value and cash flow), foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk and insurance risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group's policy that no trading in derivative financial instruments shall be undertaken except for the use as hedging instruments where appropriate and cost-efficient.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's and the Company's income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group's and the Company's interest-bearing financial assets are mainly short term in nature and have been mostly placed in fixed deposits.\n\nThe Group's and the Company's interest rate risk arise primarily from interest bearing borrowings. The Group manages its interest rate exposure by monitoring a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Group also entered into interest rate swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the floating rate interest payable on certain borrowings. The Group closely monitors markets and output from various industry working groups on the transitions to new interest rate benchmark arising from the respective interest rate benchmarks reforms in various jurisdictions. At the end of the reporting period, the Group's interest rate swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts are not materially affected by any interest rate benchmarks reforms. Approximately 31% (2022: 40%) of the Group's borrowings after cross currency swap are at fixed rates of interest.\n\nThe interest rate profile and sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk have been disclosed in Notes 24, 25, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38 and 39 to the financial statements.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is not significantly exposed to foreign currency risk as the majority of the Group's transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in Ringgit Malaysia ('RM') except for foreign currency risk arising from countries in which certain foreign subsidiaries operate. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily Singapore Dollar ('SGD'), United States Dollar ('USD'), Chinese Renminbi ('RMB'), Australian Dollar ('AUD'), British Pound Sterling ('GBP') and Indian Rupee ('INR'). Foreign currency exposures in transactional currencies other than functional currencies of the operating entities are kept to an acceptable level.\n\nApproximately 16% (2022: 15%) of the Group's sales are denominated in foreign currencies whilst almost 16% (2022: 16%) of costs are denominated in the respective functional currencies of the Group entities.\n\nThe Group maintains a natural hedge, whenever possible, by borrowing in the currency of the country in which the property or investment is located or by borrowing in currencies that match the revenue stream to be generated from its investments.\n\nThe Group also holds cash and bank balances denominated in foreign currencies for working capital purposes. At the end of the reporting period, such foreign currency balances amounted to RM350.1 million (2022: RM279.4 million).\n\nMaterial foreign currency transactions exposures are hedged, mainly with derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts.\n\nThe Group entered into cross currency swap contracts to manage its exposure in foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency borrowings as well as to minimise the interest cost. These cross currency swap contracts have expiry periods within 1 months to 30 months (2022: 2 months to 32 months).\n\nIn relation to its investments in foreign subsidiaries whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risks and which are held for long term investment purposes, the differences arising from such translation are recorded under the foreign currency translation reserve. These translation differences are reviewed and monitored on a regular basis.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The objective of the Group is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of stand-by credit facilities.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nEXEMPLARY\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 4. CAPITAL, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTD.)\n\n## (b) Insurance and financial risk management objectives and policies (contd.)\n\n## Liquidity risk (contd.)\n\nThe objective of the Group's liquidity management is to maintain a balance between long term and short term borrowings to ensure continuity of funding at a cost efficient manner to meet its financial obligations on a timely basis. In this regard, the Group diligently manages its debt maturity profile, operating cash flows and various sources of funding after taking into account of the refinancing, repayment and funding requirements to provide an adequate liquidity buffer. Besides maintaining a reasonable level of cash and cash convertible investments to meet its working capital needs, the Group also ensures it has sufficient undrawn credit facilities available to complement its overall liquidity management. The Group has undrawn credit facilities of RM1,099.7 million (2022: RM1,506.0 million) at the end of the financial year.\n\nIn addition, the Group strives to maintain available banking facilities at a reasonable level to its overall debt position. As far as possible, the Group raises committed funding from both capital markets and financial institutions and balances its portfolio with some short term funding so as to achieve overall cost effectiveness.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, approximately 62% (2022: 63%) of the Group's borrowings will mature in less than one year based on the carrying amounts reflected in the financial statements.\n\nThe analysis of financial instruments by remaining contractual maturities has been disclosed in Notes 26, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 to the financial statements.\n\nThe notional amounts of performance guarantee contracts of the Group that are payable on demand are set out below:\n\n|                                 | Group   | Group   |\n|---------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                 | 2023    | 2022    |\n|                                 | RM'000  | RM'000  |\n| Performance guarantee contracts | 35,451  | 30,776  |\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty default on its obligations. The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables, other receivables and financial guarantee contracts. For other financial assets (including investment securities, cash and bank balances and derivatives), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties.\n\n## Receivables\n\nThe Group's objective is to seek continual revenue growth while minimising losses incurred due to increased credit risk exposure. The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

CAPITAL, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTD.)\n\n## (b) Insurance and financial risk management objectives and policies (contd.)\n\n## Credit risk (contd.)\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts\n\nThe Group and the Company provides financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to subsidiaries and joint ventures and vendors supplying to subsidiaries. The Group monitors on an ongoing basis the financial performance of the subsidiaries and joint ventures and the repayments made by the subsidiaries and joint ventures to the banks and vendors.\n\nThe credit risk concentration profiles have been disclosed in Notes 24, 25 and 37 to the financial statements.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the financial instruments of the Group would fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than interest or exchange rates).\n\nThe Group is exposed to equity price risks arising from quoted investments held by the Group. These investments are classified as financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss, except for those investments which are held for strategic rather than trading purposes. Such investments are classified as financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nTo manage its price risk arising from its investments, the Group diversifies its portfolio in accordance with the limits set by the Group.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of market risk has been disclosed in Notes 19, 28 and 31 to the financial statements.\n\n## Insurance risk\n\nThe most significant risks arising from the performance guarantees contracts are compensation for delays in delivery of construction contracts that result in a decline in profit margins from the construction contracts of the Group. Since the guarantee extends to more than a year, there is also inflation risk.\n\nAs at the end of the reporting period, there is no significant exposure of insurance risk of the Group as the expected future cash outflows arising from performance guarantee contracts are negligible.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 5.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 5. REVENUE (CONTD.)\n\n## (a) Revenue from property development and construction contracts\n\nContracts with customers may include multiple promises to customers and are therefore accounted for as separate performance obligations. In this case, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. When these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected cost plus margin.\n\nRevenue from property development and construction contracts are measured at the fixed transaction price agreed under the agreement.\n\nRevenue is recognised as and when control of the asset is transferred to the customer and it is probable that the Group would collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the asset that would be transferred to the customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time. Control of the asset is transferred over time if the performance of the Group does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\n## Revenue from property development\n\nRevenue from sale of properties under development is recognised over the period of the contract using the input method by reference to the costs incurred for work performed to date against the estimated costs to completion if control of the asset transfers over time. Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset.\n\nSignificant judgement is required in determining the satisfaction of performance obligations as stated in the contracts with customers, transaction price allocations and costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time.\n\nThe Group identifies performance obligations that are distinct and material, which are judgmental in the context of contracts. Transaction prices are determined based on estimated profit margins prior to its allocation to the identified performance obligations. The Group also estimates total contract costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time. In estimating the total costs to complete, the Group considers the completeness and accuracy of its costs estimation, including its obligations to contract variations, claims and cost contingencies.\n\nThere is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of properties under development as the contracts are on normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.\n\n## Revenue from construction contracts\n\nRevenue from construction contracts is recognised over the period of the contract using the output method by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation if control of the asset transfers over time. The output method recognises revenue on the basis of direct measurements of value to the customer of the construction work performed to date relative to the remaining construction work promised under the contract, which is based on the contract work certified to date over the estimated total contract sum.\n\nIf control of asset transfers at a point in time, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 5. REVENUE (CONTD.)\n\n## (a) Revenue from property development and construction contracts (contd.)\n\n## Revenue from construction contracts (contd.)\n\nThe Group determines the transaction price of a construction contract after considering the effect of variable consideration, constraining estimates of variable consideration, effect of significant financing component, non-cash consideration and consideration payable to customer.\n\nSignificant judgement is required in estimating the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations and in assessing the exposures to Liquidated Ascertained Damages ('LAD') based on the facts and circumstances of the relevant construction projects, including projects that had been served with certificates of non-achievement for project delays. In making these judgements, the Group evaluates based on experience and by relying on the work of specialists.\n\nInformation on trade receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers are disclosed in Notes 24 and 30 to the financial statements respectively.\n\n## (b) Sale of completed properties and land\n\nThe Group recognises sales at a point in time for the sale of completed properties and land, when the control of the properties and land have been transferred to the purchasers, being when the properties and land have been completed and delivered to the customers and it is probable that the Group will collect the considerations to which it would be entitled to in exchange for the assets sold.\n\nThere is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of completed properties and land as the sales are made on the normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.\n\n## (c) Sale of goods and services, rights of enjoyment and club subscription fees\n\nRevenue from sale of products and services rendered is recognised at a point in time when the products have been transferred or the services have been rendered to the customers and coincide with the delivery of products and services and acceptance by customers.\n\nThere is no material right of return and warranty provided to the customers on the sale of products and services rendered.\n\nThere is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of products and services rendered as the sales or services are made on the normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.\n\nEntrance fees collected for rights of enjoyment of facilities are recognised when tickets are utilised.\n\nClub subscription fees are recognised on the accrual basis.\n\n## (d) Management fees\n\nManagement fees from the management of real estate investment funds activity and the provision of management services are recognised over time when customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits.\n\n## (e) Interest advances and share financing\n\nInterest advances and share financing are recognised as income on accrual basis.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nGOVERNANCE WITH\n\nINTEGRITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTD.)\n\n- (a) Leasehold land, right-of-use land and buildings, right-of-use motor vehicles and right-of-use equipment represent rightof-use assets arising from lease arrangements that do not meet the definition of investment property.\n- (b) The Group assessed whether there are any indications of impairment of property, plant and equipment during the financial year. In doing this, management considered the current environment, taking into consideration the performance of Cash Generating Units ('CGUs'). Management considered certain CGUs which are loss-making as impairment indications.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections derived from financial budgets approved by management.\n\nManagement has made estimates about future results and key assumptions applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs. These key assumptions are applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs and include forecast growth in future revenues and operating profit margins, as well as determining appropriate pre-tax discount rates and growth rates.\n\nManagement has determined that the recoverable amounts of certain property, plant and equipment are lower than their carrying amounts. Accordingly, impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of the Group amounted to RM551,000 was recognised within administrative and other expenses in the statements of profit or loss in the current financial year. The pre-tax discount rates applied on the cash flow projections in determining the recoverable amounts range from 6.9% to 7.8% (2022: 5.5% to 9.5%).\n\nManagement has also determined that the recoverable amounts of certain property, plant and equipment are higher than their carrying amounts. Accordingly, reversals of impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of the Group amounted to RM20,184,000 was recognised within other income in the statements of profit or loss in the current financial year. The pre-tax discount rate applied on the cash flow projections in determining the recoverable amount is 7.53%.\n\n- (c) All items of property, plant and equipment (excluding right-of-use assets) are initially recorded at cost. After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment (excluding right-of-use assets) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\n| Buildings                         | 2%        |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|\n| Renovations                       | 4% - 33%  |\n| Plant and machinery               | 5% - 20%  |\n| Motor vehicles                    | 10% - 20% |\n| Equipment, furniture and fittings | 5% - 33%  |\n\nFreehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated. Capital work-in-progress included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.\n\nQuarry development expenditure consists of expenditure incurred to construct infrastructure to facilitate the quarry operations. Quarry development expenditure is amortised over the extractable rock reserves period, ranging from 3 to 80 years.\n\nThe useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment (excluding right-of-use assets) are estimated based on common life expectancies and commercial factors applied in the various respective industries.\n\nChanges in expected level of usage, occupancy rates and economic development could impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, and hence future depreciation charges on such assets could be revised.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nEXEMPLARY\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 15. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTD.)\n\n- (d) The right-of-use assets under property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost, which comprise the initial amount of the lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the leases.\n- After initial recognition, the right-of-use assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are depreciated on the straight-line basis over the periods of the lease terms. The principal depreciation periods are as follows:\n\n| Leasehold land               | over the lease periods from 45 to 99 years   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Land and buildings           | over the lease periods from 1 to 47 years    |\n| Motor vehicles and equipment | over the lease periods from 1 to 5 years     |\n\n- (e) During the financial year, the Group and the Company made the following cash payments to purchase property, plant and equipment:\n\n|                                                                | Group         | Group         | Company       | Company       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                | 2023   RM'000 | 2022   RM'000 | 2023   RM'000 | 2022   RM'000 |\n| Additions of property, plant and equipment                     | 130,580       | 159,606       | 3             | 2,536         |\n| Additions via hire purchase and lease  liabilities             | (31,861)      | (37,060)      | -             | (33)          |\n| Capitalisation of borrowing costs                              | (1,517)       | -             | -             | -             |\n| Cash outflow for acquisition of  property, plant and equipment | 97,202        | 122,546       | 3             | 2,503         |\n\n- (f) The cash inflows from disposal of property, plant and equipment of the Group and the Company are as follows:\n\n|                                                                              | Group         | Group         | Company       | Company       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                              | 2023   RM'000 | 2022   RM'000 | 2023   RM'000 | 2022   RM'000 |\n| Cash received                                                                | 15,846        | 159,090       | -             | 921           |\n| Movement in other receivables                                                | (9,643)       | 57,857        | -             | -             |\n| Total sale considerations for the disposal of  property, plant and equipment | 6,203         | 216,947       | -             | 921           |\n\n- (g) Included in property, plant and equipment of the Group are amounts of RM1,517,000 (2022: Nil) for borrowing costs capitalised at interest rates ranging from 5.69% to 7.65% per annum.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated economic useful lives.\n\nImpairment losses on intangible assets amounting to RM21,000 have been recognised during the financial year due to the recoverable amount of the intangible assets in the CGU is lower than its carrying amount.\n\n## Software\n\nSoftware that does not form an integral part of the related hardware is treated as intangible asset with finite life and is amortised over its estimated useful life of 3 to 5 years.\n\n## Operating right\n\nOperating right relates to the exclusive right granted by a third party to operate and manage the park and ride facilities in the Group. Operating right has finite useful life and is amortised over its estimated useful life of 30 years.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTD.)\n\n## Data cost\n\nData cost represents the database of corporate information used for the provision of credit reference, credit rating and other related services. Data cost has finite life and is amortised over its estimated useful life of 5 years.\n\n## Trademark and brand name\n\nThe costs of trademark and brand name acquired represent their fair values as at the date of acquisition. The useful lives of trademark and brand name are estimated to be indefinite because based on the current market share of the trademark and brand name, management believes there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the trademark and brand name are expected to generate net cash flows to the Group. Trademark and brand name are stated at cost less any impairment losses. The carrying amounts of trademark and brand name are reviewed annually and adjusted for impairment where they are considered necessary.\n\nThe carrying amounts of trademark and brand name have been allocated to the CGU identified from the others segment pharmaceutical. The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections derived from financial budgets approved by management. The disclosure of key inputs and assumptions are similar to the impairment assessment on the goodwill, which have been set out in Note 22 to the financial statements.\n\n## 17.

INVESTMENT PROPERTIES (CONTD.)\n\n- (b) Investment properties (excluding right-of-use assets) are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. Investment properties under right-of-use assets are initially measured at costs, which comprise the initial amount of the lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the leases. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the end of the reporting period and changes in fair value are included in profit or loss. Fair value gain would be adjusted after taking into consideration of the difference in recognising the rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and rental income billed to the tenant in the current financial year, where applicable.\n- If the Group determines that the fair value of an investment property under construction is not reliably determinable but expects the fair value of the property to be reliably determinable when construction is completed, the Group shall measure that investment property under construction at cost until either its fair value becomes reliably determinable or construction is completed (whichever is earlier). Once the Group is able to measure reliably the fair value of an investment property under construction that has previously been measured at cost, the Group shall measure that property at its fair value.\n\nExternal valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets. Selection criteria of external valuers include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. Management decides, after discussions with the external valuers of the Group, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case and compares changes in fair value with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable. Management also verifies major inputs by agreeing information in the valuation to contracts and other relevant documents.\n\n- (c) Interest expense capitalised during the financial year under investment properties under construction of the Group amounting to RM15,270,000 (2022: RM10,345,000) at interest rates ranging from 4.56% to 5.79% (2022: 4.19% to 5.33%) per annum.\n- (d) The Group measures fair values using the fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.

INVESTMENT PROPERTIES (CONTD.)\n\n## (f) Methods of valuation\n\n## Comparison method\n\nThe comparison/cost method of valuation entails separate valuations of the land and buildings to arrive at the market value of the subject property.\n\nUnder the comparison method, a property's fair value is estimated based on comparable transactions. This approach is based upon the principle of substitution under which a potential buyer would not pay more for the property than it would cost to buy a comparable substitute property. In theory, the best comparable sale would be an exact duplicate of the subject property and would indicate, by the known selling price of the duplicate, the price for which the subject property could be sold.\n\nThe land is valued by reference to transactions of similar lands in surrounding with adjustments made for differences in location, terrain, size and shape of the land, tenure, title restrictions, if any and other relevant characteristics.\n\nCompleted buildings are valued by reference to the current estimates on constructional costs to erect equivalent buildings, taking into consideration of similar accommodation in terms of size, construction, finishes contractors' overheads, fees and profits. Appropriate adjustments are then made for the factors of obsolescence and existing physical condition of the building.\n\nBuildings under construction are valued by reference to the total development costs incurred to date plus profits expected from its designated usage, discounted to their present value at a discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\n\nIn the previous financial year, all investment properties valued using the comparison method are transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Investment method\n\nA property's fair value is estimated using explicit assumptions regarding the benefits and liabilities of ownership over the asset's life including an exit or terminal value. As an accepted method within the income approach to valuation, the investment method involves the projection of a series of cash flows on a real property interest. To this projected cash flow series, an appropriate, market-derived discount rate is applied to establish the present value of the income stream associated with the real property.\n\nThe duration of the cash flow and the specific timing of inflows and outflows are determined by events such as rent reviews, lease renewal and related lease up periods, re-letting, redevelopment, or refurbishment. The appropriate duration is typically driven by market behaviour that is a characteristic of the class of real property. In the case of investment properties, periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy, non-recoverable expenses, collection losses, lease incentives, maintenance cost, agent and commission costs and other operating and management expenses. The series of periodic net operating incomes, along with an estimate of the terminal value anticipated at the end of the projection period, is then discounted.\n\nSignificant increases/(decreases) in estimated rental value and outgoings per annum in isolation would result in a significant higher/(lower) fair value of the properties. Significant increases/(decreases) in market yield and discount rate in isolation would result in a significantly (lower)/higher fair value.\n\nGenerally, a change in the assumption made for the estimated rental value is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the rent growth per annum and discount rate.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 18.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 18. INVENTORIES (CONTD.)\n\n- (e) Property development costs not recognised as an expense are recognised as an asset measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The asset is subsequently credited over to profit or loss and recognised as an expense when the control of the asset is transferred to the customer.\n- The Group recognises in profit or loss the property development revenue and costs by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligations at the reporting period. It is measured based on direct measurements of the value transferred by the Group to the customers and the Group's efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Significant judgement is required in determining the completeness and accuracy of the budgets and the extent of the costs incurred.\n\nSubstantial changes in cost estimates can have a significant effect on the profitability of the Group in future periods. In making the above judgement, the Group relies on past experience and work of specialists. Transaction prices are determined based on estimated profit margins prior to its allocation to the identified performance obligations.\n\n- (f) Completed properties held for sale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost consists of cost associated with the acquisition of land, direct costs and appropriate proportions of common costs attributable for developing the properties until completion.\n- (g) Costs of trading inventories, food and beverages and consumables are determined on a weighted average basis, while cost of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods are determined on a weighted average and first in, first out basis.\n- (h) The amount of inventories recognised as an expense during the financial year are included in the cost of sales of the Group as disclosed in Note 6 to the financial statements.\n- (i) A write-down of inventories to net realisable value and write-off of inventories of RM5,369,000 (2022: RM4,367,000) and RM5,527,000 (2022: RM821,000) respectively were made during the year.\n- (j) The Group reversed RM41,000 (2022: RM11,000) in respect of inventories written down in the previous financial years that were subsequently not required as the Group was able to sell those inventories above their carrying amounts.\n- (k) Interest expense capitalised under property development costs and land held for development costs of the Group amounted to RM44,595,000 (2022: RM40,004,000) and RM68,383,000 (2022: RM40,991,000) at interest rates ranging from 3.28% to 7.65% (2022: 3.12% to 6.50%) respectively.\n\n## 19.

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES (CONTD.)\n\n- (a) Investments in subsidiaries other than quoted units in wholesale funds are stated in the separate financial statements of the Company at cost less impairment losses, if any.\n- Quoted units in wholesale funds are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments . The fair value of quoted units in wholesale funds is categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of quoted units in wholesale funds are determined based on net asset value of the funds at the close of business on the reporting date. There is no transfer between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.\n- (b) All components of non-controlling interests shall be measured at their acquisition-date fair values, unless another measurement basis is required by MFRSs. The choice of measurement basis is made on a combination-by-combination basis. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity.\n- (c) The Company and/or its subsidiaries review the investments in subsidiaries measured at cost for impairment when there is an indication of impairment.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the investments in subsidiaries are assessed by reference to the fair value less cost to sell of the underlying assets or the value-in-use of the respective subsidiaries.\n\nThe value-in-use is the net present value of the projected future cash flows derived from the business operations of the respective subsidiaries discounted at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. For such discounted cash flow method, it involves the use of estimated future results and a set of assumptions to support their income and cash flows. Judgement had also been used to determine the pre-tax discount rate for the cash flows and the future growth rate of the business of the entities. The value-in-use were determined using pre-tax discount rates of 6.9% to 7.8% (2022: 5.5% to 9.5%).\n\n- (d) The Group and the Company determined that their placements in wholesale funds are in substance, structured entities under their control in accordance with MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements , taking into consideration their power over the wholesale funds, exposure or rights to variable returns from their involvement with the wholesale funds and their ability to use their power over the wholesale funds to affect the amount of their returns.\n\nThe Group and the Company invested in these wholesale funds with the objective of achieving short term to long term income for their treasury management purposes. The funds are managed by the respective fund managers, who apply various investment strategies to accomplish their respective investment objectives. Their operations are financed through the creation of investee fund units, which in turn entitle the holders to variable returns and fair values in the respective wholesale fund's net assets.\n\nIn relation to this, the Group holds 74% to 100% (2022: 76% to 100%) directly in these wholesale funds as disclosed in Note 50 to the financial statements, which are all established in Malaysia. The Group and the Company are exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from their involvements in these funds. Accordingly, these funds are deemed as subsidiaries of the Group and of the Company and have been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.\n\nDuring the current financial year, the Company had net redemptions of units in its wholesale funds amounting to RM40,457,000 (2022: RM290,803,000).\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

('IASB'), and SIDSB, a joint venture of the Group, for the following purposes:\n- (i) SunCity agrees to acquire 770,450 ordinary shares held by IASB in SIDSB, representing 40% of the share capital of SIDSB, at a purchase consideration of RM770,450 ('Proposed Acquisition');\n- (ii) SunCity will subscribe for 84,229,550 non-convertible non-cumulative redeemable preference shares ('NCNCRPS') in SIDSB for a total consideration of RM84,229,550; and\n- (iii)   SIDSB will redeem 76,274,552 NCNCRPS held by IASB in the share capital of SIDSB at a redemption price of RM84,229,550.\n\nConsequent to the completion of the Proposed Acquisition and redemption of NCNCRPS on 21 August 2023, the Group had obtained control of SIDSB in accordance with MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements . Accordingly, SIDSB and its subsidiaries became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Group and have been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nThe fair value and the carrying amounts of the identifiable assets and liabilities of SIDSB and its subsidiaries as at the date of acquisition were as follows:\n\n|                                     | Fair value   recognised on   acquisition  RM'000   | Carrying   amount   RM'000   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment       | 23,045                                             | 23,045                       |\n| Inventories                         | 728,543                                            | 725,520                      |\n| Other receivables                   | 19,287                                             | 19,287                       |\n| Cash and bank balances              | 11                                                 | 11                           |\n| Tax recoverable                     | 4                                                  | 4                            |\n|                                     | 770,890                                            | 767,867                      |\n| Trade payables                      | 1,382                                              | 1,382                        |\n| Other payables                      | 586,064                                            | 586,064                      |\n| Deferred tax liabilities            | 726                                                | -                            |\n| Hire purchase and lease liabilities | 15                                                 | 15                           |\n|                                     | 588,187                                            | 587,461                      |\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nEXEMPLARY\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 19.

Bhd. ('Sunway Artessa'), Sunway Velocity Two Sdn. Bhd. ('Sunway Velocity Two') and Daksina Harta Sdn. Bhd. ('Daksina Harta') to vary certain terms in respective Subscription and Shareholders' Agreements, which resulted in the Group obtaining controls of Sunway Artessa, Sunway Velocity Two and Daksina Harta in accordance with MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nAccordingly, Sunway Artessa, Sunway Velocity Two and Daksina Harta became subsidiaries of the Group and had been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nThe financial effects on the changes in the composition of the Group arising from the remeasurements of the previously held equity interests in Sunway Artessa, Sunway Velocity Two and Daksina Harta were RM66,182,000 in the previous financial year.\n\n- (h) The other winding up and strike off of subsidiaries did not have any material effect on the financial results and position of the Group.\n- (i) Sensitivity analysis of quoted units in wholesale funds\n\nA change of 1% in funds' prices, assuming all other variables constant, at the end of the reporting period would resulted in the profit net of tax of the Company to be higher/(lower) by RM3,000 (2022: RM408,000).\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (CONTD.)\n\n- (f) The Group assessed whether there are any indications of impairment during the financial year. In doing this, management considered the current environments, taking into consideration the performance of CGUs. Management has considered the drop in market values of quoted shares in certain associates in the current financial year as impairment indications.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections derived from financial budgets approved by management.\n\nManagement has made estimates about future results and key assumptions applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs. These key assumptions are applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs and include forecast growth in future revenues and operating profit margins, as well as determining appropriate pre-tax discount rates and growth rates.\n\nThe market values of the Group's investment in Sunway REIT, Gopeng and Elite REIT (collectively known as 'Listed Associates') are below the carrying amounts of the Group's interest in the Listed Associates as at 31 December 2023. Nevertheless, the carrying amounts are supported by the net assets of these associates as well as future cash flows to be generated by these associates. Management has determined that the recoverable amounts of these investments in associates exceed their carrying amounts and with the relatively resilient fundamentals of these associates, the Group is of the view that the carrying amounts of the investments in associates are recoverable and should not be impacted by the fluctuation of the share price of these associates, therefore no further impairment loss is required at this juncture. The average pre-tax discount rate applied on the cash flow projections in determining the recoverable amounts is 5.7% (2022: 6.2%).\n\n- (g) During the financial year, the Group completed the following subscriptions, capital injection, divestment and acquisition of shares:\n- (i) Sunway Innovation Sdn. Bhd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sunway Holdings Sdn. Bhd. ('SHSB'), which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had subscribed 35,000 ordinary shares, representing 35% equity interest in The Hive Southeast Asia Sdn. Bhd. for a cash consideration of RM35,000;\n- (ii) Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. ('SunCity'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had entered into an internal reorganisation agreement to relocate its equity investments in Superseed II Ventures (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. to Superseed II Fund, L.P., and a loss on redemption of redeemable preference shares of RM641,000 had been recognised within other expenses in the statements of profit or loss. On 17 January 2023, SunCity had injected USD349,762 (equivalent to RM1,517,303) into Superseed II Fund, L.P. and further injected USD675,564 (equivalent to RM3,096,662) from 4 April 2023 to 6 December 2023;\n- (iii)   On 11 May 2023 and 7 August 2023, SunCity had injected USD781,229 (equivalent to RM3,478,292) and USD33,055 (equivalent to RM137,229) respectively into Orbit Malaysia Fund 1, L.P.;\n- (iv) On 27 October 2023, Sunway Marketing Sdn. Bhd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SHSB, which in turn is a whollyowned subsidiary of the Company, had divested the remaining 30% equity interest in its associate, Buildtrend B.S.G. (M) Sdn. Bhd. upon dissolution of the associate with no material effect; and\n- (v) On 27 October 2023, Sunway RE Capital Pte. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SunCity, had subscribed for additional 150,000 ordinary shares in the share capital of Elite REIT Manager for a total consideration of SGD150,000 (equivalent to RM515,754).\n- (h) The details of the Group's proportionate share of contingent liability in relation to a material litigation of Sunway REIT are disclosed in Note 48(a) to the financial statements.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nEXEMPLARY\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 22. GOODWILL (CONTD.)\n\n## Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations\n\nThe Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the CGU to which goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period, with a terminal value thereafter. The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations for the major business segments are:\n\n|                     | Quarry %   | Construction %   | Property investment %   | Others - pharmaceutical %   |\n|---------------------|------------|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2023 |            |                  |                         |                             |\n| Gross margin        | 11.0       | 9.5              | 40.6                    | 3.9                         |\n| Growth rate         | 10.9       | 2.2              | 18.3                    | 25.6                        |\n| Discount rate       | 7.5        | 7.8              | 7.5                     | 7.5                         |\n| At 31 December 2022 |            |                  |                         |                             |\n| Gross margin        | 9.5        | 10.1             | 40.7                    | 7.0                         |\n| Growth rate         | 24.2       | 8.8              | 13.3                    | 22.7                        |\n| Discount rate       | 9.1        | 8.1              | 9.0                     | 9.1                         |\n\nThe following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake impairment testing of goodwill:\n\n## (i) Budgeted gross margin\n\nThe basis used to determine the value assigned to the budgeted gross margins is the average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year adjusted for expected efficiency improvements or deficiency.\n\n## (ii) Growth rate\n\nThe growth rate used is based on anticipated growth rates of the respective CGU obtained from financial budgets approved by management.

GOODWILL (CONTD.)\n\n## Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations (contd.)\n\nThe following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake impairment testing of goodwill: (contd.)\n\nThe Group has adopted the Expected Cash Flow approach in performing its impairment assessment of goodwill on consolidation during the current financial year. The cash flow projections used in determining the value-in-use calculations were probability weighted based on the following scenarios:\n\n| Scenario   | Weighting   | Assumptions                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Base Case  | 75%         | Based on the key assumptions above.                                                                                                         |\n| Best Case  | 10%         | Revenue and cost of sales annual growth rates are forecasted to be 104% and 96% of  base case respectively for a period of three (3) years. |\n| Worst Case | 15%         | Revenue and cost of sales annual growth rates are forecasted to be 96% and 104% of  base case respectively for a period of three (3) years. |\n\nThe above key assumptions are determined based on management's assessment of future trends in the respective business segments. Any differences in expectations from the original estimates might impact the impairment losses amount in respect of the goodwill of the Group.\n\n## Sensitivity to changes in assumptions\n\nWith regard to the assessment of value-in-use of each of the major business segments, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to materially exceed their recoverable amounts.\n\n## 23.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items as they have arisen in companies that have a recent history of losses or in companies where future taxable profits may be insufficient to trigger the utilisation of these items.\n\nThe amount and availability of these items to be carried forward up to the periods as disclosed above are subject to the agreement of the respective local tax authorities.\n\n- (c) During the 2024 Budget Announcement on 13 October 2023, the Minister of Finance announced that the Global Minimum Tax ('GMT') would be implemented in Malaysia. On 29 December 2023, the parliament has gazetted the GMT legislation via the Finance Act (No. 2) 2023 and the said rules will come into effect from financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. GMT shall apply if a group has annual revenue of seven hundred and fifty million euro or more as specified in the consolidated financial statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity ('UPE') in at least two of the four consecutive financial years immediately preceding tested financial year. The assessment need to be carried out for each tested financial year to determine whether the group is within the scope or not. Based on the past years annual revenue recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the UPE, the Group is within the scope of the enacted GMT legislation for financial year 2025. However, the Group applies the exception to recognise and disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to GMT.\n\nUnder the GMT legislation, the Group is liable to pay top-up tax for the difference between the minimum rate of 15% and the Group's jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under the GMT rules (GloBE ETR) for each jurisdiction where the Group has operation therein. Due to uncertainties surrounding when and how each jurisdiction will enact the legislations, the quantitative impact of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation is not yet reasonably estimable. The Group is currently working with tax specialists to assess the impact of the GMT legislation on the Group.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 24.

In view of the aforementioned and the fact that the Group's trade receivables relate to a large number of diversified customers, there is no significant concentration of credit risk. Trade receivables are noninterest bearing except as stated in Note 24(l) to the financial statements.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are no variable lease income that are not included in the measurement of the finance lease receivables and hire purchase receivables.\n- (g) Impairment for trade receivables and contract assets that do not contain a significant financing component are recognised based on the simplified approach using the lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nImpairment for trade receivables that contain significant financing component such as finance lease receivables, hire purchase receivables and loans and advances are recognised based on the general approach within MFRS 9 using the forward looking expected credit loss model as disclosed in Note 25(d) to the financial statements.\n\nLifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the asset. The maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\nThe Group considers credit loss experience and observable data such as current changes and future forecasts in economic conditions by market segment of the Group as identified in Note 3 to the financial statements to estimate the amount of expected impairment loss. The methodology and assumptions including any forecasts of future economic conditions are reviewed regularly.\n\nDuring this process, the probability of non-payment by the trade receivables is adjusted by forward looking information and multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime expected credit loss for the trade receivables. The Group has identified the Gross Domestic Product, unemployment rate, inflation rate, labour force participation rate, Malaysian Property House Index Growth Rate and consumer price index as the key macroeconomic factors of the forward looking information. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such impairments are recorded in a separate impairment account with the loss being recognised within the statements of profit or loss. On confirmation that the trade receivable would not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset would be written off against the associated impairment.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These customers are internationally dispersed, engage in a wide spectrum of activities, and sell in a variety of end markets. The Group's historical experience in the collection of accounts receivable falls within the recorded allowances. Due to these factors, management believes that no additional credit risk beyond amounts provided for collection losses is inherent in the Group's trade receivables.\n\n- (k) The weighted average interest rates per annum of trade receivables that were effective as at end of each reporting period were as follows:\n\n|                           | Group   | Group   |\n|---------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                           | 2023    | 2022    |\n|                           | %       | %       |\n| Trade receivables         | 4.10    | 3.79    |\n| Finance lease receivables | 10.36   | -       |\n| Hire purchase receivables | 3.45    | 3.24    |\n| Loans and advances        | 5.90    | 5.92    |\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 24.

There is no transfer between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.\n\n## 25.

OTHER RECEIVABLES (CONTD.)\n\n- (a) Included in other receivables is the following amount due from a related party:\n\n|                               | Group   | Group   | Company   | Company   |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n|                               | 2023    | 2022    | 2023      | 2022      |\n|                               | RM'000  | RM'000  | RM'000    | RM'000    |\n| Active Equity Sdn. Bhd. Group | 112     | 273     | 66        | 59        |\n\nThe amount due from a related party is unsecured, non-interest bearing and the credit period is generally for a period of 30 days to 90 days (2022: 30 days to 90 days). The relationship with the related party is as disclosed in Note 49 to the financial statements.\n\n- (b) Total other receivables, net of prepayments are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost.\n- (c) Included in deposits of the Group are deposits paid for acquisition of land held for property development of RM28,500,000 in the current financial year.\n- (d) Impairment for trade receivables with significant financing component, quasi-equity loans, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and financial guarantee contracts are recognised based on the general approach within MFRS 9 using the forward looking expected credit loss ('ECL') model. The methodology used to determine the amount of the impairment is based on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset. At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for financial assets by comparing the risk of default occurring over the expected life with the risk of default since initial recognition. For those in which the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition of the financial asset, twelve-month expected credit losses along with gross interest income are recognised. For those in which credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime expected credit losses along with the gross interest income are recognised. For those that are determined to be credit impaired, lifetime expected credit losses along with interest income on a net basis are recognised.\n\nLifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the asset, while twelve-month expected credit losses are the portion of expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the twelve months after the end of the reporting period. The maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Group and the Company are exposed to credit risk.\n\nThe Group defined significant increase in credit risk based on operating performance of the receivables, changes to contractual terms, payment trends and past due information.\n\nThe probability of non-payment by quasi-equity loans, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and financial guarantee contracts is adjusted by forward looking information and multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the twelve-month or lifetime expected credit loss for the quasiequity loans, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and financial guarantee contracts. The Group has identified the Gross Domestic Product, unemployment rate, inflation rate, labour force participation rate, Malaysian Property House Index Growth Rate and consumer price index as the key macroeconomic factors of the forward looking information.\n\nIt requires management to exercise significant judgement in determining the probability of default by quasi-equity loans, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and financial guarantee contracts, appropriate forward looking information and significant increase in credit risk.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 25.

During the financial year, the Group had entered into interest rate swap to exchange floating interest rate for fixed interest rate in order to minimise the exposure from fluctuation of interest rate. This interest rate swap received floating interest rate equalled to Singapore Swap Offer Rate ('SOR') per annum and paid fixed rate of interest of 3.29% per annum.\n\nThe fair values of the interest rate swap contracts were determined by using the mark to market values at the end of the reporting period and changes in the fair value was recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nInterest rate swap contracts were valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques included swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs included the credit quality of counterparties and interest rate curves.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 26. DERIVATIVES (CONTD.)\n\n- (b) The Group entered into derivatives as follows: (contd.)\n- (ii) Foreign currency forward contracts\n\nThe Group entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage some of the transaction exposure. These contracts are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposure and fair value changes exposure. The Group also uses foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure to foreign currency exchange risks arising from forecasted expenditure. Where a cash flow hedge qualifies for hedge accounting, the effective portion of gains or losses on remeasuring the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised directly in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item affects profit or loss, then the gains or losses are transferred to the profit or loss. Gains or losses on any portion of the hedge determined to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the profit or loss.\n\nForward currency contracts are valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The derivatives arising from the forward currency contracts are stated at fair value using the prevailing market rate. The fair value changes are attributable to changes in foreign exchange spot and forward rate.\n\n- (iii) Cross currency swap contracts\n\nThe Group entered into cross currency swap contracts to manage its exposure in foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency borrowings, which was entered into to minimise the interest cost. The Group uses cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of variability of future cash flows attributable to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations over the hedging period on the foreign currency borrowings. Where a cash flow hedge qualifies for hedge accounting, the effective portion of gains or losses on remeasuring the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised directly in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item affects profit or loss, then the gains or losses are transferred to the profit or loss. Gains or losses on any portion of the hedge determined to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the profit or loss.\n\nCross currency swap contracts are valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and interest rate curves.\n\n- (iv) Derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group\n\nDerivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group represent the exit clauses attached to the Shareholders' Agreement ('SHA') and Share Subscription Agreement ('SSA') entered between the Company, SunCity, SHH and Greenwood Capital Pte. Ltd. ('Greenwood') following the partial divestment of 16% equity interest in SHH to Greenwood by SunCity on 23 December 2021. The Company, SunCity, SHH and Greenwood had entered into a SHA to define the rights and obligations of the shareholders of SHH.\n\nIn accordance with the SHA, Greenwood has the right but not the obligation to initiate the Joint Sale or the Put Exit if the Proposed Initial Public Offer (\"IPO\") has not occurred on or before the eighth (8 th ) anniversary of Initial Closing or such extended period up to 180 days from the 8th anniversary of the Initial Closing ('Proposed IPO Delay Event'). Accordingly, Greenwood was granted a put option, whereby it shall have the right to require SunCity to acquire all its securities held for the Put Consideration. The 'Put Consideration' shall be an amount equal to the amount that will enable Greenwood to achieve the USD IRR of no less than 18.5% upon completion of the Put Option.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 26. DERIVATIVES (CONTD.)\n\n- (b) The Group entered into derivatives as follows: (contd.)\n- (iv) Derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group (contd.)\n\nFurthermore, SunCity has agreed to offer Greenwood a valuation adjustment in the event its targeted Ringgit Malaysia ('RM') denominated internal rate of return of 12.5% is not met by the Proposed IPO. This valuation adjustment will consist of SunCity either transferring additional SHH Shares to Greenwood on or prior to the completion of the Proposed IPO ('Proposed IPO Transfer Shares') or the proceeds obtained from the sale of its SHH Shares pursuant to the Proposed IPO ('Proposed IPO Cash Transfer') followed by a cash top up ('Proposed IPO Cash Top Up'), if required. As long as the Proposed IPO is completed by 31 January 2028, the Proposed IPO Transfer Shares and Proposed IPO Cash Transfer are collectively capped at 4.5% of the enlarged issued SHH Shares (on a fully converted basis) with the Proposed IPO Cash Top Up capped at United States Dollar ('USD') 10.0 million. If SHH does not complete the Proposed IPO by 31 January 2028, it will have an additional time period until the 8th anniversary of the Initial Closing, to complete the same. However, the Proposed IPO Transfer Shares, Proposed IPO Cash Transfer and Proposed IPO Cash Top Up ceilings will progressively increase during this period with the Proposed IPO Transfer Shares and Proposed IPO Cash Transfer collectively capped at 11.5% of the enlarged issued SHH Shares (on a fully converted basis) with the Proposed IPO Cash Top Up capped at USD50.0 million.\n\nThe Group has adopted the probability model in deriving the fair value of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group. The key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group include the probabilities of occurrence of the Proposed IPO, probabilities of achieving the desired Proposed IPO valuation, timing of the occurrence of Proposed IPO and discount rate of 9.2% (2022: 9.7%), which require significant judgements and estimates made by management.\n\n## (v) Put option\n\nPut option represents the derivative attached to the Put Option Agreement ('POA') entered between Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. ('Put Grantor'), Low Peng Kiat and CRSC Property Sdn. Bhd. (collectively, 'Put Grantees'), in respect of Sunway Velocity Two Sdn. Bhd. ('Velocity Two'). Under the POA, for a period of 5 years from year 2025, the Put Grantor granted to Put Grantees the irrevocable right to require Put Grantor to purchase all of the Put Option Shares, representing 10% of the entire enlarged share capital of Velocity Two.\n\nThe fair value of the put option is the difference between the strike price and the underlying price. The Group has adopted the Binomial option pricing model in deriving the fair value of the put option. The key assumptions in estimating the fair value include expected underlying share price, expected exercise put price, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and expected volatility.\n\n- (c) The maturity pro/file of the Group's derivative liabilities at the end of the reporting period based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations is summarised in the table below:\n\n| Group                     | On demand   or within   one year   RM'000   | One to   five years   RM'000   | Over five   years   RM'000   | Total   RM'000   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2023    |                                             |                                |                              |                  |\n| Derivatives - settled net | 457,436                                     | 376,585                        | 58,500                       | 892,521          |\n| As at 31 December 2022    |                                             |                                |                              |                  |\n| Derivatives - settled net | 1,654,178                                   | 91,350                         | -                            | 1,745,528        |\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 26.

OTHER INVESTMENTS (CONTD.)\n\n- (a) The equity securities are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments .\n- Except for equity securities which are not held for trading, for which the Group has irrevocably elected at initial recognition to recognise at fair value through other comprehensive income. These are strategic investments for which the Group considers this classification to be appropriate and relevant.\n- (b) Fair value of quoted ordinary shares in Malaysia was determined by reference to the exchange quoted market prices at the close of the business on the reporting date. The fair value of quoted ordinary shares of the Group was categorised as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\n- (c) The investments in funds are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments . Unquoted ordinary shares, unquoted preference shares and investments in funds of the Group are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of unquoted ordinary shares, unquoted preference shares and investments in funds of the Group are estimated based on adjusted transacted price. The movement in other investments categorised as Level 3 during the financial year includes net disposals amounted to RM39,513,000 (2022: RM8,074,000).\n\nThe key input to the valuation of the other investments is the adjusted transaction price paid. Significant increase/ (decrease) in estimated adjusted transaction price paid in isolation would result in a significant higher/(lower) fair value of the other investments.\n\n- (d) The corporate memberships, unquoted loan stocks and unquoted corporate bonds are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments . The fair value of corporate memberships, unquoted loan stocks and unquoted corporate bonds of the Group and of the Company is categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value measurements of unquoted corporate bonds are based on indicative prices from an accredited bond pricing agency while the fair value measurements of corporate memberships and unquoted loan stocks are based on market prices of similar instruments.\n- (e) Sensitivity analysis of quoted ordinary shares\n\nA change of 5% in stock indices, assuming all other variables constant, at the end of the reporting period would result in the fair value reserve in equity of the Group to be higher/(lower) by RM14,360,000 (2022: RM14,621,000), arising as a result of higher/(lower) fair value gains on quoted equity securities classified at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n- (f) There is no transfer between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.\n\n## 29. BIOLOGICAL ASSETS\n\nAll items of biological assets are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, biological assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nBiological assets consist of animals in petting zoos operated by subsidiaries.\n\nDuring the financial year, the Group made cash payments of RM205,000 (2022: RM374,000) to purchase biological assets.\n\nDepreciation of biological assets is provided for on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of each asset to its residual value over the estimated biological life, at an annual rate of 20%. Depreciation charge of biological assets recognised during the current financial year amounted to RM166,000 (2022: RM100,000).\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)

Bhd. as its joint venture entitlement, which is unsecured, non-interest bearing and term of payment as stipulated in the Amended Joint Venture Agreement dated 22 February 2011.\n- (e) Deferred income of the Group is mainly rental received in advance.\n- (f) Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Group and the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for the loss it incurs when a specified debtor fails to make payments as and when they fall due.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under MFRS 9 Financial Instruments and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers , where appropriate.\n\nThe fair value of financial guarantees is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between the contractual payments under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are subject to forward looking expected credit loss model based on the general approach within MFRS 9 as disclosed in Note 25(d) to the financial statements.\n\nThe Group and the Company assume that there is a significant increase in credit risk, when the financial positions of the subsidiaries and joint ventures deteriorate significantly. The Group and the Company consider a financial guarantee to be credit impaired when:\n\n- (i) the joint ventures or subsidiaries are unlikely to repay their credit obligation to the bank in full; or\n- (ii) the joint ventures or subsidiaries are continuously loss making and are having deficit shareholders' funds.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)

A change of 25 basis points in interest rates, assuming all other variables remained constant, at the end of the reporting period would result in the profit net of tax of the Group to be lower/(higher) by RM83,000 (2022: RM79,000).\n- (i) Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities\n\nThe table below details changes in the Group's liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and noncash changes.

HIRE PURCHASE AND LEASE LIABILITIES (CONTD.)\n\n- (a) The hire purchase and lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date.\n\nAfter initial recognition, hire purchase and lease liabilities are measured by increasing the carrying amounts to reflect interest on the hire purchase and lease liabilities, reducing the carrying amounts to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amounts to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications.\n\nThe corresponding right-of-use assets of the hire purchase and lease liabilities are presented as property, plant and equipment as disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.\n\n## Variable lease payments, lease payments associated with short term leases and low value assets\n\nCertain property leases of the Group as a lessee contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales or profits generated by the lessee in relation to the properties.\n\nThe Group recognises these variable lease payments when the condition that triggers those payments occur while lease payments associated with short term leases (leases with lease term of 12 months or less) and low value assets (leases for which the underlying asset is RM20,000 and below) are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The variable lease payments and lease payments associated with short term leases and low value assets are recognised in profit or loss as rental expenses as disclosed in Note 9 to the financial statements.\n\n## Extension and termination options\n\nExtension and termination options are included in certain property leases of the Group, which are negotiated for purposes such as providing operational flexibility to the Group. The extension and termination options are mainly exercisable by the Group and not by the respective lessors.\n\nThe Group determines the lease term of a lease as the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with periods covered by an option to extend or to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the relevant options. Management has considered the relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to either exercise the option to extend the lease, or to exercise the option to terminate the lease. Any differences in expectations from the original estimates would impact the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities of the Group.\n\nDuring the current financial year, the Group and the Company had reassessed the lease terms of certain property leases in relation to the likelihood of exercising the extension options, taking into consideration the current relevant facts and circumstances. There were also modifications on the terms and conditions of certain property leases of the Group and of the Company during the current financial year.\n\nThe effects of the lease reassessments and modifications of the Group during the current financial year was an increase in recognised lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of RM433,000 and RM843,000 respectively (2022: a decrease in recognised lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of RM3,349,000 and RM2,368,000 respectively) as disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements as well as a net gain on reassessments and modifications of leases recognised in profit or loss of RM410,000 (2022: RM981,000).\n\nThe effects of the lease reassessments and modifications of the Company during the current financial year was a corresponding decrease in both lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of RM138,000 (2022: A corresponding increase in both lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of RM765,000) as disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ICPS will be fully matured in financial year 2025.\n\n- (c) On 4 October 2017, the Company issued 629,970,466 free warrants pursuant to the bonus issue of warrants undertaken by the Company on the basis of 3 free warrants for every 10 ordinary shares held in the Company.\n\nThe warrants entitle the registered holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share of the Company ('New Share') at a price per New Share equivalent to the exercise price of the warrants in accordance with the Deed Poll for warrants dated 19 September 2017 ('Deed Poll'), at any time within a period of 7 years commencing on and including the date of issuance of the warrants and expiring on the close of business at 5.00 p.m. in Malaysia on the date immediately preceding the 7th anniversary of the date of issuance of the warrants, and if such date is not a market day, then on the preceding market day. In relation to this, the warrants were issued at an exercise price of RM1.86 each.\n\nThe exercise price of the warrant is subject to a fixed annual step-down of RM0.07 per year on each of the anniversary dates of the date of first issuance of the warrants. The exercise price, at any time during the tenure of the warrants, is further subjected to adjustments in accordance with the provisions of the Deed Poll in the event of any alteration to the share capital of the Company.\n\n- On 11 November 2020, the Company issued 39,555,548 additional warrants arising from the adjustments to the exercise price and the number of outstanding warrants in accordance with the provisions of the Deed Poll dated 19 September 2017 constituting the warrants, pursuant to the renounceable rights issue of new ICPS undertaken by the Company.\n\nDuring the financial year, the Company increased its issued and paid-up ordinary share capital by way of issuance of 501,025,721 ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of Warrants 2017/2024, where 34,128 ordinary shares were issued at an exercise price of RM1.42 each and 500,991,593 ordinary shares were issued at an exercise price of RM1.35 each.\n\nThe new ordinary shares issued during the financial year rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of the Company.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\n## 41.

Bhd. ('SVMSB'), for a project development pursuant to an agreement entered into between the shareholders of SVMSB. Accordingly, this right has been classified and presented as equity.\n\n## 43. MERGER RESERVE\n\nThe negative merger reserve arose as a result of the excess of the consideration paid over the share capital and capital reserves of both Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. and Sunway Holdings Sdn. Bhd. as at the acquisition date. Further details on the merger exercise are disclosed in Note 45 to the financial statements.\n\n## 44.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 44. RESERVES (CONTD.)\n\nThe natures of each category of reserves are as follows:\n\n## (a) Capital reserve\n\nCapital reserve represents the Group's accretion in the value of investments in subsidiaries arising from internal restructuring, which includes the redemption of cumulative redeemable preference shares.\n\n## (b) Statutory reserve\n\nStatutory reserve represents the 10% of accumulated gains recognised in the People's Republic of China subsidiaries' income statement, which is not distributable.\n\nAccording to the Articles of Association of the subsidiaries, when distributing net profit of each financial year, the subsidiaries shall set aside 10% of its after tax profits for the statutory common reserve fund (except where the fund has reached 50% of the subsidiaries' registered capital). These reserves cannot be used for purposes other than those for which they are created and are not distributable as cash dividends.\n\n## (c) Revaluation reserve\n\nRevaluation reserve represents revaluation adjustment arising from transfer of owner-occupied property to investment property.\n\n## (d) Cash flow hedge reserve\n\nCash flow hedge reserve represents the net gains or losses, net of tax, on effective cash flow hedging instruments that will be recycled to the profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\n## (e) Fair value reserve\n\nThe fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value through other comprehensive income investment held until the investment is derecognised.\n\n## (f) Furniture, fittings and equipment reserve\n\nIn accordance with the Hotel Master Lease Agreement, the Group must set aside in the furniture, fittings and equipment ('FF&E') reserve during each financial year, an amount equivalent to 2.5% of the anticipated revenue. The FF&E reserve must be used and disbursed only in accordance with the agreed FF&E Plan.\n\n## (g) Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve is used to record foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currencies are different from that of the presentation currency of the Group. It is also used to record the exchange differences arising from monetary items, which form part of the net investment of the Group in foreign operations, where the monetary item is denominated in either the functional currency of the reporting entity or the foreign operation.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nREVIEW\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 45. MERGER EXERCISE\n\nOn 18 August 2011, the Company acquired the entire businesses and undertakings, including all assets and liabilities of Sunway Holdings Sdn. Bhd. and Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. (collectively known as the 'Merged Entities').\n\nThe consideration for the acquisition of the Merged Entities was satisfied via the payment of RM904.7 million cash and the issuance of 1,292.5 million new ordinary shares of RM1.00 each at an issue price of RM2.80 each together with 258.5 million free warrants.\n\nThe issuance of the new ordinary shares by the Company in the previous financial years to effect the above transaction has been reflected in the share capital of the Company as shown in Note 43 to the financial statements. As the Merged Entities were under common control before and after the merger, the Group and the Company applied the merger method of accounting. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been accounted for as if the merger had occurred from the date when these entities were under common control.\n\n## 46. OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS\n\n## The Group as lessor\n\nThe following table sets out a maturity analysis for operating lease payments, showing the undiscounted lease payments to be received after the reporting date.\n\n|                             | Group        | Group        |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                             | 2023  RM'000 | 2022  RM'000 |\n| Less than one (1) year      | 57,092       | 54,658       |\n| One (1) to two (2) years    | 56,637       | 56,104       |\n| Two (2) to three (3) years  | 58,412       | 55,764       |\n| Three (3) to four (4) years | 57,606       | 57,973       |\n| Four (4) to five (5) years  | -            | 57,732       |\n|                             | 229,747      | 282,231      |\n\nThe Group entered into various non-cancellable operating lease agreements on properties with third parties. The commercial properties combined leases of land and buildings. At the inception of the lease, it was not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between the land and the buildings. Therefore, the Group evaluated based on terms and conditions of the arrangement, whether the land and the buildings were clearly operating leases or finance leases.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Bhd. ('Metroplex').\n\nOn 28 September 2015, Metroplex filed writ of summons and a statement of claim against Sunway REIT to claim, amongst others, damages for various chattels and movable items (e.g. furniture and office equipment, decorations, cutlery, kitchen equipment, bar equipment, concierge and reception tables, blinds and curtains), which were allegedly acquired and owned by Metroplex but not removed by Metroplex when Sunway REIT took possession of the hotel at Sunway Putra on 27 September 2011. Metroplex has in its statement of claim alleged that the various chattels and movable items were worth in excess of RM80 million as at September 2011.\n\nOn 3 November 2017, the High Court allowed Metroplex's claim on liability in which the damages to be awarded to Metroplex shall be assessed ('High Court's Decision').\n\nSubsequently, Sunway REIT appealed to the Court of Appeal against the High Court's Decision on 6 November 2017. The Court of Appeal allowed Sunway REIT's appeal and the High Court's Decision was set aside on 22 January 2019 ('Court of Appeal's Decision').\n\nOn 20 February 2019, Metroplex filed motion for leave to appeal to the Federal Court against the Court of Appeal's Decision ('Motion'). The Motion was allowed on 25 November 2019. Subsequently, Metroplex filed notice of appeal to appeal against the Court of Appeal's Decision on 2 December 2019 ('Appeal'). The hearing for the Appeal was fixed on 31 March 2021.\n\nOn 31 March 2021, the Federal Court allowed Metroplex's appeal by setting aside the Court of Appeal's Decision, restoring the High Court's Decision and ordered the assessment of damages against Sunway REIT to proceed before the High Court ('Assessment'). In Metroplex's claim, Metroplex is claiming for various chattels and movable items amounting to approximately RM402 million. However, Sunway REIT is strenuously objecting to the amount claimed as being overly excessive and has appointed subject matter experts to dispute the quantum of claim.\n\nThe trial for the said Assessment was held on 4, 5, 6, 12 and 13 January 2023. Upon conclusion of the trial, the High Court judge directed Sunway REIT and Metroplex to appear before the High Court for oral submission on 9 and 15 May 2023. After hearing oral submissions by both parties, the Judge then proceeded to fix the date for the decision to be delivered. At this stage, the financial impact cannot be determined pending the decision of the High Court, which has been adjourned to 30 May 2024.\n\nIn accordance with MFRS 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets , the Group discloses the share of associate's contingent liabilities relating to this legal case as there is a present obligation that arose from past event, although the amount of obligation could not be measured with sufficient reliability at this juncture.\n\n## (b) Material outstanding litigations\n\n- (i) On 4 September 2008, the solicitors of Sunway Construction Sdn. Bhd. ('SunCon') had been served with a Statement of Claim ('Statement of Claim') by Shristi Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd ('Claimant').\n\nPursuant to an agreement signed between SunCon and the National Highway Authority of India for the rehabilitation and upgrading of NH-25 to a four-lane configuration in the state of Uttar Pradesh being a part of the East-West Corridor Project, SunCon had entered into a work order with the Claimant for the upgrading and rehabilitation of the stretch of NH-25 from 143.6 km to 170.0 km, of which the Claimant has provided two bank guarantees ('Bank Guarantees') to SunCon.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTD.)\n\n## (b) Material outstanding litigations (contd.)\n\n- (i) (contd.)\n\nThe Claimant has failed to carry out its obligations under the work order and SunCon has terminated the work order and cashed the Bank Guarantees. The Claimant had filed an application in the Supreme Court of India for the appointment of an arbitrator to arbitrate upon the disputes between the parties. The Supreme Court had appointed the late Mr. H.L. Agarwal as the sole arbitrator.\n\nThe Statement of Claim was raised in respect of various claims and the total amount claimed is Rs.891.5 million (approximately equivalent to RM49.2 million) in addition to interest and cost.\n\nIn the counterclaim, SunCon is seeking for Rs.781.4 million (approximately equivalent to RM43.1 million) for inter alia, additional costs incurred by SunCon to complete the works, recovery of mobilisation advance and interest charges, loss of reputation and loss of profits.\n\n- On 11 January 2013, the arbitrator that presided over the case passed away and 75 hearings had been held.\n\nSunCon was notified by its solicitors that an arbitration petition has been filed by the Claimant on 7 January 2016 in the Supreme Court of India for the appointment of a new arbitrator. The Supreme Court of India by an order dated 5 January 2017 appointed Hon'ble Mr. Justice Vikramajit Sen (a former Judge of the Supreme Court of India) as arbitrator. The first hearing before Mr. Justice Vikramajit Sen was held on 24 February 2017 and cross examination has been completed on 7 October 2017.\n\nThe Arbitrator published his award on 9 April 2019 and awarded the Claimant Rs.128.4 million (approximately equivalent to RM7.1 million).\n\nSunCon has filed an appeal with the High Court of New Delhi in early July 2019 to set aside the arbitral award. The Claimant has also filed an execution application against SunCon for enforcement of the arbitral award.\n\n- On 10 February 2020, the Honorable Court has directed SunCon to deposit, on a without prejudice basis, the decretal amount with interest with the Registrar General of the High Court of Delhi. SunCon has deposited Rs.135.7 million (approximately equivalent to RM7.5 million) on 26 February 2020 and the amount has been fully provided in the accounts on prudence grounds. Subject to compliance of the said direction, the Honorable Court has stayed the Arbitral Award dated 9 April 2019.\n\nOn 4 March 2020, the Claimant filed an application in the High Court of Delhi to permit the Claimant to withdraw the decretal amount deposited by SunCon.\n\nOn 27 August 2020, the Court directed the release of Rs.67.2 million (approximately equivalent to RM3.7 million) on the basis of a corporate guarantee to be furnished by Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd. The balance is to be released subject to furnishing of a bank guarantee. On 3 November 2020, the Court placed on record the corporate guarantee issued on 21 September 2020 and directed the registry to release the amount in terms of the Court order. On 18 November 2020, the Claimant withdrew their application for withdrawal without a bank guarantee and it has been dismissed accordingly.\n\nMatter was adjourned several times. On 20 July 2023, Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd filed an application for release of corporate guarantee and discharge itself from all obligations under the corporate guarantee. Application was heard on 31 July 2023 and is re-notified for arguments on 29 August 2023 and adjourned to 23 November 2023.\n\nOn 20 December 2023, SunCon filed a contempt application against the Claimant and Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd ('Respondents'). The application was listed on 22 December 2023 and the Court has duly issued notice to the Respondents. On 23 January 2024, the Claimant sought an adjournment of two weeks to file their reply which was allowed. The matter came up on 29 February 2024 and is listed for 14 May 2024.\n\nOUR\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nREVIEW\n\nEXEMPLARY\n\nLEADERSHIP\n\nSunway Berhad \u00b7 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\nSunway Berhad \u2022 Integrated Annual Report 2023\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTD.)\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 48.

Matter was adjourned several times.\n\nOn 3 June 2020, SunCon has issued a letter to NHA with the intention to explore the possibility of an amicable resolution of the disputes with NHA through the mechanism of Conciliation Committee of Independent Experts ('CCIE'). After a series of discussion, no amicable settlement ensued between the parties. The next hearing is scheduled for 21 February 2024.\n\nOn 15 July 2023, the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, India has launched the Vivad se Vishwas - II (Contractual Disputes) Scheme vide the Office Memorandum. This scheme is implemented by the Government of India as a one-time settlement scheme to clear the old litigation cases.\n\nThe settlement offer under the scheme was accepted by both parties on 18 December 2023 and NHA had agreed to repay 65% of the award, which amounted to approximately Rs.372.9 million (approximately equivalent to RM20.8 million). This amount of income arising from settlement scheme has been recognised in the financial statement of the Group as at 31 December 2023 as the realisation of income is virtually certain upon acceptance of the settlement amount as disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements.\n\nOn 9 January 2024, by way of application, NHA sought leave to withdraw its appeal stating that the parties had settled their disputes under the 'Vivad se Vishwas II' scheme. NHA has agreed to pay Rs.375.3 million (approximately equivalent to RM21.3 million) inclusive of taxes, to SunCon as full and final settlement of all the claims and disputes pertaining to the contract. The Court allowed NHA's application and stood disposed of as withdrawn. The scheduled hearing date of 21 February 2024 was cancelled. Subsequently, SunCon had received the settlement amount on 1 March 2024.\n\n## 49.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 53. ADOPTION OF MFRSS AND AMENDMENTS TO MFRSS (CONTD.)\n\n## (a) New MFRSs adopted during the financial year (contd.)\n\n## MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nMFRS 17 establishes the principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts and supersedes MFRS 4 Insurance Contracts .\n\nMFRS 17 outlines three measurement approaches for different types of insurance contracts - general measurement model, premium allocation approach and variable fee approach. The general measurement model uses current assumptions to estimate the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows and it explicitly measures the cost of that uncertainty. It takes into account market interest rates and the impact of options and guarantees of policyholders. The general measurement model is simplified if certain criteria are met by measuring the liability for remaining coverage using the premium allocation approach. Variable fee approach is applicable for insurance contracts with direct participation features.\n\nThe Group and the Company do not have any contracts that meet the definition of an insurance contract under MFRS 17, except for guaranteed bank facilities provided to joint ventures and corporate guarantee provided to subsidiaries, which are financial guarantee contracts that the Group and the Company had previously explicitly asserted under MFRS 4 and performance guarantee contracts. The expected future cash outflows of the performance guarantee contracts are negligible. Consequently, the Group is of the view that the carrying amount of the performance guarantee contract liabilities are not material, and hence it is not accounted for. The Group and the Company made an irrevocable choice to apply MFRS 9 Financial Instruments on a contract-by-contract basis to these financial guarantee contracts as at the date of transition to MFRS 17 retrospectively.\n\nThe effects of the adoption are disclosed in Note 54 to the financial statements.\n\n## (b) New MFRSs that have been issued, but only effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024\n\nThe Standards that are issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of financial statements of the Group and of the Company are disclosed below. The Group and the Company intend to adopt these Standards, if applicable, when they become effective.\n\n| Title                                                                                                                     | Effective Date   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Amendments to MFRS 101  Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current                                           | 1 January 2024   |\n| Amendments to MFRS 101  Non-current Liabilities with Covenants                                                            | 1 January 2024   |\n| Amendments to MFRS 16  Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback                                                            | 1 January 2024   |\n| Amendments to MFRS 107 and MFRS 7  Supplier Finance Arrangements                                                          | 1 January 2024   |\n| Amendments to MFRS 121  Lack of Exchangeability                                                                           | 1 January 2025   |\n| Amendments to MFRS 10 and MFRS 128  Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture | Deferred         |\n\nThe Group and the Company are in the process of assessing the impact of implementing these Standards, since the effects would only be observable for the future financial years.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

FINANCIAL EFFECTS ON TRANSITION TO MFRS 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS\n\nThe Group and the Company had previously designated its financial guarantee contracts given to third parties and financial institutions in respect of trade contracts and credit facilities as insurance contracts as defined in MFRS 4 Insurance Contracts . At the transition date to MFRS 17, an entity which had previously applied MFRS 4 to its financial guarantee contracts is given the irrevocable choice to apply either MFRS 17 or MFRS 9 Financial Instruments to such insurance contracts on a contract-by-contract basis.

To receive the Audited Financial Statements for the /financial year ended 31 December 2023 together with the Directors' and Auditors' Reports thereon\n\nThe Audited Financial Statements are for discussion only as they do not require shareholders' approval pursuant to the provisions of Section 340(1) of the Companies Act 2016 (' Act '). As such, this agenda will not be put for voting.\n\n## 2. Ordinary Resolutions 1 and 2\n\nSection 230(1) of the Act provides amongst others, that fees of the Directors and any bene/fits payable to the Directors of a listed company and its subsidiaries shall be approved at a general meeting.

As for the bene/fits payable to the NEDs for the period commencing from 26 June 2024 until the next AGM, they will be paid as and when they are incurred. The Board opined that the payments to the NEDs are just and equitable taking into account their roles and responsibilities towards the Company and the services that they have rendered to the Company.\n\nNEDs who are shareholders of the Company will abstain from voting on the aforesaid resolutions at the 14 th AGM.\n\n## 3. Ordinary Resolutions 3 to 6 - To re-elect Dato' Sri Idris Jala, Tan Sri Datuk Dr. Rebecca Fatima Sta Maria, Datuk Tong Poh Keow and Datuk Mohd Anuar bin Taib as Directors of the Company\n\nClause 106(1) of the Company's Constitution provides that one-third or the number nearest to one-third of the Directors of the Company (including Managing Director) for the time being shall retire by rotation at each AGM of the Company. Each Director shall retire from of/fice once at least in each three years but shall be eligible for re-election.\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NOTICE OF 14 TH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nDato' Sri Idris Jala, Tan Sri Datuk Dr. Rebecca Fatima Sta Maria and Datuk Tong Poh Keow being eligible, have offered themselves for re-election at the 14 th AGM.\n\nClause 89 provides that any Director appointed shall hold of/fice only until the next AGM and shall be eligible for re-election. Datuk Mohd Anuar bin Taib who was appointed on 7 July 2023 is standing for re-election as Director and being eligible, has offered himself for re-election.\n\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee (' NRC ') has assessed the performance and contribution of the retiring Directors including their skills, experience, character, integrity, competency, commitment and contribution as well as the independence of the Independent Directors seeking for re-election at the 14 th AGM. Based on the /findings of the Board and Board Committee Evaluation for the /financial year ended 2023, the performance and contribution of the retiring Directors were found to be satisfactory and they are competent and able to discharge their /fiduciary duties as Directors of the Company. NRC is satis/fied that the retiring Directors meet the /fit and proper criteria as set out in the Fit and Proper Policy. The retiring NEDs also complied and satis/fied the independence criteria as required by the Main Market Listing Requirements (' MMLR ') of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The retiring Directors do not have any con/flict of interest or potential con/flict of interest, including any interest in any competing business with the Company or its subsidiaries.\n\nBased on the above, the Board had endorsed the recommendation of the NRC to seek the shareholders' approval for the re-election of the retiring Directors. All Directors standing for re-election have abstained from deliberations and decisions on their own eligibility to stand for re-election at the relevant NRC and Board Meetings. They will continue to abstain from voting on their own re-election at the 14 th AGM.\n\nThe pro/files of Directors seeking for re-elections at the 14 th AGM are set out in the Pro/file of the Board of Directors on pages 116 to 127 of the Company's Integrated Annual Report 2023.\n\n## 4. Ordinary Resolution 7 - To re-appoint Messrs BDO PLT as Auditors of the Company for the /financial year ending 31 December 2024 and to authorise the Directors to /fix their remuneration\n\nBased on the results of the External Auditors Evaluation for the /financial year ended 31 December 2023 and the Audit Committee's recommendation, the Board had at its meeting held on 4 April 2024, approved the re-appointment of Messrs BDO PLT (' BDO ') as Auditors of the Company on the basis that BDO had satisfactorily performed their audit and that BDO had discharged their professional responsibilities in accordance with its rules on professional conduct and ethics and the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conducts and Practice) issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants.\n\nThe Board was also satis/fied that the provisions of non-audit services by BDO to the Company for the /financial year ended 31 December 2023 did not in any way impair their objectivity and independence as External Auditors of the Company.\n\n## (ii) Special Business\n\n## 5. Ordinary Resolution 8 - Authority to Issue Shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the Act\n\nThe Company is always on the lookout for investment opportunities to enhance the earnings potential of the Company. If any investment opportunities involve issuance of new shares, the Directors, under present circumstances, would have to convene a general meeting to approve the issuance of new shares even though the number involved may be less than 10% of the total number of issued shares of the Company.\n\nIn order to avoid any delay and costs involved in convening a general meeting to approve such issuance of shares, it is thus considered appropriate that the Directors be empowered to issue new shares in the Company, up to an amount not exceeding in total 10% of the total number of issued shares of the Company at any time, for such purpose. This authority, unless revoked or varied at a general meeting, will expire at the next AGM of the Company.\n\nThe renewal of this mandate will provide /flexibility to the Company for any potential fund raising activities, including but not limited to placement of shares, for purpose of funding current and/or future investments, working capital, acquisition, repayment of borrowings, operational expenditure and/or such other applications as they may in their absolute discretion deem /fit.\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nFINANCIALS\n\nINFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
