As part of a project to produce more eco-friendly cleaning agents, she worked in a team on a preservative of natural origin - one of the few ingredients that has mainly been produced synthetically until now. The basis: terpenes extracted from orange peel. No other country produces more oranges than Brazil. So why not use the peel? The preservative Lutensit \u00ae EcoCitrus can be used in a variety of household cleaners and detergents to effectively counteract bacteria and fungi in an environmentally friendly way.

We show how we as a company create value for our stakeholders and how sustainability contributes to BASF's long-term success as an integral part of our corporate purpose and our strategy.\n\n## Content and structure\n\nThe BASF Report, which is published each year in English and German,  combines  the  major  financial  and  sustainability-related information necessary to comprehensively evaluate the company's performance. We select the report's topics based on the following principles: materiality, completeness, sustainability context, balance and stakeholder inclusion. In addition to this report, we publish further information online. The relevant links can be found at the end of each chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe management's reports for the BASF Group and BASF SE have been combined for the first time in this annual report. The reporting period is from January 1, 2023, up to and including December 31. Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  presentation  of  the  results  of operations, financial position and net assets as well as the expected development with its significant opportunities and risks relate to the BASF Group. Information relating exclusively to BASF SE is marked as such and is dealt with in a separate section (Disclosures on BASF SE in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB)). The combined  Nonfinancial  Statement  (NFS)  is  integrated  into  the Combined Management's Report and includes, as far as possible, the disclosures for the BASF  Group and BASF  SE as the parent company. Material topics for BASF SE are largely congruent with the topics identified for the BASF Group. Deviations are presented in the separate nonfinancial section on BASF SE on page  189. The NFS disclosures can be found in the relevant sections of the Combined  Management's  Report  and  have  been  prepared  in accordance with the appropriate frameworks: the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and the reporting requirements of the U.N. Global Compact.\n\nThe information on the financial position and performance of the BASF Group complies with the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and, where applicable, the German Commercial Code (HGB), German Accounting Standards (GAS) and the guidelines on alternative performance measures from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Internal control mechanisms ensure the reliability of the information presented in this report.\n\nThe information contained in this report also serves as a progress report on BASF's implementation of the 10 principles of the U.N. Global Compact. KPMG  AG  Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft has performed an independent limited assurance of the disclosures in the online GRI Index. The results of this assurance are also available in the online report in the form of an assurance statement. We also\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npublish additional information on sustainability online in accordance with  the  industry-specific  requirements  of  the  Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). BASF's Report addresses elements of the framework of the former International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), which is now incorporated into the work of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop internationally recognized standards for sustainability reporting. Our involvement in networks  and  in  national and  international standard-setting  bodies  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  share  our experiences  of  integrated  reporting  with  stakeholders  and,  at the  same  time,  give  and  receive  inspiration  for  enhancing  our reporting.\n\nMaterial topics along the value chain form the focal points of our reporting and define the limits of this report. In identifying, prioritizing and validating material, sustainability-related topics, we are guided by  the  principle  of  double  materiality,  taking  into  consideration financial materiality and impact materiality. General information on the  materiality  analysis  can  be  found  under  'Our  Sustainability Concept' from page 48 onward. Material topics are explained in the 'Material Topics in Focus' sections.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the results of operations, net assets and financial position,\n\nsee page 61 onward\n\nFor more information on our sustainability reporting, see page 48 and 100 onward\n\n- The 2023 BASF Online Report can be found at basf.com/report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe GRI and Global Compact Index can be found at basf.com/en/gri-gc\n\nThe SASB index can be found at basf.com/sasb",

The data and information for the reporting period were sourced  from  the  expert  units  responsible  using  representative methods. Due to rounding, individual figures may not add up exactly to the totals shown and percentages may not correspond exactly to the figures shown. The reporting period is the 2023 business year. We include relevant information made available up to the preparation of this report by the Board of Executive Directors at the accounts meeting on February 19, 2024 (editorial deadline).\n\nBASF  Group's  scope  of  consolidation  for  its  financial  reporting comprises  BASF  SE,  with  its  headquarters  in  Ludwigshafen, Germany,  and  all  of  its  fully  consolidated  subsidiaries  and proportionally consolidated joint operations. Shares in joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for, if material, using the equity method  in  the  BASF  Group  Consolidated  Financial Statements and are thus not included in the scope of consolidation.\n\nThe section 'Employees' refers to employees active in a company within the BASF Group's scope of consolidation as of December 31, 2023. Our data collection methods for environmental protection and safety are based on the recommendations of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) and the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC). We report all data of the worldwide production sites of BASF SE, its fully consolidated subsidiaries and proportionally consolidated joint operations in the sections 'Environmental' and 'Social.' BASF  SE subsidiaries that are fully consolidated in the Group financial statements in which BASF holds an interest of less than  100%  are  included  in  full  in  environmental  reporting.  The emissions  of  proportionally  consolidated  joint  operations  are disclosed  pro  rata  according  to  the  respective  shareholding. Work-related accidents at all sites of BASF SE and its subsidiaries as well as joint operations and joint ventures in which we have authority in terms of safety management are compiled worldwide regardless of our interest and reported in full. Unless otherwise\n\nindicated, data on social responsibility and transportation safety refers to the BASF Group's scope of consolidation.\n\n## External audit\n\nOur reporting is independently audited by third parties. KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft has audited the BASF Group  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  the  Combined Management's Report and has approved them free of qualification. The limited assurance of the sustainability information contained in the Management's Report was conducted in accordance with ISAE 3000  (Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial  Information)  and  ISAE  3410  (Assurance Engagements  on  Greenhouse  Gas  Statements),  the  relevant assurance standards for sustainability reporting. KPMG conducted a reasonable assurance of all disclosures on the most important nonfinancial key performance indicator 'absolute CO2 emissions' (Scope 1 and 2). KPMG also conducted a limited assurance of the combined Nonfinancial Statement (NFS).\n\n- The Independent Auditor's Report can be found on page 221 onward\n- An assurance statement on the sustainability information in the BASF Report 2023\n- can be found at basf.com/sustainability\\_information\n\nAn assurance statement of the NFS can be found at basf.com/nfs-audit-2023\n\n## Forward-looking statements and forecasts\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current estimates and projections of the Board of Executive Directors and currently available information. Forward-looking  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  the  future developments and results outlined therein. These are dependent on a number of factors: they involve various risks and uncertainties and they are based on assumptions that may not prove to be accurate. Such  risk  factors  include  in  particular  those  discussed  in Opportunities and Risks on pages 173 to 183. We do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this report above and beyond the legal requirements.\n\n## Symbols used and captions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- You can find more information in this report.\n\nYou  can  find  more  information  online.

        "page_content": "At BASF, we are accustomed to working under pressure - and not just in our plants. The year 2023 once again required enormous effort on our part, as the entire chemical industry is in upheaval. Our markets, our competitors and the needs of our customers are changing rapidly. The world is still experiencing geopolitical conflicts, weak economic growth and high interest rates due to ongoing inflation. In Europe, structurally higher energy price levels, extremely sluggish growth  and  overregulation  are  especially  challenging  for  the competitiveness  of  local  European  producers.  This  difficult  environment  is demanding everything from us and is reflected in our figures.\n\nHowever, we accept these challenges. We are taking action to maintain our competitiveness, especially in Germany. We want to grow profitably worldwide and become climate-neutral. We worked hard on this in 2023. I am convinced:\n\nWe will succeed in all these areas because we are a strong company. We have the will to change and a concrete plan, which we are systematically implementing. And we will emerge even stronger from these tough times, just as we have done repeatedly over our 158-year history.\n\n## Clear focus on strengthening competitiveness and profitability\n\nBASF supplies products and services to around 78,000 customers from various sectors in almost every country in the world. We want to further strengthen these relationships  and  win  new  customers  too.  The  operating  environment  has changed significantly in recent years for our Battery Materials, Coatings and Agricultural Solutions businesses. Our competitors in these sectors are making a\n\nmore focused push into the market and are thus increasingly challenging us. At the same time, these business areas are not integrated so deeply into the BASF Verbund. That is why we will be giving them more space - so they can tailor their business models and processes more precisely to the needs of their customers and perform even more successfully on\n\n' We have the will to change and a concrete plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe market. Despite these changes, BASF remains an integrated company with a broad portfolio. Particularly in a year such as 2023, this structure proved its value once again. The Coatings and Agricultural Solutions divisions generated record earnings, which partly offset weak results in other segments.\n\nIn Germany in particular, we are working systematically on our competitiveness and  profitability.  We  are  reducing  our  costs  by  adapting  our  production structures, among other measures. We acted promptly, but we must not let up. Given the extremely difficult market environment and structural challenges, we need targeted measures at our site in Ludwigshafen in particular to make it fit for the future. And we will continue to be under enormous pressure here owing to the weak demand compared with other regions, high energy prices and increasingly far-reaching regulatory requirements. This is why we are implementing changes where we need to. We are altering where it makes us better. But we are also investing where we see opportunities.",

        "page_content": "## Focus on future industries and growth markets\n\nOur strategy is to produce locally for local markets. We want to be close to our customers, and we focus on innovation-driven growth areas. In 2023, we opened  Europe's  first  colocated  center  for  battery  material  production  and battery recycling in Schwarzheide, Germany. We are the first global producer of battery materials with production in all three core markets: Europe, the United States and Asia. In Geismar, Louisiana, the expansion of our MDI plant is well  underway.  This  enables  us  to  serve  the  growing  demand  from  our North American customers in industries such as construction, automotive and\n\n' We are altering where it makes us better and investing where we see opportunities.\n\nfurniture. And construction at our new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, is proceeding at an impressive pace on a site the size of 550 soccer fields. This project is fully on schedule and on budget.\n\nAs we decided in 2018, we will be divesting the oil and gas business. At the end of 2023, BASF, LetterOne and Harbour Energy signed an advantageous agreement to combine the businesses of Wintershall Dea and Harbour Energy. It is planned to transfer the\n\nexploration and production business, excluding Russia-related activities, to the publicly listed firm Harbour Energy in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n## Pioneer on the path to climate neutrality\n\nBy 2050, we aim to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions for our production (Scope 1) and our energy purchases (Scope 2). Despite the difficult economic times, we are firmly committed to this ambitious goal. I am excited and proud to see how the entire BASF team is pulling together to make this a reality. We are changing how we produce. With new electrified technologies, such as the world's first electrically heated steam cracker furnace, we are testing what is possible. We are transitioning our energy supply from grey to green. Whether through investments in  wind  farms,  solar  parks  or  green  electricity  contracts,  we  already  meet 20% of our electricity demand from renewable sources. By 2030, this proportion should rise to at least 60% worldwide - even though our demand for electricity is\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngrowing. We  are getting ever closer to this target. We  officially inaugurated the offshore wind farm Hollandse Kust Zuid in the Dutch North Sea\n\nin 2023. This is an incredible success! And we are already  pursuing  two  other  major  wind  farms: in  the  German  North  Sea  and  off  the  coast  of Zhanjiang in China.\n\nMoreover,  we  have  committed  to  reducing  the greenhouse gas emissions from raw materials purchased from our suppliers. By 2030, we intend to\n\n' I am excited to see how the entire BASF team is pulling together.\n\nreduce our specific Scope 3.1 emissions by 15%  compared with 2022. In the future, we want to source raw materials with a smaller carbon footprint than today's level from our suppliers.\n\nFurthermore, we are steadily expanding our portfolio of low-emission products. As part of this, we are also advancing the circular economy. With loopamid \u00ae , BASF launched a solution for greater circularity in the textile industry in early 2024. Textile waste is recycled as a valuable raw material to produce polyamide 6. This idea strikes a chord with our customers: Fashion company Zara recently presented a jacket made entirely of recycled polyamide. All its components - from the fabrics and filling to the hook-and-loop fastener and zipper - are made of loopamid \u00ae , so the garment is also 100% recyclable. This is a fantastic achievement!\n\n## Framework conditions remain difficult\n\nAll these successes cannot hide the fact that 2023 was an economically tough year for BASF. We did not reach our targets or meet analyst estimates for sales and income from operations (EBIT) before special items. Our sales in 2023 amounted to \u20ac68.9 billion (2022: \u20ac87.3 billion), a decrease of around 21% versus the prior year. The downward sales trend was driven by significantly lower prices and volumes, while currency effects also had a dampening effect on sales. EBIT before special items declined to \u20ac3.8 billion (2022: \u20ac6.9 billion). This year-on-year decline of nearly 45% resulted from lower margins due to decreased sales. These could not be offset by the reduction in fixed costs we achieved.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We considerably reduced our inventory levels and achieved a strong cash flow from operating activities. BASF therefore continues to have a high equity ratio and a strong balance sheet. This is all good news for you, dear shareholders.\n\n' BASF continues to have a high equity ratio and a strong balance sheet.\n\nIt is our goal to increase our dividend per share each year, or at least maintain it at the previous year's level. We will therefore propose a dividend of \u20ac3.40 per share, matching the prior-year level, to  the  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  in  April 2024. Based on the 2023 year-end share price of \u20ac48.78, the BASF share again offers a high dividend yield of 7.0%.\n\nThe framework conditions will remain difficult in 2024. We expect the subdued momentum in the global economy seen in 2023 to continue into the first half of 2024. Global economic growth will likely only pick up slightly as the year progresses.\n\n## Positive change requires a team effort\n\nFor the chemical industry, Europe will continue to be the most challenging market due to its low growth and structurally higher energy prices compared with other regions. In addition, there are increasingly far-reaching regulatory requirements. BASF and large parts of our customer industries are drowning in this sea of red tape. Nevertheless, I remain an optimist! We can successfully maintain and strengthen our industrial basis in Europe if there is widespread willingness to embrace change among society, business and policymakers. But this will also require a new regulatory framework. One that promotes innovations for climate protection, enables the international competitiveness of new processes and accelerates the expansion of renewable energies at competitive prices. We need an 'Industrial Deal' to again foster more entrepreneurship, creativity and profitable growth for the chemical industry and our customer industries in Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt BASF, chemistry is our passion.

Institutional investors from Germany accounted for around 4%. Institutional investors from the United Kingdom and Ireland hold 8% of BASF shares, while investors from the rest of Europe hold a further 10% of capital. Approximately 47% of the company's share capital is held by private investors, nearly all of whom reside in Germany. BASF is therefore one of the DAX companies with the largest percentage of private shareholders.\n\n## Employees becoming shareholders\n\nIn many countries, we offer share purchase programs that turn our employees into BASF shareholders.

In identifying, prioritizing and validating topics, we are guided by the principle of double materiality, taking into consideration financial materiality and impact materiality. The identified topics are explained in this report in the 'Material Topics in Focus' sections.\n\nIn 2023, we updated our materiality analysis that already addressed the double materiality required by regulations from 2024 onward. This identified sustainability topics on which we have potentially positive or negative impacts through our business activities along the value chain, and that have or could have positive or negative impacts on the company's performance.\n\nThe following adjustments were made to the 2022 analysis as part of the update: 'Occupational health and safety' has been expanded to include the topic 'process safety,' while 'plastic waste' was integrated  into  the  overarching  topic  of  'circular  economy  and resource efficiency.' Based on this update, a total of 11 topics were identified as material. As a result, we will address material topics in focus chapters in this report. The graphic on the right shows how these topics impact the stages of the value chain.\n\nFor more information on our materiality analysis, see page 49 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Material topics along the value chain\n\n| Focus topic                                                | SUPPLIERS   | BASF   | CUSTOMERS   | Page     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|\n| Environmental                                              |             |        |             |          |\n| Climate Change                                             |             |        |             | Page 29  |\n| Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency                   |             |        |             | Page 46  |\n| Emissions to Air, Waste and Remediation                    |             |        |             | Page 110 |\n| Water                                                      |             |        |             | Page 112 |\n| Biodiversity and Ecosystems                                |             |        |             | Page 116 |\n| Process Safety                                             |             |        |             | Page 127 |\n| Social                                                     |             |        |             |          |\n| Inclusion of Diversity                                     |             |        |             | Page 138 |\n| Occupational Safety and Health Protection                  |             |        |             | Page 143 |\n| Product Stewardship for Crop Protection Products and Seeds |             |        |             | Page 149 |\n| Governance                                                 |             |        |             |          |\n| Our Values and Global Standards                            |             |        |             | Page 33  |\n| Responsibility for Human Rights, Labor and                 |             |        |             | Page 154 |\n| Social Standards                                           |             |        |             |          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHigher impact\n\nLower impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n22",

Around 112,000 employees contribute to the BASF Group's success worldwide. Our business comprises the Chemicals, Materials, Industrial Solutions, Surface Technologies, Nutrition & Care and Agricultural Solutions segments.\n\n## Sites and Verbund\n\nAs one of the world's largest chemical companies, BASF is present in 93 countries. We operate 234 production sites worldwide. We laid the foundation for the Verbund concept in Ludwigshafen, Germany, in 1865 - and it remains one of our key strengths to this day. Intelligently linking and steering our Verbund plants creates efficient value chains - from basic chemicals to high value-added solutions. The Verbund enables us to manage our production in a resourceefficient, carbon-optimized and reliable way. By-products from one facility are used as feedstocks elsewhere, for example. This saves raw materials and energy, avoids emissions, lowers logistics costs and leverages synergies.\n\nIn addition to Ludwigshafen, Germany, BASF operates five other Verbund  sites  in  Antwerp,  Belgium;  Freeport,  Texas;  Geismar, Louisiana; Kuantan, Malaysia; and Nanjing, China. Another Verbund site is being built in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Following the startup of the engineering plastics plant in 2022, a plant for the production of thermoplastic polyurethanes came onstream there in 2023.\n\nWe  also  use  the  Verbund  principle  for  more  than  production, applying it to technologies, the market and digitalization as well. Our research  expertise  is  pooled  globally,  with  the  Know-How  and Research Verbund in Ludwigshafen, Germany, as the central hub.\n\n- For more information on the Verbund concept, see basf.com/en/verbund\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on our segments' investments, see page 42 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The BASF Group's segments in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chemicals\n\nThe Chemicals segment supplies BASF's other segments and customers with basic chemicals and intermediates.\n\n- \u25aa Share of sales: 15.0%\n- \u25aa R&D expenses: \u20ac83 million\n- \u25aa Investments incl. acquisitions 1 : \u20ac2,706 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Surface Technologies\n\nThe Surface Technologies segment provides chemical solutions for surfaces and automotive OEM coatings, as well as battery materials and catalysts.\n\n- \u25aa Share of sales: 23.5%\n- \u25aa R&D expenses: \u20ac304 million\n- \u25aa Investments incl. acquisitions 1 : \u20ac621 million\n\n## Nutrition & Care\n\nThe Nutrition & Care segment produces ingredients and solutions for consumer applications such as human and animal nutrition, cleaning agents and personal care.\n\n- \u25aa Share of sales: 10.0%\n- \u25aa R&D expenses: \u20ac150 million\n- \u25aa Investments incl. acquisitions 1 : \u20ac765 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materials\n\nIn the Materials segment, we produce advanced materials and their precursors for the plastics and plastics processing industries.\n\n- \u25aa Share of sales: 20.5%\n- \u25aa R&D expenses: \u20ac185 million\n- \u25aa Investments incl. acquisitions 1 : \u20ac1,083 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Industrial Solutions\n\nThe Industrial Solutions segment develops and markets ingredients and additives for industrial applications.\n\n- \u25aa Share of sales: 11.6%\n- \u25aa R&D expenses: \u20ac150 million\n- \u25aa Investments incl. acquisitions 1 : \u20ac285 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agricultural Solutions\n\nThe Agricultural Solutions segment is an integrated solutions provider of seeds, crop protection products and digital solutions for the agricultural sector.\n\n- \u25aa Share of sales: 14.6%\n- \u25aa R&D expenses: \u20ac900 million\n- \u25aa Investments incl. acquisitions 1 : \u20ac353 million",

We provide a high level of transparency around the results of our segments and show the importance of the Verbund and value chains to our business success. The operating divisions, the service units, the regions, research and development and the corporate center  are  the  cornerstones  of  the  BASF  organization.  This organizational structure lays the foundation for customer proximity, competitiveness and profitable growth. BASF aims to differentiate its businesses from their competitors to enable BASF to perform even more strongly in an increasingly competitive market environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe divisions bear strategic and operational responsibility and are organized  according  to  sectors  or  products.  They  manage  the 49  global and regional business units and develop strategies for 70 strategic business units.\n\nFive service units provide competitive services for the BASF Group:\n\n- - Global Engineering Services\n- - Global Digital Services\n- - Global Procurement\n- - European Site & Verbund Management\n- - Global Business Services (finance and controlling, human resources, safety, intellectual property, communications, procurement, supply chain and in-house consulting services).\n\nBASF's regional and national companies represent the Group locally and support the growth of the operating divisions with local proximity to customers. For financial reporting purposes, we organize the regional companies into four regions: Europe; North America; Asia Pacific; and South America, Africa and Middle East.\n\nOur specific research and development units are integrated into the divisions, and activities with broad relevance for our businesses are bundled in a research division.

        "page_content": "## Business and competitive environment\n\nBASF's global presence means that it operates in the context of various local, regional and global developments. These include:\n\n- - Global economic and political environment\n- - Legal and political requirements\n- - International trade agreements\n- - Industry standards\n- - Environmental agreements (such as the E.U. Emissions Trading System)\n- - Social aspects (such as the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights)\n\nBASF holds one of the top three market positions in around 80% of the business areas in which it is active.     Our most important global  competitors  include  Arkema,  Bayer,  Celanese,  Clariant, Corteva,  Covestro,  Dow,  DSM-Firmenich,  Evonik,  Huntsman, SABIC, Sinopec, Solvay, Syngenta, Wanhua and many hundreds of local and regional competitors. We expect competitors from Asia and the Middle East in particular to continue to grow in significance in the years ahead.\n\n## Our measures in Europe\n\nThe situation in Europe remains challenging. Low market growth and structurally higher gas prices compared with other regions are weakening the competitiveness of the European chemical industry. The  comprehensive  requirements  resulting  from  the  European Green Deal are an additional burden on the industry.\n\n- For more information on the development of gas prices in 2023, see page 60\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a reaction to this, BASF announced concrete measures for a cost savings program in nonproduction units with a focus on Europe in February 2023. These measures include the systematic bundling of services in hubs, simplifying structures in divisional management, the rightsizing of service units, and increasing the efficiency of R&D\n\nactivities. Taking into account new positions to be created, this is expected to result in a total reduction of 2,600 positions worldwide.\n\nThe cost savings program was launched in 2023. We expect annual cost savings in nonproduction areas to reach more than \u20ac600 million by the end of 2024 and more than \u20ac700 million by the end of 2026. These figures include measures related to Europe in the Global Business  Services  and  Global  Digital  Services  units.  Additional measures in these two service units in other regions will probably contribute a further \u20ac200 million.\n\nIn addition, in 2023, BASF took measures to adjust production structures at the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany. These adjustments include the shutdown of the caprolactam plant, the plants for cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone and soda ash, one of the two  ammonia  plants  and  the  fertilizer  facility.  In  addition,  the shutdown of the TDI plant and the precursor plants for dinitrotoluene and  toluylenediamine  was  also  announced.  Furthermore,  the production capacity of adipic acid will be reduced in Ludwigshafen, Germany.  The  following  plant  shutdowns  have  already  been completed as of 2023: TDI plant, plant for TDI precursors, ammonia plant and the fertilizer facility. Further shutdowns will be implemented gradually until the end of 2026. These measures in production are expected to affect around 700 positions. BASF expects to reduce fixed costs in this way by more than \u20ac200 million per year.\n\nTogether with the savings from the aforementioned cost savings program focusing on Europe, we expect total annual savings of around \u20ac1.1 billion from the end of 2026.\n\n## Corporate legal structure\n\nAs the publicly listed parent company of the BASF Group, BASF SE takes a central position: Directly or indirectly, it holds the shares in the companies belonging to the BASF Group and is also one of the largest  operating  companies.  In  the  BASF  Group  Consolidated Financial Statements, 260 companies including BASF SE are fully consolidated. We consolidate nine joint operations on a proportional basis and account for 21 companies using the equity method.\n\nFor more information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 238 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

All of this requires a clear vision, responsible action as well as a high degree of creativity and flexibility.\n\nWe want to grow profitably and sustainably. To this end, we have set ourselves  ambitious  targets  and  defined  concrete  measures  to achieve them: To increase our profitability, we are strengthening our competitiveness with  our  cost  savings  program  focusing  on Europe  and  we  are  adapting  our  Verbund  structures  in Ludwigshafen, Germany, to ensure the site remains future-proof (see page 26). We are investing in growth markets , particularly in Asia, with China as the largest and most important growth driver of global  chemical  production.  Furthermore,  we  are  undergoing  a fundamental transformation in the way we steer our company. As part of our Differentiated Steering concept, we are implementing new financial steering indicators tailored to each business. Our operating  divisions  are  also  continuing  to  adapt  their  specific business  models  and  processes  -  supported  by  customized process structures, IT systems and governance frameworks (see page 37 onward).\n\nTo further embed sustainability in our business activities, we are driving innovations for a sustainable future , focusing our portfolio on growth areas and developing products with a lower carbon footprint. We are pioneers in climate-neutral production . This means  we  are  gradually  converting  our  energy  supply  from fossil  fuels  to  renewable  sources,  developing  new,  pioneering emission-free  and  low-emission  production  processes  for  our products as well as strengthening the circular economy through the use of alternative raw materials and new recycling technologies.\n\nThe success of these measures depends primarily on the ideas and commitment of our employees. This is why we want to create an environment in which they can thrive and contribute to BASF's long-term success. Moreover, the diverse potential of digitalization used in our processes and business models further contributes to the successful implementation of these measures.\n\n- For more information on our strategic action areas, see page 30 onward For more information on our steering concept, see page 37 onward For more information on our targets, see page 40 onward\n- For more information on our strategy, see basf.com/strategy",

Swift and resolute action is needed to achieve the targets agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement. We stand by this responsibility. In many areas, products and innovations based on chemistry are the key to a climate-neutral future - from insulation foams for energy-efficient buildings, lightweight construction components and battery materials for electromobility to more sustainable agriculture.\n\nWe expanded our climate protection targets: By 2050, we want to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for our production (Scope 1), our energy purchases (Scope 2) 1 and our purchase of raw  materials  (Scope  3.1).  We  have  set  ourselves  ambitious milestones on this path: By 2030, we want to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 25% compared with 2018 - while growing production volumes in parallel. Compared with 1990, this translates into  a  reduction  of  around  60%.  As  we  become  increasingly transparent about our upstream emissions and want to offer more products with a low carbon footprint to our customers, we have set ourselves another intermediate target: We aim to reduce our raw materials-related emissions specifically by 15% by 2030 from the 2022 baseline. 2\n\nTo achieve our climate protection targets, we are focusing on the following measures: Our electricity needs are increasingly covered using renewable energy . We are developing emission-free and low-emission  production  processes,  building  on  lower-emission steam generation and improving the energy and process efficiency of our plants ( carbon abatement ). We are also increasingly using renewable, recycled and CO2-based raw materials in order to close material cycles ( circularity ). To reduce our raw materials-related emissions, we are working with our suppliers.\n\nWe want to help shape the transformation towards climate neutrality in a socially just way (just transition). This requires a political and regulatory environment  that  promotes  innovation  in  climate protection, makes it possible to develop new processes that are\n\n## 2030 targets\n\n-25%\n\nReduction in our absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 1 compared with 2018\n\n## 2050 target\n\n## Net-zero\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (Scope 1, 2 1 and 3.1)\n\ncompetitive  internationally  and  resolutely  drives  forward  the expansion of renewable energies. Our electricity requirements from renewable sources will increase significantly due to new, loweremission  production  processes.  To  meet  this  demand,  we  are investing in our own power assets (wind farms and solar power plants) and are increasingly buying green electricity on the market (make & buy approach). We are also addressing the question of how climate change affects our sites and implementing climate resilience measures (see page 113).\n\nFor more information on energy and climate protection, see page 102 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Scope 1 and Scope 2 (excluding the sale of energy to third parties).

        "page_content": "## Our Strategic Action Areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF's  strategic  direction  is  based  on  a  comprehensive analysis  of  our  markets,  competitors  and  the  economic environment.  We  continuously  monitor  global  trends  and short-term developments  and  anticipate the resulting opportunities and risks. In doing so, we keep a close eye on the demands of our customers and the transformation of our company. The following six strategic action areas enable us to strengthen our leading position in a competitive environment.\n\n## Innovation\n\nInnovation is the bedrock and driver of our success. BASF is a leader in the chemical industry with around 10,000 employees in research and development and R&D spending of around \u20ac2.1 billion in 2023. We want to further strengthen this position by driving forward  our  research  activities,  especially  in  agriculture,  battery materials, polymer technologies and catalytic and biotechnological methods. Our research units are organizationally aligned with the needs of our customers. Customer-focused activities are directly integrated into the divisions. Research activities that are relevant to several operating divisions as well as Group-wide relevant topics are driven by the global division Group Research. In addition, we are pursuing  and  expanding  our  cooperations  with  customers, universities and research institutions.\n\nWe  want  to  gear  our innovation  pipeline to  sustainability  especially climate protection, circular economy  and  more sustainable products for our customers. This lays the foundation for  future  growth.  We  are  working  intensively  on  fundamental innovations  for  processes,  products  and  business  models,  for example, for the low-emission production of basic chemicals, new battery materials and catalyst technologies, chemical recycling of plastics and textiles, and digital, climate-smart farming models. At the  same  time,  we  are  developing  new  products  and  product improvements in all business units that can offer our customers sustainability and competitive advantages. These include surface\n\nsolutions for the aviation and wind power industries, bio-based and biodegradable active ingredients for the cosmetics, detergent and cleaner industries, and engineering plastics based on renewable or recycled raw materials.\n\n- For more information on innovation, see page 54 onward\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe  believe  that  the  economy,  environment  and  society  are inextricably linked and interdependent. In all three areas we want to create value with our products, solutions and technologies. Already in 1994, we pledged our commitment to sustainability and since then, have systematically aligned our activities with the principles  of  sustainability.  We  want  to  further  strengthen  our position as a pioneer for sustainable solutions. We see sustainability as an integral part of our strategy as well as our targets, steering processes and business models. In doing so, our aim is to be a responsible and attractive partner for our customers, develop new growth areas and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company. Our approach covers the entire value chain - from the responsible  procurement  of  our  raw  materials  and  safety  and resource efficiency in production to sustainable solutions for our customers.\n\nIn this context, protecting the climate is of central importance for us. We have reduced our CO2 emissions by around 60% since 1990 at the  same  time,  sales  product  volumes  have  increased significantly.  By  2030,  we  want  to  reduce  our  absolute  CO2 emissions  related  to  our  production  (Scope  1)  and  our  energy purchases (Scope 2) by 25% compared with 2018. In 2023, we also set  ourselves  a  target  for  our  raw  materials-related  emissions (Scope 3.1) to be able to offer our customers an even wider range of products with a low carbon footprint. By 2030, we want to reduce these raw materials-related emissions specifically by 15% from the 2022 baseline. Furthermore, by 2050, we want to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for our production, our energy and raw\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supercomputer enables new research approaches\n\nIn 2023, BASF  commissioned  a  new  supercomputer  in Ludwigshafen, Germany. Quriosity is the world's largest supercomputer used in industrial chemical research. It replaces the supercomputer  that  has  been  deployed  since  2017.  With three petaflops of computing power, the new supercomputer is considerably more powerful than its 1.75-petaflops predecessor. As the  complexity  of  research  projects  is  increasing,  we  have expanded our computing capacities accordingly.\n\nIn the personal care business area, for example, the supercomputer's complex simulations help employees to precisely predict which cosmetic ingredients harmonize optimally together to achieve the desired effect. At an early stage in the development of crop protection products, the supercomputer uses molecular modeling to quickly identify suitable compounds that are effective and environmentally sound. However, the supercomputer is also used  in  projects  outside  of  research  and  development,  for example, to optimize plant components in production operations.",

        "page_content": "materials purchases. To achieve our climate protection goals , we are  relying  on  the  use  of  renewable  energy,  taking  targeted measures to avoid CO2 emissions, working to close material cycles and working together with our suppliers to reduce emissions in the supply chain (see page 29).\n\nWe  are  focusing  our  product  portfolio  even  more  strongly  on resource efficiency, climate change and energy as well as circular economy in order to meet the increasing sustainability requirements of our  customers  with  innovative  solutions  and  to  comply  with regulatory  requirements.  That  is  why  we  have  updated  our Sustainable Solution Steering (TripleS) methodology for steering the product portfolio based on sustainability criteria (see page 48). We applied  the  new  methodology  for  the  first  time  in  the  2023 financial  year  and  developed  a  new  key  performance  indicator, 'Sustainable-Future Solutions' sales, which indicates the share of our products  with  a  particular  contribution  to  sustainability  in  the relevant sales. In addition, a digital solution enables us to calculate the carbon footprint of our approximately 45,000 sales products - from raw materials extraction to the factory gate ('cradle-to-gate'). This enables us to create transparency around the carbon intensity of our products  and  optimize  our  processes  on  this  basis:  We  are increasingly using low-emission and renewable raw materials and are continuously expanding  our  product  portfolio with a lower carbon footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on energy and climate protection and our carbon footprint, see page 102 onward For more information on the circular economy, see page 46 onward\n\n## Production\n\nThe production and processing of chemicals is our core business. Our comprehensive product portfolio ranges from basic chemicals to custom system solutions. The strength of our company lies in the Verbund and its integrated value chains. This enables us to achieve reliable,  efficient  and  CO2-optimized  production  and  leverages synergies in the development and application of new technologies and the use of digital solutions. At the same time, the Verbund is the\n\nfoundation  for  meeting  the  increasingly  diverse  needs  of  our customers and markets with a differentiated offering.\n\nOur strategy is to produce locally for local markets, close to our customers. We plan to invest \u20ac19.5 billion worldwide between 2024 and 2027 to expand our capacities based on market demand and to further increase the availability, efficiency and flexibility of our plants. In particular, we want to benefit from the strong growth of the chemical market in Asia (see 'Portfolio'). Our global production footprint contributes to the regional diversification of our sales and earnings distribution, making it part of our risk management. It helps us to compensate for economic weaknesses and a lack of growth prospects  in  individual  markets  within  the  BASF  Group.  This currently applies to Europe and especially Germany, where high energy  prices  compared  with  other  regions  and  a  challenging regulatory environment are negatively impacting our competitiveness and growth.\n\n- For more information on our production sites and the Verbund structure, see page 23\n\n## Digitalization\n\nWe want to leverage the diverse growth potential of digitalization, seize the associated opportunities to the benefit of our customers and strengthen our competitiveness. To achieve this, we promote digital skills among our employees, cooperate with partners and make digital technologies and ways of working an integral part of our business.\n\nDigitalizing our plants and systematically analyzing data enables us to further automate processes. In this way, we steer the capacity, availability and efficiency of our plants in line with market conditions, for  example,  by  simulating  value  streams  within  our  Verbund structure  or  through  predictive  maintenance.  Linking  data  from different  sources  and  using  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  opens  up numerous  opportunities  for  us  to  manage  our  business  more efficiently and improve our processes, for example, in logistics. Using AI also supports our transformation to climate neutrality and a\n\ncircular economy,  for  example  by  automatically  calculating product-specific carbon footprints or improving management of value chains.\n\nThe combination of products, services and digital offerings also creates new business models and advantages for our customers, such as in the automotive and personal care industry as well as agriculture. In addition, digitalization enables us to further strengthen our innovative power.  In  2023,  we  started  up  our  new supercomputer Quriosity, which is considerably more powerful than its predecessor of the same name (see page 30). At the same time, we are working on new technologies such as quantum computing, for instance as a founding member of the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC). We are also involved in other digitalization initiatives such as the Catena-X network, where we are working with partners to develop a system for standardized data exchange in the automotive value chain. By using a standardized calculation logic for the product carbon footprint (PCF), we help to develop solutions that can reduce CO2 emissions.\n\n## Portfolio\n\nWe are steering our portfolio toward innovation-driven growth areas . Following major acquisitions in recent years (battery materials, engineering  plastics,  agricultural  solutions),  we  plan  to  further develop our portfolio through smaller, bolt- on acquisitions in the future. Major divestitures (pigments, construction chemicals, paper and  water  chemicals,  kaolin  minerals)  in  previous  years  were followed by the carve-out of the emissions catalysts and precious metals services business into the new BASF Environmental Catalyst and Metal Solutions (ECMS) entity and the divestiture of BASF's nickel-based catalysts production site in De Meern, Netherlands, to IQatalyst B.V. In addition, at the end of 2023, BASF, LetterOne and Harbour Energy plc (Harbour) signed an agreement to combine the businesses of Wintershall Dea and Harbour. With this agreement, large parts of Wintershall Dea's exploration and production business",

In 2023, BASF began construction of the third  expansion  phase  of  the  production  plants  for  methylene diphenyl  diisocyanate  (MDI)  at  its  Verbund  site  in  Geismar, Louisiana.  Together  with  Yara,  we  are  also  evaluating  the development  and  construction  of  a  production  plant  for  blue ammonia 1 using carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We are enhancing our range of fragrances and flavors  in  Europe  at  the  Ludwigshafen  site  in  Germany,  with additional plants for menthol and linalool scheduled for startup in 2026. At our site in Chalamp\u00e9, France, we are building a new hexamethylenediamine (HMD) plant and we are expanding our polyamide  6.6  production  in  Freiburg,  Germany.  In  2023,  we started up an expanded complex for ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide  derivatives  at  the  Verbund  site  in  Antwerp,  Belgium.  In addition, a new world-scale production plant for alkylethanolamines will be built there by 2024. The Asian market will play a key role in our future growth. With a share of around 50%, China is already by far the world's largest chemical market and is a key driver of growth in global chemical production. We have a strong production, sales and innovation base in Asia, and in particular in China, which we will continue to expand. Our largest project is the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, which we are planning from the outset as a pioneer for sustainability. Once completed, Zhanjiang will be our third-largest Verbund site after  Ludwigshafen  and  Antwerp.  The  implementation  of  the project is on schedule. Following the startup of the engineering plastics plant in 2022, a plant for the production of thermoplastic polyurethanes came onstream in 2023. The focus in Zhanjiang is now on the step-by-step establishment of the Verbund structure, starting  with  the  construction  of  a  steam  cracker  along  with downstream  plants  for  the  production  of  petrochemicals  and intermediates  as  well  as  plants  for  surfactants  and  citral.  In addition, since 2022 we have been expanding our Verbund site in\n\nNanjing, China, which we operate together with Sinopec. A new tert-butyl acrylate plant came on stream there by the end of 2023 and we have expanded production capacities for several products in the Petrochemicals and Intermediates divisions.\n\nWe  also  reached  important  milestones  in  our  global battery materials and battery recycling business in 2023. This includes investments to increase our production capacities and to establish innovative recycling concepts in the three key regions of Asia, North America and Europe: In June 2023, we opened Europe's first colocated center for battery materials production and battery recycling 2 at the Schwarzheide site in Germany. At our U.S. site in Battle Creek, Michigan, we will offer cathode active materials from recycled metals on a commercial scale from 2024. We are also currently expanding the capacity for cathode active materials of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd. in China and the new production lines at the Changsha and Shizuishan sites will gradually be  put  into  operation.  In  Onoda,  Japan,  work  to  expand production capacities for cathode active materials at BASF TODA Battery Materials LLC has been underway since the end of 2022. This is scheduled for startup in the second half of 2024.\n\n- For more information on material investments and portfolio measures, see page 42 onward\n\n## Employees\n\nOur employees are key to BASF's success.

        "page_content": "## Our Steering Concept\n\nWe have firmly anchored our goal of growing profitably and creating value for society in our strategy. Both financial and nonfinancial key figures are an integral part of our steering concept. Until the end of 2023, return on capital employed (ROCE) and CO2 emissions were our most important key performance indicators. From 2024 onward, we will pursue a Differentiated Steering concept. Industry-specific key performance indicators tailored to the respective business will enable us to increase the competitiveness of our business units and thus the profitability of the BASF Group. We use EBITDA before special items and free cash flow as the new most important key performance indicators for short and medium-term steering. ROCE will continue to play a central role as a medium-term strategic steering indicator.\n\n## The BASF Group's steering concept in 2023\n\nUntil now, the return on capital employed (ROCE) was used as the key target and steering indicator for the BASF Group. In line with our strategic targets, we aimed to achieve a ROCE considerably above the cost of capital percentage every year. With ROCE, the same data  was  used  for  our  value-based  management,  external communication with the capital markets and variable compensation.\n\nWe are also pursuing the target of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\u00b9 are defined as a steering-relevant indicator, and we report on them as the most important nonfinancial key performance indicator. By 2030, we want to  reduce  our  absolute  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  25% compared with the 2018 baseline.\n\n## Further development of the steering concept as of 2024\n\nTo increase the value creation of the individual operating divisions, we are introducing a Differentiated Steering concept, which we will report on at segment level. Key criteria in the selection of specific steering  indicators  are  the  respective  strategic  direction  of  the business,  the  role  of  the  business  in  BASF's  portfolio  and  the contribution of the business to achieve corporate targets. We are focusing on industry-specific value drivers, which enables us to better  integrate  market  conditions  into  our  management  and strengthen our business operations. We will also benchmark our performance even more closely against that of our competitors.\n\nThis is why we have further developed our financial steering concept for the financial years from 2024 onward. Here, we will differentiate between short-term and medium-term steering more clearly than before. We have established two new most important financial key performance indicators for the BASF Group's steering:\n\n- - Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items)\n- - Free cash flow\n\nROCE, our most important financial key performance indicator up to and including the 2023 business year, is significantly influenced by strategic decisions such as acquisitions and divestitures as well as  investments.  Short-term  influencing  factors,  such  as  the development of earnings or current operating assets, can be better controlled directly via earnings or cash flow figures.\n\nReturn on capital employed remains a medium-term key financial target  for  the  BASF  Group.  We  use  ROCE  to  emphasize  the importance of managing our return on capital employed over time.\n\nScope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions remain the most important nonfinancial  key  performance  indicator  at  Group  level.  We  see sustainability  as  a  decisive  factor  for  our  long-term  business success.\n\nThe differentiated approach to steering the operating business units takes into account the different business models of the segments. In the future, capital-intensive segments  (Chemicals,  Materials, Surface Technologies and Agricultural Solutions) will be measured by their absolute contribution to EBITDA before special items, an earnings indicator that describes operational performance independent of age-related depreciation and amortization of assets and any impairment or reversal of impairment. The key figure is therefore  particularly  suitable  for  indicating  the  profitability  of  a business and for comparisons with businesses in similar sectors.",

        "page_content": "The  success  of  the  Industrial  Solutions  and  Nutrition  &  Care segments  primarily  depends  on  the  generation  of  new  and profitable business. Therefore, the most effective measure of their performance  is  a  combination  of  sales  growth  and  margin. Accordingly, the EBITDA margin before special items is the link to the BASF Group's key performance indicator.\n\nTo manage cash flow at segment level, we use a specific key figure, segment cash flow, which includes the elements of free cash flow that  can  be  managed  by  the  operating  divisions.  This  key performance indicator is relevant in all segments.\n\n## Value-based management throughout the company\n\nThe target agreement process is an important part of our valuebased  management.  It  aligns  individual  employee  targets  with BASF's  targets.  The  most  important  financial  indicator  in  the operating  business  has  so  far  been  ROCE.  The  other  units' contribution to value is also assessed according to effectiveness and efficiency on the basis of quality and cost targets. To assess this, we use metrics such as BASF's internal service score in the service units.\n\nWe are gradually adapting the target agreement process to the Differentiated  Steering  concept.  From  2024  onward,  variable compensation for senior executives in all business units and the Service, Research and Corporate Center units will be based on targets derived from the new key performance indicators for the steering of the respective business unit or the BASF Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key figures in reporting\n\nFor the BASF Group, we have been using EBIT before special items and capital expenditures (capex) until now as key performance indicators that have a direct impact on ROCE. EBIT before special items is used to steer profitability at Group and segment level. Capital expenditures are used to manage capital employed in the BASF  Group. These comprise additions to property, plant and equipment excluding additions from acquisitions, IT investments, restoration obligations and right-of-use assets arising from leases. Furthermore, we have been commenting on and forecasting sales at Group and segment level so far in our financial reporting as a\n\nsignificant  driver  for  EBIT  before  special  items  and  our  most important key performance indicator, ROCE.\n\nIn line with the new steering concept, in future financial reporting, we will comment on and forecast the most important key performance indicators EBITDA before special items and free cash flow for the BASF Group and EBITDA before special items and segment cash flow  for  the  segments.  We  will  continue  to  forecast  capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment 1 as a key factor for free cash flow.\n\nIn addition, we will continue to analyze and comment on sales at Group and segment level, but we will not forecast them.",

        "page_content": "## Calculation of ROCE and cost of capital\n\nROCE is calculated as the EBIT of the segments as a percentage of the average cost of capital basis.\n\nTo calculate the EBIT of the segments, we take the BASF Group's EBIT and deduct the EBIT of activities recognized under Other, which are not allocated to the divisions.\n\nThe cost of capital basis is calculated using the month-end figures and consists of the operating assets of the segments. Operating assets comprise the current and noncurrent asset items of the segments. They include property, plant and equipment as well as intangible fixed assets, integral investments accounted for using the equity method, inventories, trade accounts receivable, miscellaneous assets generated by core business activities and, if applicable, the assets of disposal groups. The cost of capital basis also includes customer and supplier financing.\n\nWe have integrated the cost of capital percentage into our ROCE target  as  a  comparative  figure.  This  is  determined  using  the weighted cost of capital from equity and borrowing costs (weighted average cost of capital). To calculate a pretax figure similar to EBIT, the cost of capital is adjusted using the projected tax rate for the BASF Group for the business year. In addition, the projected net expense of Other is already provided for by an adjustment to the cost of capital percentage. The cost of equity is ascertained using the capital asset pricing model. Borrowing costs are determined based on the financing costs of the BASF Group. The cost of capital percentage for 2024 is 10% (2023: 9%).\n\n## Calculation of CO2 emissions\n\nWe calculate the BASF Group's absolute CO2 emissions on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions, which are the sum of direct emissions from production processes and the generation of steam and electricity (Scope 1), as well as indirect emissions from the purchase of energy (Scope 2). Direct emissions from the generation\n\nof  energy  for  third  parties  are  not  considered  here.  Relevant emissions  include  other  greenhouse  gases  according  to  the Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol,  which  are  converted  into  CO2 equivalents.\n\n- For more information on our CO2 emissions and climate protection targets, see page 102 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Calculation of EBITDA before special items\n\nEBITDA is the result from income from operations reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements plus depreciation, amortization, impairments and reversals of impairments on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. This is adjusted for special items that may arise from the integration of acquired businesses, from restructuring measures, gains or losses resulting from divestitures and sales of shareholdings, and other expenses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities. The EBITDA margin before special items is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA before special  items  to  sales  revenue.  This  relative  indicator  enables operational performance to be compared independently of the size of the underlying business.\n\n## Calculation of free cash flow and segment cash flow\n\nSegment cash flow measures the cash inflow and outflow of a segment and thus the contribution to the BASF Group's free cash flow. It includes only those amounts that can be controlled by the segment and is calculated from the EBITDA, changes in inventories and trade accounts receivable, other extraordinary adjustments, for example  in  connection  with  acquisitions  and  divestitures,  less payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The BASF Group's free cash flow additionally includes transactions that are not allocated to operations as well as adjustments of other noncash effects. Free cash flow is the cash flows from operating activities less payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\n## Reconciliation of segment cash flow to free cash flow\n\n## EBITDA\n\n- + Changes in inventories\n- + Changes in trade accounts receivable\n- + Other changes\n- - Payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\n## = Segment cash flow\n\n- + Net income from shareholdings\n- + Financial result\n- + Income taxes\n- + Changes in other balance sheet items and adjustment of other noncash effects\n- = Free cash flow\n\n<!-- image -->",

That  is  why  we pursue ambitious targets along our entire value chain. We report  transparently  on  target  achievement  so  that  our stakeholders can track our progress.\n\nOur objective is profitable growth - we set ourselves the following targets up to and including 2023: We want to grow sales volumes faster  than  global  chemical  production,  further  increase  our profitability, achieve  a  return  on  capital  employed  (ROCE) considerably above the cost of capital percentage and increase the dividend per share every year based on a strong free cash flow or at least maintain it at prior-year level.\n\nIn addition to these financial targets, we have set ourselves broad sustainability targets. We want to considerably reduce our CO2 emissions in the coming years. In addition to the targets for reducing our emissions from production (Scope 1) and the purchase of energy (Scope 2), 1 we set ourselves a new target for our purchase of  raw  materials  (Scope  3.1) 2 in  2023.  We  have  also  added Scope 3.1 emissions to our net-zero target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (see page 29). As part of this target, we are working to strengthen sustainability in our supply chains and use resources more responsibly.\n\nWe want to further improve safety in production and since 2023 we have been reporting according to a new system that focuses on high-severity work-related accidents and incidents.\n\nWe  also  aim  to  increase  the  number  of  women  in  leadership positions and create a working environment in which our employees feel that they can thrive and perform at their best.\n\nThe objective of these targets is to grow profitably, and at the same time, contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs).  We  are  focusing  here  on  issues  that  we  as  a company can influence - especially SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 5 (Gender  equality),  SDG  6  (Clean  water  and  sanitation),  SDG  7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (Climate action).\n\n- For more information on financial indicators, see page 56 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on environmental, social and governance, see page 100 onward\n\nWe want to align our product portfolio even more strongly with climate protection and the circular economy. To achieve this, we have further updated the methodology used to assess our product portfolio against defined sustainability criteria and defined a new target  figure  for  products  with  a  particular  contribution  to sustainability (see page 48).\n\n## Good to know\n\n## Most important KPIs\n\nBASF sets itself ambitious targets along the value chain. Two key figures were of particular importance for 2023:\n\n- - Return on capital employed (ROCE)\n- - Absolute CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\nThese most important key performance indicators (KPIs) were the main indicators used to steer the BASF Group up to and including 2023. We also use ROCE for employee incentivization, while the achievement of targets for reducing CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) influences the compensation of members of the Board of Executive Directors and senior executives.\n\nFrom the 2024 financial year, we will establish two new most important key performance indicators at financial level besides CO2 emissions in order to focus more strongly on the short-term value creation of the BASF Group: The following financial key performance indicators are therefore relevant for 2024:\n\n- - Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items)\n- - Free cash flow\n\nROCE remains relevant for steering in the medium term and for incentivization.\n\nFor more information on the steering concept, see page 37 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- see basf.com/compensationreport\n- 1 Scope 1 and Scope 2 (excluding the sale of energy to third parties). The target includes greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e). The baseline year is 2018.\n- 2 Scope 3.1, raw materials excluding battery materials, services and technical goods, excluding greenhouse gas emissions from BASF trading business. Future adjustment of the baseline in line with the TfS guideline possible depending on the availability of further primary data, among other things. The baseline year is 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Capex accounted for \u20ac5,198 million of this amount (2022: \u20ac4,148 million).\n\n- 1 Additions to property, plant and equipment excluding acquisitions, restoration obligations, IT investments and right-of-use assets arising from leases\n- 2 Major growth projects are the construction of our future Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, as well as our battery materials activities.\n\nWe continued to drive forward our growth projects in 2023 and further expand our position in our three key regions: Asia Pacific, North America and Europe. The Asia Pacific region and China in particular, which already has a significant influence on the growth of the  global  chemicals  market  with  a  share  of  around  50%,  will continue to play a key role here. To serve the increasing needs of various  growth  industries  in  this  region,  we  are  continuously expanding our market position in China. One example of this is the construction of our new integrated Verbund site in Zhanjiang (see pages 43 and 44). In North America, among other things, we have been further expanding our production capacities in the isocyanates value chain in 2023 (see page 44). In Europe, the opening of the first colocated battery materials and recycling center at the Schwarzheide site in Germany was a milestone on our way to further expanding our position in this area (see page 44).\n\nIn addition, we want to refine our portfolio through smaller, bolt-on acquisitions that promise above-average profitable growth and help to  expand  our  market  position  in  a  targeted  manner.  A  key consideration  is  that  these  acquisitions  are  innovative,  offer  a technological differentiation, or make new, sustainable business models possible.\n\n## Investments in the segments and regions\n\nOur investments in 2023 focused on the Chemicals, Materials, Surface Technologies and Nutrition & Care segments.\n\n## Additions to property, plant and equipment a by segment in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Additions to property, plant and equipment a by region in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a Including restoration obligations, IT investments and right-of-use assets arising from leases",

In 2023, we completed the further expansion project of the Verbund site in Nanjing, China, together with our partner Sinopec, to strengthen the joint production of chemical products in China. This means that we have increased our production capacities for propionic aldehyde, propionic acid and purified ethylene oxide. We also built a new tert-butyl acrylate plant. These new and expanded plants came onstream in 2023.\n\nWe are continuing the construction of the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. The site will be constructed in several phases. The core of the Verbund, including a steam cracker and several downstream plants for the production  of  petrochemicals  and  intermediates,  among  other products, is currently being built. As part of the Verbund, these plants should be operational from late 2025 onward.\n\nWe  are  expanding  the  2-ethylhexanoic  acid  plant  in  Kuantan, Malaysia, with our partner PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad. Startup is planned for 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we successfully completed the expansion of our production complex for ethylene oxide and derivatives, for example for the production of alkoxylates, at our Verbund site in Antwerp, Belgium. A world-scale alkylethanolamines plant is scheduled for startup there in 2024.\n\n| Segment                | Location                                             | Project                                                                                                                                                                                | Startup   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Chemicals              | Antwerp, Belgium                                     | Capacity expansion at ethylene oxide plant                                                                                                                                             | 2023      |\n|                        |                                                      | Construction of a new world-scale alkylethanolamines plant                                                                                                                             | 2024      |\n|                        | Kuantan, Malaysia                                    | Capacity expansion at 2-ethylhexanoic acid plant a                                                                                                                                     | 2024      |\n|                        | Ludwigshafen, Germany                                | Modernization of chloroformates and acid chlorides plant                                                                                                                               | 2025      |\n|                        | Nanjing, China                                       | Capacity expansion at plants for propionic aldehyde, propionic acid, purified ethylene oxide,  ethanolamines and ethyleneamines, and construction of a new tert-butyl acrylate plant b | 2023      |\n|                        | Zhanjiang, China c                                   | Construction of a new steam cracker and plants for ethylene oxide, syngas, monoethylene  glycol, polyethylene, oxo-C4 alcohols, acrylic monomers and neopentyl glycol                  | 2025      |\n| Materials              | Chalamp\u00e9, France                                     | Construction of a world-scale production plant for hexamethylenediamine (HMD)                                                                                                          | 2024      |\n|                        | Geismar, Louisiana                                   | Capacity expansion at MDI plants                                                                                                                                                       | 2025      |\n|                        | Zhanjiang, China                                     | Construction of a new thermoplastic polyurethane plant                                                                                                                                 | 2023      |\n| Industrial Solutions   | Huizhou, China                                       | Capacity expansion at acrylics dispersions plant                                                                                                                                       | 2024      |\n|                        | Huizhou and Zhenjiang, China                         | Modification at two dispersions plants for anode binder production                                                                                                                     | 2023      |\n|                        | Jiaxing, China                                       | Capacity expansion at sulfuric acid plant                                                                                                                                              | 2023      |\n|                        | Lampertheim, Germany and   Pontecchio Marconi, Italy | Capacity expansion for hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS)                                                                                                                         | 2024      |\n|                        | Merak, Indonesia                                     | Capacity expansion at acrylics and styrene-butadiene dispersions plants                                                                                                                | 2023      |\n| Surface Technologies   | Harjavalta, Finland                                  | Construction of a precursor plant for cathode active materials                                                                                                                         | -

It will increase production capacity to approximately 600,000 metric tons per year to support the growth of BASF's North American MDI customers. Including the first and second phases, the investment volume totals around $1 billion.\n\nWe started up the engineering plastics production plant at our Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, in August 2022. Building on this, the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) plant kicked off its operations in September 2023. This plant is BASF's largest TPU production line globally. It will enable us to better meet the growing market demand in Asia Pacific - particularly in the areas of electromobility and new energy.\n\nIn Europe, BASF is investing in a new world-scale production plant for hexamethylenediamine (HMD) at the Chalamp\u00e9 site in France. The new plant, which is scheduled to start operations in 2024, will increase BASF's annual HMD production capacity to 260,000 metric tons.\n\n## Industrial Solutions\n\nBASF is investing in production capacity for hindered amine light stabilizers  (HALS)  at  its  sites  in  Lampertheim,  Germany,  and Pontecchio Marconi, Italy. As part of a multistep investment plan, BASF aims to serve the growing demand for light stabilizers used in durable  plastics  applications  and  increase  supply  security  for customers worldwide.\n\nIn addition, we have invested in the production of water-based anode binders in two existing dispersion plants in Huizhou and Zhenjiang,  China.  Stable  supply  of  two  new  innovative  binder\n\nproducts, Licity \u00ae and Basonal \u00ae Power, came onstream in mid-2023. The investment was due to growing demand in the lithium-ion battery market.\n\nTo ensure the supply of high-quality dispersions solutions for the South Asian market, we are expanding our dispersions capacities in Huizhou, China, with an additional production line. It will startup in 2024.\n\n## Surface Technologies\n\nWe aim to expand our position as a leading and innovative provider of battery materials and recycling solutions and expect to benefit from the strong growth in this market segment. A global, customerfocused production network for battery materials is crucial here. In June 2023, we opened Europe's first colocated battery materials and recycling center at the Schwarzheide site in Germany. The inauguration of the modern production plant for high-performance cathode active materials,\u00b9 the battery recycling prototype plant 1 (startup: beginning of 2024) and the battery recycling plant for the production of black mass from lithium-ion batteries currently under construction  (planned  startup:  2024)  represent  important  steps toward  closing  the  loop  for  the  European  battery  value  chain. End-of-life  batteries  and  waste  from  battery  production  will  be mechanically processed in the new plant to produce black mass. The prototype plant will allow for the development of operating procedures  and  optimization  of  technology  to  deliver  superior returns of lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese from end-of-life lithium-ion batteries and unused process materials. The construction of our production facility in Harjavalta, Finland, was completed in 2023, which will supply precursors for cathode active materials. 2 With these investments, BASF is the first cathode active materials supplier with local production capacities in all of what are currently  the  main  markets:  China,  Japan,  North  America  and Europe.\n\n- 1 Our investment and research activities in Schwarzheide and Ludwigshafen, Germany, receive funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action and the Ministry for Economic Affairs, Labor and Energy of the German state of Brandenburg under the IPCEI on Batteries (funding code 16BZF101A/B). 2 The investment in Finland is cofinanced by Business Finland, the Finnish government organization for innovation funding and trade, travel and investment promotion. The required approval from the relevant authorities has been granted. Startup of the plant is scheduled following the legally binding conclusion of the opposition proceedings.\n\n## Nutrition & Care\n\nIn 2023, BASF started up the new world-scale vitamin A formulation plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany. The plant's startup followed the expansion of the vitamin A acetate plant in 2021 in order to meet the expected growing market demand for high-quality vitamin A.\n\nIn Antwerp, Belgium, BASF expanded production capacities for nonionic surfactants for the home care industry as well as for industrial  and  institutional  cleaning  applications  by  significantly extending the industry-leading alkoxylates portfolio at its Verbund site. This investment expands upstream production capacity for ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide derivatives.\n\nBASF has invested in a citral plant as part of its Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, and menthol and linalool downstream plants at its Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany. These plants are expected to come on stream from 2026 onward. The investment is driven by a growing demand from the global flavor and fragrance market.",

BASF had decided to divest the site and the related Fischer-Tropsch and FOCAT 1 portfolio to increase the efficiency of its global chemical catalysts production network. The site was part of BASF's Catalysts division until the completion  of  the  divestiture  process.  The  transaction  mainly covered production plants, including the associated infrastructure and inventories, as well as the transfer of the employees working at the site.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on this divestiture, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 240 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n45\n\n## Agreed transactions\n\nOn December 21, 2023, BASF, LetterOne and Harbour Energy plc (Harbour)  signed  an  agreement  to  combine  the  businesses  of Wintershall Dea and Harbour. The E&P business of Wintershall Dea is  to  be  transferred  to  Harbour:  It  comprises  production  and development  assets  as  well  as  exploration  rights  in  Norway, Argentina, Germany, Mexico, Algeria, Libya (excluding Wintershall AG), Egypt and Denmark (excluding Ravn), and licenses from Wintershall Dea for carbon storage (CCS). In exchange, at closing, the shareholders of Wintershall Dea will receive total cash consideration of $2.15 billion (BASF share: $1.56 billion) and new shares to be issued by Harbour equating to a total shareholding in the enlarged Harbour of 54.5% (BASF share: 39.6%).\n\nUntil the completion of the transaction, which is, among other things, subject to antitrust approvals and further official approvals for foreign investments in various countries, among other things, Wintershall Dea and Harbour will continue to operate as independent companies. Subject to these regulatory approvals, closing is targeted for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWintershall Dea is accounted for as a non-integral shareholding using the equity method. After completion of the transaction, both the shareholding in Wintershall Dea, which will then only include the businesses not transferred to Harbour and the head offices, and the shareholding  in  Harbour  will  be  accounted  for  using  the equity method in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group.\n\nFor more information on this divestiture, see Non-Integral Oil and Gas Business from page 97 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the same time, many recyclable materials end up in landfill or in waste incineration. Using resources responsibly and closing loops are crucial for our business and achieving our climate targets.\n\nAt BASF we think of circularity in two dimensions: In order to achieve our climate targets, we have to not only further reduce our own carbon footprint, but also that of our products. To do this, we use renewable raw materials and recycled raw material sources. At the same time, we are developing products and technologies to help our customers close loops, create value for society and protect the environment.\n\nBASF's Verbund structure presents numerous opportunities for a circular economy: By intelligently networking our plants, we can use by-products from one plant elsewhere as feedstocks or an energy source, thereby using resources efficiently (see pages 102 and 110). We are also focusing our raw material base even more strongly on nonfossil  circular  alternatives.  We  procure  these  raw  materials responsibly in order to minimize negative environmental impacts (for example, biodiversity loss) (see page 121 onward).\n\nCurrently, less than 10% of the approximately 350  million metric tons 1 of plastic waste generated worldwide each year is currently recycled, yet the global demand for circular feedstocks is rising.\n\n## This page:\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, Zara launched a jacket that is made entirely from recycled polyamide, from the fabric and lining to the hook-and-loop fastener and zipper. Thanks to BASF's loopamid \u00ae solution, the garment is not only made from 100% recycled textile waste, it is also 100% recyclable.\n\nThe plastics in our product portfolio are mainly used in durable and demanding  applications,  such  as  automotive  engineering  and insulation foams. As a responsible player in the value chain, we are working to further improve the sustainable use of plastics throughout the entire life cycle. That's why we are developing and marketing solutions  for  improved  mechanical  recycling.  Where  this  is  not possible, we are driving forward the chemical recycling of plastics as a complementary technology to expand our supply base: Plastics are broken down into their building blocks, which can then be used in production as recycled feedstocks. To do this, we are developing suitable recycling processes, often with partners (see page 124). In a challenging environment with limited availability of alternative raw materials, we still aim to process 250,000 metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials, such as pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste or end-of-life tires, in our production plants annually from 2025.\n\nMany of BASF's products and technologies are already helping to close loops at many points along the value chain. Together with our customers and other stakeholders, we want to further accelerate the transformation  from  linear  to  circular  business  models.  Our target: By 2030, we want to double our sales of solutions for the circular economy to \u20ac17 billion (baseline: 2020). As the sustainable properties of our products have been reassessed since 2023 using the updated TripleS method (see page 48), this target will be adjusted in the course of 2024.\n\n- 1 Bruna Alves, Statista (2023).

        "page_content": "## Material topics in focus: Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency\n\nOur BASF solutions for the circular economy include:\n\n- -Products based on renewable or recycled raw materials: These include products manufactured in whole or in part from renewable  or  recycled  instead  of  fossil  raw  materials.  The alternative raw materials are attributed to the end product, partly using what is known as the mass balance approach. This is verified and certified by independent third parties (see box on page  124).  We  use  this  approach  for  example  for  selected ingredients for the automotive, cosmetics, detergent, cleaner and food industries (see page 122). Other examples are products to which pyrolysis oil from the chemical recycling of plastic waste can  be  attributed  via  the  mass  balance  approach  (Ccycled \u00ae products, see page 125), or products that contain mechanically recycled raw materials (Mcycled \u00ae ).\n- -Products  that  close  material  cycles  ('close  the  loop'): These include products that enable and improve the recyclability of valuable resources. Our first focus area here is the value chain for plastics. For example, multilayer packaging produced with our water-based Epotal \u00ae adhesives can be easily separated into its individual recyclable materials during recycling, which can then be reused. We have expanded our ecovio \u00ae plastic portfolio and now also offer home-compostable food packaging. The second focus is recycling mineral raw materials. For example, we are driving forward  innovative  technologies  and  solutions  for  recovering metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese from endof-life lithium-ion batteries (see page 125).\n- -Products that increase the resource efficiency or lifespan of materials  ('extend  the  loop'): These  include  products  that reduce resource consumption and environmental impact along the value  chain.  One  example  is  Oxsilan \u00ae ,  an  innovative  thin-film technology for protecting metals from corrosion, for example, before painting. The process not only enables higher productivity with lower material use, but also offers a favorable safety, health and environmental profile compared with conventional phosphating processes. This category also includes products that extend service life and/or reduce maintenance  intervals. Tinuvin \u00ae light stabilizers are one example of this. They extend the lifespan of products such as agricultural films by providing reliable protection against UV radiation, heat and agrochemicals.\n\nOne of the steps we have taken to meet our targets and accelerate the transformation is establishing a company-wide Circular Economy Program.  As  part  of  this  program,  BASF  teams  are  currently developing new approaches within three main action areas and over 50 initiatives: alternative raw materials pathways, innovative material cycles and new business models for the circular economy - which also include digital and service-based concepts. We also cooperate with partners along the value chain and are involved in numerous networks, such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Global Battery Alliance and the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. In doing so, we  want  to  better  understand  needs,  trends  and  growth opportunities and contribute to the development of standards.\n\nFor more information on the circular economy, see basf.com/circular-economy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on plastics, see plasticsjourney.basf.com\n\n## Case study\n\n## From the clothing bin to the runway\n\nEvery year, almost 100 million metric tons of textile waste is produced worldwide, 87% of which is incinerated or disposed of in landfills. At the beginning of 2024, BASF brought an innovative and sustainable solution to the market to boost circularity in the textile industry: loopamid \u00ae . Using a new chemical recycling process, textile waste made of polyamide 6 (nylon  6)  are  first  converted  into  monomers  in  a  process  called depolymerization and then purified. The resulting monomers are then converted back into pure polyamide 6 (PA6) through polymerization. This recycled PA6, loopamid \u00ae , serves as the raw material for completely new clothing in a circular production model.\n\nBASF is thus offering a solution to close the loop for polyamide 6 in clothing exclusively with textile waste, which can be reused as a valuable feedstock, thereby reducing the consumption of fossil raw materials, for example. loopamid \u00ae ensures that textiles remain in their own cycle and garments containing PA6 can be recycled without restrictions. We want to inspire  the  industry  to  focus  on  sustainable  textile  production  and introduce new business models that close loops in textile manufacturing.\n\nTo this end, we work closely with our partners along the value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We want to secure our long-term success with products, solutions and technologies that create value added for our customers, the environment and society.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- \u25aa Sustainability aspects integrated into corporate steering\n- \u25aa New targets for climate protection (Scope 3.1) and portfolio steering\n- \u25aa Human rights aspects embedded in decision-making processes\n\n## Our strategic approach\n\nSustainability is integrated into our decision-making processes. Our opportunities and risk management systematically records effects, opportunities  and  risks  arising  from  our  business  activities  for sustainability topics and how these impact our businesses in a positive or negative  way.  Decisions  regarding  investments, acquisitions and divestitures are made while taking comprehensive assessments  of  sustainability  impacts  into  account.  The  entire Board of Executive Directors is responsible for sustainability topics, which should be driven forward by all employees. Therefore, BASF's senior executives' long-term variable compensation is also based on the achievement of our targets for reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nWe pursue a holistic sustainability approach that covers the entire value chain - from our suppliers and our own activities to our customers  -  and  contributes  to  environmental,  social  and governance key sustainability topics (ESG, see page 100 onward). We have formulated commitments for our conduct and underpinned\n\nthese with corresponding targets and measures (see page 41). Based on our corporate strategy, we steer the global sustainability target for climate protection for 2030 via the most important key performance indicator (KPI) absolute CO2 emissions\u00b9 (see page 40). To  this  end,  we  have  strengthened  the  necessary  steering mechanisms and control systems at Group level, for example with internal  reviews.  Our  transition  plan  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions includes the use of renewable energy, measures to avoid CO2 emissions and circular economy solutions (see page 102). In addition to our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,\u00b2 we are pursuing further targets for a more sustainable portfolio, for responsible  procurement,  resource-efficient  and  safe  production, engaged employees and diversity.\n\n## Measuring sustainable value added\n\nWe are aware that our business activities can have both positive and negative  impacts  on  the  environment  and  society.  We  aim  to increase  our  positive  contributions  and  minimize  the  negative impacts  of  our  business  activities.  To  achieve  this,  we  need  to measure how our actions and our products affect the environment and society.\n\nWe have many years of experience in this area from evaluating our products and processes using methods such as the SEEbalance \u00ae Socio-Eco-Efficiency Analysis, Eco-Efficiency Analyses, our TripleS (Sustainable  Solution  Steering)  methodology,  BASF's  corporate\n\ncarbon footprint and the calculation of Product Carbon Footprints (PCF).\n\nWe want to offer our customers innovative products and solutions that  support  their  sustainability  goals.  Our  business  units  are therefore in close contact with our customers in order to better understand  their  sustainability  needs  and  offer  tailored  BASF solutions.  The  insights  from  this  dialog  are  considered  in  the implementation of research projects and in innovation processes.\n\nA significant steering tool for the product portfolio, based on the sustainability performance of our products, is TripleS. In 2022, we updated this method in order to further steer our product portfolio to transformation topics such as climate change and energy, resource efficiency and circular economy. With this update we have integrated the TripleS evaluation even more deeply into the assessment of our R&D development processes, also considering the requirements formulated within the Safe and Sustainable by Design framework by the E.U. Commission. Within the scope of the further development of our method, in 2023 we began to reassess the products in the relevant portfolio 3 with regard to their applications and regional aspects. As a result, we categorize our product portfolio into five segments,  taking  sustainability-related  aspects  into  account: Pioneer , Contributor , Standard , Monitored and Challenged (see graphic). The reassessment will be completed in 2024. We will take regulatory changes into account if they have a material impact on our portfolio and therefore also on our segmentation. The allocations by segment and sales are therefore provisional.\n\n- 1 Target includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (excluding the sale of energy to third parties) as well as Scope 3.1 emissions. Greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e).\n- 2 Target includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (excluding the sale of energy to third parties) as well as Scope 3.1 emissions, excluding greenhouse gas emissions from BASF trading business.

Products allocated  to  these  segments  make  a  positive  sustainability contribution in the value chain. For example, polyurethane catalysts, which reduce energy consumption and material use, and highperformance insulation materials, which save energy for end users. In line with our corporate strategy, we have set ourselves the target of making sustainability an even greater part of our innovative power. By 2030, more than 50% of BASF's sales relevant to TripleS 1 are to be attributable to Sustainable-Future Solutions (2023: 41.4%). With TripleS, we are steering our product portfolio and our research and development units toward sustainable solutions. According to our updated methodology, in 2023, around \u20ac1  billion of our annual expenditure on research and development contributed to potential Sustainable-Future Solutions.\n\nIf, during the reassessment of our portfolio, we identify products with sustainability concerns, we classify them either as 'Monitored,' or in case of significant concerns, as 'Challenged,' as we did in the past. A description of possible measures is mandatory for both categories. In the case of Challenged products, we develop our own action plans. These include research projects and reformulations to optimize products or replacing the product with an alternative. To systematically align our portfolio with contributions to sustainability, we are generally phasing out all Challenged products within five years of their initial classification.\n\nOf BASF's \u20ac68.9 billion in sales in 2023, \u20ac55.5 billion is relevant for the TripleS evaluation. We have analyzed \u20ac52.8 billion of this as part of TripleS by the end of 2023. 2 The relevant portfolio comprises BASF  Group's sales from sales products to third parties in the business  year  concerned.

The results do not only set the framework for reporting, but also help us to  better  understand  the  complex  and  sometimes  diverging requirements and expectations that our stakeholders have of us and\n\n- 1 The definition of the relevant portfolio and further information can be found in the TripleS manual at basf.com/en/sustainable-solution-steering\n- 2 Sum of validated and provisional segmentation\n\nto define strategically relevant topics for our long-term business success. As part of the update in 2023, we reviewed whether new topics had been identified or the topics from the previous year had significantly changed in priority. We used a big data tool to review the relevance of sustainability topics for various stakeholder groups. We also included the expertise of external stakeholders, with whom we are in constant contact, and of employees in this review.\n\nA sustainability aspect is considered material in the sense of double materiality if it has been classified as having both impact materiality and financial materiality. To assess impact materiality, both actual and  potential  positive  and  negative  impacts  of  our  company's activities were considered along the value chain. To this end, the scale, scope and likelihood of occurrence of these impacts were assessed. For the analysis of financial materiality the topics were classified  based  on  their  potential  financial  impacts  on  BASF. Specifically, we analyzed how each sustainability aspect affects us geographically, for example, whether a local business unit or an\n\n<!-- image -->",

'Plastic waste' was integrated into the overarching topic of 'circularity and resource efficiency.' Based on this update, 11 topics were identified as material (see list) and confirmed by the BASF Sustainability Reporting  and  Controlling  Committee.  At  the beginning of 2024, we will review the methodology of our materiality analysis again to ensure that it meets the requirements of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, for example, in terms of double materiality.\n\nFor more information on our materiality analysis, see basf.com/materiality\n\n## Our organizational and management structures\n\nTogether with decentrally organized specialists, the units Corporate Strategy & Sustainability and Corporate Finance are responsible  for  integrating  sustainability  into  decision-making processes and for steering and reporting on sustainability topics. The Corporate Strategy & Sustainability unit is also responsible for the  global  steering  of  climate-related  matters.  The  Net  Zero Accelerator unit plays a key role in achieving our climate protection targets  by  accelerating  and  implementing  projects  related  to low-emission  production  technologies,  circular  economy  and renewable energy. The Corporate Finance unit reports to the Chief Financial Officer, while the other two units report to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nSustainability topics are discussed and managed by the Board of Executive  Directors.  When  making  its  decisions,  the  Board  of Executive Directors considers the results and recommendations from  sustainability  evaluations  of  business  processes.  It  makes decisions with strategic relevance for the Group and monitors the implementation  of  strategic  plans  and  target  achievement.  The Supervisory  Board  is  regularly  briefed  on  the  development  of individual sustainability topics by the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nThe Chief Human Rights Officer is responsible for further embedding human rights aspects in decision-making processes. He reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors (see page 154).\n\nWe  systematically  evaluate  sustainability  criteria,  including  the effects  of  climate  change,  as  an  integral  part  of  decisions  on investments, acquisitions and divestitures in property, plant and equipment and financial assets. In this way, we not only assess economic dimensions, but also the potential impacts on areas such as the environment, human rights or the local community. We evaluate both the potential impacts of our activities here as well as how we are affected.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf we identify potential negative impacts, for example, in planned investments,  these  are  presented  transparently  in  the  internal decision-making process together with possible mitigation measures.\n\nIn our Sustainable Finance Roundtable, experts from departments such  as  Finance,  Corporate  Strategy,  Investor  Relations  and Communications  discuss  new  legal  or  capital  market-driven requirements.  The  interdisciplinary  group  analyzes  the  steadily growing requirements, assesses the impacts on BASF and drives forward the necessary change processes as well as the concrete implementation of measures.\n\nThe  Sustainability  Reporting  and  Controlling  Committee  is  the central decision-making body for questions relating to internal and external reporting and the controlling of sustainability topics. This committee of managers from the relevant Corporate Center and operating units facilitates rapid decisions to ensure that external and internal requirements for sustainability-related information and data are met immediately and in the best possible way.\n\n- For more information on our financial and sustainability targets, see pages 40 and 41\n\nFor more information on our risk management, see pages 173 to 183\n\n- For more information on compensation structures, see the compensation report\n- at basf.com/compensationreport",

Parts of our business activities,  such  as  the  use  of  certain  new  technologies  or  our environmental impacts, are often viewed by stakeholders with a critical eye. We take questions from our stakeholders seriously, initiate  dialogs  and  participate  in  discussions  (see  page  140 onward). Our stakeholders include customers, employees, investors, suppliers, the communities surrounding our sites, and representatives  from  industry,  academia,  politics  and  society. We are in ongoing exchange through a variety of formats of our strategic stakeholder engagement.\n\nWe are involved in networks, lobbying groups and associations in order to jointly promote sustainability topics. In our own independent exchange formats, we discuss our contribution to a socially just climate  transformation  (just  transition)  with  representatives  from business,  science,  politics  and  civil  society.  For  example,  we discussed solutions and challenges on the path to climate neutrality with  our  stakeholders  at  the  BASF  Sustainability  Lab  in  2023. In-depth, context-related discussions take place in topic-specific committees such as the Human Rights Advisory Council and the Nature Advisory Council.\n\nWe promote continuous exchange between local residents and our site management with community advisory panels. We also involve key  stakeholders  in  the  decision-making  process  about  future investments at an early stage in order to work together on viable solutions. Our political advocacy is conducted in accordance with transparent guidelines and our publicly stated positions.\n\nFor more information on the dialog with our stakeholder groups, see page 140\n\nFor more information on our guidelines for responsible lobbying,\n\n- see basf.com/responsible-lobbying\n\nFor more information on the Industry Associations Review, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\nFor more information on the BASF Sustainability Lab, see basf.com/en/sustainability-lab\n\nFor more information on our stakeholder engagement, see basf.com/en/stakeholder-engagement\n\nOur societal engagement is an important part of our sustainability management and our corporate responsibility. Communities at our sites and disadvantaged groups around the world are particularly important to us. Our activities are bundled in three action areas globally across all levels of the BASF Group: We want to improve people's quality of life by preventing and combating disease (health), promoting  educational  equality,  employability  and  economic participation (skills), and conserving natural resources (resources). Our aim is to make a positive contribution to society by leveraging our  expertise  and  resources.  In  accordance  with  our  societal engagement policy, our actions are in line with our compliance requirements, BASF's strategy and our sustainability commitments.\n\nFor more information on our societal engagement, see page 141\n\n<!-- image -->",

The knowledge and skills of our highly qualified employees is our most valuable resource and the source of our innovative strength. In 2023, approximately 10,000 employees worldwide were working in research and development (R&D).\n\nOur research  and  development  expenses amounted  to \u20ac2,130 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac2,298 million). R&D activities in our operating divisions, which are mainly application and customerrelated, accounted for 83% of this figure. Cross-divisional and longterm topics were responsible for 17% of these expenses.\n\nOur innovation focus is on developing new products, solutions and product improvements that offer our customers competitive and sustainability  advantages.  By  helping  them  reduce  their  carbon footprint, use resources more efficiently and manufacture products in a more environmentally friendly way and recycle them, we also\n\nensure our long-term competitiveness and at the same time, play a role in decoupling growth from the consumption of limited resources.\n\nIn 2023, we generated sales of around \u20ac10 billion with products launched on the market in the past five years that stemmed from research and development activities.   In the long term, we aim to further  increase  sales  and  earnings  with  new  and  improved products - especially with products that make a positive sustainability contribution in the value chain (see page 48).\n\nOur  research  and  development  units  explicitly  address  the industry-specific  needs  of  our  customers.  Customer-focused activities  are  directly  integrated  into  the  operating  divisions. Research activities that are relevant to several operating divisions are bundled in the cross-functional global division Group Research. It supports the R&D activities of our divisions and drives forward cross-divisional projects on topics relevant to the entire Group, such as avoiding CO2 emissions in chemical processes and products, energy efficiency and recycling technologies. The unit is globally positioned with research centers in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. Together with the research and development units in our operating divisions, Group Research forms the core of our global Know-How Verbund.\n\nAdditionally, we use corporate funding to finance research activities that are of broad relevance to the BASF Group and go beyond the industry-specific focus of the individual operating divisions, such as  digital  tools,  polymer  technologies,  catalyst  processes  and biotechnological methods.\n\n## Research and development expenses by segment 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurthermore, we promote creative research approaches and drive forward the development of new business areas. For example, we are developing innovative coating technologies and materials that make innovative surfaces and functions possible. Functional films can  be  used  to  reduce  the  frictional  resistance  of  surfaces  or improve UV protection and weather resistance.\n\nAs part of our Carbon Management R&D Program, we are focusing in particular on projects at the energy-intensive starting point of the value chain. This will enable us to offer our customers even more products with a lower carbon footprint in the future.",

Due to both front-loading and catch-up effects from the coronavirus pandemic, demand for goods increased much slower than demand for services. Industrial production and demand for chemicals were therefore extremely weak.\n\nFor the outlook on the economic environment in 2024, see page 167 onward\n\n## At a glance\n\n+2.6% Global GDP growth\n\n+1.7% production\n\nIncrease in global chemical\n\n- \u25aa Weak growth in demand for goods\n- \u25aa Rising interest rates and high inflation\n- \u25aa Growth in chemical production in China; decline in the rest of the world\n\nGlobal gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.6% compared with the previous year (2022: +3.1%). Global industrial production rose by 1.4% (2022: +2.9%). Global chemical production rose by 1.7% (2022:  +2.1%),  albeit  with  marked  variation  between  different regions. While chemical production grew by 7.5% in China, it shrank by 3.9% in the rest of the world.\n\nThe  average  price  for  a  barrel  of  Brent  crude  oil  remained considerably  below  the  prior-year  level  at  $82  per  barrel (2022:  $101  per  barrel).  The  annual  average  gas  price  in Northwestern Europe was \u20ac40.52 per MWh ($12.83 per mmBtu), around two-thirds below the prior-year level, but still more than twice as high as the average annual price for 2015 to 2020 and more than five times as high as in the United States.\n\n## Trends in the global economy in 2023\n\nMacroeconomic  development  in  2023  was  dampened  overall. However,  there  was  significant  regional  variation.  While  gross domestic  product  growth  in  the  United  States  accelerated considerably in the third quarter after a moderate first half of the year, gross domestic product in the European Union (E.U.) largely stagnated. In the United States, private demand was supported by the depletion of savings, rising employment and growing wages. Despite solid labor markets, consumers in the E.U. were reluctant to spend in view of the rise in electricity and gas prices and the uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. Economic development in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In this section:\n\nEconomic Environment Results of Operations Net Assets Financial Position Actual Development Compared with Outlook for 2023 Business Review by Segment Other Non-Integral Oil and Gas Business Regional Results\n\nAsia was mixed. In China, a dynamic start to the year in the first quarter  was  followed  by  weak  growth  in  the  rest  of  the  year. Domestic demand in China remained subdued due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the real estate crisis and exports suffered as a result of the weakness of the global economy. In Japan, the economy  picked  up  temporarily  due  to  the  weaker  exchange rate,  growing  private  consumption  and  high  demand  for  cars domestically and abroad.\n\nIn our customer industries, existing order backlogs continued to be processed after the disruptions in the supply chains had largely receded. This catch-up effect led to high growth rates, particularly in the automotive industry, which had previously been affected by significant  supply  problems.  In  contrast,  demand  for  consumer goods such as furniture and consumer electronics fell considerably following the boom in demand during the coronavirus lockdowns. In the construction industry, the sharp rise in interest rates in many countries was increasingly reflected in falling demand.",

As in the previous year, there were considerable differences between the traditional tourist destination countries and the economies that are more oriented toward industry and goods exports. While GDP in Spain increased by more than 2%, France and Italy only achieved GDP growth of less than 1%.\n\nConversely,  in Germany , gross  domestic  product  decreased slightly by 0.1% after adjustment for calendar variations. Private consumption fell due to the high inflation rate and the resulting decline in the purchasing power of private households. In contrast to the other major E.U. countries, government spending also fell considerably,  due  to  the  absence  of  pandemic-related  extra spending. The weak global economy was ultimately reflected in a decline in exports, although this was also offset by a sharper decline in imports. Foreign trade therefore made a positive contribution to the growth of the German economy overall. Due to the decline in\n\nproduction in the energy-intensive industries and in the construction industry, German industrial production declined by around 1%.\n\nGrowth in the Eastern E.U. countries also slowed significantly (2023: +0.5%, 2022: +4.2%). Although consumer price inflation decreased slightly compared with the previous year, at around 11% it was considerably higher than in Western E.U. countries (around 6%). In addition to the loss of purchasing power, these countries were particularly affected by the weakness of the manufacturing sector due to their above-average industrial share.\n\nIn  the United  Kingdom , GDP  only  grew  weakly,  by  0.5% (2022:  +4.3%),  as  private  consumption  only  increased  slightly against the backdrop of high inflation rates and as rising interest rates  increasingly  restricted  the  spending  flexibility  of  private households.\n\nIn the United States , economic performance was considerably better than we had expected at the beginning of the year. At 2.5%, GDP grew more strongly in 2023 than in the previous year (+1.9%). Growth was mainly driven by private services consumption and a demand for motor vehicles and leisure goods. Private households continued to deplete the savings they had accumulated during the coronavirus  pandemic.  Industrial  construction,  which  benefited from government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, also contributed to growth. Conversely, production in the manufacturing industry declined slightly by 0.5%.\n\nIn 2023, the economy in China recovered only hesitantly from the coronavirus-related restrictions in 2022. After low growth in 2022 (+3.0%), the growth target of 5% was achieved. However, domestic demand for goods grew only modestly and goods exports were weak due to the ailing global economy. The crisis in the housing sector continued  despite  government  support  measures,  and  youth unemployment  remained  high.  Against  this  backdrop,  Chinese consumers  were  particularly  reluctant  to  spend  on  consumer durables.\n\n- 1 We define the emerging markets of Asia as the ASEAN countries (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam), India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn most of the other emerging markets of Asia, particularly India (2023:  +6.5%,  2022:  +7.3%)  and Indonesia (2023:  +5.1%, 2022: +5.3%), growth remained at a high level against the backdrop of solid domestic demand. At 4.7%, the entire country group grew at  a  slower  rate  than  in  the  previous  year  (+5.7%).  In Japan , gross  domestic  product  grew  at  an  above-average  rate  of 1.8% (2022: +0.9%) due to a weak yen, declining imports and rising automotive exports, increasing investments and a moderate rise  in  private  consumption.  In South  Korea ,  however,  growth was weaker than in the previous year due to weak export demand from China and low demand for information technology goods (2023: +1.4%, 2022: +2.6%).\n\nIn South America , growth in Brazil (2023: +3.0%, 2022: +3.0%) was supported by high production growth in agriculture. In Argentina, economic  development  declined  in  an  environment  of  very  high inflation rates and  a  rapidly  falling currency  (2023:  -1.7%, 2022: +5.0%). All in all, the countries in the region grew by 1.4% in 2023, considerably slower than in the previous year (2022: +3.7%).\n\n## Trends in key customer industries\n\nGlobal demand for goods grew only weakly in 2023. The high inflation rates in many countries reduced private purchasing power and  dampened  growth  in  consumption  overall.  Demand  for consumer  durables  continued  to  decline  as  consumers  had front-loaded purchases during the coronavirus lockdowns. Rising interest  rates  and  the  high  level  of  economic  uncertainty  also reduced  companies'  willingness  to  invest.  However,  catch-up effects led to high rates of growth in the automotive industry.\n\nGlobal industrial production expanded by only 1.4% overall in 2023 (2022: +2.9%). Industrial production in the advanced economies declined  by  0.4%  (2022:  +1.6%);  in  the  emerging  markets,  by contrast, industrial production grew by 2.8% (2022: +3.9%). In the E.U., industrial production declined by 1.7%; in North America, it",

        "page_content": "only rose by 0.9%, while in Asia it grew by 2.9% overall. Despite the weak  economy  in  China,  the  growth  in  global  industrial  value creation came almost exclusively from there (total global growth contribution +1.4 percentage points, 1.3 percentage points of which came from China). The E.U.'s global contribution was negative at around  -0.2  percentage  points.  All  the  other  regions  only contributed little to global industrial growth overall.\n\nGlobal  automotive  production grew  dynamically  by  9.4%  or 7.7 million units in 2023 to a total production of 90.1 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (2022: +6.7%, 82.3 million units), thus reaching the pre-coronavirus pandemic level again. High growth was achieved in all regions. At 12.5%, growth was highest in the E.U.; in North America (+9.5%) and Asia (+9.0%), rates of growth were somewhat slower. In terms of unit sales, growth was highest in Asia, the world's largest vehicle market with 51 million units. A total of  4.3  million  more  vehicles  were  produced,  thereof  almost 2.5  million in China and 1.1  million in Japan. However, absolute growth was also very high in the E.U. and North America, with around 1.6 million and 1.4 million vehicles respectively.\n\nGrowth in the production of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) was significantly higher than that of the market as a whole: A total of 2.3 million more BEVs were produced; this corresponds to growth in this segment of around 28% compared with the previous year. Consequently, electric vehicles' share of all vehicles produced rose from around 10% in 2022 to around 12% in 2023.\n\n## Growth in key customer industries\n\nReal change compared with previous year\n\n|                               | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Industry total                | 1.4%   | 2.9%   |\n| Transportation                | 9.5%   | 7.7%   |\n| Of which: automotive industry | 9.4%   | 6.7%   |\n| Energy and resources          | 0.9%   | 3.6%   |\n| Construction                  | 1.8%   | 2.6%   |\n| Consumer goods                | -0.1%  | 2.9%   |\n| Electronics                   | 0.8%   | 4.9%   |\n| Health and nutrition          | 0.7%   | 2.7%   |\n| Agriculture                   | 3.1%   | 1.9%   |\n\nProduction in the construction industry was impacted in many countries by the continued rise in interest rates and the persistently high  construction  costs.  The  real  estate  crisis  in  China  had  a substantial impact on global growth in residential construction, as Chinese residential construction accounts for around a quarter of the global residential construction  market.  While  residential construction in all major economic areas contracted by around 3.5% overall on the basis of partially estimated figures, moderate growth  continued  to  be  recorded  in  the  construction  of  other buildings (+2.9%). Growth in industrial construction was particularly high in the United States, which benefited from subsidy offers for the semiconductor industry. Infrastructure construction continued to expand  dynamically  worldwide  (+6.8%).  However,  the  global construction  industry  expanded  by  only  1.8%  overall  in  2023 (2022: +2.6%).\n\nIn the consumer goods industry , production stagnated in 2023 (-0.1%) after growing by 2.9% in the previous year. In the furniture industry, production declined by more than 6%, while it declined by just under 3% in the textile industry. By contrast, the production of chemicals for the manufacture of care products grew moderately by around 2%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe electronics industry only grew slightly (2023: +0.8%, 2022: +4.9%).  Production  fell  in  communication  electronics,  while  it stagnated  in  electronic  components,  computers  and  peripheral devices  overall  and  there  was  a  moderate  increase  in  classic entertainment and other electronics.\n\nThe energy and raw materials sector expanded by around 0.9% in 2023 (2022: +3.6%). Oil and gas production stagnated overall. Oil production cuts by the OPEC+ countries were more than offset by higher production in North America, resulting in a slight increase in oil  supply  overall.  The  production  of  liquid  gas  also  increased slightly, while Russian gas exports via pipeline fell significantly. The low production growth in industry and the warm weather reduced demand for gas. The weak global industrial economy was also reflected  in  only  slight  production  growth  in  other  industrial non-energy raw materials.\n\nProduction in health and nutrition almost stagnated in 2023, at 0.7% (2022: +2.7%). In the pharmaceutical industry, production stagnated as well: Growth in the E.U. and North America was offset by a decline in Asia. Production in the food industry declined in the E.U. and in North America against the backdrop of high food inflation rates. Conversely, production rose moderately in Asia.\n\nAt 3.1%, agriculture grew more strongly than in the previous year (+1.9%). While production in Asia saw growth of 3.5%, growth in North and South America accelerated following the long periods of drought in 2022, from -1.6% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023. Agricultural production  in  Eastern  Europe  also  grew  again  by  nearly  4% following the war-related decline of 1.2% in the previous year.",

While the chemical industry in China grew dynamically by 7.5% 1 on the basis of official figures, it shrank by 3.9% in the rest of the world as a whole.\n\nProduction losses were especially severe in the E.U . Following a decline of 5.2% in 2022, production recorded a further decline of 7.6% in 2023. In Germany , production fell even more sharply by 9.7% (after -12.1% in 2022). These sharp declines primarily reflect base effects from the previous year. In view of the overall weak demand for industrial goods, the correspondingly low demand for intermediate inputs from the chemical industry and ongoing import pressure from China, production in the E.U. and Germany remained largely at the low level reached in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decline in production in the second half of 2022 due to energy costs could not be compensated for in this weak environment. In addition, gas prices in Northwestern Europe remained high by international standards, even though they had dropped below pre-Ukraine war levels by 2023.\n\nIn  the United  Kingdom , chemical  production  decreased  by 8.4% (2022: -4.5%).\n\nDespite low energy prices internationally, chemical production in the United States also essentially trended sideways over the course of the year and closed the year with a decline in production of 1.0% (2022: +2.2%). One major reason for the weak development was the low domestic demand for equipment for private households and from the construction industry.\n\nIn contrast, chemical production in Asia expanded by 4.6%. This varied widely by country. In China , the world's largest chemical market, production expanded by 7.5% (2022: +6.6%). 1 In India, production largely stagnated. Conversely, Japan (-6.6%), South Korea (-10.0%) and Taiwan (-10.5%) recorded sharp declines in production.\n\nChemical production in the Middle East also decreased by 1.5%.

The main driver of the additional demand  was  China,  which  accounted  for  almost  half  of  the growth  in  demand.  Demand  from  the  transportation  sector increased  sharply  after  the  end  of  the  zero-COVID  policy. Furthermore, Chinese oil reserves increased considerably compared with the previous year.\n\nThere were contrasting developments on the supply side of the oil market: While the OPEC countries, including Saudi Arabia in particular, reduced their production in order to stabilize the oil price in the weak economic environment, production in the United States increased considerably. Despite the sanctions against Russia, the Russian oil supply remained largely unchanged. As a result, the oil price fell from $101 per barrel of Brent crude in 2022 to $82 per barrel in 2023. The price of oil fluctuated over the course of the year between $75 per barrel in June and $94 per barrel in September. Over the course of the year, the average monthly price for the chemical raw material naphtha ranged between $550 per metric ton in June and $719 per metric ton in February. At $643 per metric ton, the annualized average price of naphtha in 2023 was around 16% lower than in 2022 ($770 per metric ton).\n\nThe price of gas in Northwestern Europe fell considerably in 2023 to around one-third of the prior-year level, as gas consumption declined considerably due to savings made by private households, industry and commerce, combined with lower demand in industry and exceptionally high average temperatures. At the same time, the infrastructure for the supply of liquid gas was expanded in Northwestern Europe. Gas storage levels were therefore above their respective  seasonal  long-term  averages  throughout  the  year. The  average  gas  price  in  Northwestern  Europe  in  2023  was \u20ac40.52 per MWh ($12.83  per mmBtu). In the previous year, it averaged \u20ac124.16 per MWh ($38.01 per mmBtu) due to the abrupt interruption in pipeline supplies from Russia. Fluctuations in the price of gas were also considerably lower than in the previous year.  The  highest  monthly  average  was  reached  in  January\n\n## Price trends for crude oil (Brent) and naphtha\n\n$/barrel, $/metric ton\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nat \u20ac62.82 per MWh ($19.83 per mmBtu), while the lowest was recorded in July at \u20ac29.37 per MWh ($9.52 per mmBtu).\n\nThe average price of gas in the United States was $2.54 per mmBtu, likewise considerably below the prior-year level ($6.36 per mmBtu). Gas prices in China averaged around $12.77 per mmBtu nationally (2022: $12.21 per mmBtu).\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, the global economy as well as global industrial and chemical production grew in part at a considerably more moderate pace than in the previous year. In this market environment, BASF's business also largely fell short of expectations: Sales, EBIT before special items and ROCE declined considerably overall compared with the 2022 business year. By contrast, the Agricultural  Solutions  and  Surface  Technologies  segments increased their EBIT before special items considerably and slightly, respectively, in this challenging market environment.\n\n- Business reviews by segment can be found from page 74 onward\n\nFor more information on the development of CO2 emissions, see page 102 onward\n\n## At a glance\n\n- \u25aa Sharp declines in sales, EBIT before special items and ROCE\n- \u25aa Earnings per share of \u20ac0.25; adjusted earnings per share of \u20ac2.78\n\nSales amounted to \u20ac68,902 million in the 2023 business year - a decrease of \u20ac18,424 million compared with the previous year. This sales development was mainly driven by considerably lower prices and volumes. Lower raw materials prices in particular led to lower prices in almost all segments. Considerable price increases in the Agricultural Solutions segment were unable to compensate for this. Sales volumes fell significantly in all segments as a result of weak demand from many of our customer industries. Currency effects, mainly relating to the Chinese renminbi, also weighed down sales performance. Portfolio effects, mainly in the Industrial Solutions segment  and  especially  due  to  the  sale  of  the  kaolin  minerals business as of September 30, 2022, also had a negative impact on sales.\n\n## Sales\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|   2023 | 68,902   |\n|--------|----------|\n|   2022 | 87,327   |\n|   2021 | 78,598   |\n|   2020 | 59,149   |\n|   2019 | 59,316   |\n\n## Factors influencing sales of the BASF Group\n\n|                       | Change   in million \u20ac   | Change   in %   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|\n| Volumes               | -7,368                  | -8.4%           |\n| Prices                | -8,703                  | -10.0%          |\n| Currencies            | -2,141                  | -2.5%           |\n| Acquisitions          | -                       | -               |\n| Divestitures          | -212                    | -0.2%           |\n| Total change in sales | -18,424                 | -21.1%          |\n\n## Income from operations (EBIT) before special items declined by\n\n\u20ac3,072 million compared with the prior-year figure, to \u20ac3,806 million, primarily due to a considerably lower earnings contribution from Chemicals and Materials. EBIT before special items decreased in the  Chemicals  segment,  primarily  due  to  lower  margins  and volumes,  as  well  as  lower  contributions  from  shareholdings accounted for using the equity method. Earnings were lower in the Materials segment, largely as a result of lower polyamide and ammonia margins. The Nutrition  & Care and Industrial Solutions segments' EBIT before special items was considerably lower than the  prior-year  figure,  mainly  as  a  result  of  lower  volumes  and margins. Conversely, the Agricultural Solutions segment strongly increased EBIT before special items, primarily as a result of price increases and a one-time payment that was received. The slight\n\nearnings growth in Surface Technologies was attributable to the considerably  higher  EBIT  before  special  items  in  the  Coatings division  due  to  price  and  volume  increases,  which  more  than compensated for the significant decline in earnings of the Catalysts division. EBIT before special items attributable to Other improved considerably,  mainly  as  a  result  of  higher  income  from  other businesses and lower corporate research costs.\n\n## EBIT before special items\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2023 | 3,806   |\n|--------|---------|\n|   2022 | 6,878   |\n|   2021 | 7,768   |\n|   2020 | 3,560   |\n\n- a EBIT before special items for 2019 has been restated to reflect the reclassification of income from non-integral companies accounted for using the equity method to net income from shareholdings.\n\nSpecial  items 1 in  EBIT  amounted  to  -\u20ac1,566  million  in  2023 compared with -\u20ac330 million in the previous year. Special expenses resulted in particular from other charges due to impairments totaling around \u20ac1.1 billion. These comprised impairments on property, plant and equipment in the Surface Technologies segment, especially in the battery materials business, on plants in the Agricultural Solutions segment, and on tangible and intangible assets in the Materials segment. Furthermore, special charges totaling \u20ac396 million (previous year: \u20ac249 million) resulted from restructuring measures, in particular in connection with the cost savings program focusing on Europe, the adjustments  to  production  structures  at  the  Verbund  site  in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and the carve-out of the BASF Environmental Catalyst and Metal Solutions unit within the Catalysts division. Special charges from divestitures amounted to \u20ac59 million after a special income of \u20ac174 million in 2022. Integration costs of \u20ac17 million resulted mainly from the integration of the BASF Shanshan companies acquired in 2021.\n\n- 1 Special items may arise from the integration of acquired businesses, from restructuring measures, gains or losses resulting from divestitures and sales of shareholdings, impairments and other expenses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities.",

In the previous year, net income from  shareholdings  was  dampened  by  special  charges  of \u20ac6.3  billion, in particular from non-cash-effective impairments on Wintershall Dea, a non-integral shareholdings accounted for using the equity method, primarily in connection with the termination of business activities in Russia. Wintershall Dea's earnings contribution in 2023 amounted to -\u20ac130 million and included special items of -\u20ac164 million for impairments and reversals of impairments as well as for provisions as part of the planned adjustment of the corporate structure.\n\nCompared with the previous year, the \u20ac202 million decrease in the financial result was partly due to the \u20ac105 million lower interest result. Higher interest expenses for financial indebtedness, primarily as a result of higher interest rates, were only partially offset by higher interest income. In addition, the other financial result decreased by \u20ac97 million, mainly due to higher net expenses in connection with bonds in foreign currency and related hedging instruments.\n\nOverall, income before income taxes amounted to \u20ac1,420 million in 2023, after \u20ac1,190 million in the previous year. Income tax expenses were \u20ac1,041 million (2022: \u20ac1,581 million). The tax rate of 73.3% was mainly due to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards as well as their nonrecognition, particularly in Germany.\n\nThe  decrease  in noncontrolling  interests by  \u20ac82  million  to \u20ac154  million primarily resulted from lower earnings contributions from the BASF Shanshan companies in China.\n\nNet income was \u20ac225 million compared with -\u20ac627 million in 2022.\n\n## Earnings per share amounted to \u20ac0.25 (2022: -\u20ac0.70).\n\n- For more information on the items in the statement of income, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 227\n\nFor more information on the tax rate, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 260 onward\n\n## Additional indicators for results of operations\n\nWe also use alternative performance measures (APMs) to steer the BASF Group. Investors, analysts and rating agencies use them to assess our performance. These are not defined by IFRS. As such, the methods of calculation can differ from those used by other companies. Alternative performance measures for the results of operations are EBIT before special items, EBITDA before special items,  EBITDA,  the  EBITDA  margin  before  special  items  and adjusted earnings per share. Other APMs are net debt, 1 free cash flow 1 and capital expenditures (capex). 2\n\nFrom the 2024 reporting year onward, we will use EBITDA before special items and free cash flow as the new most important key performance indicators for short and medium-term steering of the BASF Group. A detailed explanation of how these key performance indicators are calculated can be found in 'Our Steering Concept' from page 37 onward.\n\nEBITDA before special items in 2023 was \u20ac3,092 million below the 2022 figure at \u20ac7,671 million; EBITDA decreased by \u20ac3,568 million to \u20ac7,180  million.

Amortization, impairments and reversals of impairments on intangible assets are then eliminated. Amortization of intangible assets primarily results from the purchase price allocation following acquisitions and is therefore of a temporary nature. The effects of these adjustments on income taxes and on noncontrolling interests are also considered. This makes adjusted earnings per share a suitable measure for making comparisons over time and predicting future profitability.\n\nIn 2023, adjusted earnings per share amounted to \u20ac2.78 compared with \u20ac6.96 in the previous year.\n\n- For more information on the earnings per share according to IFRS, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 248\n\n<!-- image -->",

Lower current assets were the main reason for the decline.\n\nNoncurrent  assets declined  by  \u20ac1,127  million  compared  with December 31, 2022, to \u20ac45,923 million. The decrease of intangible assets amounted to \u20ac1,056 million and was mainly attributable to amortization  of  \u20ac612  million  and  impairments  of  \u20ac267  million. Currency effects of \u20ac291  million also contributed to the decline. Additions of \u20ac142 million had an offsetting effect.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment increased by \u20ac1,113 million, mainly due to additions of \u20ac5,864 million, particularly in connection with the construction of our Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China. Depreciation amounted  to  \u20ac4,062  million  and  included  impairments  of \u20ac883  million. A currency effect of \u20ac555  million counteracted the increase in property, plant and equipment.\n\nCompared with the end of the previous year, the carrying amounts of  integral  investments  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method declined by \u20ac302 million to \u20ac2,054 million. This resulted primarily from a lower carrying amount of BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China, due to dividend payments and currency effects.",

Retained earnings were \u20ac2,937  million below the figure as of December 31, 2022. This resulted from the dividends paid to the shareholders of BASF SE for 2022, which amounted to \u20ac3,035  million, while the net income amounted to \u20ac225  million. Other comprehensive  income  decreased  by \u20ac1,349  million, in particular as a result of currency effects and actuarial losses.\n\nAt 47.3%, the equity ratio was slightly below the prior-year level (48.4%).\n\nNoncurrent liabilities increased by \u20ac1,769 million compared with the 2022 year-end. This was mainly attributable to the \u20ac1,914 million increase  in  noncurrent  financial  indebtedness.  The  increase primarily resulted from the issue of three eurobonds with a nominal value totaling \u20ac1.5 billion and the taking up of loans amounting to around \u20ac1.8 billion. The reclassification of a 500 million eurobond and two loans totaling \u20ac760  million from noncurrent to current financial indebtedness as well as exchange rates and interest had an offsetting effect.\n\nThe \u20ac133 million increase in other noncurrent liabilities compared with the prior-year figure largely resulted from higher lease liabilities.",

        "page_content": "At \u20ac2,896 million, provisions for pensions and similar obligations were slightly above the prior year-end figure. The rise in obligations due to lower discount rates in all relevant currency zones was largely offset by the return on plan assets and lower defined benefit assets.\n\nTax and other provisions were almost on prior-year level.\n\nCurrent liabilities decreased by \u20ac4,569 million to \u20ac15,871 million compared with December  31, 2022, largely as a result of the considerable decrease in trade accounts payable by \u20ac1,693 million and current financial indebtedness by \u20ac1,662 million. The decrease in  financial  indebtedness  was  mainly  due  to  the  scheduled repayment of a U.S. dollar bond and a eurobond as well as a GBP bond with an aggregate carrying amount of about \u20ac2.1  billion. Furthermore, commercial paper at BASF SE were reduced by around \u20ac650 million. This was partially offset by the aforementioned reclassifications of a bond and two loans.\n\nCurrent provisions were \u20ac584  million below the prior-year figure, largely as a result of lower provisions for bonus payments. Slightly higher provisions for rebates had an offsetting effect.\n\nOther liabilities declined by \u20ac437 million year on year, mainly due to lower advance payments received and lower negative fair values of derivatives.\n\nTax liabilities decreased by \u20ac194 million.\n\nNet debt amounted to \u20ac16,590 million on December 31, 2023, and was therefore almost on a level with the prior year-end.\n\n- For more information on the composition and development of individual asset items, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 234 onward\n\nFor more information on the development of the balance sheet, see the Ten-Year Summary on page 317\n\n## Net debt\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                   | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Noncurrent financial indebtedness | 17,085               | 15,171               |\n| + Current financial indebtedness  | 2,182                | 3,844                |\n| Financial indebtedness            | 19,268               | 19,016               |\n| - Marketable securities           | 53                   | 232                  |\n| - Cash and cash equivalents       | 2,624                | 2,516                |\n| Net debt                          | 16,590               | 16,268               |\n\n## Off-balance sheet obligations\n\nOff-balance sheet obligations mainly relate to long-term purchase obligations  for  raw  materials  and  long-term  supply  agreements for electricity from renewable sources. In addition, obligations exist in connection  with  initiated  or  planned  investment  projects (2023: \u20ac11,064 million), primarily in connection with the construction of the new BASF Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China.\n\n- For more information, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 290 and the forecast from page 170 onward\n\n## Financing policy and credit ratings\n\nOur financing policy aims to ensure our solvency at all times, limiting the  risks  associated  with  financing  and  optimizing  our  cost  of capital. We preferably meet our external financing needs on the international capital markets.\n\nBASF  continues  to  strive  for  a  solid  A  rating,  which  ensures unrestricted access to financial and capital markets. Our financing measures are aligned with our operational business planning as well as the company's strategic direction and also ensure the financial flexibility to take advantage of strategic options.\n\n## Maturities of financial indebtedness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Million \u20ac       |       |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| 2024            | 2,182 |\n| 2025            | 1,904 |\n| 2026            | 2,681 |\n| 2027            | 2,383 |\n| 2028            | 1,818 |\n| 2029 and beyond |       |\n\nBASF  enjoys  good  credit  ratings,  especially  compared  with competitors in the chemical industry. Fitch confirmed its rating of A/F1/outlook stable on November  8, 2023. Moody's rating of A3/P-2/outlook  stable  from  September  4,  2023,  also  remained unchanged. Standard & Poor's adjusted its rating of A/A-1/outlook negative to A-/A-2/outlook stable on August 2, 2023.\n\nWe  have  solid  financing,  both  for  ongoing  business  and  for investment projects initiated or planned. Corporate bonds form the basis of our medium to long-term debt financing. These are issued in euros and other currencies with different maturities as part of our \u20ac20 billion debt issuance program. The goal is to create a balanced maturity profile, diversify our financing and optimize our debt capital financing conditions.\n\nFor short-term financing, we use BASF SE's global commercial paper program, which has an issuing volume of up to $12.5 billion. As of December 31, 2023, no commercial paper were outstanding under this program. A firmly committed, syndicated credit line of \u20ac6 billion with a term until 2026 covers the repayment of outstanding commercial  paper.  It  can  also  be  used  for  general  company purposes. This credit line was not used at any point in 2023. In 2023, BASF Integrated Site (Guangdong) Co. Ltd., China, signed a  syndicated  bank  term  loan  facility  totaling  40  billion  Chinese renminbi with a maturity of 15 years for the construction of the Verbund site in Zhanjiang. Of this amount, 1 billion Chinese renminbi (\u20ac127 million) was utilized as of December 31, 2023. Our external financing is largely independent of short-term fluctuations in the credit markets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To minimize risks and leverage internal optimization potential within the Group, we bundle the financing, financial investments and foreign currency hedging of BASF SE's subsidiaries within the BASF Group where  possible.  Foreign  currency  risks  are  primarily  hedged centrally using derivative financial instruments in the market.\n\nOur interest risk management generally pursues the goal of reducing interest expenses for the BASF  Group and limiting interest risks. Interest rate hedging transactions are therefore conducted with banks in order to turn selected liabilities to the capital market from fixed to variable interest rates or vice versa.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the financing tools and hedging instruments used, see Note 20 from page 280 onward and Note 25 from page 291 onward in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nCash flows from operating activities amounted to \u20ac8,111 million, compared with \u20ac7,709 million in the previous year. The improvement was primarily due to cash inflow from net working capital. Net income increased by \u20ac852  million year on year to \u20ac225  million. Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were \u20ac740  million above the prior-year figure, in particular due to impairments. The non-cash-effective equity results improved by \u20ac4,577  million. In the previous year, these included the negative earnings contribution of -\u20ac4,853 million from Wintershall Dea AG, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany. The adjusted earnings for the aforementioned noncash items therefore decreased by \u20ac2,985 million compared with the previous year.\n\nIn 2023, dividends received from investments accounted for using the equity method amounted to \u20ac622 million following \u20ac1,629 million in  the  previous  year.  The  main  reason  for  the  decline  was  the \u20ac716 million decrease in dividend payments from Wintershall Dea AG.\n\nThe reduction in inventories in 2023 released cash amounting to \u20ac1,896  million.  In  contrast,  \u20ac1,991  million  was  tied  up  in  an inventories  buildup  in  the  previous  year.  The  change  in  trade accounts receivable led to a cash inflow of \u20ac1,443  million, an increase of \u20ac1,223  million compared with the previous year. The cash outflow from the trade accounts payable change amounted to \u20ac1,544 million, compared with an inflow of \u20ac451 million in the previous year. Funds amounting to \u20ac1,918  million were released from other operating assets, an increase of \u20ac1,621 million compared with 2022. The increase in cash released was mainly the result of a stronger reduction in precious and industrial metal trading items and tax receivables. The change in other operating liabilities and pension provisions led to a cash outflow of \u20ac730  million, an increase of \u20ac246 million compared with the previous year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCash flows from investing activities totaled -\u20ac4,991  million in 2023, after -\u20ac3,778 million in the previous year. Payments made for property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  rose  by \u20ac1,020 million to \u20ac5,395 million, mainly due to investments in the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China. In 2023, cash flows from investing  activities  included  payments  made  for  acquisitions  of \u20ac5  million. As in the previous year, these related to an adjusted purchase price payment for Solvay's polyamide business. Payments received for divestitures in the amount of \u20ac32 million resulted from minor transactions. In the previous year, payments received in the amount of \u20ac691 million resulted primarily from the sale of shares in the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm and the sale of the kaolin minerals business.\n\nCash flows from financing activities amounted to -\u20ac2,905 million. In  addition  to  the  payment  of  dividends  in  the  amount  of \u20ac3,094  million  (2022:  \u20ac3,248  million),  BASF  bought  back  own shares worth \u20ac70 million (2022: \u20ac1,331 million). This was partially offset  by  net  additions  to  financial  and  similar  liabilities  of \u20ac259 million (2022: \u20ac565 million).\n\nFree cash flow , which remains after deducting payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from cash flows from operating activities, represents the financial resources remaining after investments. It amounted to \u20ac2,715 million in 2023 following \u20ac3,333 million in the previous year.\n\n- For more information on the statement of cash flows, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 306 onward",

        "page_content": "## Actual Development Compared with Outlook for 2023\n\n## Sales, earnings and ROCE forecast for the BASF Group\n\nIn 2023, the BASF Group's sales decreased to \u20ac68.9 billion and were thus considerably below the forecast range at the beginning of the year of \u20ac84 billion to \u20ac87 billion and below the forecast range adjusted in July 2023 of \u20ac73 billion to \u20ac76 billion. This was the result of lower sales in all segments. Sales performance in the Chemicals, Materials, Nutrition & Care and Agricultural Solutions segments in particular was weaker than initially expected. Sales also declined considerably in Other, after we had expected slight sales growth in February  2023.  The  decline  in  sales  resulted  mainly  from significantly lower prices than anticipated, primarily as a result of lower raw materials prices. Prices declined in all segments except for  Agricultural  Solutions.  Contrary  to  our  expectations,  sales volumes decreased sharply in all segments, especially due to lower demand.  Portfolio  effects  had  a  slightly  negative  impact,  as expected.\n\nAt \u20ac3.8  billion, EBIT before special items was outside both the forecast range of \u20ac4.8 billion to \u20ac5.4 billion from February 2023 and the adjusted range of \u20ac4.0  billion to \u20ac4.4  billion from July 2023. Developments in the segments varied: In the Chemicals and Materials segments,  EBIT  before  special  items  declined  considerably  as forecast. The Industrial Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments recorded a considerably sharper decline in earnings than initially expected. In contrast, the development in the Agricultural Solutions and  Surface  Technologies  segments  and  in  Other  were  better than assumed. Agricultural Solutions exceeded our expectations and  considerably  increased  earnings.  Other  also  recorded  a considerable  increase  in  earnings,  despite  our  expectations  of a considerable decline. Surface Technologies slightly increased EBIT before special items and thus exceeded our forecast of a slight decline in earnings.\n\n## Forecast/actual comparison\n\n|                        | Sales                     | Sales         | EBIT before special items   | EBIT before special items   | ROCE          | ROCE        |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n|                        | 2023 forecast             | 2023 actual   | 2023 forecast               | 2023 actual                 | 2023 forecast | 2023 actual |\n| Chemicals              |                           |               |                             |                             |               |             |\n| Materials              |                           |               |                             |                             |               |             |\n| Industrial Solutions   |                           |               |                             |                             |               |             |\n| Surface Technologies   |                           |               |                             |                             |               |             |\n| Nutrition & Care       |                           |               |                             |                             |               |             |\n| Agricultural Solutions |                           |               |                             |                             |               |             |\n| Other                  |                           |               |                             |                             | -             | -           |\n| BASF Group             | \u20ac84 billion-\u20ac87 billion a | \u20ac68.9 billion | \u20ac4.8 billion-\u20ac5.4 billion   | \u20ac3.8 billion                | 7.2%-8.0% a   | 4.5%        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- At prior-year level: no change (+/-0.0%)\n\n|\n\n- Slight increase/decrease: 'slight' represents a change of 0.1%-5.0% for sales; 0.1%-10.0% for earnings; 0.1 to 1.0 percentage points for ROCE\n- | Considerable increase/decrease: 'considerable' represents a change of 5.1% or higher for sales; 10.1% or higher for earnings; more than 1.0 percentage points for ROCE\n- a We updated our outlook in July 2023, forecasting sales of between \u20ac73 billion and \u20ac76 billion, EBIT before special items of between \u20ac4.0 billion and \u20ac4.4 billion, and a ROCE of between 6.5% and 7.1%.\n\nOur  expectations  for ROCE were  accurate  in  the  Chemicals, Materials and Nutrition & Care segments. In the other segments, ROCE was below our expectations. Overall, ROCE for the BASF Group amounted to 4.5%, below the cost of capital rate of 9% for 2023 and below the range we had forecast in February 2023 of between 7.2% and 8.0%. The adjusted range of 6.5% to 7.1% in July 2023 was also not reached. This ROCE development was attributable to the declines in earnings in the segments, which was partly due to unexpected impairments in the fourth quarter of 2023. A  considerably  lower  cost  of  capital  basis  was  unable  to compensate for this.\n\n## CO2 emissions forecast for the BASF Group\n\nCO2 emissions amounted to 16.9 million metric tons, well below the forecast range in February 2023 of 18.1 million metric tons to 19.1 million metric tons and slightly below the adjusted range from July 2023 of 17.0 million metric tons to 17.6  million metric tons. The main driver for this was the reduced production volume due to persistently weak demand. We continued to use electricity from renewable sources and purchase green electricity certificates.",

        "page_content": "## Capex forecast for the BASF Group\n\nIn 2023, we invested a total of \u20ac5.2 billion in property, plant and equipment, excluding additions from acquisitions, IT investments, restoration obligations and right-of-use assets arising from leases. The figure forecast in February 2023 was around \u20ac6.3 billion. The Chemicals and Surface Technologies segments as well as Other spent considerably less in 2023 than originally planned.\n\n## Sales, earnings and ROCE forecast for the segments\n\nSales in the Chemicals segment declined considerably in 2023, after we had expected a slight decline in sales at the beginning of the year. Prices declined in both operating divisions as expected, albeit to a more considerable extent than anticipated. In addition, volumes decreased considerably due to a slowdown in demand. We  had  initially  assumed  volume  growth  in  the  segment.  The segment's  EBIT  before  special  items  and  ROCE  declined considerably, as forecast.\n\nContrary to our assumption of slight sales growth, sales in the Materials segment were considerably below the prior-year level. Here, too, this was mainly due to demand- and raw materials pricesrelated price and volume decline after we had assumed a price increase and slight volume growth at the beginning of 2023. EBIT before special items and ROCE declined considerably as expected.\n\nCompared with the previous year, sales in the Industrial Solutions segment decreased considerably, contrary to our expectation of a slight decline. This was mainly due to the sharp decline in sales volumes in the Performance Chemicals division as a result of weak demand. In February, we forecast volume growth for the division. As expected, lower volumes in the Dispersions & Resins division, lower prices in both divisions and the negative portfolio effect from the divestiture of the kaolin minerals business also had a negative impact on sales. The segment's EBIT before special items decreased significantly  instead  of  only  slightly  as  forecast.  Both  divisions contributed  to  this  with  considerably  lower  earnings.  We  had\n\nassumed a considerable increase in EBIT before special items for the Performance Chemicals division in our forecast. Contrary to our expectation of a slight decline, ROCE was also considerably below the previous year as a result of earnings development.\n\nSales in the Surface Technologies segment were considerably below the prior-year figure. We had originally assumed a slight decline in sales. While price developments in both divisions were as forecast, the Catalysts division was unable to increase volumes as expected. However, EBIT before special items rose slightly; we had initially expected a slight decrease. This was attributable to the expected considerable earnings growth in the Coatings division, which even more than compensated for the anticipated decline in earnings in the Catalysts division. ROCE was considerably lower due to impairments on property, plant and equipment, particularly in the battery materials business. We had expected a slight decline in ROCE in February.\n\nDespite our assumption of sales on a level with the previous year, sales in the Nutrition & Care segment decreased considerably. The divisions recorded declines in volumes, contrary to our expectations. Prices decreased as assumed. In line with sales performance, EBIT before  special  items  declined  significantly  due  to  volumes  and margins, after we had assumed only a slight decline. ROCE was considerably below the previous year, as forecast.\n\nSales decreased slightly in the Agricultural Solutions segment and did not increase slightly as originally forecast. The expected price increases were not able to fully compensate for the unforeseen decline in sales volumes driven by a change in market dynamics. EBIT before special items increased considerably, primarily as a result of price increases and the receipt of a one-time payment. At  the  beginning  of  the  year,  we  had  only  expected  a  slight improvement. ROCE was slightly lower, contrary to our assumption of a slight increase. This was mainly driven by impairments on production facilities in Europe as well as charges for measures in the context of the cost savings program focusing on Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales in Other were significantly lower compared with the prior-year figure due to lower sales in commodity and energy trading. We had forecast a slight increase in February  2023.  Contrary  to expectations, EBIT before special items increased considerably. This was mainly due to a higher contribution from other businesses compared with the previous year and lower expenses for corporate research.\n\n- For more information on our forecast for 2024, see page 170 onward\n\nFor more information on investments, see page 42 onward",

For example, a cement production facility at Heidelberg Materials will be the first to use a large-scale CO2 capture plant in which a process based on OASE \u00ae blue, jointly developed by  BASF,  Linde  and  Heidelberg  Materials,  will  be used. From 2025, around 70,000 metric tons of CO2 per year will be captured, purified and liquefied in this first plant  of  its  kind  for  capturing  and  recycling  CO2  in cement production at the Lengfurt site in Bavaria. As cement production is associated with considerable CO2 emissions, we and our partners are making an important contribution  to  reducing  emissions.  The  use  of  the special OASE \u00ae -based process is open to all companies in the cement industry.\n\nFor more information on OASE \u00ae blue, see basf.com/oase-blue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chemicals\n\nThe Chemicals segment consists of the Petrochemicals and Intermediates  divisions.  It  supplies  the  other  segments with basic chemicals and intermediates, contributing to the organic growth of our key value chains as well as to our direct  customer  business.  Alongside  internal  transfers, our customers mainly come from the chemical and plastics industries. We aim to further expand our competitiveness through technological leadership and operational excellence.\n\nFor more information on the Chemicals segment's business model, see page 34 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales\n\n\u20ac10,369 million 2022: \u20ac14,895 million\n\nEBIT before special items\n\n\u20ac361 million\n\n2022: \u20ac1,956 million\n\nSegment cash flow\n\n-\u20ac936 million 2022: \u20ac1,878 million\n\nEBITDA before special items\n\n\u20ac1,167 million 2022: \u20ac2,774 million",

In the Petrochemicals division sales declined by \u20ac3,127  million to \u20ac7,418 million, while sales in the Intermediates division decreased by \u20ac1,398 million to \u20ac2,951 million.\n\n## Factors influencing sales - Chemicals\n\n|            | Chemicals   | Petrochemicals   | Intermediates   |\n|------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Volumes    | -11.9%      | -11.7%           | -12.4%          |\n| Prices     | -17.1%      | -16.9%           | -17.6%          |\n| Currencies | -1.4%       | -1.1%            | -2.1%           |\n| Portfolio  | -           | -                | -               |\n| Sales      | -30.4%      | -29.7%           | -32.2%          |\n\nSales performance was mainly driven by considerably lower prices and volumes in both divisions as a result of weak demand coupled with high product availability and lower raw materials prices. As a result, prices in the Petrochemicals division fell significantly in all business areas. In the Intermediates division, increased capacities of Chinese competitors led to additional price pressure, which meant that price levels declined in the butanediol and derivatives business in particular.\n\n## Segment data - Chemicals\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                            |                                                                            | 2023   | 2022   | +/-    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sales to third parties                                                     | Sales to third parties                                                     | 10,369 | 14,895 | -30.4% |\n| of which Petrochemicals                                                    |                                                                            | 7,418  | 10,546 | -29.7% |\n| Intermediates                                                              |                                                                            | 2,951  | 4,349  | -32.2% |\n| Intersegment transfers                                                     | Intersegment transfers                                                     | 3,606  | 4,860  | -25.8% |\n| Sales including transfers                                                  | Sales including transfers                                                  | 13,975 | 19,754 | -29.3% |\n| Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items | Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items | 1,167  | 2,774  | -57.9% |\n| Income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)       | Income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)       | 1,167  | 2,771  | -57.9% |\n| EBITDA margin before special items %                                       | EBITDA margin before special items %                                       | 11.3   | 18.6   | -      |\n| Depreciation and amortization a                                            | Depreciation and amortization a                                            | 803    | 1,013  | -20.8% |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)                                              | Income from operations (EBIT)                                              | 364    | 1,758  | -79.3% |\n| Special items                                                              | Special items                                                              | 4      | -198   | .      |\n| EBIT before special items                                                  | EBIT before special items                                                  | 361    | 1,956  | -81.6% |\n| Investments including acquisitions b                                       | Investments including acquisitions b                                       | 2,706  | 1,701  | 59.1%  |\n| Segment cash flow                                                          | Segment cash flow                                                          | -936   | 1,878  | .      |\n| Assets                                                                     | Assets                                                                     | 11,468 | 10,481 | 9.4%   |\n| Return on capital employed (ROCE)                                          | %                                                                          | 3.3    | 15.6   | -      |\n| Research and development expenses                                          | Research and development expenses                                          | 83     | 93     | -10.4% |\n\n- a Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including impairments and reversals of impairments)\n- b Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nWeak demand weighed down the segment's volume development significantly.  Compared  with  the  previous  year,  volumes  in  the Petrochemicals division decreased, particularly for steam cracker products, styrene monomers and in the propylene value chain. In the Intermediates division, volumes decreased considerably in all business areas.\n\nCurrency effects, largely relating to the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar, also had a negative impact on sales.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decline in EBIT before special items in both  operating  divisions  was  primarily  attributable  to  the  lower margins and volumes, and lower contributions from shareholdings accounted for using the equity method.

EBIT before special items declined considerably in the Monomers division due to lower polyamide and ammonia margins. The slight decline in earnings in the Performance Materials division was driven by lower margins and volumes. Considerably reduced fixed costs in both divisions, primarily as a result of lower production costs, were unable to compensate for this.\n\nEBIT decreased by \u20ac1,399  million to \u20ac378  million. This included special charges amounting to \u20ac464 million, mainly for impairments on intangible assets and production plants in Europe, for costs in connection with adaptations to the production structures at the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and for measures in the context of the cost savings program focusing on Europe.\n\nFor the outlook for 2024, see page 170 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Division sales by region\n\n(Location of customer)\n\n| Divisions             | Europe   | North America   | Asia Pacific   | South America,   Africa, Middle East   | Total   (million \u20ac)   |\n|-----------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Performance Materials | 35.7%    | 25.1%           | 34.2%          | 5.0%                                   | 7,244                 |\n| Monomers              | 42.8%    | 21.3%           | 31.1%          | 4.8%                                   | 6,905                 |\n\n## Divisions, products, applications\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Products                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Customer industries and applications   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Engineering plastics, polyurethane systems, thermoplastic   polyurethane, foam specialties, biodegradable plastics                                                                               | Transportation (including automotive, e-mobility), industrial (including electric  and electronics), consumer goods (including footwear, sports and leisure,  household appliances and furniture, medical devices), construction (including  thermal insulation) | Performance Materials                  |\n| Isocyanates (MDI, TDI), ammonia, caprolactam, adipic acid,   chlorine, urea, glues and impregnating resins, caustic soda,   polyamides 6 and 6.6, standard alcoholates, sulfuric and nitric acid | Plastics, woodworking, furniture, packaging, textile, construction and   automotive as well as other industries                                                                                                                                                  | Monomers                               |\n\n## Production capacities of selected products in the regions a\n\n| Product              | Europe   | North America   | Asia Pacific   | South America,   Africa, Middle East   | Annual capacity  (metric tons)   |\n|----------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Ammonia              | \u25a0        | \u25a0               |                |                                        | 1,370,000                        |\n| Chlorine             | \u25a0        |                 |                |                                        | 595,000                          |\n| Urea                 | \u25a0        |                 |                |                                        | 545,000                          |\n| Isocyanates          | \u25a0        | \u25a0               | \u25a0              |                                        | 2,400,000                        |\n| Polyamides 6 and 6.6 | \u25a0        | \u25a0               | \u25a0              |                                        | 885,000                          |\n| Polyamide precursors | \u25a0        | \u25a0               | \u25a0              |                                        | 1,220,000                        |\n| Propylene oxide      | \u25a0        |                 |                |                                        | 675,000                          |\n| Sulfuric acid        | \u25a0        |                 |                |                                        | 920,000                          |\n\n- a All capacities are included at 100%, including plants belonging to joint operations and joint ventures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The film optimizes the aerodynamics on flow-related parts of the aircraft, meaning that less fuel is needed and CO2 emissions are reduced. Applying NovaFlex SharkSkin film to a Boeing 777-300 reduces the aerodynamic drag by more than 1%, saving 1,250 metric tons of CO2 per aircraft per year. Using the technology at its highest expansion level could reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 3%.\n\nFor more information on NovaFlex SharkSkin, see basf.com/sharkskin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Surface Technologies\n\nThe Surface Technologies segment comprises the Catalysts and Coatings divisions, which offer chemical solutions for surfaces.

The considerable earnings growth in the Coatings division, which resulted mainly from  price  and  volume-related  margin  increases,  more  than compensated for a considerable decrease in EBIT before special items in the Catalysts division. This was mainly a result of a sharp fall in lithium prices. In addition, lower contributions from precious metal trading reduced earnings in the division. Higher margins in the automotive and refining catalysts businesses could only partially offset this.\n\nEBIT declined by \u20ac247 million compared with the previous year to \u20ac366  million.

After discovering the virus, BASF quickly identified genetic sources of resistance and applied state-of-the-art breeding methods to be able to offer resistant and competitive varieties. The first resistant tomato varieties were made available under the Nunhems \u00ae brand in 2020 and BASF has since expanded the range to more than 20 varieties for different markets and consumer preferences. Using these resistant varieties in combination with appropriate hygiene protocols offers a solution that benefits both growers and the food supply chain.\n\nFor more information on ToBRFV-resistant seed varieties, see basf.com/en/rugose-virus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agricultural Solutions\n\nIn  the  Agricultural  Solutions  segment,  we  aim  to  further strengthen our market position as an integrated solutions provider.

This was mainly driven by both lower sales volumes, particularly of herbicides, and negative currency effects due to the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar. Considerably higher price levels had an offsetting effect.\n\n## Segment data - Agricultural Solutions\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                            | 2023   | 2022   | +/-    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sales to third parties                                                     | 10,092 | 10,280 | -1.8%  |\n| Intersegment transfers                                                     | 36     | 40     | -11.0% |\n| Sales including transfers                                                  | 10,128 | 10,320 | -1.9%  |\n| Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items | 2,270  | 1,928  | 17.7%  |\n| Income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)       | 2,177  | 1,922  | 13.2%  |\n| EBITDA margin before special items                                         | 22.5   | 18.8   | -      |\n| Depreciation and amortization a                                            | 1,046  | 701    | 49.2%  |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)                                              | 1,131  | 1,221  | -7.4%  |\n| Special items                                                              | -433   | 1      | .      |\n| EBIT before special items                                                  | 1,563  | 1,220  | 28.1%  |\n| Investments including acquisitions b                                       | 353    | 414    | -14.7% |\n| Segment cash flow                                                          | 1,746  | 179    | 875.6% |\n| Assets                                                                     | 16,089 | 17,071 | -5.7%  |\n| Return on capital employed (ROCE)                                          | 6.4    | 7.1    | -      |\n| Research and development expenses                                          | 900    | 944    | -4.6%  |\n\n- a Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including impairments and reversals of impairments)\n- b Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nIn Asia , sales of \u20ac1,072 million were \u20ac58 million lower than in the previous year.

        "page_content": "## Non-Integral Oil and Gas Business\n\nBASF holds 72.7% of the ordinary shares in Wintershall Dea AG; 27.3% are held by LetterOne.\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nThe price of a barrel of reference Brent crude oil averaged $82 in 2023 (2022: $101 per barrel). Gas prices on the European spot markets averaged \u20ac40.52 per MWh ($12.83 per mmBtu) for the year and were therefore considerably lower than the high gas prices in the previous year (\u20ac124.16 per MWh or $38.01 per mmBtu), which were influenced by the very tense situation on the European gas market due to the significant reduction in gas supplies from Russia to the E.U.\n\n## Equity-accounted income of the oil and gas business\n\nWintershall Dea AG contributed -\u20ac130 million to net income from shareholdings in 2023 (2022: -\u20ac4,853 million).  This included special items in the amount of -\u20ac164 million associated in particular with with the planned adjustment of the corporate structure. Impairment losses and reversals on the part of Wintershall Dea almost balanced each other out in 2023.\n\nIn  2022,  net  income  from  shareholdings  in  Wintershall  Dea including special items amounted to around -\u20ac6.3 billion. Those primarily resulted from impairments and reversals of impairments on Wintershall Dea's Russian assets and on its gas transportation business.\n\nBASF  received dividend payments of \u20ac291 million from Wintershall Dea in 2023. In the previous year, dividend payments from Wintershall Dea amounted to approximately \u20ac1 billion.\n\n- 1 Development activities include projects before and after the final investment decision.\n- 2 EBITDAX is defined as sales revenue and other income less production and operating expenses, less production-related taxes and less general administrative expenses, adjusted for special effects.\n\nWintershall Dea conducts production, development 1 and exploration activities in the following countries:\n\n- - Egypt (production, development, exploration)\n- - Algeria (production)\n- - Argentina (production, development)\n- - Denmark (production, exploration)\n- - Germany (production, development, exploration)\n- - Libya (production)\n- - Mexico (production, development, exploration)\n- - Netherlands (production, development, exploration)\n- - Norway (production, development, exploration)\n- - United Arab Emirates (development)\n- - United Kingdom (production, development, exploration)\n\nWintershall Dea  is  also  active  in  gas  transportation.  This includes interests in GASCADE  Gastransport  GmbH and OPAL Gastransport  GmbH  &  Co.  KG  held  by  WIGA  Transport Beteiligungs-GmbH & Co. KG, and the interest in Nord Stream AG held directly by Wintershall Dea AG.\n\n## Withdrawal from Russia\n\nOn January 17, 2023, Wintershall Dea announced its full exit from Russia in compliance with all legal requirements. In this context, Wintershall  Dea is implementing a legal separation of its Russiarelated business. This comprises the interest in the joint ventures in Russia, the shareholdings in Wintershall AG (51% interest) in Libya and Wintershall Noordzee BV (50% interest) in the Netherlands as well as the interest in Nord Stream AG (15.5% interest).\n\n## Agreement with Harbour Energy on the merger of businesses\n\nOn December 21, 2023, BASF, LetterOne and Harbour Energy plc (Harbour)  signed  an  agreement  to  combine  the  businesses  of Wintershall  Dea  and  Harbour.  Accordingly,  the  E&P  business of Wintershall Dea is to be transferred to Harbour; it comprises production and development assets as well as exploration rights in Norway,  Argentina,  Germany,  Mexico,  Algeria,  Libya  (excluding Wintershall  AG),  Egypt  and  Denmark  (excluding  Ravn),  and licenses from Wintershall Dea for carbon capture and storage (CCS). In exchange, the shareholders of Wintershall Dea will receive a total cash consideration of $2.15 billion (BASF interest: $1.56 billion) on completion of the transaction as well as new shares to be issued by Harbour, equating to a total 54.5% shareholding in the enlarged Harbour (BASF interest: 39.6%).  The agreed enterprise value for Wintershall Dea's assets amounts to $11.2 billion.  On completion of the transaction, Wintershall Dea's outstanding bonds with a nominal value of around $4.9 billion will be transferred to Harbour.\n\nIn 2022, the combined business had pro forma sales of $13.5 billion and  EBITDAX\u00b2  of  $10.3  billion.  Overall,  production  volumes  of Harbour and Wintershall Dea amounted to 526 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022. At the end of 2022, combined 2P reserves stood at 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent.\n\nUntil the completion of the transaction, Wintershall Dea and Harbour will continue to operate separately as independent companies. The transaction is subject to antitrust approvals and official approvals for foreign  investments,  among  other  things,  in  various  countries. Subject to these regulatory approvals, closing is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2024.",

        "page_content": "With this agreement, BASF is taking a major step toward achieving its announced strategic goal of exiting the oil and gas business. Completion of the transaction will create opportunities for BASF to monetize its shares in the combined company easily, as Harbour is listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nFurthermore, Wintershall Dea is working on the separate sale of its interest in WIGA  Transport  Beteiligungs-GmbH  &  Co  KG (WIGA), which is not part of the transaction.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nWintershall Dea's headquarters and its employees are not part of the transaction with Harbour. This means that, in addition to the restructuring initiated in September 2023, further restructuring and ultimately the closure of the headquarters in Kassel and Hamburg, which  currently  employ  around  850  people,  will  be  necessary. Harbour intends to transfer employees from these units to the combined company. Since signing, the parties have been working on further details regarding the transfer of employees in a joint integration committee. In 2023, Wintershall Dea already reduced its Management Board from five to three members. In 2023, Wintershall Dea recognized the necessary provisions for the implementation of the upcoming restructuring measures.\n\n## Wintershall Dea's activities in 2023\n\nWintershall Dea produced 118 million BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) in  2023  (2022:  117  million  excluding  Russia)  of  which  around 77  million BOE of gas (2022: 77 million excluding Russia). This corresponded  to  a  daily  production  of  323  thousand  BOE (2022: 321 thousand excluding Russia).\n\nSeveral Norwegian development projects were successfully started in 2023. Hyme and Bauge started production in April 2023; Dvalin started production in July 2023.\n\nIn Argentina, the development of the F\u00e9nix project is progressing as planned, the underwater pipeline has been laid and the construction of the production platform has been completed. Gas production is expected to begin in 2025.\n\nWintershall Dea drilled nine exploration wells in 2023, of which five were successful. The result of one well is still pending.\n\nIn February 2023, Wintershall  Dea, together with INEOS and the state-owned company Nords\u00f8fonden, was granted the Greensand carbon capture and storage (CCS) license C2023/01 (IRIS) in the Danish North Sea. By 2026, up to 1.5 million metric tons of CO2 per year are to be stored underground under this license.\n\nIn March 2023, Wintershall Dea was awarded its second operated CCS license in the Norwegian North Sea (Havstjerne). The storage facility is to be operated by Wintershall Dea, which holds 60% of the shares. The remaining shares of 40% are held by Stella Maris AS. The annual storage potential is estimated to be up to 7 million metric tons of CO2.\n\nIn March  2023, Wintershall Dea and its partners submitted the development plan for the Zama oil field in the Gulf of Mexico and the project was approved by the authorities in June. The field is expected to produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhich corresponds to around 10% of Mexico's current total oil production.\n\nAt  the  end  of  March  2023,  Wintershall  Dea  completed  the acquisition of the 37% interest in the producing Hokchi Block off the coast of Mexico. The Hokchi Block, operated by Hokchi Energy, a subsidiary  of  Pan  American  Energy,  currently  produces  around 24,000 BOE per day.\n\nIn April  2023, operator Wintershall Dea and its partners Harbour Energy and Sapura OMW discovered a significant oil deposit in the Kan prospect in Block 30, off the coast of Mexico. According to initial estimates,  the  deposit  is  approximately  equal  to  200 to 300 million BOE.\n\nIn August 2023, Wintershall Dea obtained the first CCS license in the United Kingdom. The expected annual storage potential of the Camelot license is up to 6 million metric tons of CO2. Furthermore, Wintershall  Dea received a 10% share in the Poseidon license (also in the United Kingdom) in November 2023.\n\nIn October  2023, Wintershall  Dea completed the acquisition of shares in the Algerian Reggane Nord gas project from its previous project  partner  Edison.  Wintershall  Dea  has  thus  increased  its participating interest to 24%.\n\nAlso in October 2023, Wintershall Dea and its partners started gas production in the Egyptian onshore block East Damanhur, following successful  exploration.  Gas  production  is  around  35  MMscf per day.\n\nWintershall  Dea was once again recognized as one of the best companies  in  the  industry  in  Morningstar  Sustainalytics'  ESG Risk  Rating  (2023  ESG  Risk  Rating:  25.6  -  medium  risk). Wintershall Dea's ESG risk management is rated as strong.",

This was primarily due to a sharp decline in sales in the Chemicals and Materials segments.  Sales  also  declined  significantly  in  the  Surface Technologies, Industrial Solutions and Nutrition  &  Care segments and  in  Other.  Conversely,  the  Agricultural  Solutions  segment recorded a considerable increase in sales.\n\nThe decline in sales in Europe was attributable in particular to lower volumes related to reduced demand in all segments. Considerably lower  prices,  mainly  in  the  Materials,  Chemicals  and  Surface Technologies segments, contributed to the decline in sales. Higher prices in the Agricultural Solutions segment and in the Coatings division had an offsetting effect. Negative currency effects in all segments and portfolio effects, especially in the Industrial Solutions segment, had a slightly negative impact on sales.\n\nSales at companies located in North America declined by 21.9% to \u20ac19,003 million compared with 2022. In local currency terms, they were 20.2% below the prior-year figure. This was mainly due to significantly  lower  sales  in  the  Surface  Technologies  segment. Chemicals, Materials, Other, Industrial Solutions and Nutrition & Care also recorded considerable declines in sales. In the Agricultural Solutions segment, sales decreased slightly.\n\nLower prices driven by raw materials costs in the Chemicals segment and lower precious metal prices in Surface Technologies were the main factors affecting sales performance in North America. In addition, lower sales volumes in all segments as a result of weak demand reduced sales. Currency effects had a slightly negative impact on sales. In addition, sales were reduced by slightly negative portfolio effects, especially in the Industrial Solutions segment following the sale of the kaolin minerals business as of September 30, 2022.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nSales at companies located in Asia Pacific declined by 19.6% compared with the previous year to \u20ac17,142 million. In local currency terms,  sales  declined  by  14.0%.  This  was  largely  due  to  a considerable decline in sales in the Surface Technologies segment. Sales  in  the  Materials,  Chemicals,  Industrial  Solutions  and Nutrition  &  Care  segments  were  also  significantly  below  the prior-year  figure.  In  the  Agricultural  Solutions  segment,  sales decreased slightly.\n\nThe sales performance was primarily the result of lower price levels, particularly in the Surface Technologies, Chemicals and Materials segments. In addition, currency effects dampened  sales performance. The decline in sales volumes was primarily driven by the  Catalysts  division  in  the  Surface  Technologies  segment.\n\nChemicals and Materials increased volumes slightly; the same was true for the Coatings and Nutrition  &  Health divisions. Portfolio effects, particularly in the Industrial Solutions segment, reduced sales slightly.\n\n## South America, Africa, Middle East\n\nSales at companies located in South America, Africa and the Middle East decreased by 7.6% in local currency terms and by 12.4% in euros to \u20ac5,126 million. Almost all segments recorded considerably lower sales. The Surface Technologies segment improved sales slightly.\n\nLower sales volumes overall and negative currency effects were the main reasons for the decline in sales in the region. Considerable volume growth in Surface Technologies was unable to offset the negative volume development in the other segments. Slightly lower prices overall also weighed down sales performance, despite the price increases in Agricultural Solutions and Surface Technologies.",

We see it as part of our corporate obligation to preserve the natural foundations of life for future generations. Our core business - production, processing and transportation of chemicals - therefore demands a responsible approach. Our aim is to minimize the impact we have on the environment along the entire value chain. This also includes protecting the climate and using increasingly scarce resources as efficiently as possible.\n\n## Our Management and Control Systems\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2, 3, 303, 403\n\nIn  order  to  minimize  negative  impacts  and  protect  the environment, a holistic approach and continuous monitoring are essential.

Our  Responsible  Care Management  System  comprises  the  global  directives, standards and procedures for environmental protection, health and safety.\n\n## Responsible Care Management System\n\nBASF is actively involved in the International Council of Chemical Associations' global Responsible Care \u00ae initiative. Our Responsible Care  Management  System  covers  the  environmental  protection, health and safety aspects that we have identified as material (for more information on  health  and  safety,  see  page  143  onward). Environmental protection is particularly relevant for the procurement and transportation of our raw materials, the production at our plants, activities at our sites and warehouses, as well as distribution of our products. The Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ)  unit  in the Corporate  Center  defines  Group-wide management and control systems and monitors compliance with internal requirements as well as legal regulations, while the sites and Group companies implement these requirements locally. Our global\n\nnetwork  enables  information  and  insights  to  be  shared  across the BASF Group on an ongoing basis.\n\nOur policies and requirements are continuously updated. This is why we also maintain dialog with government institutions, associations and international organizations. We set ourselves ambitious goals for environmental protection (see page 41). We regularly review our performance and progress with audits. In the 120 audits conducted in 2023, we took a risk-based approach. We assess the potential risks and weaknesses of all our major activities - from research and development to production and logistics - and the potential effects of these on the environment.

At the same time, we are working to significantly reduce our CO2 emissions 2 along the value chain. This creates opportunities for our business activities: Thanks to our transformation toward climate neutrality, we can increasingly offer our customers products with a reduced product carbon footprint (PCF).  However,  emissions  from  our  production,  our  energy procurement and our upstream and downstream value chain have a negative impact on the climate. Climate protection is therefore very\n\nimportant  to  us  and  is  an  important  part  of  our  corporate strategy. Climate scenarios are incorporated into the strategies of our business units. We continuously analyze short and long-term opportunities  and  risks  for  our  business  operations  arising  in connection with the topics of energy and climate protection as part of our opportunity and risk management (for more information, see page 182 onward).\n\nWe are pursuing ambitious climate protection targets . In addition to the targets for reducing our emissions from production processes (Scope  1) 1 and  the  purchase  of  energy  (Scope  2) 1 , we  set ourselves a target for reducing our specific raw materials-related emissions (Scope 3.1) 3 in the reporting year (see 'Global targets'). Based on increased transparency and data availability, we will be able to steer our upstream emissions, which make up the majority of our total emissions along the value chain, in a more targeted manner in the future. We have extended our long-term target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and are striving toward this target for Scope 3.1 in addition to Scope 1 and 2 (see page 104).\n\nTo reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and demand for fossil raw materials, we are focusing on the following measures:\n\n- -Renewable energy: We are increasingly meeting our electricity needs from renewable sources (see 'Energy supply').\n- -CO2 abatement: We are taking targeted measures to avoid CO2 emissions: These include lower-emission steam generation (see 'Energy supply'), the development of new technologies (see 'Climate-smart technologies') and continuous measures in the area of operational excellence (see 'Energy efficiency').\n- -Circularity: We are increasingly using renewable and recycled raw materials as well as raw materials based on the use of CO2 in order to move from linear value creation to closed material cycles (see 'Raw materials' from page 121 onward).\n- 1 Excluding the sale of energy to third parties.

We bundle measures to achieve our Scope 3.1 target 3 primarily in purchasing-specific measures (see box on 'Managing our emissions in the value chain,' page 106).\n\nBy adjusting our organizational structures , we have created the conditions for implementing our climate protection targets and the  measures  that  contribute  to  them  in  a  focused  and  swift manner: The Corporate Center's Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit, which reports to the Board of Executive  Directors,  develops  Group-wide  requirements  and guidelines  for  collecting  emissions  and  energy  data  and  for energy management. It conducts regular audits to monitor the implementation of and compliance with internal guidelines and legal requirements by our sites and Group companies. The Corporate Strategy & Sustainability unit develops the BASF Group's climate targets and strategic levers for achieving them.

The  Global Procurement  unit,  together  with  Corporate  Development,  is responsible for purchasing processes and procurement guidelines with regard to our raw materials-related targets. Global Procurement reports to the Chief Financial Officer; the Corporate Sustainability and Net Zero Accelerator units report to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors. This enables us to lay the foundation for integrating climate protection-relevant aspects  into  strategic decision-making processes such as investments, acquisitions and core business activities (see page 50). Group-wide Scope 1 and Scope  2  emissions  have  been  anchored  in  the  BASF  Group's steering  and  compensation  systems  as  the  most  important nonfinancial key performance indicator since 2020, giving them even more weight (see page 40).\n\nBy reducing our own CO2 emissions and those upstream in the value chain, we contribute to our customers achieving their climate protection targets. To increase transparency and target our CO2 reduction measures to those areas where they bring the greatest added  value,  we  continuously  determine  the  Product  Carbon Footprint  for  around  45,000  sales  products  (see  'Product Carbon Footprints'). In addition, we offer our customers solutions that help prevent greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy and resource efficiency.\n\nWe  are  committed  to  reporting  transparently  on  our  climate protection targets and progress, as well as on the impact of climate change on BASF. In this context, we support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Since  2019,  BASF's  annual  report  has  included  an  overview showing  the  sections  and  subsections  in  which  TCFD-relevant information can be found (see page 21). We also participate in the program established by the international nonprofit organization CDP for reporting on data relevant to climate protection and have done so  since  2004.

This corresponds to a decrease of around 60% compared with 1990. Our long-term goal is net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 1\n\nIn 2023, the BASF Group's emissions from production and energy purchases 1 amounted to 16.9 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2022: 18.4  million metric tons). The decline compared with the previous year as a result of a weak economy led to persistently low production volumes and therefore lower emissions in 2023. The share of electricity from renewable sources was increased compared with the previous year, to 20%, and, together with measures to increase energy and  process  efficiency, made  a  relevant contribution to reducing emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This increase  is  attributable  to  the  decline  in  production  and  the associated reduced use of raw materials in Europe.\n\nIn the long term, we strive to reduce Scope 3.1 emissions to an unavoidable minimum by 2050, thereby expanding our long-term net-zero target to include these greenhouse gas emissions. Despite all our efforts, there will be residual share of emissions in 2050 that cannot be avoided using technical or economic approaches. These emissions  must  be  offset  by  measurements  outside  our  value chains. One option is to sequester carbon into the soil through farming (carbon farming, see page 36).\n\n- For more information on climate protection, see page 29 Our projection of greenhouse gas emissions for 2024 can be found in the forecast from page 170 onward\n\n## Energy supply\n\nOur  total  energy  consumption  was  50.1  million  MWh  in  2023 (2022: 52.9 million MWh), slightly below the prior-year figure due to the lower production levels. Total energy consumption includes fuel demand in our own central power and steam generation plants, primary energy requirements in our process plants, and net power and steam imports.\n\nTo generate our own steam and power , we mainly use natural gas (78.8%) and substitute fuels (17.8%). The latter are residues from chemical production plants that cannot be reused in the BASF Verbund. In 2023, we covered 51% of our electricity demand with our own gas and steam turbines in highly efficient combined heat and power plants. Combined heat and power generation reduces the carbon footprint of our energy production and ensures that fuels are used as efficiently as possible: For instance, compared with separate methods of generating steam and electricity, we saved\n\n- 1 Scope 3.1, raw materials excluding battery materials, excluding services and technical goods, excluding greenhouse gas emissions from BASF trading business.

In 2023, internally generated power in the BASF Group had a carbon footprint of around 0.26 metric tons of CO2 per MWh of electricity and was below the national grid factor at most BASF sites.\n\nThe Verbund system is also key to carbon-optimized energy supply at our sites. It helps us realize synergies and manage value chains in a resource-efficient way. For example, waste heat from one plant's production process is used as energy in other plants. The Verbund saved us around 17.3  million MWh in 2023, which translates to 3.5 million metric tons less CO2 released into the atmosphere. 3 With combined power and steam generation as well as our continuously optimized Energy Verbund, we were thus able to avoid a total of 5.7  million  metric  tons  of  CO2  emissions  in  2023.  We  will continue  to  invest  in  the  creation  and  optimization  of  Verbund structures and drive forward the consolidation of production at highly efficient sites.",

        "page_content": "A core component in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is the gradual conversion of our energy supply from fossil to renewable sources . This  mainly  affects  our  electricity  supply.  In  2023, electricity from renewable sources as a share of total electricity consumption  rose  compared  with  the  previous  year  to  20% (2022: 17% 1 ). Our electricity consumption will increase significantly in the coming years due to the planned gradual electrification of our steam generation and the switch from natural gas-based to electricity-based, low-emission production processes, for example in our steam crackers (see page 107). Nevertheless, we aim to source more than 60% of our power needs from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nIn  the  transformation  of  our  power  supply,  we  are  pursuing  a make  &  buy approach.  Firstly,  BASF  is  investing  in  its  own renewable power assets. Secondly, we are purchasing green power on the market through long-term supply agreements with plant operators,  power  purchase  agreements  or  renewable  energy certificates,  depending  on  the  region  and  market  regulations. Profitability and additionality are key purchasing criteria: This means that  the  electricity  purchased  is  primarily  sourced  from  new renewable energy facilities.\n\nIn 2023, we successfully advanced our plan for a power supply from renewable sources. The Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm, a joint project with Vattenfall and Allianz, was officially inaugurated in fall 2023 and should be fully operational in 2024. With 139 turbines and a capacity of 1.5  gigawatts, it is one of the largest offshore wind  farms  in  the  world.  We  have  signed  a  memorandum  of understanding with Vattenfall for a shareholding in the wind farms Nordlicht 1 and 2 as part of a further project. It is envisaged that 49% of the shares will be sold to BASF. Construction is due to start in 2026, subject the final investment decision, expected in 2025. With a total capacity of 1.6  gigawatts, the wind farm should be completely operational in 2028. We plan to use just under half of the electricity  generated  to  supply  our  production  sites  in  Europe, particularly Ludwigshafen, Germany. In order to be able to fully\n\nsupply our Verbund site in Zhanjiang in Southern China, which is  currently  under  construction,  with  electricity  from  renewable sources in the future, we have entered into a joint venture with Mingyang  for  an  offshore  wind  farm  in  Southern  China,  which includes development, construction and operation. The planned wind farm in Zhanjiang in the province of Guangdong will have a capacity of 500 megawatts and is scheduled to go into operation in 2025, subject to approval. We have also extended our long-term supply contract with the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) and secured a supply of 1,000 gigawatt hours of green electricity per year from 2025. In 2023, we also concluded further long-term supply agreements for green power at other sites in Asia, such as the Verbund site in Nanjing, China, and our sites in South Korea. In North  America,  for  example,  we  were  able  to  secure  around 250 megawatts of solar generation capacity through virtual power\n\n- 1 The comparative figure for 2022 has been adjusted to reflect updated data.\n\n## Energy supply of the BASF Group 2023\n\n## Electricity supply a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steam supply\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a Conversion factor: 0.75 MWh per metric ton of steam\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fossil fuels and residual fuels used in the BASF Group's central power and steam generation plants\n\nNatural gas\n\n25.3 million MWh\n\n78.8%\n\nHeating oil 0.3 million MWh\n\n0.9%\n\nCoal\n\n0.8 million MWh\n\n2.5%\n\nSubstitute fuels\n\n5.7 million MWh\n\n17.8%\n\n32.1 million MWh\n\nTotal:\n\npurchase agreements in 2022.

In  some  regions,  we  have  also acquired green power certificates. The aim is to gradually replace these temporary measures with our own power assets or long-term supply agreements.\n\nThe carbon footprint of purchased electricity in 2023 was around 0.22 metric tons of CO2 per MWh (market-based approach), slightly below the prior-year level (2022: 0.23 metric tons CO2 per MWh).\u00b9",

        "page_content": "## Good to know\n\n## Managing our emissions in the value chain\n\nReducing Scope 3 emissions presents us with particular challenges, as these are only partly within our own direct sphere of influence and are subject to a large number of external factors. In recent years, we have been able to considerably increase the data availability and thereby transparency of our Scope 3.1 emissions. With our new target and dedicated measures, we want to control upstream emissions in a more targeted manner in the future.\n\nWe launched the Supplier CO2 Management Program in 2021 to achieve transparency regarding these emissions. The goal is to obtain a more accurate data base and better manage and reduce emissions in the supply chain. In a first step, we have requested the Product Carbon Footprints of our raw materials since 2021 and support our suppliers in determining these, for example, by sharing our knowledge of valuation and calculation methods with them. Since the start of the program, we have asked more than 1,600 suppliers, covering around 70% of our raw materials-related greenhouse gas emissions. After around two years, we have more than 800 validated Product Carbon Footprints  for  our  raw  materials.  In  a  second  step,  we  will now work with our suppliers on solutions to reduce productrelated emissions. To this end, we are building up a team of experts in our procurement  organization, supported  by\n\ninterdisciplinary experts from the operating divisions and the Net Zero Accelerator unit.\n\nWe are also further developing our purchasing processes and establishing the Product Carbon Footprint as a relevant criterion for raw materials in the purchasing guidelines. In addition to reducing our raw materials-related emissions (Scope 3.1), we are taking targeted measures to reduce Scope 3 emissions along the entire value chain. In order to reduce emissions from the use of sold products (Scope 3.11), for example, we rely on product adaptations: For example, climate-damaging blowing agents for foaming polyurethane foams can now be largely dispensed with in the downstream value chain. We also want to reduce emissions resulting from the disposal of our products (Scope 3.12). This is possible, for example, through the increased use of renewable raw materials (see page 122) or circular solutions (see page 46). Both ensure that less and less CO2  pollutes the atmosphere throughout the life cycle of our products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, we built a stationary long-term sodium sulfur-based storage system (NAS \u00ae ) at our Schwarzheide site in Germany. It supports the power supply of individual systems via the plant's own solar park. Together with NGK Insulators Ltd., BASF Stationary Energy Storage GmbH makes NAS batteries and develops them further.\n\nAlongside electricity, steam generation is an important component of our energy supply. In the future, new technologies should make a significant contribution to reducing CO2, for example by recovering energy from the waste heat of our production and infrastructure facilities. In this context, we are examining various concepts such as using electric heat pumps and e-boilers as well as electrifying steam drives.\n\n## Climate-smart technologies\n\nTo  further  reduce  CO2  emissions,  we  are  also  developing completely new technologies for emission-free and low-emission production.  They  will  need  large  volumes  of  electricity  from renewable sources in order to realize their full potential. The main focus here is on basic chemicals, which are often still emissionsintensive to produce. This applies, for example, to steam crackers, which use high levels of energy to break down crude petroleum into olefins and aromatics. We made significant progress here in 2023 with the construction of a demonstration plant for electrically heated steam cracker furnaces (see box on page 107). Another important basic material in the chemical industry is hydrogen, which we have so far mainly used as a raw material. One common but emissionsintensive way of obtaining hydrogen is steam reforming. We are already testing an alternative process - methane pyrolysis - in Ludwigshafen, Germany. This process is virtually emission-free if renewable energy is used and requires considerably less electricity compared  with  other  methods,  such  as  water  electrolysis.  We successfully  tested  a  new  reactor  concept  at  the  pilot  plant, which  went  into  operation  in  2021,  thus  overcoming  the  first important  technical  hurdle  for  further  scaling.  Furthermore,  we started  construction  of  a  PEM  (proton  exchange  membrane)",

They split petroleum into olefins and aromatics - both important groups  of  substances  for  numerous  chemical  value  chains. The  cracking  reaction  requires  high  temperatures  of  around 850 degrees Celsius, which until now have been achieved by burning natural gas.\n\nHeating concepts that use electricity from renewable sources could reduce process-related emissions by at least 90% in the future. We want to test the feasibility of this new process, as well as direct and indirect heating concepts together with our partners SABIC and Linde in a demonstration plant. 1 At the beginning of 2024  this  plant  was  completed  at  our  Ludwigshafen  site  in Germany  and  has  since  then  been  gradually  being  put  into operation. The prototype is completely integrated into one of the two existing steam crackers at the site.\n\nwater  electrolyzer 2 with  a  capacity  of  54  megawatts  at  the Ludwigshafen  site  in  Germany  with  Siemens  Energy  in  2023. Powered by electricity from renewable energy, the plant, which will  go  into  operation  in  2025,  is  expected  to  produce  up  to 8,000  metric  tons  of  emission-free  hydrogen  and  thus  reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the site by up to 72,000 metric tons per year. BASF will primarily use the hydrogen produced as a raw material for the manufacture of products with a reduced carbon\n\nfootprint. In addition, we expect new hydrogen applications in the future, such as energy use, and thus a trend toward increasing demand for hydrogen. Access to large quantities of low-emission or emission-free hydrogen at competitive prices is therefore becoming increasingly important for BASF.\n\nAnother focus area of our technological development is carbon capture and storage (CCS). For example, we are currently part of an industrial CCS project at the Antwerp site in Belgium (Kairos@C) as the first phase of the Antwerp@C project, which could enable BASF to avoid the emission of up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year from production. Together with Yara, we are also evaluating the development and construction of a world-scale production plant for low-emission blue ammonia using CCS in the United  States.  Approximately  95%  of  the  CO2  generated  from the production process is to be captured and permanently stored in the ground.\n\n## Energy efficiency and specific greenhouse gas emissions\n\nEnergy use and greenhouse gas emissions are closely linked to capacity utilization at our plants and its product portfolio. Specific greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 amounted to 0.584 metric tons of CO2 equivalents per metric ton of sales product, 3 an increase of 1.2% compared with the previous year (2022: 0.577 metric tons). This was mainly due to persistently lower and inconsistent capacity utilization at our plants, which resulted in a decline in plant efficiency. In contrast, the use of renewable power had a positive impact on specific greenhouse gas emissions. Since 1990, we have been able to lower our overall greenhouse gas emissions from BASF operations by  57.8%  and  even  reduce  specific  emissions  (per metric ton of sales product) by 74.5%.\n\nThrough our operational excellence projects, we aim to make our plants and processes even more efficient and resource saving,\n\n- 1 The project has been granted \u20ac14.8 million from Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) under the Decarbonization in Industry funding program. This project is also being financed by the European Union via the NextGenerationEU fund.\n- 2 The project is funded by the BMWK and the Federal State of Rhineland-Palatinate.\n- 3 Sales product volumes include sales between BASF Group companies; merchandise is not taken into account.\n- 4 Relevant sites are selected based on the amount of primary energy used and local energy prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthereby  avoiding  CO2  emissions.  Certified  energy  management systems according to DIN EN ISO 50001 at all relevant production sites 4 play  a  particularly  important  role  here.  These  help  us  to identify and implement further potential for improvement in energy efficiency.  This  not  only  reduces  greenhouse  gas  emissions and  saves  valuable  energy  resources  but  also  increases  our competitiveness.  In  2023,  78  production  sites  worldwide  had certified energy management systems, representing around 89% of our primary energy demand.\n\nA global working group provides ongoing support to the sites and Group companies in implementing and maintaining certified energy management systems. All energy efficiency measures are recorded in a global database, analyzed and made available to BASF sites as examples of best practices.\n\nIn  2023,  we  implemented  more  than  500  measures  to  reduce energy and resource consumption and increase our competitiveness. In our steam cracker in Ludwigshafen, Germany, for example, we were  able  to  monitor  and  analyze  energy  consumption  more specifically by introducing a digital tool for energy optimization, thereby further optimizing the energy efficiency of the crude gas compression process and cracking furnaces. This enables us to avoid more than 15,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year. At a plant in Freeport,  Texas,  an  optimized  control  system  increased  process efficiency while reducing the power consumption of the compressors. This led to an annual reduction of more than 6,000 metric tons of CO2. In Caojing, China, we can reduce annual emissions by more than 25,000  metric tons of CO2 by harnessing reaction heat through process adjustments and the integration of an absorption heat pump for steam generation.",

This reports on all emissions along the value chain - from raw materials extraction to production and disposal. We are continually working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions both in our own production and, together with our partners, along the value chain (see 'Strategy and governance').\n\nIn 2023,  our  greenhouse  gas  emissions  according  to  the Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol,  including Scope  1  and  Scope  2 emissions \u00b9 were 17.851 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2022: 19.149 million metric tons\u00b2). Of this amount, 87% were Scope 1 emissions (2022: 87%\u00b2) and 13% were Scope 2 emissions (2022: 13%\u00b2). Carbon dioxide was by far the largest component and accounted for 98% of emissions (2022: 98%).\n\nScope  3  emissions arising  upstream  and  downstream  of  our operations in the value chain are calculated in accordance with the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard  published  by  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol  and the WBCSD Guidance for Accounting and Reporting Corporate GHG Emissions in the Chemical Sector Value Chain (WBCSD Chemicals).

These Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) include all greenhouse gas emissions - from raw materials extraction to the finished product leaving the factory gates ('cradle-to-gate'). PCFs provide us with important  information  for  assessing  the  climate  impact  of  our products and guidance for implementing mitigation measures so that our customers can benefit from reduced CO2 emissions in the value chain.\n\nIn 2023, we further expanded our portfolio of products with a certified reduced carbon footprint, including engineering plastics. We already offer some of our products, such as the intermediates neopentyl  glycol  and  propionic  acid,  the  isocyanates  MDI  and Lupranat \u00ae , the amino resin Kaurit \u00ae and the adhesive raw material acResin \u00ae with  a  net-zero  carbon  footprint.  These  lower  PCFs are  primarily  made  possible  by  the  substitution  of  fossil  raw materials. For instance, we use electricity from renewable sources instead of electricity from fossil fuels to produce low-PCF and zero-PCF products . We also use - in whole or in part - renewable, waste-based  or  recycled  raw  materials  such  as  castor  oil, biomethane or pyrolysis oil from plastic waste. These alternative resources often have a better carbon footprint compared with fossil raw materials. The alternative resources are allocated to the end product using the mass balance approach (see box on page 124).\n\nThe digital methodology we have developed to calculate PCFs meets general life cycle analysis standards such as ISO 14040, ISO 14044 and ISO 14067, as well as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Product  Standard.

This includes reducing emissions to air, preventing waste and protecting the soil by operating our plants safely and efficiently and using resources responsibly. We are also developing product solutions for our customers that can reduce emissions and waste.\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nOur product solutions, such as catalysts and additives, contribute to  reducing  pollutants  in  the  air  and  reducing  waste.  What's more, the implementation of circular models offers us business opportunities.  However,  emissions  to  air  and  waste  from  our production processes along with existing contaminated sites can have a negative impact on the environment. We systematically record opportunities and risks arising from emissions to air, waste and contaminated sites as part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 182 onward).\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of our plants and the responsible management of resources and waste are core elements of our Responsible  Care  Management  System.  We  have  defined  our global standards for emissions to air, waste and contaminated sites in Group-wide requirements, the implementation of which is the responsibility of the sites and Group companies.

BASF's  global  network  of experts  shares  information,  insights  and  best  practices  on  an ongoing  basis.  Continuous  monitoring  and  documentation  of atmospheric emissions, waste streams and contaminated sites as well  as  the  implementation  of  measures  for  improvement  are an integral part of our environmental management. In addition to greenhouse gases (see page 102 onward), other air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and ammonia are emitted as a result of power generation  and  production.  We  evaluate  and  analyze  these emissions and reduce them using emission control technologies.\n\nThrough targeted waste management , we want to keep material consumption and disposal volumes to a minimum by systematically tracking our material flows and following a clear hierarchy: We aim to avoid waste as far as possible, for example, by continuously optimizing our processes or developing new production methods. This  is  where  our  Verbund  structure  with  its  networked  plants and value chains comes in: The by-products of one plant serve as feedstock elsewhere in the BASF Verbund, avoiding waste and enabling us to use raw materials as efficiently as possible. If these cannot be used within the Verbund structures, we assess whether they can be recycled or thermally recovered. We have established processes for the safe, proper and environmentally responsible disposal of materials that we cannot recycle or where recycling is not legally permitted. If we use external waste disposal companies, we  conduct  regular  audits  to  verify  that  waste  is  disposed  of properly. In this way, we also contribute to soil protection and keep today's waste from becoming tomorrow's contamination.

Of this, 53.7% was disposed of (2022: 52.6%). Hazardous waste accounted for 74.4% of the total disposed  waste  (2022:  75.2%).  Based  on  the  concept  of  the circular  economy,  we  are  continuously  examining  options  for recycling or thermal recovery for all waste. In this way, we were able to find new uses for 46.3% of our waste in 2023 (2022: 47.4%). We  continuously  identify  and  evaluate  the  safest  and  most environmentally  sound  disposal  routes  for  nonrecyclable  waste. In 2023, most of our hazardous waste was incinerated (72.3%), where possible with energy recovery. 9.9% of hazardous waste was disposed of in landfill.

It is used as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent, and to make our products. Waterways are used to transport goods. At the same time, water is a scarce commodity in an increasing number of regions. That is why we promote the responsible use of this resource with sustainable water management.\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nAs  a  manufacturing  company,  we  need  water  for  production. In order to use water as efficiently as possible, we are building on intelligent cooling water systems, increased reuse and multimodal transportation concepts with combined transportation methods. A lack of water presents a risk for us. Our demand for water, the volume of wastewater we generate and the associated emissions to water can have an impact on the environment. We systematically record the short and long-term opportunities and risks that arise from water as part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 178 onward).\n\nThe responsible use of water as a resource is a core element of our Responsible Care Management System and an important part of our commitment to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is also reflected in our position paper on water protection, which we published in 2021.\n\nOur  global  standards  and  provisions  for  water  are  defined  in Group-wide requirements. Among other things, these stipulate that\n\n## This page:\n\nAt our Verbund site in Kuantan, Malaysia, we are aiming to reduce our demand for water by 50% by 2030 compared with 2022. In the site-specific initiative to save and recycle water, we are focusing on increasing the reuse of wastewater, condensate and collected rainwater.\n\n## 2030 target\n\nIntroduction of sustainable water management at our production sites in water stress areas and at our Verbund sites\n\nwater protection concepts must be implemented at all production sites. The requirements also cover aspects such as process and transportation safety (see pages 127 and 130) in order to prevent production and transportation-related product spillages into water bodies as far as possible. Our sites and Group companies are responsible  for  implementing  and  complying  with  internal  and legal requirements. This is regularly audited by the Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center.  BASF's  global  network  of  experts  shares  information, insights and best practices around the responsible use of water on an ongoing basis.\n\nIntroducing and implementing sustainable water management has been a cornerstone of our strategy for many years now. Our focus here is on our Verbund sites and on production sites in water stress areas. 1 We look at water availability, water quality and the impact of our water use on the environment and other users. For this, we use  the  standard  of  the  Alliance  for  Water  Stewardship  (AWS)\n\n- 1 We define water stress areas as regions in which more than 40% of available water is used by industry, households and agriculture. Our definition is based on the Water Risk Atlas (Aqueduct 3.0) published by the World Resources Institute. For more information, see wri.org/aqueduct.\n\n<!-- image -->",

AWS is a global multistakeholder organization that promotes the responsible use of water, which we are a member of.\n\nIn the wake of advancing climate change, the resulting water shortages and  extreme  weather  events, climate  resilience  measures are becoming increasingly important. We have established early-warning systems for the Ludwigshafen site in Germany in order to secure our supply of raw materials and transportation via water and developed  a special type of ship for extremely low water levels. In 2023, we were able to inaugurate a tanker and a ship for transporting specialty chemicals, which are optimized for low water levels and are for the exclusive use of BASF. Further measures at our sites are aimed at reducing our demand for water, for example, through recycling and intelligent cooling water systems.\n\n- For more information on our risk management, see page 178 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engagement in the value chain\n\nWe advocate the responsible use of water as a resource along the entire value chain. We audit supplier compliance with environmental standards in our regular supplier assessments (see page 159). Where improvement is necessary, we support suppliers in developing and implementing appropriate measures, such as the correct handling of wastewater. In addition, we are involved in a wide range of initiatives to promote sustainability in the supply chain. For example, efficient water use is a core part of the Pragati project to improve sustainability in castor bean farming (see page 123).\n\nWe work with numerous partners along the value chain and from civil society to protect water as a resource. In addition to the Alliance for Water Stewardship, we are involved in networks such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) and Operation Clean Sweep \u00ae to prevent waste from plastic production from entering water bodies.\n\nWe offer our customers solutions that help purify water and use it  more  efficiently  and  minimize  pollution.  These  include  high-\n\nperformance plastics to produce ultrafiltration membranes, intermediates to produce flocculants for water treatment, or seeds with higher drought and heat tolerance.\n\nWe  report  transparently  and  comprehensively  on  how  we  use water. For instance, in 2023, we again participated in the program established by the nonprofit organization CDP for reporting on data relevant to climate protection, on the topic of water. BASF again achieved leadership status with an A- rating in the final assessment. CDP evaluates how transparently companies report on their water management activities and how they reduce risks such as water scarcity.  The  assessment  also  considers  the  extent  to  which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' With our sustainable water management, we cover around 90% of BASF's water abstraction.\n\n## Dr. Andrea St\u00f6gbauer\n\nproduct developments can also contribute to sustainable water management at the customers of the evaluated companies.\n\n- For more information on our position paper on water protection, see basf.com/water\n\nFor more information on the CDP water questionnaire, see basf.com/en/cdp\n\n## Global target and measures\n\nOur goal is to introduce sustainable water management at our Verbund sites and at all production sites in water stress areas by 2030, covering around 90% of BASF's total water abstraction. We achieved 70% of our target in 2023 (2022: 62%). 1 Sustainable water\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmanagement  was  introduced  at  seven  further  sites  in  2023 (2022: seven sites).\n\nAs  part  of  sustainable  water  management,  our  sites  regularly assess  the  water  situation  in  the  catchment  area.  This  raises awareness of potential risks and impacts such as water scarcity for the population. Based on the assessments conducted until the end of 2023, we did not identify a significant impact on water availability and quality resulting from our activities at any site.\n\nAnother important part of our sustainable water management is the  continuous  analysis  and  implementation  of  measures  for improvement. For example, process optimizations such as the use of modified valves or the recycling of low-temperature cooling water at the General Lagos site in Argentina are leading to water savings of 15%. At our Verbund site in Freeport, Texas, we commissioned a membrane bioreactor for treating wastewater in 2023, which improved  the  capacity  and  performance  of  the  wastewater treatment  plant.  In  the  future,  the  treated  wastewater  is  to  be recycled, thereby reducing the need for freshwater. Depending on the local situation, we also implement measures together with other stakeholders. One example is the Lake Winnipeg Basin project in the Canadian province of Manitoba, where we are working with project partners to analyze the benefits of water management for the environment, farmers and other stakeholders.\n\n## Water balance\n\nOur water abstraction totaled 1,518 million cubic meters in 2023 (2022: 1,590 million cubic meters). This demand was covered for the most part by freshwater such as rivers and lakes (88% of total water abstraction). At some sites, we use alternative sources such as treated municipal wastewater, brackish water or seawater. A small part of the water we use reaches our sites as part of raw materials and steam, or is released in our production processes. We abstract most of the water we need for cooling and production",

In 2023, 5% of our total water demand was covered by third parties (2022: 5%).\n\nWater  use in 2023  totaled 6,722 million cubic meters (2022: 6,917  million cubic meters). Put in relation to total water abstraction, this means that we use every liter we abstract around four times, or cover 79% of our water demand with reuse. We predominantly use water for cooling purposes (88% of total water abstraction), after which we discharge it back to our supply sources with  no  product  contact.  We  reduce  our  water  abstraction  for cooling purposes mainly by using recooling plants. Around 12% of our total water abstraction is used in production plants, for example, for extraction or dissolution processes or for cleaning. Here, too, we reduce our demand for water by reusing wastewater. Most of the water used for production purposes is discharged back to water bodies after being treated in our own or third-party wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThe  BASF  Group's water  consumption describes  the  amount of water that is not discharged back into a water body, meaning that it is no longer available to other users. Consumption is mainly attributable  to  the  evaporation  of  water  in  recirculating  cooling systems. A smaller amount is from the water contained in our products.  Water  consumption  in  2023  amounted  to  around 67 million cubic meters (2022: 69 million cubic meters).\n\n## Water balance in the BASF Group 2023\n\nMillion cubic meters per year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Abstraction / supply                       |       | Discharge                                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Of which in water stress areas: 1% 1,518 a |       | Of which cooling water: 1,204 Of which wastewater from production: b  148 1,352 a |\n| Surface water / freshwater                 | 1,249 | Surface water / freshwater  1,179                                                 |\n| Brackish water / seawater                  | 168   | Brackish water / seawater 156                                                     |\n| Groundwater                                | 74    | Groundwater  1                                                                    |\n| Drinking water                             | 20    | External treatment plant 16                                                       |\n| Reusable wastewater from third parties     | 3     | Consumption                                                                       |\n| Water from raw materials                   | 5     | 67 a                                                                              |\n|                                            |       | Of which in water stress areas: 15%                                               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a The difference between water abstraction and discharge is due to water consumption and limited measurement accuracy in water discharge.\n- b Total from production processes, sanitary facilities, rinsing and cleaning in production\n\nGroup as a whole. Cooling water is rarely used for once-through cooling here. Instead, it is generally recirculated to reduce water demand. Production wastewater in water stress areas is primarily treated at third-party facilities.\n\nIn 2023, around 25% of our production sites were located in water stress areas (2022: 25%). These sites accounted for 1% of BASF's total  water  abstraction  (2022:  1% 1 ).  In  water  stress  areas,  we mainly source water from third parties (79%) and largely cover our demand with freshwater. Water consumption in water stress areas accounted for 15% of BASF's total water consumption in 2023 (2022: 17%) and was primarily attributable to evaporation in cooling processes. Wastewater in water stress areas accounted for less than 1% of BASF's total wastewater. The share of wastewater from cooling processes in water stress areas is lower than for the BASF\n\n- 1 Aqueduct 3.0 was used to identify sites in water stress areas to determine pro rata water abstraction and water consumption.\n\nThe supply, treatment, transportation and recooling of water is often associated with a high energy demand.

Both  internal  audits  and  the responsible local authorities regularly assess whether the analyses and safety precautions at our sites comply with internal and legal requirements. A total of 1,352 million cubic meters of water were discharged from BASF production sites in 2023 (2022: 1,400 million cubic meters). Including 148  million cubic meters of wastewater from  production.  Emissions  of  nitrogen  to  water  amounted  to 2,100  metric  tons  in  2023  (2022:  2,400  metric  tons 1 ).  Around 8,800 metric tons of organic substances were emitted in wastewater (2022: 10,600 metric tons). Our wastewater contained 13 metric tons of heavy metals (2022: 15 metric tons 1 ). Phosphorus emissions amounted to 220 metric tons (2022: 230 metric tons\u00b9).\n\nOur approach is to reduce wastewater volumes and contaminant loads at the source in our production processes and to reuse wastewater and material flows internally as far as possible. To treat wastewater, we use both central measures in wastewater treatment plants  and  the  selective  pretreatment  of  individual  wastewater streams before these are sent to the wastewater treatment plant. We use different methods depending on the type and degree of contamination - including biological processes, chemical oxidation, membrane technologies, precipitation or adsorption. In order to avoid unanticipated emissions and the pollution of surface water or  groundwater,  we  have  water  protection  concepts  for  our production  sites  in  place.  This  is  mandatory  for  all  production sites  as  part  of  our  Responsible  Care  Management  System (see page 131). The wastewater protection plans involve evaluating wastewater in terms of risk and drawing up suitable monitoring approaches. We use audits to check that these measures are being implemented and complied with.\n\nFor more information, see basf.com/water\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a chemical company, we use many valuable resources provided by nature such as water, air and soil. At the same time, our business activities have an impact on nature, through emissions into the environment or the purchase of renewable raw materials. Protecting biodiversity is therefore a key element of our commitment to climate protection and sustainability. We want to contribute to achieving the global goal to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nTo better understand BASF's impact on nature, we are guided by the five drivers of biodiversity loss defined by the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES): land-use change , pollution , climate change , overexploitation and invasive species . We do not consider the latter to be material for BASF.\n\nWe achieve positive effects on biodiversity primarily through the responsible use of natural resources and through our solutions and technologies,  such  as  biodegradable  plastics  and  chemical recycling, which help reduce waste, for example. Negative impacts might arise in our supply chain through our production activities and through the use of our products. We record opportunities and risks resulting  from  the  loss  of  biodiversity  as  part  of  our  general opportunity and risk management.\n\nWith specific measures along our entire value chain, we minimize the loss and strengthen the preservation of biodiversity. Our sustainabilityrelated corporate goals for climate protection (see page 102), circular\n\n## This page:\n\nBASF is working with farms in the United Kingdom to show how agricultural use and the protection of biodiversity can be reconciled. Planting wildflower strips and creating habitats for birds and insects have led to a long-term improvement in biodiversity and soil health.\n\neconomy  (see  page  46),  water  management  (see  page  112), responsible management of emissions, waste and remediation (see page 110) as well as the procurement of renewable raw materials (see page 122) contribute to the protection of biodiversity.\n\nThe United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity, with the new Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), serves as an important orientation and reference framework for BASF. It aims to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030. We also align with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Life below water (SDG 14) and Life on land (SDG 15).\n\nBiodiversity is an important aspect for many of our stakeholders, such as investors, customers, legislators, suppliers, insurers and nongovernmental organizations. We actively seek out partnerships with  relevant  interest  groups  and  organizations  worldwide,  for example in the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD),  to  expand  our  knowledge,  to  raise  awareness  about biodiversity and to drive necessary actions forward (see page 140).\n\nWe align our biodiversity measures with the impact of our business activities along the value chain. Our focus here is on three areas: supply chains, sites and production, and product impacts. For this purpose, we are guided by the risk mitigation hierarchy: We try to avoid having an impact on nature. If this is not feasible, we want to reduce these impacts, support the restoration of nature or contribute to the transformation of value chains toward better environmental sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Material topics in focus: Biodiversity and Ecosystems\n\nCurrently, there is no standardized, globally accepted indicator for the loss of biodiversity (in contrast to greenhouse gas emissions as a key indicator of climate change). In addition, impacts must be considered primarily in a local context. We therefore use indicators such as nitrogen emissions to water to measure drivers of biodiversity loss and species occurrence to assess the status of ecosystems. For example, we regularly  examine  the  fish  population  in  the  Rhine  around  the Ludwigshafen site using electrofishing. With this method, the animals are temporarily stunned with a weak electric field for documentation purposes and removed with a fishing net before being returned to the water. In 2023, species diversity was found to be the same as in 2021.\n\nWe use various methods to measure our sustainability performance that implicitly and explicitly consider relevant opportunities and risks for biodiversity. Examples of this include the BASF Eco-Efficiency Analysis  as  well  as  AgBalance \u00ae in  the  context  of  agricultural products and the corresponding biodiversity calculator.\n\nNewly developed assessment methods help us to better understand influences on biodiversity. We regularly test various analysis tools available on the market. Taking into account the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) methodology developed by TNFD, we are systematizing our existing strategic approach. Based on this understanding, we seek dialog with partners and enter into strategic cooperations, through which we drive forward measures to protect biodiversity around the world (e.g., Wildlife Habitat Council).\n\nAn  internal  working  group  addresses  strategic  aspects  and  the identification  of  impacts,  dependencies,  opportunities  and  risks arising from biodiversity. In 2023, for instance, a survey of BASF's divisions was conducted on the importance of biodiversity aspects and their perceived economic relevance. This revealed significant differences: High importance and economic relevance are particularly evident in units nits that provide solutions for agriculture or source renewable raw materials. Another result of this working group was the establishment of the new Nature Advisory Council (see box).\n\n## Responsibility to our sites and production\n\nOur risk management regularly examines the risks to our business activities  from  the  loss  of  biodiversity.  Moreover,  when  making decisions  about  investing  in  the  construction  of  new  sites  or expanding existing ones, we conduct systematic assessments of sustainability aspects, such as the potential impact on forests and biodiversity.\n\nWe use the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter, a tool developed by the World  Wide  Fund  for  Nature  (WWF)  and  partners  with  global coverage of sites and value chains, to identify dependencies on ecosystem services (e.g., risk of water availability) and assess the impact of biodiversity loss on our business in addition to the impact of our activities on ecosystems (e.g., risk of environmental pollution).\n\nWhen  managing  our  sites  and  plants,  we  aim  to  ensure  the preservation of biodiversity by minimizing negative impacts on the environment (biodiversity loss drivers: pollution, overexploitation). We therefore keep emissions from our production to air, water and soil  as  low  as  possible,  avoid  and  reduce  waste  and  manage contaminated  sites  carefully  (see  page  110  onward).  BASF  is committed  to  the  goals  of  Operation  Clean  Sweep \u00ae and  is constantly working on measures to prevent plastic production waste from entering the environment. We use databases such as the Integrated  Biodiversity  Assessment  Tool  (IBAT)  to  examine  the proximity of production sites to internationally recognized protected areas . We have been documenting the results in our environmental database  since  2021.  This  allows  us  to  raise  awareness  of biodiversity  at  a  local  level,  assess  and,  if  necessary,  reduce potential impacts of our sites on these areas. In 2023, 5% of our production sites were adjacent to a Ramsar site 1 and 1% were adjacent to a category I, II or III protected area as defined by the International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature. 2 None  of  our production sites were adjacent to a UNESCO protected area. In addition, we used the STAR tool (Species, Threat, Abatement and\n\n- 1 'Wetlands of international importance' in accordance with the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention)\n- 2 We have defined 'adjacent' as the area within a 3 km radius.\n\n## Good to know\n\n## New Nature Advisory Council\n\nIn 2023, BASF founded a new advisory council for topics related to the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, the Nature Advisory Council (NAC), to obtain an independent societal perspective on our activities related to nature and biodiversity issues.\n\nThe  aim  is  to  obtain  constructive  feedback  and  specific  advice  on nature-related  topics  and  our  strategic  approach  as  well  as  our contributions to a sustainable future.\n\nThe Nature Advisory Council is currently made up of four members from the fields of science, relevant value chains and multilateral organizations. The NAC met for the first time in November 2023 and discussed BASF's approach  to  sustainability  and  the  necessary  adjustments  around planetary boundaries and the biodiversity crisis using concrete examples from corporate practice, such as the extraction of important raw materials and BASF's activities in the field of agriculture. Future meetings will address other important drivers of biodiversity loss and how they relate to BASF's strategy.\n\nFor more information on our Nature Advisory Council, see basf.com/en/nature-advisory-council\n\nRestoration), based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, to analyze how many of our production sites are located adjacent to endangered  species  (amphibians,  birds,  mammals).  The  results show that some of our production sites are located in areas with high or very high STAR values. We took a closer look at the drivers at these locations (e.g., tourism, fishing, invasive species or the occurrence  of  diseases).  These  were  generally  not  related  to chemical production.\n\nWe are implementing local measures to protect biodiversity at a number of sites.

Fallow land  and  an  orchard  were  planted,  nesting  boxes  were  built for swallows  and  animal  and  plant  species  were  regularly counted and monitored. The site has been certified by the local nongovernmental organization CPIE (Centre Permanent d'Initiative pour  l'Environnement)  for  its  measures  to  protect  biodiversity. It serves as a reference site for BASF in France. Furthermore, we use recooling plants at our sites. This allows us to reuse water several times as cooling water and reduce our water consumption. Recooling  also  reduces  thermal  emissions  when  we  return  the cooling water to the waterways. This ensures that our activities have a minimal impact on the habitats of plants and animals. We are constantly working to optimize our energy consumption and the amount of water we use, and to adapt to the needs of our business and the environment (see page 112).\n\nWe  are  committed  to  complying  with  the  provisions  of  the international Nagoya Protocol when using biological resources. This supplementary agreement to the U.N.'s Convention on Biological Diversity regulates access to genetic resources and benefit sharing. It sets out obligations (for example, compensation payments) for the users  of  genetic  resources  such  as  plant based  raw  materials. We use internal control mechanisms to monitor compliance with these standards.\n\n## Management of our product impact\n\nBASF offers products and solutions for a wide range of industries. We  want  to  ensure  that  our  products  meet  our  customers' standards in terms of quality and, through appropriate use, pose no risk to humans, animals or the environment (see page 146). Our commitment to the objectives set forth by the Responsible Care \u00ae charter of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) obligates us to continuously minimize the negative effects of our products on the environment, health and safety and to optimize our products  on  an  ongoing  basis.  It  is  important  to  consider  the potential impacts of product use on biodiversity, for example, with regard to the biodiversity loss driver of pollution.\n\nWe evaluate our products and solutions in crop protection and seeds, for example, throughout the entire research, development and registration process. After they have been approved for the market, we continue assessing them regularly for potential risks and impacts to the ecosystems in which they are used. We have initiated various  projects  and  offer  trainings  to  prevent  misuse  of  our products (see page 149).\n\nAll types of land development, such as agriculture and forestry, play a role in changing biodiversity (driver of biodiversity loss: land-use change). Activities such as tillage, drainage, fertilization and the use of crop protection products can affect flora and fauna, for example, by  influencing  food  sources.  Minimizing  these  impacts  while ensuring the necessary productivity is one of the biggest challenges farmers are facing.\n\nOur Agricultural Solutions division focuses on four areas to help farmers  to  find  the  right  balance  between  productivity  and sustainability.  The  focus  areas  are  more  climate-smart  farming, more sustainable solutions, digital farming and smart stewardship (see box on page 36). In this context, we work with farmers to create balanced agricultural systems which enable productive and efficient\n\nfarming of high-quality food products and at the same time promote biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. For example, we advise them on soil cultivation practices and look for suitable ways to improve biodiversity in farmlands. Our many years of experience in sustainability  measurement  and  evaluation  in  agriculture  are particularly  useful  here.  Our  modern  seed  solutions  and  crop protection products also enable better yield on existing farmlands and thus help protect natural habitats.\n\nWith our AgBalance \u00ae method , we can measure and compare the impacts  of  different  agricultural  practices  on  the  environment according to the principle of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Using the corresponding biodiversity calculator, we can assess the impact on biodiversity. Based on these assessments, we issue recommendations for measures with scientifically proven effectiveness (according to the analyses of Conservation Evidence, a project team at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom), such as planting hedges and flower strips or establishing nesting places to benefit pollinators such as wild bees and farmland birds.\n\nAxalion \u00ae is one example of BASF's more environmentally friendly crop protection products. The insecticidal active ingredient received its first approval in Australia at the end of 2022 and has been sold there under the name Efficon \u00ae since April 2023. Approval was also granted in South Korea in 2023. Axalion \u00ae enables farmers to control a wide range of piercing and sucking pests that are harmful to crops. At the same time, it is highly compatible with beneficial insects such as pollinators. The active ingredient thus supports farmers in managing the challenges they face around productivity and environmental protection.",

        "page_content": "## Material topics in focus: Biodiversity and Ecosystems\n\n## Responsibility to our supply chains\n\nSome of the business activities of our raw materials suppliers involve land uses that can influence biodiversity (driver of biodiversity loss: land -use change). We have laid down our expectations of our suppliers with regard to environmental, labor and social standards in the  supply  chain  as  well  as  our  commitment  to  preserving biodiversity in the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 159).\n\nBASF procures various renewable raw materials. Just as for fossil raw  materials,  we  consider  how  renewable  resources  impact aspects of sustainability along the value chain. Alongside positive effects like avoiding greenhouse gas emissions (driver of biodiversity loss: climate change), these can also have negative effects, for example, through the drivers of biodiversity loss overexploitation and land-use change, depending on the raw material. Through our sourcing practices, we aim to preserve ecosystems and enable sustainable land development that supports the livelihoods of the people who depend on them (see page 122).\n\nThere is a high risk especially for palm and palm kernel oil that forest areas are cleared to create farmland. To anchor sustainability topics more  firmly  in  procurement  we  established  the  BASF  Palm Commitment  in  2011,  which  was  updated  in  2015,  and  is implemented  through  our Palm  Sourcing  Policy . Third-party certification with standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standard enables us to take biodiversity criteria into account when purchasing raw materials (see page 122).\n\nWe are committed to the environmental sustainability of other supply chains through our own initiatives. One example is our rambutan program .  It  was  launched  in  2014  in  close  collaboration  with partners in Vietnam to source botanical ingredients for cosmetic products from certified organic rambutan gardens. In cooperation with  local  farmers  and  NGOs,  BASF's  program  promotes  the preservation of biodiverse habitats, as well as good agricultural practices, gender equity and fair working conditions.\n\nOur position on forest protection sets out our commitment to preserving biodiversity in areas of High Conservation Value such as High Carbon Stock forest areas and peatlands in the procurement of renewable raw materials. In 2023, BASF again participated in the 'Forests' assessment conducted by the international organization CDP and achieved a score of A-, once more giving it Leadership status. The assessment is conducted based on detailed insights into the palm value chain and activities that impact ecosystems and natural habitats.\n\n- For more information on the CDP forests questionnaire, see basf.com/en/cdp\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Partnerships for biodiversity\n\nEngaging  in  ongoing  dialog  with  a  variety  of  stakeholders  is important  to  BASF.  On  the  one  hand,  we  want  to  share  our knowledge and on the other hand, learn from other to improve our own practices. To this end, we established a Nature Advisory Council (NAC) in 2023 (see page 117).\n\nWe cooperate with several organizations including the Roundtable on  Sustainable  Palm  Oil,  the  Sustainable  Palm  Oil  Forum,  the Brazilian Coalition on Climate, Forests and Agriculture and the High Carbon Stock Approach Steering Group. BASF is a member in the forum  of  the  Taskforce  on  Nature-related  Financial  Disclosures (TNFD) initiative, which provides recommendations for reporting on nature-related  risks  and  activities.  We  are  an  active  advisory member of the working group for chemical sector guidelines that TNFD established at the beginning of 2023. Our involvement in organizations such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and the Alliance for Water Stewardship (see page 113) helps to preserve biodiversity in bodies of water.\n\nTogether with international partners and based on the dialog with stakeholders  in  the  food  value  chain,  we  are  driving  forward measures to promote sustainable agriculture. In the United States, for example, BASF is a member of the Honey Bee Health Coalition, which aims to preserve healthy honey bee populations and support healthy populations of native and managed pollinators in productive agricultural systems and thriving ecosystems. BASF France SAS is part of the Entreprises pour l'Environnement network, which launched  the  Act4nature  campaign  with  the  main  objective  of protecting and enhancing biodiversity.\n\nWe have been working with farms in the United Kingdom on pilot projects  since  2002  to  demonstrate  how  the  protection  of biodiversity can be reconciled with the complex challenges farmers face. Local farmers grow a variety of annual crops to establish demonstration plots. Practices within the field, such as mixtures of cover crops, as well as measures at the edge and outside the field,",

Data collected and analyzed on one of the farms between 2009 and 2019 by a team of local agronomists and ornithologists on behalf of BASF shows that farmland bird species considered threatened by U.K. experts (26 on the Red List and  19  on  the  Amber  List)  benefit  greatly  from  sustainable agriculture combined with high-quality ecological habitats.\n\nFor  more  than  10  years,  we  have  been  working  with  different farmers and experts from the BASF FarmNetwork Sustainability, an association  of  farms  in  Europe,  to  integrate  more  connected biodiversity  areas  into  agricultural  production.  By  creating  and maintaining new habitats and linking habitats for living, breeding and feeding,  biodiversity  can  be  sustainably  promoted  in  modern, conventional agriculture. External scientists accompany the project and examine the effectiveness of the biodiversity measures. The results are published annually in a report. Based on the insights gained from working together, an advisory board of experts from agriculture,  nature  conservation  and  environmental  protection developed a biodiversity checklist and published it in 2021. This summarizes  10  ecologically  effective  measures  to  promote biodiversity. Since 2021, BASF has supported farmers participating in its #wirzahlenBiodiversit\u00e4t ('We pay biodiversity') program financially and with professional advice.\n\nBASF also offers various e-learning modules on biodiversity and agriculture to support farmers in implementing the necessary and effective measures in practice. The interactive training sessions are available to all interested farmers free of charge.\n\n- For more information on our responsible management of resources, see page 46 For more information on product stewardship, see pages 146 and 149\n- For more information on our commitment to biodiversity, see basf.com/biodiversity\n\nFor more information on our position on forest protection, see basf.com/forestprotection",

We want to use these resources efficiently and responsibly. As part of our activities to achieve greater sustainability, we are turning to recycled and renewable raw materials to replace fossil raw materials and reduce emissions along the value chain. Our focus is on a secure supply and a stable supply chain,  in  which  our  suppliers  source  and  produce  raw materials in line with environmental and social requirements. At the same time, our chemical products are raw materials for our customers and we want to increasingly offer them with a reduced carbon footprint.\n\n## At a glance\n\n~30,000\n\nDifferent raw materials purchased\n\n## ~1 million metric tons\n\nRenewable raw materials purchased\n\n- \u25aa BASF's Verbund concept enables the efficient use of resources\n- \u25aa Recycled and renewable raw materials are gaining in importance\n- \u25aa Raw materials purchased from over 6,000 suppliers\n- \u25aa Numerous projects to improve supply chain sustainability\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nOur  strategy  covers  the  entire  value  chain  -  from  responsible procurement and the efficient use of raw materials in our own processes and recycling by-products to developing resource-saving solutions for our customers.\n\nFossil raw materials continue to be among our most important raw materials and sourcing and producing them causes greenhouse gas\n\nemissions, which contribute to climate change. We are trying to reduce  these  emissions  by  using  recycled  and  renewable  raw materials. However, these alternatives can also pose sustainability challenges, such as risks in the supply chain. We see one solution in a transition to a circular economy in which we want to decouple growth  from  resource  consumption  with  process  and  product innovations.\n\nBASF's Verbund concept is key to making the use of raw materials in our own processes as efficient as possible: Intelligently linking and steering our plants and processes creates efficient value chains. By-products from one plant are used as feedstocks elsewhere. This saves raw materials and energy. At the same time, the Verbund offers numerous opportunities to use renewable and recycled raw materials. Going forward, we want to better leverage this potential.\n\nThe Corporate Center unit Corporate Development sets binding, Group-wide  purchasing  guidelines  for  the  procurement  of  raw materials. They are supplemented by specific internal requirements, for  example,  on  sourcing  palm-based  raw  materials  or  certain mineral raw materials. We use a multistage control process to ensure  compliance  with  these  requirements.  We  systematically record short and long-term opportunities and risks caused by our purchase of raw materials as part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 182 onward).\n\nAlongside  economic,  environmental  and  social  criteria,  we  also consider aspects such as product safety and supply security when selecting  suppliers  and  raw  materials.  Our  expectations  of  our suppliers are laid down in our Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 159). We take a closer look at suppliers in critical supply chains, for example, for mineral raw materials and renewable resources as well as a number of pigments. Upstream stages of the value chain are assessed for serious sustainability risks and, if necessary, suitable remedial measures are introduced. In addition, we develop and test approaches in joint initiatives with suppliers and other partners to make  the  supply  of  raw  materials  more  sustainable.  Examples include  our  cooperative  ventures  and  investments  for  recycling lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (see page 125) and our joint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nactivities on certified sustainable supply chains for renewable raw materials such as palm, palm kernel and castor oil.\n\nResource efficiency and stewardship are also becoming increasingly important for our customers. That is why we are constantly working to switch  to  more  sustainable  raw  materials  and  reduce  the resources  consumed  in  the  manufacturing  of  our  products,  for example through more efficient processes and innovative technologies.  This  enables  us  to  offer  our  customers  more sustainable solutions, for example with a smaller carbon footprint or better biodegradability. Our  products  also  improve  resource efficiency and sustainability at many points along the value chain. For  example,  BASF  additives  increase  the  service  life  and mechanical recyclability of plastics, which saves fossil resources, reduces CO2 emissions and enables a circular economy.\n\nFor more information on our supplier management, see page 158 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on circular economy, see page 46\n\n## Fossil and petrochemical resources\n\nBASF's most important raw materials (based on volume) include gas and crude oil-based petrochemical products such as naphtha and benzene. We use liquid gas and natural gas as fuels to generate energy and steam, and as raw materials to produce key basic chemicals such as ammonia or acetylene. Naphtha is mainly fed into our steam crackers, where it is split into products such as olefins and  aromatics.  The  olefins  ethylene  and  propylene  are  both important feedstocks for BASF's numerous value chains. We use aromatics such as benzene or toluene to manufacture engineering plastics, among other products. Thanks to a high degree of forward and  backward  integration,  we  can  produce  feedstocks  for  our value chains efficiently while conserving resources within the BASF Verbund.  This  increases  supply  security  and  strengthens  our resilience to fluctuations in the supply chain. We source key raw materials from different suppliers to minimize supply risks. This also applies to natural gas, for which we are further diversifying our supplier structure due to the changed supply situation in Europe. For example, we have signed a long-term supply agreement for",

        "page_content": "liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States starting in 2026. In the following years, the agreed delivery volume can cover about one  third  of  BASF's  expected  natural  gas  demand  in  Europe. In  addition,  we  have  reduced  our  demand  through  technical optimizations  in  the  BASF  Production  Verbund  and  converted further  power  plants  to  bivalent  operation  -  they  can  thus  be operated with natural gas or heating oil. We are also continuously evaluating  whether  fossil  and  petrochemical  resources  can  be replaced with nonfossil or recycled alternatives.\n\n## Renewable resources\n\nIn addition to fossil resources, we employ renewable raw materials, mainly  based  on  vegetable  oils,  fats,  grains,  sugar  and  wood. In 2023, we purchased around 1 million metric tons of renewable raw  materials.  We  use  these  to  produce  ingredients  for  the detergent and cleaner industry and natural active ingredients for the cosmetics industry, for example. We further use renewable feedstocks such as biomethane and bionaphtha in our Verbund as an  alternative  to  fossil  resources.  The  mass  balance  approach allows us to attribute the amount of renewable raw materials used to a wide variety of end products (see box on page 124). Examples include biomass balanced glues and impregnating resins for the woodworking  industry  such  as  Kaurit \u00ae Zero  and  Kauramin \u00ae Balance, various biomass balanced versions of Trilon \u00ae and Sokalan \u00ae products  for  the  detergent  and  cleaner  industries,  biomass balanced tetrahydrofuran (THF) for the production of elastic fibers for the textile industry, a product range of biomass balanced engine coolants under the Glysantin \u00ae brand and biomass balanced styrene as a precursor for numerous styrenics.\n\nOur aim is to continuously increase the share of renewable raw materials in our value chains. Just as for fossil raw materials, we also consider economic criteria, aspects of supply security, process and product safety and the availability of various raw materials as well as the  potential impact  on  sustainability along  the  value  chain.\n\n- 1 Fractions and primary oleochemical derivatives as well as vegetable oil esters\n- 2 The global palm footprint in this context includes certified and noncertified palm-based raw materials.\n\nAlongside  positive  effects  such  as  reducing  greenhouse  gas emissions, these can also have negative effects, depending on the raw materials. We therefore take the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems into account when sourcing renewable raw materials and also include social factors such as working conditions and food security in our risk analyses. We carefully weigh up advantages and disadvantages, for example with life cycle analyses. At the same time, we seek dialog with our stakeholders to identify conflicting goals.  We  also  take  into  consideration  recognized  certification standards in our decisions, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). For our biomass balance portfolio, we source renewable raw materials that are certified according to recognized standards  such  as  the  International  Sustainability  and  Carbon Certification (ISCC) or the organization for sustainably produced biomass REDcert.\n\nAs part of our commitment to greater sustainability, we focus on supply chains that are relevant quantitatively and are involved where there is currently a lack of certification standards. We are also working on product innovations and on enhancing our production processes  to  improve  the  profitability  and  competitiveness  of renewable resources. For example, we are developing innovative processes such as biocatalysis and fermentation for the production of vitamins and enzymes, and driving forward white biotechnology for  the  production  of  chemical  components  from  renewable resources.\n\nPalm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives are some of our most important renewable raw materials. We mainly use these to produce ingredients  for  the  cosmetics,  detergent,  cleaner  and  food industries. We aim to ensure that palm-based raw materials come from certified sustainable sources. We have been a member of the RSPO already since 2004 and are involved in other national and international initiatives, such as the German Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil and the High Carbon Stock Approach organization. Based on our Group-wide Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 159), we have outlined our expectations of suppliers in the palm-based value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nchain in an additional sourcing policy (BASF Palm Sourcing Policy). This  addresses  aspects  such  as  forest  and  peat  conservation, respect  for  human  and  labor  rights,  smallholder  inclusion,  and certification and traceability standards. As part of our supplier and risk management, we have used the internet platform palmoil.io to monitor  deforestation  activities  and  other  possible  breaches  of regulations at our suppliers' sites. For the first time in 2023, our Care Chemicals  division  published  a  comprehensive Responsible Sourcing Report , in which we will report annually on our measures and progress toward more sustainability and transparency in the palm value chain as well as further renewable raw materials value chains. It replaces the previously published Palm Progress Report.\n\nWe purchased 159,798 metric tons of palm oil and palm kernel oil in 2023  (2022:  191,714).  We  again  met  our  own  voluntary commitment to source only RSPO-certified palm oil and palm kernel oil.  This  avoided  more  than  225,000  metric  tons  of  carbon emissions compared with the procurement of conventional palm oil and palm kernel oil. As part of our voluntary commitment, we also aim to procure the main derivatives 1 based on palm oil and palm kernel oil entirely from certified sustainable sources by 2025. In addition, we maintained the RSPO supply chain certification of our sites for cosmetic ingredients. At the end of 2023, 25 production sites worldwide were certified by the RSPO (2022: 25).\n\nWe source most of our palm-based raw materials from Malaysia and Indonesia. As of the end of 2023, we were able to trace around 96% of  our  global  palm  footprint 2 to  oil  mill  level  (2022:  97%). Smallholders account for around one-third of the total volumes produced there. We are involved in local initiatives to expand our supplier base  for RSPO-certified  palm  oil  products  while strengthening smallholder structures and sustainable production methods at local level. Since 2018 we have been working together with The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, the RSPO and civil society organization Solidaridad in Indonesia. The project in the province of Lampung  supported  around  1,000  independent  smallholders  in improving their livelihoods and the sustainable production of palm oil",

Upon completion of the project, the declared goal  of  certifying  one-third  of  the  participants  of  the  program according to the RSPO Smallholder Standard was almost achieved (313 certifications). In 2023, BASF partnered with a leading natural cosmetics manufacturer and the Indonesian nonprofit organization Kaleka to support smallholders in Central Kalimantan. The aim is to promote  regenerative  agricultural  methods  as  well  as  to  help establish political framework conditions and regulations. We are also involved  in  a  local  project  in  Sumatra  through  the  Forum  for Sustainable Palm Oil (FONAP).\n\nAlso important for BASF, albeit at a much smaller scale, is castor oil . We use castor oil to manufacture products such as plastics and ingredients for paints and coatings, as well as products for the cosmetics  and  pharmaceutical  industries.  With  the  objective  of establishing a certified sustainable supply chain for castor oil, we launched the Sustainable Castor Initiative - Pragati in 2016 together with the companies Arkema and Jayant Agro and with Solidaridad. The initiative aims to improve the economic situation of castor bean farmers  in  India  and,  at  the  same  time,  raise  awareness  of sustainable farming methods. Over 80% of the world's castor beans are produced in India, mainly by smallholders. As part of Pragati, smallholder farmers receive training on topics such as cultivation methods,  efficient  water  use,  health  and  the  safe  use  of  crop protection products based on a specially developed sustainability code,  SuCCESS.  Since  the  project  was  initiated,  more  than 7,000 smallholders and over 27,000 hectares of land have been certified for sustainable castor cultivation. Yields from this land were 36% higher than average amounts for the region published by the local government for the 2022/2023 harvest cycle. In addition to SuCCESS, the Sustainable Castor Association (SCA), which was launched in 2019 by the founders of the Pragati initiative, has also developed a sustainability code for the wider supply chain. This will allow  castor  beans  obtained  from  the  program  to  be  further processed  into  certified  castor  oil  and  derivatives  and  to  be introduced into the downstream supply chain. In 2023, we again sourced certified sustainable castor oil from the program after our\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf-Holthausen site in Germany became the first chemical company in the world to be certified in 2021. The site supplies customers  with  the  first  certified  products  based  on  certified sustainable castor oil.\n\nWe are also driving the market transformation toward certified, sustainably  sourced  oleochemicals  for  another  renewable  raw material: coconut  oil . We  use  coconut  oil  to  manufacture ingredients for products such as detergents, cleaning agents and cosmetics. BASF is the world's first chemical company to offer certified sustainable ingredients for personal care products based on coconut oil. Following our production site in Cassina Rizzardi, Italy, we successfully certified another site in Zona Franca, Spain, under  the  Rainforest  Alliance  Mass  Balance  Coconut  scheme in 2023.\n\nPlants also form the basis of many other products in our portfolio for cosmetics. These include our biopolymers, which we have been offering  under  the  Verdessence\u2122  brand,  and  our  bioactives. Through  sustainable  sourcing  practices,  we  aim  to  preserve ecosystems and enable sustainable management for the people whose livelihoods depend on them. For example, we have already been combining economic, environmental and social aspects for several  years  in  our  holistic  procurement  initiatives  for  argan (Morocco),  rambutan  and  galanga  (both  Vietnam).  With  the Responsibly  Active  program , we  are  bundling  our  existing activities (see box on page 123).\n\n- For more information on biodiversity, see page 116 onward\n- For more information on our voluntary commitment to palm oil products and the Responsible Sourcing Report, see basf.com/en/palm-dialog For more information on the Responsibly Active program, see personal-care.basf.com/responsibly-active\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Responsibility for bioactives\n\nWith the Responsibly Active program , we are bundling our activities in the area of bioactives to protect natural resources, to improve the working conditions of people along the supply chain and to reduce the impact on the climate and environmental footprint in production. We have made concrete progress:\n\nAs  part  of  full  traceability  in  the  botanical  supply  chain,  for example, we have developed a digital tool that tracks every step of argan oil production. Thanks to developments such as these, our Care Chemicals division is able to trace 98% of its botanical supply chains to the country of origin and 42% to the source.\n\nIn another  project,  we  worked  with  suppliers  and  nongovernmental  organizations  to  support  women  and  small businesses along the moringa 1 supply chain through training.",

        "page_content": "## Recycled feedstocks\n\n## Good to know\n\nRecycling is playing an increasingly important role due to limited resources, growing sustainability requirements in the markets, and regulatory developments. In a challenging environment with limited availability  of  alternative  raw  materials,  we  still  aim  to  process 250,000 metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials in our  production  plants  annually  from  2025,  replacing  fossil  raw materials.\n\nA focal point of our activities here is the chemical recycling of plastics. This technology complements mechanical recycling and can help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is disposed of in landfills or thermally recovered. Chemical recycling breaks down plastics  into  their  building  blocks  or  converts  them  into  basic chemicals. Different methods are used to achieve this.\n\nIn  our  ChemCycling \u00ae project,  our  technology  partners  use  the pyrolysis process to extract pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste or end-of-life tires, which are not mechanically recycled as of yet. We feed the pyrolysis oil into the BASF Verbund as a substitute for fossil raw materials and manufacture new products from it using the mass balance principle (see page 124). Our customers can process these mass balanced products in the same way as conventional products. Our  portfolio  of  Ccycled \u00ae products  now  comprises  around 240 products, which our customers use for a wide range of applications - from food packaging and transport cases for temperaturesensitive drugs to high-performance plastics for the automotive industry and functional textiles. In order to expand our customer portfolio with mass balanced Ccycled \u00ae products, we signed a new cooperation  agreement  with  our  partner  Pyrum  in  2023.  This provides for a conditional loan of initially \u20ac25 million. It is intended to serve as startup financing for the planning, project development and construction of at least three new Pyrum plants, each with an annual capacity of 20,000 metric tons of end-of-life tires. BASF intends to use the pyrolysis oil produced in the new plants as a recycled raw material in production.\n\n## The mass balance approach\n\nMany BASF value chains start in syngas plants or steam crackers, where  fossil  resources,  mostly  natural  gas  and  naphtha,  are converted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide or important basic chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. These are used to create thousands of products in the BASF Verbund.\n\nIn addition to fossil raw materials, we feed alternative raw materials into  the  Verbund  that  come  from  bio-based  and  chemically recycled sources, such as bionaphtha, biomethane and pyrolysis oil. These alternatives are used in place of fossil feedstocks for our mass  balance  products.  As  fossil,  bio-based  and  recycled feedstocks  are  processed  simultaneously,  the  raw  materials cannot be directly physically assigned to resulting derivatives. However, through monitoring by independent third parties such as T\u00dcV Nord on the basis of recognized certification systems, such as REDcert 2 or ISCC PLUS, it can be verified that an adequate amount of alternative raw materials has been used for the amount of  mass  balance  sales  product.  This  ensures  that  fossil  raw materials are saved with every sale of these certified products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMass balanced products are identical in quality to conventionally produced  products,  but  the  use  of  alternative  raw  materials contributes to sustainability, for example, through fewer carbon emissions and lower demand for fossil raw materials. This method has already been applied to over 1,400 BASF products including engineering plastics such as polyamide as well as superabsorbents, dispersions and intermediates.\n\nWe  share  our  expertise  in  numerous  stakeholder  platforms, including the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD),  Together  for  Sustainability  (TfS)  and  nova-Institute's Renewable  Carbon  Initiative,  to  harmonize  and  standardize different attribution methods and certification schemes for mass balance products.\n\nFor more information on the mass balance approach, see basf.com/massbalance\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In addition, BASF continues to drive forward the recycling of foams from used mattresses. Using a process developed by BASF, the raw materials can be recovered from flexible polyurethane foams to produce new mattresses. Thanks to this new process, in 2023, our cooperation partner NEVEON  was  able  to  produce  new polyurethane foams from the polyol recovered for the first time on a metric ton scale. The mattresses produced with this material contain 80%  recycled  content in the polyol component. Approximately 100 mattresses produced using this process are used  exclusively  in  BASF's  own  business  hotel  Ren\u00e9  Bohn  in Ludwigshafen, Germany.\n\nWe  have  many  years  of  experience  and  a  high  degree  of specialization  in recycling  precious  metals such  as  platinum, palladium and rhodium. They are used in mobile emissions catalysts as well as in process and chemical catalysts. We primarily use the precious metals recovered in this way as feedstocks to manufacture new products for the automotive, chemical, electronics and green hydrogen industries. The carbon footprint for recycled precious metals is up to 90% lower than for primary metals from a mine.\n\nWith the rapidly growing market for electric vehicles, there is also an increasing need for recycling lithium-ion batteries . As a leading producer of battery materials with local production capacities in the three main markets - Asia, Europe and North America - BASF has in-depth expertise in battery chemistry and process technology. We are utilizing these competencies to address battery recycling as an additional growth market in cooperation with partners along the value chain (see page 32). In this way, we want to ensure that valuable  metals  remain  in  the  production  cycle  for  as  long  as possible. This conserves resources and significantly reduces the carbon footprint of cathode active materials compared with the industry standard. At our site in Schwarzheide, Germany, a new plant  for  the  production  of  black  mass  from  spent  lithium-ion batteries and battery production waste will be built in the course of 2024, as well as a prototype plant for a metal refinery, which is scheduled  for  completion  in  early  2024.  This  will  allow  for  the development  of  new  operating  procedures  and  optimization  of technology to deliver superior recovery rates of metals, such as\n\nlithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, from the black mass. In addition, we will produce cathode active materials from recycled metals on a commercial scale at our U.S. site in Battle Creek, Michigan,  from  2024.  This  will  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of cathode active materials by around 25% compared with the use of primary metals. These are used in the lithium-ion battery cells from our partner Nanotech Energy. Together with Nanotech Energy, American  Battery  Technology  Company  (ABTC)  and  TODA Advanced Materials Inc. (TODA), we are aiming to establish a local battery value chain in a closed cycle.\n\n- For more information on circular economy, see page 46\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mineral raw materials\n\nWe procure a number of mineral raw materials, which we use to produce automotive and process catalysts or battery materials for electromobility, among other products. We are continually improving our products and processes to minimize the use of primary mineral raw materials.\n\nResponsible sourcing of mineral raw materials is important to BASF as we are aware of the challenges in the supply chain and our due diligence.  We  have  implemented  the  E.U.  Conflict  Minerals Regulation. This defines supply chain due diligence for tin, tantalum, tungsten and their ores as well as gold (3TG) imported into the E.U. from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs).\n\nIn addition, BASF is committed to responsible and sustainable global supply chains for other mineral raw materials. These include cobalt , a key component in the production of battery materials. We have organized our cobalt supply chain according to established sustainability guidelines such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals. Our goal is to not purchase cobalt from artisanal mines as long as responsible labor, social and environmental standards cannot be verified.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTogether  with  BMW  Group,  Samsung  SDI  Co.  Ltd.,  Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Volkswagen AG, Stihl AG & Co. KG and GIZ, we have been involved in the cross-industry Cobalt for Development initiative since 2018. It aims to improve working and living conditions for artisanal miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo. To achieve this, the initiative offers programs such as training on important environmental,  social  and  governance  aspects  of  responsible mining practices. In 2023, mining cooperatives continued to receive trainings on topics such as occupational safety and environmental management. Furthermore, together with local nongovernmental organizations and Bon Pasteur/the Good Shepherd International Foundation, GIZ is supporting local communities to develop stable sources of income as an alternative to mining. Residents are trained, for example, in farming during the dry season, learning a trade, starting a business and using financial resources effectively. As a result, households have increased their income by 36% and are better able to cope with crises or shortages. Around 3,000 people are already benefiting from this. The pilot project has also financed the construction and equipment of a school, provided educational training for teachers and developed teaching materials. Today, 600 children are taught in a new school building.\n\nBASF is currently exploring an investment to develop a nickel-cobalt refining complex in Indonesia together with Eramet, a global mining and metallurgy company, to supply cathode active materials to the growing electric vehicle market. BASF has not yet decided whether this project will be implemented. Part of the evaluation process is an intensive review and assessment of environmental, social and governance risks (ESG).\n\nWe are also involved in various German and international initiatives to strengthen sustainability and innovation in the value chain for batteries. For example, we are a partner in a consortium led by the system change consultancy Systemiq that has received funding of \u20ac8.2 million from the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action to develop a digital product passport for batteries. This aims to address the requirements of the E.U. Battery Regulation and both capture data that maps information about the origin of raw materials and create the basis for an efficient circular economy.",

        "page_content": "Close cooperation with the Global Battery Alliance (GBA) is also intended to ensure global compatibility of the digital battery passport. Cofounded by BASF in 2017, the GBA has over 150 members and promotes dialog between business, governments and civil society. It develops the steering tools aiming to establish a sustainable and responsible  battery  circular  economy  by  2030.  Following  the publication of the Greenhouse Gas Rulebook in 2022, the GBA unveiled  a  revised  edition  in  2023  as  the  result  of  a  public consultation. As the first framework of its kind, it contains around 80 specifications and rules for the globally harmonized - and therefore comparable - accounting of greenhouse gas emissions along the battery value chain. As an impartial platform, GBA strives to facilitate a consensus between the relevant stakeholders. The aim of this and further rulebooks is to create transparency for comprehensive and standardized  reporting  of  ESG  topics  on  the  basis  of  broad acceptance.\n\nTogether with BMW Group, Mercedes-Benz AG, Fairphone B.V., Daimler Truck AG and Volkswagen Group, we have also been a member of the Responsible Lithium Partnership since 2021. It advocates for the responsible use of natural resources in Chile's Salar de Atacama, home to the world's largest lithium reserves and a significant portion of global production. To this end, GIZ was commissioned to organize a local multistakeholder platform on the water-related opportunities and risks of lithium and copper mining and other economic activities and to promote action plans. BASF participated in a study organized by BMW together with experts from the University of Alaska and the University of Massachusetts to investigate hydrological conditions in the Salar de Atacama. The results of this study are incorporated as an important component of the Responsible Lithium Partnership's work.\n\nAnother mineral raw material that BASF processes is mica . 1 As a base for effect pigments, it is mainly used in the production of coatings  and  seed  coatings.  BASF  is  conscious  of  its  social responsibility  with  regard  to  mica  sourcing  and  applies  high standards which, among other things, exclude child labor. Suppliers\n\nare asked to source mica in accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. As an active member of the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI),  we  advocate  for  the  eradication  of  child  labor  and unacceptable working conditions, specifically in India's mica supply chain. The initiative focuses on labor standards, strengthening local communities and legal frameworks. As RMI's most recent progress report shows, activities in the relevant regions of India have already led  to  improved  income  and  living  conditions.  These  include improved access to clean drinking water through the installation of pumps and filtration systems and improved access to health care through doctors' visits in villages and enrollment in public health insurance plans.\n\n- For more information on responsibility for human rights, labor and social standards, see page 154\n- For more information on the Cobalt for Development project, see basf.com/cobalt-initiative\n\nFor more information on the Global Battery Alliance, see globalbattery.org\n\nFor more information on the Responsible Mica Initiative, see responsible-mica-initiative.com\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our comprehensive safety concepts are designed to provide the best possible protection for employees, contractors and our sites' neighbors, and to prevent damage to property and the environment.\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nWe rely on comprehensive preventive measures to ensure process safety and are continually improving the safety of our production processes.  Opportunities  arise  in  particular  in  the  automation and digitalization of processes. In our complex production plants, incidents  may  nevertheless  occur  that  have  a  potential  impact on  humans  and  the  environment.  We  systematically  record opportunities and risks in the area of process safety as part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 178 onward).\n\nOur production plants are at the heart of our business. To ensure efficient and safe production and to counteract incidents in our plants, we set binding global standards for process safety. Our sites and  Group  companies  are  responsible  for  implementing  and complying with Group-wide requirements and local standards. The Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center performs regular audits to check compliance with these requirements.\n\n## This page:\n\nIn September 2023, around 100 Emergency Response personnel trained for emergencies as part of the major incident drill that takes place twice a year in Ludwigshafen, Germany. The scenario: A defective seal causes a solvent-containing liquid to escape from a system, leading to ignition and deflagration. Exercises of this kind are an integral part of the preventive safety concept at our sites.\n\n- 1 In 2023, we adjusted our safety targets.\n\n## 2030 target 1\n\nReduce our worldwide High Severity Process Safety Incidents per 200,000 working hours a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na  Hours worked by BASF employees, temporary workers and contractors\n\nWe pursue ambitious targets for process safety. As part of our continuous improvement process, we regularly monitor progress toward  our  goals.  We  critically  reviewed  our  occupational  and process safety targets and key performance indicators in 2022. Since 2023, we have been focusing on high-severity incidents. Our reporting continues to be based on established industry standards, with a stronger focus on people.\n\n## Global targets and measures\n\nWe set high safety standards in the planning, construction and operation of our plants around the world. These meet and, in some cases, go beyond local legal requirements. Our global requirements provide the framework for the safe construction and operation of our plants as well as the protection of people and the environment. Our experts develop a safety concept for every plant that considers the key aspects of safety, health and environmental protection - from\n\n<!-- image -->",

This also applies to the timely completion of the prescribed (process) safety assessments and the resulting safety measures. We regularly update our plants' safety  concepts,  taking  into  particular  account  new  findings, technological opportunities and regulatory developments.\n\nWe  use  the  number  of  High  Severity  Process  Safety  Incidents (hsPSI) per 200,000 working hours as a reporting indicator. We have set ourselves the target of reducing High Severity Process Safety Incidents to a rate of no more than 0.10 per 200,000 working hours by 2030. 1 In 2023, we recorded 0.05 hsPSI per 200,000 working hours worldwide. The rate of all process safety incidents in the BASF  Group was 0.3 in 2023 (2022: 0.3). We investigate every incident in detail, analyze causes and use the findings to derive suitable measures. We share the findings in our global network in the interest of continuous improvement.\n\nTo  reduce  process  safety  incidents,  we  focus  in  particular  on technical measures, digital solutions and on a leadership culture that places even greater emphasis on process safety and dealing openly with mistakes. In addition, we are continually refining and expanding our training methods and offerings to increase risk awareness and strengthen our safety culture. In 2023, for example, a program to reduce process incidents at our site in Pudong, China, focused on the topic of tightness and the prevention of leaks and covered this in training courses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' We focus our targets on high-severity incidents in order to focus more strongly on people.\n\nGert Van Bortel\n\nWe play an active role in improving process safety around the world in internal and external networks, through our involvement in  organizations  such  as  the  International  Council  of  Chemical Associations (ICCA), the European Process Safety Centre (EPSC) and  the  Center  for  Chemical  Process  Safety  (CCPS),  and  by fostering dialog with government institutions.\n\n- For more information on process safety, see basf.com/process\\_safety\n- For more information on occupational safety and health protection, see page 143 onward\n\n## Case study\n\n## Learning through simulation\n\nAn Operator Training Simulator (OTS) can be used to provide a realistic training environment for plant operators so they can learn the skills needed in practice. Similar to a flight simulator, OTS systems can be used to simulate the processes of complex chemical plants.\n\nIn this way, new employees can familiarize themselves with their field of work in a practical manner. They can train how to operate the plant, which valves need to be opened or closed under which conditions and which trends in the process control system are particularly important to keep an eye on. An OTS can also be used to simulate conditions that rarely occur in day-to-day work - such as exceptional malfunctions. The simulator is therefore also suitable for training experienced employees.\n\nBy using OTSs, we want to further increase the operational safety of our plants and rectify faults faster and better. Several of our operating divisions  use  simulators.  The  Petrochemicals  division  is  currently developing  OTSs for all of its plant clusters at the Verbund site under construction in Zhanjiang, China, in close cooperation with the Global Engineering Services unit. The advantage of considering an OTS at the same time as planning new projects is that weak points can be identified and rectified before construction begins.\n\nIn  Nanjing,  China;  Port  Arthur,  Texas;  Ludwigshafen,  Germany;  and Antwerp, Belgium, the simulators have already been in successful use at selected plants for several years.",

Should  an  emergency  nevertheless  arise, we have established structures and processes that enable effective crisis management.\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nWe want to be as prepared as possible for crisis situations at global, regional and local level - from process safety incidents to goods spillages and  emergencies  -  through  extensive  emergency preparedness and emergency response regulations and measures. That is why our emergency and crisis management focuses on the protection of our employees, contractors and neighbors, the safety of our plants and sites, and the protection of the environment. To ensure rapid and effective crisis management, we have defined appropriate structures and processes and laid them down in binding Group-wide  requirements.  Our  sites  and  Group  companies  are responsible for implementing and complying with these internal requirements  and  the  legal  specifications.  The  Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center conducts regular audits to monitor this.\n\nUnusual incidents are recorded and reported centrally in accordance with  a  standardized  Group-wide  procedure  (e-Rapid  Incident Report).  The  aim  is  to  identify  risks  at  an  early  stage  and,  if necessary,  initiate appropriate remedial and  communication measures. All incidents are followed up on to identify potential for improvement, which is integrated into existing concepts as needed.\n\n## Organization and responsibilities\n\nIncidents are initially handled by the local crisis organization or local emergency response team. We have implemented precautionary organizational measures with clearly defined responsibilities and procedures at all sites for this purpose. The employees responsible receive regular training. This includes safety and emergency drills, which vary in scope and the number of people involved. Depending on the situation, we also involve business partners and our sites' communities, such as local authorities or neighboring companies, both in drills and in the event of an emergency. Additional teams may be called in for emergencies, depending on the extent of the damage and how it develops.\n\nThe Global Crisis Management Support Team (GCMS), led by a member of the Board of Executive Directors is activated in the event of a crisis situation. It provides the strategic direction for crisis management  and  is  supported  by  issue-specific  and  specialist working groups.\n\nWe  are  involved  in  external  networks,  which  quickly  provide information  and  assistance  in  emergencies.  These  include  the International  Chemical  and  Environmental  (ICE)  initiative  and the  German  Transport  Accident  Information  and  Emergency Response System (TUIS), in which BASF plays a coordinating role. In 2023, we provided assistance to public emergency response agencies and other companies in 116 cases (2022: 131). This included information on chemicals and their proper disposal, on -site operational support for transportation accidents involving hazardous goods and information on human biomonitoring. 1 We apply the experience we have gathered to improve our own processes and set up similar systems in other countries.\n\nFor more information on emergency response, see basf.com/emergency\\_response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These cover the delivery of raw materials, the handling and distribution  of  chemical  products  between  BASF  sites, warehouses and customers, and the transportation of waste.\n\n## At a glance\n\n## Zero\n\nTransportation incidents with significant impact on the environment\n\n- \u25aa Risk minimization along the entire transportation chain\n- \u25aa Risk assessment based on national and international dangerous goods regulations\n- \u25aa Regular review of logistics service providers\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nAs a chemical company, we transport some hazardous goods that may have potentially negative effects on people and the environment if handled improperly or in the event of accidents involving third parties. Whether by road, rail, ship or air, we want to ensure that our products are loaded, transported and handled in accordance with the relevant regulations and their hazard potential. That is why we depend on global standards, an effective organization, training and reliable logistics partners. Our goal is to minimize risks along the entire transportation chain.\n\nAll BASF products intended for transport must be clearly identifiable, classified, securely packaged and labeled. The transportation of dangerous goods is subject to mandatory national and international dangerous goods regulations as well as our global requirements.\n\nOur sites and Group companies are responsible for implementing these transportation safety regulations and requirements. Compliance is regularly monitored by the Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center using globally standardized  transportation  safety  reviews.  External logistics  partners  are  evaluated  based  on  risk  either  through assessments or on-site audits.\n\nOur global network of BASF experts trains the responsible leaders and  their  employees  on  transporting  dangerous  goods.  This network also ensures that information, insights and best practices are shared on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Preventive safety measures\n\nNational and international dangerous goods regulations are based on an assessment of transportation risks and define rules and measures for safely transporting dangerous goods. We use various tools  to  minimize  transportation  risks.  For  example,  for  every dangerous good to be transported, we check in each case whether the packaging has been approved for that product and is suitable for the type of transport. We conduct digital dangerous goods checks before shipping orders are released. In addition, vehicles are subjected to a thorough dangerous goods check prior to loading and rejected if there are any issues.\n\nAbove  and  beyond  this,  we  use  our  global  requirements  to specifically assess the safety and environmental risks of transporting and handling raw materials and sales products with high hazard potential. This is based on the Guidance on Safety Risk Assessment for  Chemical  Transport  Operations  published  by  the  European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC).\n\nWe  stipulate  worldwide  requirements  for  our  logistics  service providers and assess them in terms of safety and quality. Our experts  use  our  own  tools  as  well  as  internationally  approved\n\n- 1 Data is collected based on the International Council of Chemical Association's (ICCA) Guidance for Reporting Performance and includes road, rail and container shipping incidents.\n- 2 Hazardous goods are classified in accordance with national and international hazardous goods regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nschemes for evaluation and monitoring. These include the ship inspection reports issued by the Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) and the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF).\n\n## Transportation incidents\n\nTo evaluate transportation safety, we  systematically  record transportation incidents according to defined criteria. We use the number of transportation incidents 1 as a reporting indicator. In 2023, we recorded 16 transportation incidents worldwide (2022: 25).\n\nA  particular  focus  is  incidents  involving  goods  spillages  that could  lead  to  significant  environmental  impacts.  These  include dangerous goods leaks in excess of 200 kilograms on public traffic routes, provided transport was arranged by BASF. We recorded no incidents in 2023 with spillage of more than 200 kilograms of dangerous goods 2 (2022: 1). There have therefore been no incidents with a significant impact on the environment (2022: 0).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on transportation safety, see basf.com/distribution\\_safety",

A trust-based relationship with our stakeholders and careful management of our supply chains are crucial to our business success. We value an inspiring and safe working environment for our employees. We are in close contact with our local community and respond to the needs of our customers and the concerns of society.\n\n## Our Management and Control Systems\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe health and safety of our employees and contractors is our top priority, as is the quality and safety of our products. To this end, we have established comprehensive management and control systems. Our Responsible Care Management System comprises the global directives, standards and procedures for environmental protection, health and safety.\n\n## Responsible Care Management System\n\nBASF is actively involved in the International Council of Chemical Associations' global Responsible Care \u00ae initiative. Our Responsible Care Management System covers the environmental protection, health and safety aspects that we have identified as material. When it comes to health protection and safety, this is particularly relevant for  the  production  at  our  plants,  activities  at  our  sites  and warehouses, as well as distribution of our products down to our customers'  application  of  our  products.  The  Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center defines Group-wide mandatory management and control systems and monitors compliance with internal requirements as well as  legal  regulations  through  audits,  while  the  sites  and  Group companies  implement  these  requirements  locally.  Our  global\n\nnetwork enables information and insights to be shared across the BASF Group on an ongoing basis.\n\nOur policies and requirements are continuously updated. We also maintain  dialog  with  government  institutions,  associations  and international  organizations  for  this  reason.  We  set  ourselves ambitious goals for safety and health protection (see page 41). We assess the potential risks and weaknesses of all our major activities from research and development to production and logistics - and the potential effects of these on safety, the environment and our surroundings. We use databases to record accidents, near misses and  safety-related  incidents  at  our  sites  as  well  as  along  our transportation routes. This documentation helps us to continuously improve. Appropriate measures are derived according to specific cause analyses.\n\n- For more information on Responsible Care \u00ae , see basf.com/en/responsible-care\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Responsible Care audits\n\nRegular audits help ensure that our safety, health and environmental protection standards are met. We conduct regular audits every three to six years at all BASF sites and at companies in which BASF is a majority shareholder. We take a risk-based approach here. An audit database ensures that all sites and plants worldwide are regularly audited. We have defined our regulations for Responsible Care  audits  in  a  global  Corporate  Requirement.  The  Board  of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In this section:\n\nEmployees Inclusion of Diversity Stakeholder and Societal Engagement Occupational Safety and Health Protection Product Safety Quality Management Product Stewardship for Crop Protection Products and Seeds Corporate Information and Cybersecurity\n\nExecutive Directors is regularly informed about the results of the audits. Newly acquired sites and companies are generally audited for the first time after the integration phase is complete, generally within one to two years depending on complexity and number of sites. During our audits, we create a safety and environmental profile that shows if we are properly addressing the hazard potential. If this is not the case, we agree on corrective measures to be implemented within a certain time frame depending on the identified hazard potential. We monitor this in follow-up audits, among other things.\n\nIn the BASF Group in 2023, 120 environmental and safety audits were conducted at 72 sites (2022: 115 audits at 73 sites). The sites were audited based on their individual risk profile. Auditing of the sites acquired in 2020 from Solvay was interrupted due to local coronavirus restrictions in 2022 was continued and completed in the 2023 reporting year. In addition, eight sites were audited on occupational medicine and health protection (2022: 16).\n\nFor more information on occupational safety and health protection, see page 143 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  want  to  attract  and  retain  talents  for  our company and support them in their development. To do so, we strive to cultivate a working environment that inspires and connects people. It is founded on a culture of open leadership based  on  mutual  trust,  respect  and  dedication  to  top performance.\n\n## At a glance\n\n## 111,991\n\nEmployees around the world\n\n- \u25aa Global targets on employee engagement and promotion of women in leadership positions\n- \u25aa Focus topics in 2023: promoting diversity and supporting the resilience of teams, leaders and the organization\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur employees are key to the successful implementation of BASF's strategy. That is why we rely on our employees and leaders. We help them to develop the necessary skills to support our customers in the best possible way and provide them with the tools they need to do so. We promote a working atmosphere based on mutual trust with attractive working conditions, in which employees can develop their individual skills and potential. We want to further strengthen our employee engagement and innovative power through the inclusion of diversity. This also positions us to meet the challenges of an increasingly rapidly changing environment.\n\nNevertheless, attracting and retaining qualified employees presents us with an increasing number of challenges and risks. By offering\n\nvarious learning and development opportunities as well as attractive compensation and benefits, and with our commitment to supporting a  balance  between  personal  and  professional  life,  we  want  to maintain  our  reputation  as  an  attractive  employer.  In  order  to continue to attract and retain talents for our company in the future, we work continuously on BASF's attractiveness as an employer.

        "page_content": "## Employee engagement\n\nBASF can rely on the engagement of its employees. Employee surveys and pulse checks are used as feedback tools to actively involve employees in shaping their working environment. The results are communicated to employees, the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, among others.\n\nWe have performed regular global employee surveys since 2008, and since 2019, we have also recorded the employee engagement level as an index score based on the answers to five key questions. Overall, more than 84,400 employees worldwide participated in the 2023 survey (participation rate: 74% 1 ). The survey revealed an engagement index of 79%, which constitutes a drop of two percentage points compared with the previous year (2022: 81%). Our aim is to get this score back above 80%, the target defined in the BASF strategy. We support our leaders in addressing topics that help to strengthen employee engagement together with their teams in  a  decentralized  way.  In  addition,  in  2023,  we  launched  the centrally coordinated initiative 'Learn from the Best.' As part of the  initiative,  BASF  units  from  all  regions  that  have  achieved exceptionally high levels of employee engagement are presented. These examples serve not just as inspiration for others, but also promote cross-unit exchange.\n\n## What we expect from our leaders\n\nOur leaders and their teams should contribute to BASF's success. This is why we promote high-quality leadership and measure its impact. We understand impactful leadership as leaders that serve as role models by having - in line with our corporate values - a positive influence on the engagement and development of their employees,  and  by  developing  and  implementing  business strategies together with their teams. These aspects are part of the standard global nomination criteria for leadership positions.\n\nOur  leadership  culture  is  based  on  BASF's  corporate  values (see page 33) and our specific expectations of leaders' conduct are derived from these: The CORE Leadership Values serve as the guiding principles for all leaders and set out our expectations of leadership conduct. They are aligned with BASF's strategic goals and reflect our company's leadership vision.\n\nBy offering a wide range of targeted training and development opportunities for leaders at all levels, we help to ensure the future viability of BASF. We offer our leaders opportunities for each phase of their career as well as various formats that enable them to learn from one another and from external experts. We aim to develop leaders  who  lead  their  teams  with  professional  competence, optimism, empathy and trust, and in this way, create a competitive advantage for BASF.\n\nIn order to further anchor the CORE Leadership Values in dayto-day work, the focus topic Care and Coach for Performance was defined for our leadership training in 2023. We gave leaders impetus to work on the topic of resilience and to further strengthen their role as coaches (see page 135). These virtual training courses and inspirational events provided senior executives in particular with opportunities for self-reflection, global exchange, practicing and consolidating competencies and skills.\n\nTo identify and develop the best talent at an early stage, we also use  potential  assessments.  Among  other  things,  we  identify indicators for future leadership success and compare the skills already  developed  by  the  talents  with  the  requirements  for management tasks with greater responsibility. This enables us to offer  even  more  targeted  development  opportunities  and  help to further increase the quality and number of our potential leaders.\n\nRegular feedback plays an important role in the development of leaders. In 2023, we did not make it mandatory to use our global feedback  tool  FEEDback&forward.  Nevertheless,  800  leaders voluntarily used the tool and obtained valuable feedback from their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nteams. This corresponds to around 10% of our leaders. In 2024, we will make using our leadership feedback tool mandatory again.\n\n## Competition for talent\n\nAttracting  and  retaining  the  best  employees  is  crucial  to  our success. Having an attractive and compelling total offer package for employees  is  becoming  increasingly  important  considering  the strong global competition for the best qualified employees and leaders. This is why we are constantly working on measures to better appeal to talents worldwide and are increasingly using digital platforms such as our country-specific career websites as well as global and regional social networks.\n\nOur talent search activities in 2023 were based on a mix of face-to-face  events  and  digital  offerings.  For  example,  we  are represented  at  digital  trade  fairs  and  conferences.  This  virtual contact enables a demand-oriented,  flexible and  locationindependent approach. As a result, we were able to continue to attract and recruit talented employees.\n\nIn 2023, we introduced a new digital recruitment tool in Europe, North  America  and  South  America.  On  this  basis,  we  have established a global recruiting process. The new system offers improved  user-friendliness  and  is  designed  to  speed  up  the recruitment process. Artificial intelligence (AI) features enable people applying to BASF to match their CV with all job offers. The solution is scheduled for launch in Asia Pacific in 2024.\n\nWe  want  to  ensure  the  availability  of  qualified  employees  and safeguard existing knowledge today and in the years to come. At the BASF SE site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, we perform analyses to make the demographic situation for different operational job profiles transparent for the responsible leaders. On this basis, we offer specific measures for succession planning, knowledge sharing and moderated knowledge transfer. To combat the shortage of",

The skills  and competencies of our employees are critical for profitable growth and lasting success. For this reason, we want to further modernize our learning culture and step up our efforts to promote continuous, self-directed learning and learning from others. Employee development  at  BASF  is  underpinned  by  the  principle  that development opportunities and support are open to all employees.\n\nWe understand development as continuous learning by building individual experience and skills, further training or changing jobs. A trust-based relationship between employees and leaders as well as regular feedback through continuous meaningful conversations are crucial to employee development. These regular conversations can be initiated by both leaders or employees and take different forms leaders and employees can agree on this in the annual employee dialog.\n\nEmployees also define their individual learning objectives together with their leader as part of the continuous conversations. These are to be adapted to the specific requirements of the position concerned and future needs. Learning can take place in various formats and at different locations - at work, as social or formal training - depending on individual and workplace demands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur learning opportunities are available for a variety of employee development  needs:  starting  a  career,  expanding  knowledge, personal growth and leadership development. In 2023, we focused some  offers  on  strengthening  resilience  (see  page  135).  In addition, the many academies in the divisions and service units offer training on specific professional content. Since 2023, we have been offering Campus Events for newcomers in all regions to welcome them to BASF, share general information such as our strategy and give them the opportunity to network with each other.\n\nTo achieve our ambitious digitalization goals, we are focusing on digital skills development of our leaders and employees, as well as on agile transformation. One example of this is our training course on the current development of generative AI applications. We offer content on this topic for various target groups in the form of self-led learning paths, training courses and individual or group coaching. In  this  way,  we  want  to  enable  BASF  employees  to  gain  an understanding of data, data analysis and AI. After all, in order to exploit the full potential of AI solutions, it is essential to combine new technologies  with  the  experience  and  expertise  of  employees. Employees can gain practical experience using the chatBASF AI assistant.",

Resilient people can deal with difficulties more easily and use them as an opportunity for growth. For this reason, and in a challenging and increasingly rapidly changing environment, we focused on promoting resilience in the learning opportunities for leaders and in various opportunities for employees in 2023. Under the motto 'Care  and  Coach  for  Performance,'  we  offered  our  senior executives various training modules and learning opportunities in virtual formats. These also included training on how leaders can apply a coaching-oriented leadership style and make better use of their emotional intelligence. As role models and coaches, leaders can better promote the strengths of their team members and support them in their development.\n\nIn addition, we have provided leaders and employees with a wide range of resources and independent learning opportunities to inform themselves and develop their own skills. These included\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compensation and benefits\n\nWe want to attract and retain engaged and qualified employees, and motivate them to achieve top performance with a comprehensive package  that  includes  market-oriented  compensation,  benefits, individual development  opportunities and  a  good  working environment. Our employees' compensation is based on global compensation  principles according  to  position,  market  and performance. As a rule, compensation comprises fixed and variable components  as  well  as  benefits  that  often  exceed  legal requirements. In many countries, these benefits include company pension  benefits,  supplementary  health  insurance  and  share programs. We regularly review our compensation systems at the global  and  local  levels.  We  are  committed  to  the  U.N.  Global Compact's goal of paying employees a living wage to support them and their families by 2030. Since 2022, we have been conducting a global analysis to determine whether we pay employees such a wage and to close any gaps.\n\nWe want our employees to contribute to the company's success. This is why the compensation granted to the vast majority of our employees includes variable compensation components, with which they participate in the success of the BASF Group as a whole and are recognized for their individual performance. The same principles essentially apply for all employees worldwide. The amount of the variable component is determined by economic success as well as the employee's individual performance. We use the BASF Group's return on capital employed (ROCE) to measure economic success for  the  purposes  of  variable  compensation.  This  links variable compensation to  our  ROCE  target. 1 Individual  performance  is assessed as part of a globally consistent performance management process. In numerous Group companies, our 'plus' share program ensures  employees'  long-term  participation  in  the  company's success through incentive shares. In 2023, for example, around 26,700 employees worldwide (2022: around 27,100) participated in the 'plus' share program.\n\n- 1 In calculating compensation-relevant ROCE, adjustments are made for negative and positive special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures (for example, integration costs in connection with acquisitions and gains or losses from the divestiture of businesses) when these exceed a corridor of +/-1% of the average cost of capital basis.  An adjustment of compensation-relevant ROCE (in the first 12 months after closing) therefore only occurs in cases of exceptionally high special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nin particular strategies and rituals for self-care and caring for employees. It is important to us to enable teams to perform at their best, even in challenging situations, without neglecting their own health.  This  training  portfolio  was  supplemented  by  tailored initiatives from our Corporate Health Management (see page 145), as well as by regional and local offerings. In North America, we offer  digital  solutions  that  enable  affected  employees  to  take advantage of offers to improve their mental health, regardless of their location or working hours. Over the past five years, BASF has built up a network of employees in the United Kingdom and Ireland who act as first aiders for mental health issues (Mental Health First Aiders). They complement Corporate Health Management and can provide confidential advice and professional support to those who need it.",

The  four-year  program  takes  into  account  the development  of  the  total  shareholder  return.  It  incentivizes the achievement of strategic growth, profitability and sustainability targets. To take part in this program, participants must hold BASF shares, the amount of which is based on their individual fixed compensation.  In  2023,  around  93%  of  the  people  eligible  to participate in the long-term incentive program around the world did  so,  holding  between  30%  and  70%  of  their  fixed  annual compensation in BASF shares.\n\nThe  share  price-based  compensation  program  (BASF  option program, BOP), which had existed since 1999, was offered for the last time in 2020.

In the previous year, these amounted to \u20ac11,400 million. The decline was mainly due to the lower additions of bonus provisions, currency effects, particularly from the U.S. dollar and the Argentine peso, as well as lower pension expenses.

We want to strengthen their identification with the company and our position in the global competition for qualified personnel. We want to achieve this with a wide range of offerings aimed at employees in different phases of life. We have formulated global guidelines for more flexibility that regulate where, when and how employees can work. These opportunities have become an integral part of our employees' day-to-day work, job permitting. These include flexible working  hours,  part-time  employment,  remote  working,  and time-off options. Desk-sharing concepts support the new form of collaboration and create areas to withdraw as well as interaction spaces for sharing ideas and being creative together. There are also\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexternal and internal coworking opportunities that employees can take advantage of.\n\nWe  want  to  support  employees  in  achieving  a  better  work-life balance, for example in relation to childcare or caring for relatives, by offering additional services. We are continually working to expand these options.\n\nChildcare is essential for many parents and enables them to return to work more quickly. The BASF SE nursery LuKids is one of the largest company childcare facilities in Germany with a total of 260 places and offers demand-oriented all-day care. It is supplemented by flexibly bookable emergency childcare places via other providers and children's holiday programs. We also offer employees at other sites in Germany and North America, for example, support with childcare or childcare solutions for emergencies.\n\nAt  many  sites  worldwide,  we  offer  our  employees  professional support with stressful situations in their personal and professional lives. In Germany, this is done by the BASF Stiftung's social and life counseling service, for example, and is increasingly also offered at sites outside of Ludwigshafen.\n\nAs part of our global Corporate Health Management, we support employees in strengthening their mental and physical health and adapting their health behavior accordingly, among other things (see page 145).\n\n- For more information on BASF Stiftung, see basf.com/international\\_donations\n\n<!-- image -->",

This also applies to dialog with our employees.\n\nOur employees have the opportunity to form, join and support legally recognized trade unions or employee representatives. These are entitled to represent employees and their interests in collective bargaining. BASF upholds these rights and has anchored this in the Group-wide guideline on compliance with international labor norms.\n\nTrust-based  cooperation  with  employee  representatives  is  an important  component  of  our  corporate  culture.  Our  open  and continual dialog lays the foundation for balancing the interests of the company and its employees, even in challenging situations. In 2023, this underpinned our efforts to manage the effects of the war of aggression in Ukraine and the corresponding increases in energy prices, as well as the current restructuring programs. In the case of organizational changes or if restructuring leads to staff downsizing, for example, or in the case of other codetermination-relevant topics, we involve employee representatives at an early stage to develop socially  responsible  implementation  measures.  Our  actions  are aligned with the respective legal regulations and the agreements reached, as well as operational conditions.\n\nBy focusing our discussions on the local and regional situations, we aim to find tailored solutions to the different challenges and legal conditions for each site.

We connect people with different backgrounds, views and perspectives on an equal footing. Promoting and valuing diversity across all hierarchical levels is an integral part of our strategy and is also embedded in our corporate values.\n\nEmployees  should  be  able  to  contribute  their individual perspectives and skills in an inclusive working environment. As a global company, we serve many different customer needs. We want to reflect, value and promote this diversity among our employees in order to increase their creativity, motivation and sense of belonging to BASF.\n\nPromoting  diversity  has  positive  consequences  for  BASF,  for example through having an inclusive working environment and a more diverse workforce. Negative consequences could arise if our employees lose their sense of belonging, we are no longer perceived as an attractive employer or not all customers feel that we appeal to them. We systematically record short and long-term opportunities and risks as part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 182 onward).\n\nWe expect our leaders to create an inclusive working environment and promote diversity. This is why it is one of our focal points in our leadership development. For example, our leaders learned about promoting openness as part of the CORE Leadership Values online training  series.  This  training  supports  them  in  what  they  can specifically do to make the work environment more inclusive for all\n\n## This page:\n\nPeople around the world show their support for the LGBTQI+ community during Pride month in June.

With the Diversity Moments format, we offer teams concise information,  everyday  examples  and  reflection  exercises  on  the topic of diversity and inclusion. In 2023, as part of the global employee survey (see page 133), we again used the inclusion index as a relevant point of reference for the inclusion of our employees and provided our leaders with suggestions for follow-up measures.\n\nIn Brazil, there is an initiative to attract, retain and include people with disabilities in BASF. Among other things, we are focusing on improving the accessibility of our Brazilian sites and our internal and external communication channels. With further measures as part of the initiative, we want to ensure that we consider more people with disabilities in the recruitment process and offer them specific training opportunities. The project team works closely with leaders, the  HR  department  and  the  local  network  of  employees  with disabilities.",

The Shadow Board is made up of younger employees and advises the leadership team on strategic and operational topics. Using this reverse monitoring approach, we want to broaden and enrich the perspectives of the leadership team and bridge the gap between hierarchical levels and between generations.\n\nWe also promote diversity in the selection and development of our leaders. We have set a global target to promote female leadership and aim to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions to 30% by 2030. We have made important progress toward this and continually  review  our  target.  In  the  BASF  Group,  the  global proportion of female leaders with disciplinary responsibility was 28.4% at the end of 2023 (2022: 27.2%).\n\nTo enable our management to monitor progress toward this target, we have developed a global dashboard that is used to regularly review the status of implementation. The systematic advancement\n\nof women is an integral part of our process for selecting senior executives and is regularly addressed in strategic dialogs with the divisions at the level of the Board of Executive Directors and in the Board's strategic talent discussions.

We are also involved in other external initiatives to promote inclusion of diversity and equal opportunities in the workplace, such as the Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) initiative.

BASF has been an active member of the World Business Council for Sustainable  Development (WBCSD)  since  1999.  We cofounded the Global Battery Alliance (GBA) in 2017. The aim of the GBA is to develop standards and tools to steer a sustainable value chain for batteries. In 2019, we cofounded the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) to drive forward solutions that reduce and avoid the disposal of plastic waste in the environment, in particular in the ocean.

Our aim is to contribute to improving people's quality of life and make a positive contribution to society.\n\nOne example of our contribution to public health is the  cooperation with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) and Promega.  Swiss  TPH  is  researching  and  developing  novel insecticides to combat mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria. The collaboration began in September 2022 and is expected to span a three to five-year study. Its focus is on proteolysis-targeting chimera  (PROTACs),  small  therapeutic  molecules  that  degrade specific proteins within cells. This innovative approach holds great potential for effectively and cost-efficiently combating insect-borne diseases. With the support of BASF in molecular research and funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, preliminary results from this collaboration are anticipated by 2025.\n\nEducation is key to personal success and the future viability of society. That is why BASF is committed to working with partners at numerous sites to achieve greater educational equality , especially for disadvantaged children and young people. Science education\n\nand  education  for  sustainable  development  are  particularly important to us. For 26 years now, children and young people in 45  countries  have  been  able  to  take  part  in  experiments  in BASF Kids' Labs. The Virtual Lab program was expanded this year to include the ProtAct17 app. The mobile app is designed to teach children aged 8 and up to protect the environment and to take action in line with the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals. ProtAct17 imparts knowledge in an age-appropriate and interactive way, arouses curiosity and the spirit of research and addresses  current  and  future  challenges  for  the  environment, economy and society. Above all, the app shows what - albeit small - possibilities young researchers have for taking action.\n\nIn this year's Young Voices for a Sustainable Future project, which BASF initiated in 2022 together with the nongovernmental organization JA Worldwide, more than 1,000 young people from eight countries were once again able to address the impacts of climate change in their communities with their ideas. Supported by more than 100 BASF employees, the young people looked at how they can tackle challenges in their communities. For example, they discussed how to reduce the risk of forest fires in Greece and how to  manufacture  resource-saving  products  from  alternative  raw materials in Indonesia.\n\nWe aim to create long-term value for BASF and society with new business models and cross-sector partnerships. Our intrapreneurship program, Starting Ventures , helps people from low-income areas to improve their economic opportunities and their quality of life. The program also provides access to new markets and partners, and contributes  to  reaching  the  SDGs.  Eight  new  Starting  Ventures projects were selected for implementation in December 2022. BASF is tackling challenges on the ground together with local partners and contributing to the SDGs with entrepreneurial ideas, technical expertise and time resources.",

As part of the Highland Food Systems Starting Ventures project, project partner International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) is helping smallholders in Kenya store potato harvests and seeds safely. To this end, IFDC is providing the smallholders with low-cost, insulated containers with a capacity of 60 metric tons, which have been produced with the help of BASF's Elastospray LWP system. The project also aims to empower 100 women and young people to find employment or set up their own businesses.\n\n## BASF Group expenses for societal engagement activities 1\n\n## ~\u20ac37 million\n\nAt  our  headquarters  in  Ludwigshafen,  Germany,  we  want  to strengthen civil society with a number of projects, such as the LUnited project. The aim of the project is to find gaps and potential for action to further promote engagement in and around the city of Ludwigshafen.  In  2023,  BASF  supported  the  German  National Garden Show in Mannheim as a partner. A special experience space with  an  interactive  exhibition  illustrated  BASF's  contribution  to sustainable solutions. Around 130,000 people took advantage of this program. We also ran experimentation programs for families and school classes on the topics of sustainability, climate and energy. The experiments gave older school classes an insight into technical professions. In an outdoor area shared with John Deere, we held 12 action and dialog days on the topic of experiencing agriculture.\n\nIn the area of international development cooperation, we support the independent charitable BASF Stiftung with donations for its international  projects  in  cooperation  with  various  organizations. The 2023 year-end donation campaign in favor of BASF Stiftung\n\nsupported the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, so that more  children  in  Afghanistan  can  get  access  to  education. BASF topped up the donations made by employees of participating German Group companies to a total of around \u20ac335,000.\n\nIn  2023,  BASF  also  supported  those  affected  by  humanitarian disasters.  Following  the  earthquakes  in  Turkey  and  Syria  and the payment of \u20ac500,000 in emergency aid, BASF launched an employee donation campaign in which more than \u20ac844,000 was donated  worldwide.  BASF  doubled  the  amount  to  more  than \u20ac1.6  million, which is available for reconstruction in the affected regions. In addition, \u20ac300,000 in emergency aid went to the German Red Cross for people affected by the earthquake in Morocco.\n\nFor more information on Starting Ventures, see basf.com/en/starting-ventures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our societal engagement around the world, see basf.com/en/engagement\n\nFor more information on societal engagement at our sites, see ludwigshafen.basf.de/en\n\n<!-- image -->",

To ensure safe working conditions we rely on comprehensive preventive measures in occupational safety and health protection. Our comprehensive safety concepts are designed to provide the best possible protection for our employees and contractors.\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nBASF's long-term economic success is closely linked to the health and well-being as well as the productivity of our employees. In the research and production of chemicals, some of our employees handle hazardous substances and operate complex systems and machines. Potential risks arise as a result, which we aim to minimize through  comprehensive  preventive  measures.  We  systematically record opportunities and risks in the area of occupational safety and health  protection  as  part  of  our  general  opportunity  and  risk management (see page 178 onward).\n\nWe set binding global standards for occupational safety and health protection. Our health and safety management covers all employees worldwide. Our sites and Group companies are responsible for implementing and complying with Group-wide requirements and local standards. They are supported in this task by global networks\n\n## This page:\n\nScheduled turnarounds of our production plants harbor risks for work process-related injuries due to nonroutine work and the increased use of contractors. Special initiatives, such as the conduct-based 'Consistently safe!' ('Konsequent sicher!') program at the large-scale turnaround of the styrene plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany, reinforce safety management with holistic approaches to correctly assess risks and establish a common safety culture.\n\n- 1 In 2023, we adapted our safety targets.\n\n## 2030   target 1\n\nReduce our worldwide number of High Severity Work Process Related Injuries per 200,000 working hours a to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a  Hours worked by BASF employees, temporary workers and contractors\n\nof experts.

In the reporting year, we adjusted our occupational safety target and the related reporting based on a Group-wide  definition  and  are  now  focusing  on  high-severity injuries (see 'Occupational safety').\n\nWe document and analyze accidents as well as their causes and consequences  in  detail  at  a  global  level  to  learn  from  them. We  consider  the  systematic  hazard  assessments  and  the  risk minimization measures derived from them an important prevention tool. With these and a culture of dealing openly with mistakes, division  and  site -specific  safety  activities,  ongoing  qualification measures and dialog across BASF's global network, we want to strengthen risk awareness among our employees and contractors,\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023, we achieved an HSI rate of 0.03. We have set ourselves the goal of reducing high-severity work process-related injuries to a rate of no more than 0.05 HSI per 200,000  working hours by 2030. 1 By focusing on high-severity work process-related injuries, we want to make our employees' working environment even safer.\n\nDespite our efforts, there was one fatal work-related injury in 2023 (2022: 1), in which two people lost their lives. Two contractors suffered fatal injuries in a car accident on a business trip in Brazil. BASF is assisting the authorities in determining the circumstances and cause of the accident.\n\nTo  prevent  work  process-related  injuries,  we  encourage  and promote  risk-conscious  behavior  and  safe  working  practices, learning from incidents and regular dialog. That is why we are constantly  refining  and  enhancing  our  global  requirements  and training.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' We encourage and promote riskconscious and safe working practices.\n\n## Dr. Johannes Heinemann\n\nIn addition to the legally required briefings, BASF requires new employees and contractors to complete compulsory health and safety training . Employees at our production sites also receive regular training on the safe handling of chemicals and the correct use of personal protective equipment.\n\nWe do everything we can to prevent injuries and use our findings to take appropriate measures to prevent these from happening again, as  far  as  possible.  These  include  regular  campaigns  and informational events to raise employees' awareness. Many events and initiatives over the course of 2023 focused on further developing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe safety culture, such as a course on the safe handling of forklifts as part of the EHS Culture of Excellence initiative in North America.\n\nLeaders play a key role in the safety culture as role models, which is why  environmental  protection,  health  and  safety  are  discussed with  newly  appointed  senior  executives.  Senior  executives  with particular responsibility for such topics, for example, in production, also  receive  specific  further  training  to  be  able  to  meet  their responsibilities.\n\nTo further improve our processes and methods, we evaluate trends in  data,  analyze  accidents  and  potential  incidents,  and  share knowledge and best practices within our global network of experts and as part of safety initiatives. We also seek dialog with government institutions and are actively involved in external occupational safety initiatives and networks around the world led, for example, by the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) or national associations such as the German Chemical Industry Association and the American Chemistry Council.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on process safety, see page 127 onward\n\nFor more information on occupational safety, see basf.com/occupational\\_safety",

The BASF health checks form the foundation of our global health promotion program and are offered to employees at regular intervals.\n\nWe also systematically raise employee awareness of health topics with offerings tailored to specific target groups. One example is the Global  Health  Campaign.  In  2023,  we  chose  a  decentralized approach in which the regions and sites could focus on locally relevant health aspects. In North America, for example, the focus was on mindfulness in the professional and private environment. The Take a Moment campaign focused, among other things, on dealing with shift work and mental health. Specific health campaigns were offered at a total of over 459 sites in 2023.\n\nWe measure our performance in health protection using the Health Performance Index (HPI). It comprises five components: recognized occupational diseases, medical emergency drills, first aid, preventive medicine and health promotion. Each component contributes a maximum of 0.2 to the total score, meaning that the highest possible score is 1.0. We aim to achieve a value of more than 0.9 every year. With an HPI of 0.96, we once again achieved this in 2023 (2022: 0.96).\n\nIn  2023,  44  work-related  illnesses  among  BASF  employees worldwide were documented as recognized occupational diseases (2022:  38).  The  main  recognized  occupational  diseases  are occupational asthma, hearing loss, skin diseases, musculoskeletal disorders and cancer.\n\nAnother  focus  in  2023  was  on  influenza  prevention.  BASF employees could be vaccinated against seasonal flu at many sites around  the  world.  At  the  Ludwigshafen  site  in  Germany,  for example, around 3,850  employees participated in the influenza vaccination campaign.\n\n- For more information on occupational medicine, health campaigns and the HPI, see basf.com/health\n\n## Case study\n\n## New Medical Center for comprehensive medical care\n\nIn 2023, BASF opened a new Medical Center in Ludwigshafen, Germany. The aim is to secure our employees' health and ensure that they remain able to work despite the rising average age by strengthening medical care at the site in the long term.\n\nAlongside  examination  and  training  rooms  and  offices,  it  houses state-of-the-art medical diagnostic facilities. In addition to the clinic, the Medical  Center  accommodates  eight  external  specialist  and  medical facilities, a physiotherapy practice and a pharmacy. With the exception of the occupational and emergency medicine section reserved for BASF employees,  all  facilities  are  also  available  to  our  neighbors  in  the surrounding districts of Ludwigshafen.\n\nOccupational medicine has a long history at BASF: A document from 1866 shows that the first factory doctor was employed at BASF just one year after the company was founded. This also marks the beginning of the first company medical service in the chemical industry in Germany, long before statutory obligations existed.\n\n- For more information on the Medical Center see medicalcenter.basf.com/en\n\n<!-- image -->",

We continuously work on ensuring our products pose no risk to people or the environment when they are used responsibly and in the manner intended. A thorough safety and risk assessment enables us to serve markets with safe and sustainable products that meet regulatory requirements while responding to trends.\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nAs a chemical company, we have products in our portfolio with physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties that may have negative effects on people and the environment if handled incorrectly.  We  are  committed  to  continuously  minimizing  these effects and to the ongoing further development of the safety and sustainability of our products. This commitment to product safety is enshrined in our Responsible Care \u00ae charter and the initiatives of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). We aim to comply  with  all  relevant  national  and  international  laws  and regulations. At the same time, we strive to meet the requirements of our customers worldwide with our products and contribute to the development of a sustainable future in many areas (see sustainable portfolio management on page 48). We systematically record short and long-term opportunities and risks in the area of product safety as part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 177 onward).\n\nOur global requirements define rules, processes and responsibilities, for example, to ensure uniformly high product safety standards worldwide. Our sites and Group companies are responsible for implementing and complying with internal and legal requirements. This is regularly audited by the Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center. BASF's\n\nBefore our products are launched on the market, they undergo various tests and assessments - depending on legal requirements and their application profile. Our aim here is to identify potential hazard characteristics as well as health and environmental risks at an  early  stage.  Based  on  the  results,  we  derive  precautionary and protective measures and develop recommendations for safe handling - from production to application and disposal.\n\nWe  document  environmental,  health  and  safety  data  and  the assessments thereof for all of our substances and products in a global database . This information is continuously updated. The database forms the basis for communicating this information in our safety data sheets, for example, which we make available to our customers in around 40 languages. These include information on the physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties of products, potential hazards, first aid measures, measures to be taken in the case of accidental release, and disposal. Our global emergency  hotline  network  enables  us  to  provide  information around the clock. To ensure that people who buy, sell, use, transport or dispose of our products can quickly find out about our products and the risks associated with them, we use the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) to classify and label our products around the world, provided this is legally permissible in the country concerned. We take into account any national or regional modifications within the GHS framework, such as the E.U.'s regulation on the classification, labeling and  packaging  of  substances  and  mixtures  (CLP Regulation, Classification, Labelling, Packaging).\n\nIf necessary, we advise our customers on product safety. We set guidelines on the safe transport of dangerous goods for our logistics service providers worldwide (see page 130). We also train our employees worldwide on the proper handling and use of selected products with particular hazard potential.\n\nIn  associations  and  together  with  other  manufacturers,  BASF supports the establishment of voluntary global commitments to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprevent  the  misuse  of  chemicals.  We  are  also  involved  at national and international level in various initiatives to further develop risk  assessments,  such  as  that  of  the  European  Centre  for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC).\n\n## Global chemicals regulations\n\nMost of the products we manufacture are subject to statutory chemicals regulations. We are bound by the relevant regional and national chemicals regulations, which continue to grow in number worldwide. Examples include REACH in the E.U., UK REACH in the United Kingdom, KKDIK in Turkey, K-REACH in South Korea and TSCA in the United States. BASF Group companies work closely together with a global network of experts to ensure that BASF complies with the applicable regulations.\n\nIn Europe, the European Commission has developed a road map that  will  bring  about  far-reaching  changes  to  the  regulation  of chemicals in Europe in the coming years: the European Green Deal and, as part of this, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS). BASF supports the objectives of the Green Deal in principle but sees a need for adjustment, greater clarity and predictability, particularly in regulatory matters. It is necessary to strike a balance between achieving the ambitions of the CSS and safeguarding the long-term competitiveness  and  future  viability  of  the  European  chemical industry. As part of the ongoing clarification process, we therefore seek  dialog  with  all  relevant  stakeholders  and  advocate  for  a science-based and innovation-driven development of the regulatory framework.\n\n## Animal welfare in environmental and toxicological testing\n\nBefore launching products on the market, we subject them to a variety of tests, including environmental and toxicological tests using state-of-the-art knowledge and technology. If these tests include animal studies, this is generally required by law and necessary to reliably evaluate the safety and efficacy of our products. If we employ",

In addition, we are involved in networks  such  as  the  European  Partnership  for  Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) to further develop alternative methods across sectors.\n\nOur aim is to replace, reduce or refine animal studies to minimize the impact on them. For example, we use an OECD-certified alternative testing  strategy  developed  jointly  with  Givaudan  for  animal-free testing  of  allergic  skin  reactions.  We  also  use  other  alternative methods  wherever  possible.  In  2022,  BASF  SE's  Experimental Toxicology and Ecology became the first institute in the world to be certified for Good In Vitro Method Practices (GIVIMP). GIVIMP is a standard published by the OECD. It increases the quality of data generated  by  in  vitro  test  methods  and  confidence  in  newly developed nonanimal testing methods.\n\n## Management of nano- and biotechnology\n\nNanotechnology and biotechnology offer solutions for key societal challenges - such as environmental and climate protection and health  and  nutrition.  For  example,  nanomaterials  can  improve battery performance and biocatalytic methods can increase process resource  efficiency.  We  want  to  harness  the  potential  of  both technologies. Using them safely and responsibly is our top priority. Safe handling of nanomaterials is stipulated in our Nanotechnology Code  of  Conduct,  for  instance.  With  regard  to  the  safety assessment and regulatory compliance of nano and particulate materials, BASF participated in the NanoHarmony, MACRAME and Nanomet projects funded by the European Union in 2023. The results were documented and communicated in publications with BASF's involvement. Furthermore, the findings will be incorporated into the OECD Test Guidelines Programme in order to develop valid and  standardized  test  methods  for  the  safety  assessment  of nano- and particulate materials.\n\n- For more information on NanoHarmony, see nanoharmony.eu\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the Nanomet project, see oecd.org/chemicalsafety/nanomet\n\n<!-- image -->",

Quality defects can have potential  negative  effects  on  people  and  the  environment.  We prevent  these  with  our  quality  management.  We  systematically record opportunities and risks in the area of quality as part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 177 onward).\n\nOur quality management supports BASF's strategy and focuses on our customers by taking their needs as well as those of consumers and  other  stakeholders  into  account.  Our  quality  management system comprises central requirements and processes along the value chain, which are defined by the Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center. Local implementation of these is the responsibility of our business units and sites. Quality management is monitored on a decentralized basis via a comprehensive internal audit system in accordance with ISO standards.\n\n## Quality Management System\n\nOur Quality Management System is based on the plan-do-checkact approach and focuses on planning, implementation, evaluation and action. It is risk-based, process-oriented and focused on the satisfaction of our  customers  and  stakeholders.  Mandatory elements  are  set  out  in  global  requirements.  These  include requirements for core processes such as nonconformity management, handling of product recalls and change management.\n\nOur  quality  management  includes  the  consistent  handling  of incidents that relate to product quality. A core element in this context is accessibility for and communication with affected customers and stakeholders in order to be able to react as quickly as possible and  initiate  appropriate  measures  such  as  product  recalls  or withdrawals. In further steps, we systematically work through the incidents and identify and eliminate causes. This includes all our customers and products, in particular products with inherent hazard potential, which entail specific documentation requirements. We are committed to handling the data of our customers and suppliers with particular care. During the current reporting year, only individual product quality incidents relating to individual items or batches of items are known to us. These were addressed, processed and monitored directly by our operating divisions.\n\nA key focus in the implementation of our quality management is on interlinking our targets and business-related requirements with the opportunities and risks identified by our operating divisions. This decentralized approach allows us to adapt our quality management to  the  requirements  of  BASF's  diverse  business  areas  in  the individual  operating  divisions.  We  apply  quality  management methods  commonly  used  in  the  chemical  industry,  including management  of  change,  quality  assurance  and  control  and development processes. In addition to appropriate documentation and the systematic development of expertise through training, our approach also includes regular internal audits. The results of these audits are taken into account alongside other indicators in the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinuous review of the management systems. If necessary, we revise their strategic and organizational alignment.\n\nAs part of World Quality Week, we draw our employees' attention to the importance of quality. In 2023, we offered a range of activities based on the theme 'Quality: realizing your competitive potential,' to exchange ideas internally and with customers, learn from each other and for levers to improve our quality performance.\n\n## External certification\n\nWe pursue a decentralized certification approach for our business units and Group companies. This takes into account local needs, internal and legal requirements, and our customers' requirements. Our Responsible Care audit system complies with the ISO 19011 standard  and  is  certified  according  to  ISO  9001.

Our products and technologies help them master this complex task. We are committed to the responsible and ethical use of our products throughout their entire life cycle.\n\nAs global demand for agricultural products and solutions grows, so does  the  pressure  on  farmers.  They  are  expected  to  produce healthy and affordable food and, at the same time, reduce CO2 emissions, minimize land use and preserve biodiversity. With our integrated  solutions,  we  help  farmers  find  a  balance  between economic, environmental and societal demands. High-performance seeds from BASF help to achieve a higher yield and improve the quality  of  the  harvest.  Our  innovative  crop  protection  products reduce crop losses caused by insect pests, weeds and fungal diseases. Our digital solutions enable, among other things, better soil management and more targeted use of fertilizers and crop protection products by taking important parameters such as plant health, weed density or weather data directly into account during application.\n\nIn 2023, we invested \u20ac900 million in research and development in the  Agricultural  Solutions  segment,  which  represents  9%  of segment sales. Our innovation pipeline has a peak sales potential of more than \u20ac7.5 billion for products launched by 2033.  The main\n\n## This page:\n\nDrones can be used to increase safety and productivity in agriculture. The main advantages compared with conventional backpack spraying are optimized use of crop protection products, reduced risk of product contact during spraying and high efficiency in application and collection of information. BASF supports the training of drone pilots with various programs.\n\nfocus here is sustainability, with four key areas: more climate-smart farming,  more  sustainable  solutions,  digital  farming  and  smart stewardship (see box on page 36).\n\n## Strategy\n\nMisuse  of  our  crop  protection  and  seed  products  can  have  a negative impact on human health and the environment. We are therefore focusing our smart stewardship activities on education and continuously improving our solutions for farmers. Alongside aspects such as efficacy and productivity, this also includes safe use by our customers and impact on the environment. We consider the entire life cycle of our products - from research and development to their proper use and disposal.\n\nCrop protection products and seeds are highly regulated at national and international level, which brings with it strict requirements for registering and re-registering active ingredients and crop systems. Regulatory approval is only granted after comprehensive proof has been provided showing that our products are safe for humans, animals and the environment when used in the manner intended.\n\nAs a member of the CropLife International industry association, we are committed to complying with the standards on the research, registration and distribution of crop protection products set out in the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management issued by  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO).  We  are  also\n\n<!-- image -->",

In our use of biotechnology, we are guided by the respective code of conduct set out by CropLife International and adhere to the relevant standards and legal regulations governing production and marketing.\n\nPotential  risks  of  our  products  are  assessed  and  minimized throughout the research, development and registration process, and on an ongoing basis following market registration. We regularly conduct scientific studies and tests, including on modes of action, (eco)toxicological properties and possible residues. This ensures that,  as  far  as  possible,  our  registration  dossiers  address  all questions on potential environmental and health effects.\n\nWe adapt our portfolio to the specific requirements of regional markets as customer requirements, crops, soils, climate conditions, plant  diseases  and  farming  practices  vary  around  the  world. Consequently, product registrations differ from country to country. Distribution  generally  requires  registration  and  approval  of  our products in accordance with the respective national regulations.\n\n## Crop protection\n\nBASF adheres to the International Code of Conduct issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the management of crop protection products. These  are  only  marketed  once  they  have  been  approved  by the competent authorities. We no longer sell WHO Class 1A or 1B products  (high  acute  oral  and  dermal  toxicity),  even  if  formal approvals exist. Depending on availability, we offer our customers alternatives.\n\nAll of BASF's crop protection products can be used safely under local farming conditions if the information and directions on the label are followed. If they have any questions, complaints or issues, our\n\ncustomers can contact us through various channels, for example, by calling the telephone number printed on all product labels, using the contact forms on our websites or by approaching our sales employees directly.\n\nWe record all product incidents relating to health or the environment that come to our attention in a global database. If necessary, we take  appropriate  measures  on  the  basis  of  this  information  to minimize preventable incidents.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' We are committed to only considering chemical measures for crop protection if they are necessary and no other effective options are available.\n\n## Dr. Volker Laabs\n\nThese include updating the instructions for use on product labels. We communicate these changes and general recommendations on the safe use of our products through channels such as our global training and education activities.\n\nOne of the ways we meet our commitment to product stewardship is by offering a wide range of courses and training on the safe storage, handling, use and disposal of our products. This ranges from on-site events to handouts and digital offerings and is aimed at farmers, retailers, advisors and other users. In India, for example, BASF launched  the  Suraksha  Hamesha  program.  Suraksha  Hamesha means 'safety all the time.' The program creates a platform for educating farmers and other users of crop protection products about the nine steps of responsible use of crop protection products and personal protection. Through Suraksha Hamesha, BASF has trained over 36,000 agricultural workers in India in 2023. BASF also\n\ninvolves government agencies and the central government's farm extension teams to support and promote farm safety. In addition, we reached over 10 million people through digital information and training and informed them on safety in agriculture.\n\nAs part of our smart stewardship activities, we particularly make use of the possibilities offered by digital and technological solutions to enable  our  customers  to  handle  our  products  responsibly.  In Thailand, for example, 143 drone pilots were trained in the safe use of crop protection products as part of the 'We make it fly' program since  2021.  Approximately  20,000  switched  from  backpack spraying to the safe drone application in 2023.\n\nWe also work closely together with associations such as CropLife International and CropLife Europe to promote the safe and proper use  of  crop  protection  products.  For  example,  we  support stewardship initiatives of both associations and various programs on the proper disposal and  recycling of product containers. Technological innovations developed together with industry partners also help to make using crop protection products easier and safer. Examples  include  the  closed  transfer  systems  easyconnect  in Europe and the Wisdom system in South America.\n\n## Seeds\n\nOur biotechnology activities and our research and development capabilities  comprise  advanced  breeding  techniques,  analytics, technology platforms and trait validation. To offer tailor-made, more sustainable crop solutions, our gene identification work focuses on those  plant  characteristics  that  enable  higher  yield  and  better quality, disease resistance and tolerance of environmental factors such as drought. We apply state-of-the-art scientific methods such as  genetic  engineering  and  selective  genome  editing.  Genome editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas and other pioneering tools in modern biosciences offer numerous opportunities for innovative solutions,  for  example,  in  the  fields  of  health,  agriculture  and industrial applications.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  consider  the protection  of  our  employees,  sites,  plants,  information  and communication  systems  and  our  intellectual  property  against interference by third parties to be vitally important. We systematically record physical and transitory risks from corporate, information and cybersecurity as part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 178 onward).\n\nA global team is responsible for our corporate security . To ensure rapid and effective implementation of security measures, we have defined appropriate structures and processes and laid them down in binding Group-wide requirements. Our sites and Group companies are responsible for implementing and complying with these internal requirements  and  the  legal  specifications.  The  Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center conducts regular audits to monitor this.\n\nResponsibility for information and cybersecurity lies with the Chief Financial Officer, who is also the Chief Digital Officer. The Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for the strategic direction. A global cybersecurity team is tasked with protecting BASF's IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) systems against hacker attacks and ensuring information security. In order to initiate and monitor suitable security measures, the organization is structured according to a global best practice framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover). Our IT security management system,  which  is  certified  in  accordance  with  DIN  EN  ISO/IEC\n\n27001:2017,  is  the  main  tool  for  managing  information  and cybersecurity  in  the  BASF  Group.  It  is  crucial  to  ensure  the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and IT infrastructure while demonstrating compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We  want  to  use  the  system  to  meet  regulatory  compliance requirements  for  our  critical  infrastructure.  The  Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality unit in the Corporate Center conducts regular audits to monitor this.\n\n## Corporate security\n\nOne cornerstone of corporate security is site security. The tasks performed by our security teams range from access controls at our sites to defense against industrial espionage. Aspects of human rights relevant to site security are a component of the global code of  conduct  and  qualification  requirements  for  our  internal  and external security personnel.\n\nFor  investment  projects  and  strategic  plans,  we  analyze  the potential safety and security risks, and define appropriate safety and security concepts. Our guiding principle is to identify risks for the company at an early stage, assess them and derive appropriate safeguards.\n\nWe inform business travelers and transferees about appropriate protection measures prior to and during travel in countries with elevated security risks. We  continuously  adjust  our  travel recommendations.  With  a  globally  standardized  travel  search system, we are able to locate and contact employees in affected areas following serious incidents.\n\n## Information and cybersecurity\n\nInformation security and cybersecurity are becoming increasingly important for our company. In addition to protecting data and IT infrastructure, they form the basis for successful digitalization and the implementation of new business models. BASF applies the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'security by design' principle to critically review and optimize IT applications from a cybersecurity perspective as early as the design phase. We are continually improving our ability to prevent, detect and react to security incidents with various measures and training offers.\n\nAround  the  world,  we  work  to  sensitize  our  employees  about protecting information and know-how. In 2023, we continued to raise  employees'  risk  awareness  with  regular  mandatory  online training for all employees and complementary offerings such as seminars, case studies and interactive training. Our global network of information protection officers comprises around 600 employees. They support the implementation of our uniform requirements and hold events and seminars on secure behaviors. Around 70,000 employees were trained on the basics of cybersecurity and information protection in 2023.",

BASF  is  also active in initiatives such as Together for Sustainability (TfS) and Responsible Care \u00ae . We have also integrated human  rights-related evaluations into our governance  and decision-making processes, for example for investments, acquisitions  and  divestitures.  In  2023,  for  example,  we  began working  with  partners,  local  authorities  and  nongovernmental organizations in Indonesia at an early stage, long before a potential investment decision, to analyze and evaluate in detail whether and how we could build a nickel-cobalt refining complex in a responsible manner, also taking into account the rights of indigenous peoples (see page 126).\n\nIn our Human Rights Expert Working Group , steered by our compliance department, experts from various areas of our company work closely together to holistically assess and refine our approach to human rights due diligence. In this way, we want to ensure that we approach our human rights responsibility in a comprehensive way  and  that  we  can  continually  improve  our  performance. The  expert  working  group  includes  employees  from  specialist departments  -  Corporate  Compliance,  Global  Procurement, Corporate Legal, Corporate Human  Resources,  Corporate Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality, Corporate Strategy & Sustainability, Site Security, Corporate Communications and  Governmental  Relations  -  and  our  operating  divisions. It provides support and advice in challenging and critical situations, on the development of internal processes, and on the creation of information and training offerings, among other things. In 2023, for example, a mandatory guideline with additional due diligence steps was introduced to further protect the rights of third-party workers in higher-risk countries.\n\n## International labor and social standards\n\nOur aim of acting responsibly toward our employees is embedded in our global Code of Conduct and our Policy Statement on Human Rights through our voluntary commitment to respecting international labor and social standards. This voluntary commitment\n\nencompasses internationally recognized labor norms as stipulated in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy of the International Labour Organization (ILO). In order to meet the requirement to comply with these standards worldwide, we mainly approach our adherence to international labor and social standards using three elements: the Compliance Program (including compliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as with employee representatives or international organizations) and the BASF guideline on compliance with international labor norms, which applies Group -wide. This guideline concretizes the topics in our global Code of Conduct under 'Human rights, labor and social standards' as these relate to our employees and leaders worldwide. An additional guideline specifies that these topics must also be considered and applied when working with agency workers and freelancers. Regular training courses on these topics are held for the managing directors and employees of the BASF Group.\n\nThis  forms  the  basis  for  our  global,  risk-based  management process: We regularly monitor changes to the national law of all the countries in which BASF operates and evaluate our adherence to international labor and social standards. If the national law contains no or lower requirements, action plans are drawn up to close these gaps. If conflicts with national law or practices arise, we strive to act in  accordance  with  our  values  and  internationally  recognized principles without violating the law of the country concerned. As part of  the  management  process,  we  regularly  follow  up  on  and document the results of the comparison between national law and our guideline, as well as measures to implement the guideline. This is part of our central due diligence system.\n\nWe monitor our voluntary commitment to international labor and social standards as part of our management process. Individual elements of the guideline are also reviewed as part of internal control processes  such  as  Responsible  Care  audits  at  BASF  Group companies.  In  addition  to  these  quality  assurance  measures, compliance  with  international  labor  and  social  standards  is  an\n\n## Good to know\n\n## Human Rights Advisory Council\n\nWe established a Human Rights Advisory Council in 2020 to integrate external expertise. Its members include independent international human rights experts. The trust-based dialog on human rights topics helps us to better understand different perspectives and to deal more openly with critical situations.\n\nThe meetings held in 2023 were once again attended by representatives from the Corporate Compliance and Corporate Strategy & Sustainability departments as well as other experts from the operating divisions.\n\nThe Council provided an external perspective, for example, on our internal guidelines on the responsible procurement of battery materials, on due diligence in challenging circumstances, on responsibly taking the rights of indigenous peoples into consideration and on the limits of corporate due diligence.\n\n- For more information on the Human Rights Advisory Council, see basf.com/human-rights-council\n\nintegral  part  of  the  standard  questionnaire  in  the  compliance management audits conducted by the Corporate Audit department.\n\nOur  labor  and  social  standards  also  include  respect  in  the workplace. To promote awareness of respectful behavior at work, we  launched  an  initiative against sexual harassment  and discrimination in September 2023, initially at the Ludwigshafen site. Its aim is to draw attention to the issue in order to better investigate and prevent incidents and ensure that all employees are treated with respect.

We set up a specific risk management to ensure BASF's compliance with the specific environmental treaties covered by the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Minamata, Stockholm, Basel). In addition, aspects of human rights topics are part of the global qualification requirements for security personnel and are incorporated into standard agreements with contractors.\n\nAs part of our Responsible Care Management, we aim to ensure that we also fulfill our duty of care towards local residents and that their human rights, such as the right to access clean water, are respected. To this end, we enter into dialog with residents at our sites through community advisory panels in order to promote trust in BASF's activities. Globally binding requirements for these panels are based on the grievance mechanism standards in the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (see page 140).\n\n## Cooperation along our value chains\n\nAs  an  international  company,  we  are  a  part  of  society  in  the countries in which we operate and have business relationships with partners around the world. In our supply chains, we are confronted with  risks  in  the  areas  of  working  conditions,  environmental protection,  health  and  safety,  particularly  in  countries  with  an increased  human  rights  risk  and  when  purchasing  higher-risk product categories.\n\nWe have trustful working relationships with our partners (suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners and customers), expect them to comply with internationally recognized human rights standards and to expect the same of their partners further along the value chain.\n\nWe  work  to  ensure  that  our  partners  meet  their  respective responsibilities.\n\nWe have defined these expectations as binding in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which is also part of our purchasing conditions (see page 159). We are in close contact with our business partners, especially  in  higher-risk  areas  and  regions,  and  monitor  the implementation of relevant standards and necessary measures for improvement. We use recognized assessment methods and audits to verify this. If this or other sources (e.g., media reports, compliance hotline) lead to anomalies or violations, we take this very seriously, respond and require our suppliers to implement corrective measures immediately and put an end to the violations.\n\nFor  example,  in  March  2023,  authorities  in  Uruguaiana,  Brazil, recorded a case of unacceptable working conditions and underage labor in our supply chain. The affected workers were temporarily employed by subcontractors of BASF contractors in the fields of two rice farms that produced seeds for BASF. We deeply regret the way in which the workers of our contractors' subcontractors were treated and strongly condemn all practices that violate human rights. We immediately approached the relevant authorities and evaluated the processes. The work was stopped immediately and the contract with one of the contractual partners was terminated, as it became clear that it was not possible to work constructively on the incidents with this partner. BASF has also taken additional preventive and training measures to avoid such incidents even more effectively in the future (see page 160).\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, an internal audit of our joint venture operations in Korla, China, was carried out to verify compliance with the BASF Code of Conduct and the requirements embedded in it to respect human rights as well as key labor and social standards. This investigation, as well as past audits, did not reveal any evidence of human rights violations in the two joint ventures. We have obtained written confirmation from key suppliers, including our joint venture partners,  that  they  accept  our  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct. Nevertheless, reports from spring 2024 on the joint venture partner\n\nin Korla contain serious allegations that indicate activities that are not compatible with BASF's values. Consequently, we will accelerate the process already started at the end of 2023 to divest our shares in the two joint ventures in Korla for strategic reasons, subject to negotiations and the required approvals from the relevant authorities.\n\nIn 2023, we continued our work with our upstream supply chain, where  we  usually  have  no  direct  contractual  relationships,  less transparency and less influence. Here, we seek to increase our influence through collaboration with partners and stakeholders, and place importance on certifications such as the LBMA certificate for gold,  the  LPPM  certificate  for  platinum  group  metals,  and  the Responsible Minerals Initiative's Responsible Minerals Assurance Process.\n\nWe work together with partners and civil society and we are active in cross-sector initiatives. These include the Global Battery Alliance and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. Projects often start on the  ground  to  build  specific  expertise  for  sustainable  and responsible  supply  chains.  The  local  initiatives  also  include  the Sustainable Castor Initiative - Pragati in India, the Responsible Lithium Partnership Initiative in Chile, the Responsible Mica Initiative in India and the Cobalt for Development pilot mining project in the Democratic Republic of Congo (see page 126). In 2022, BASF, Syngenta and Arisa also worked together on a multistakeholder initiative in the vegetable seeds business in India. The initiative, WISH (Wage Improvements in Seed Hybrids), addresses the fight against child labor and the payment of an appropriate wage in the Indian  vegetable  seed  industry.  The  first  phase  of  the  project examined where to start in order to improve local conditions. In the next step, the project partners will use various instruments such as training  and  further  education,  networking,  the  involvement  of interest groups, advocacy work at local and international level and the dissemination of best practices. The project team's aim is to achieve significant changes in several key areas by 2025.\n\nFor more information on standards in our supply chain, see page 158 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Information  offers  on  this  were  held  in  our  operating divisions.  In  addition,  managing  directors  of  BASF's  Group companies and employees in all regions were informed about and sensitized  to  human  rights  topics  through  presentations  and discussion formats tailored to specific target groups. In Brazil, the Compliance Week was held on the theme of 'Everyone for the Protection of Human Rights.' The topic of human rights was also integrated even more strongly into the existing compliance training program.\n\nOur grievance mechanisms , including our globally standardized hotline and reporting system, were also used intensively in 2023 (see  page  203).  All  complaints  were  reviewed  and  forwarded to the relevant departments for in-depth investigation. If justified, appropriate measures were taken. We have not received any reports of human rights violations within the meaning of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act through our grievance mechanisms. We report on our global targets, monitoring systems and measures to integrate  human  rights  topics  into  our  business  activities  in publications such as this report and online.\n\n- For more information on our production standards, see page 127 and 143\n- For more information on the Policy Statement on Human Rights and a comprehensive report on the implementation of due diligence in human rights in accordance with the requirements of the National Action Plan developed by the German government, and in accordance with the U.N.

These raw materials and precursors are the building blocks for our value creation and thus high-quality products for our customers. Our objective is to create competitive advantages through our professional procurement structures, to establish stable and reliable supply chains, and, at the same time, meet high ethical and environmental standards. Together with our suppliers, we want to improve sustainability in the supply chain and minimize risks.\n\n## At a glance\n\n## \u20ac41 billion\n\nGlobal procurement spend\n\n## 89%\n\nof relevant spend 1 covered by sustainability evaluations\n\n- \u25aa Sustainability-oriented supply chain management\n- \u25aa Global targets to increase sustainability in the supply chain\n- \u25aa Supplier Code of Conduct creates transparency\n- \u25aa Risk-based approach with clearly defined follow-up processes\n\n## Strategy and governance\n\nOur  procurement  organization  ensures  a  reliable  supply  of  raw materials,  energy,  precursors,  technical  goods  and  services  to BASF.  With  active  supplier  management,  we  aim  to  minimize purchase-related  risks  such  as  supply  shortages  and  price fluctuations, ensure our competitiveness and seamless production processes. Alongside economic and qualitative criteria, we also take\n\nenvironmental,  social  and  ethical  aspects  into  account  in  the cooperation with our suppliers 2 in order to minimize risks in the supply  chain  and  live  up  to  our  responsibility  by  establishing standards and initiatives. Our sustainability-oriented supply chain management  is  an  integral  part  of  our  opportunity  and  risk management (see page 177 onward).\n\nProcurement  guidelines  and  targets  are  set  centrally  by  the responsible Corporate Center unit Corporate Development and are binding for all employees with procurement responsibility worldwide. We use a multistage control process to ensure compliance with these requirements. Our expectations of our suppliers are laid down in the globally binding Supplier Code of Conduct (see 'What we expect from our suppliers').\n\nWe have defined our standards in a global requirement. We are continually  refining  and  optimizing  this  requirement  and  our structures  and  processes  in  response  to  changing  framework conditions, such as new obligations arising from the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (GSCA), which requires large companies to conduct due diligence on human rights and certain  environmental  standards  in  their  supply  chains  since January 1, 2023 (see page 156). In principle, this applies both to our own business operations and to direct and indirect suppliers. As part of the new statutory due diligence obligations, we have updated our  purchasing  conditions,  adapted  clauses  for  new  contracts, revised existing contracts and proactively informed our suppliers. Our  established  supply  chain  management  tools,  such  as  our Supplier  Code  of  Conduct  or  the  systematic  risk-oriented assessment and auditing of suppliers, remain important elements and have been updated accordingly.\n\nOur risk-based approach aims to identify and evaluate sustainability matters in our value chains in the best possible way. We count on reliable and long-term supply relationships in order to jointly improve our  sustainability  performance,  for  example  through  projects\n\n- 1 We understand relevant spend as procurement volumes with relevant suppliers. We define relevant suppliers as Tier 1 suppliers showing an elevated sustainability risk potential as identified by our risk matrices, our purchasers' assessments or other sources.\n- 2 BASF considers all direct suppliers to be Tier 1 suppliers that provide services to the BASF Group in the respective business year. These are suppliers that provide us with raw materials, investment goods, consumables and services. Suppliers can be natural persons, companies or legal persons under public law.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(see page 122) or by helping to address shortcomings. We regularly review and document progress based on the risk level. Procurement employees receive regular training in sustainability-oriented supplier management  and  responsible  procurement.  In  2023,  around 330 employees received such training, covering the requirements arising from the GSCA.\n\nIn our supplier relationships, we focus on the potential to reduce upstream, raw materials-related carbon emissions, thus contributing to our new raw materials-related climate protection target defined in 2023 (see page 102). With our Supplier CO2 Management Program launched in 2021, we aim to increase the transparency and reduce the carbon footprint of our value chain together with our suppliers (see page 108).\n\nIn line with our strategy and our values we promote and value diversity, the sense of belonging and inclusion in our value chain. We have been involved in supplier diversity programs in North and South America for many years. We seek targeted contact with underrepresented supplier groups through interest groups and work to integrate them into our supply chain. In addition, we promote the exchange of information on sustainability topics in webinars and workshops and establish partnerships to enable dialog between customers and suppliers.\n\nFor more information on suppliers, see basf.com/suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Global targets\n\nIn 2023, we acquired raw materials, goods and services for our own production worth approximately \u20ac41 billion from our more than 70,000 suppliers. Of this, around 90% were procured locally. 1\n\nWe  actively  promote  sustainability  in  the  supply  chain  with  our ambitious targets: By 2025, we aim to have conducted sustainability evaluations for 90% of the BASF Group's relevant spend. In addition, we  aim  to  have  80%  of  suppliers  improve  their  sustainability performance  upon  reevaluation  by  2025.  In  2023,  89%  of  the relevant spend had been evaluated. Of the suppliers reevaluated in 2023, 82% had improved. Both global targets are embedded in the target agreements of employees responsible for procurement.\n\n## 2025 targets\n\n## 90%\n\nShare of the BASF Group's relevant spend covered by sustainability evaluations\n\n## 80%\n\nPercentage of suppliers with improved sustainability performance upon reevaluation\n\n## What we expect from our suppliers\n\nTogether with our suppliers, we want to improve sustainability in the supply chain. Consequently, we require our suppliers to comply with the applicable laws in full and to adhere to internationally recognized environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. We also expect them to make an effort to enforce these standards with their suppliers. In addition, we require our suppliers to support and comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct - or to demonstrate and ensure their commitment to the principles specified in the Code of Conduct, for example in their own code of conduct.\n\nOur global Supplier Code of Conduct is founded on internationally recognized guidelines, such as the principles of the United Nations' Global  Compact,  the  U.N.  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and Human  Rights,  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO) conventions, and the topic areas of the Responsible Care \u00ae initiative. Topics covered by the Code of Conduct include compliance with human rights, the exclusion of child and forced labor, adherence to labor and social standards, antidiscrimination and anticorruption policies, and protecting the environment. The Code of Conduct is available  in  the  most  relevant  languages  for  our  suppliers  and integrated  into  electronic  ordering  systems  and  purchasing conditions across the Group. We expanded our Supplier Code of Conduct to include requirements from the GSCA and informed our existing suppliers of these changes in 2023. Around 5,000 new suppliers committed to the Code of Conduct in 2023.\n\nBASF conducts audits and assessments to ensure that suppliers comply with the applicable laws, rules and standards. We reserve the right to discontinue business relationships for nonadherence to international  principles.  The  same  applies  to  failure  to  correct violations, or for displaying patterns of noncompliance with these standards. Our Code of Conduct expressly points out that potential violations of laws, rules or standards can be reported - including anonymously  -  to  our  compliance  hotlines.  Each  case  is documented and investigated, and appropriate measures are taken as necessary.\n\n## Selection and evaluation of our suppliers\n\nNew suppliers are selected and existing suppliers are evaluated not only on the basis of economic criteria, but also ESG standards in particular. As such, selection, evaluation and auditing are important parts  of  our  sustainable  supply  chain  and  risk  management. Processes and responsibilities are defined in a global requirement. Due to the large number of suppliers, they are evaluated based on risk. Both country and industry-specific risks as well as our ability to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexert  influence  are  taken  into  account.  Observations  from  our employees  in  procurement,  concerns  reported  through  the compliance  hotline  and  information  from  internal  and  external databases, such as Together for Sustainability (TfS) assessments (see box on page 160), are also used.\n\nWe are aware of problems in specific supply chains (see pages 122 and 125). We have suppliers with a high potential sustainability risk evaluated by third parties, either through sustainability evaluations or on-site audits. The list of suppliers to be assessed is updated every year.  Sustainability  evaluations  and  on-site  audits  are  mainly conducted according to the TfS framework. A total of 89 raw materials supplier sites were audited on sustainability standards on our  behalf  in  2023.  We  received  sustainability  evaluations  for 579 suppliers. We also take into account other certification systems and external audits, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, when assessing our suppliers.\n\n## Audit results\n\nWe carefully analyze the results of our assessments, which are summarized  in  audit  reports  with  specific  plans  for  corrective measures, and document them in a central database. We regularly review the implementation of the measures and verify them in a follow-up audit. Over the past few years, we have identified some need for adjustment at our suppliers with respect to environmental, social and governance standards, for example in waste management,  or  deviations  in  occupational  health  and  safety measures  and  standards  under  labor  law.  Follow-up  audits performed in 2023 identified improvements in these areas.\n\nIn this reporting year, we recorded one case of undignified working conditions and underage labor. In March 2023, representatives of local authorities identified unacceptable working conditions on two rice farms which produced seeds for BASF in Uruguaiana, Brazil . The affected workers were temporarily employed by subcontractors",

Immediately after becoming aware of  this,  we  approached  the  relevant  authorities  proactively  and without delay and evaluated the processes on-site. The work was stopped immediately and the contract with one of the farms was terminated as it was not possible to work constructively on the incidents  with  this  partner.  We  have  also  strengthened  our regulations and started to introduce additional preventive measures. In  particular,  we  have  reaffirmed  to  our  seed  multipliers  their obligations under applicable labor laws and compliance with human rights requirements in writing, including with regard to potential subcontractors. We have strengthened our training with a focus on respect for human rights. In addition, we plan to carry out more risk-based controls of our contractors and their subcontractors, as well as training sessions.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, an internal audit of our joint venture operations in Korla, China, was carried out. This investigation, as well as past audits, did not reveal any evidence of human rights violations  in  the  two  joint  ventures.  We  have  obtained  written confirmation from key suppliers, including our joint venture partners, that  they  accept  our  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct.  Nevertheless, reports from spring 2024 on the joint venture partner in Korla contain serious allegations that indicate activities that are not compatible with BASF's values. Consequently, we will accelerate the process already started at the end of 2023 to divest our shares in the two joint ventures in Korla for strategic reasons, subject to negotiations and the required approvals from the relevant authorities.\n\nAs part of our due diligence, we are in regular contact with our South African platinum  suppliers, including Sibanye-Stillwater. 1 In addition, we are in regular dialog with relevant stakeholders in order to gain a comprehensive picture of the situation at a local level and address relevant issues. Sibanye-Stillwater and the other South African platinum suppliers have agreed to conduct future audits in accordance with the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) mining standard and are in the process of conducting an\n\nIRMA self-assessment. We discuss the status and results in our regular exchanges.\n\nWe maintain dialog and a regular exchange with Nornickel to continuously monitor the situation and audit results, and we are in contact with civil society groups. Nornickel continues to work on implementing  management  systems  according  to  internationally recognized industry standards that allow for third-party verification of mining and responsible sourcing, such as IRMA. The current conditions  continue  to  impact  our  business  relationship,  while auditing according to the aforementioned standards is currently not possible.\n\n## Supplier development\n\nIf  supplier  assessments  identify  deviations  from  standards,  we require suppliers to develop and implement corrective measures within  a  reasonable  time  frame  in  a  clearly  defined  follow-up process. We support them in their efforts. For example, we trained 102 employees from 88 Chinese suppliers in 2023 as part of a partnership  with  the  East  China  University  of  Science  and Technology  in  Shanghai,  China.  An  important  part  of  supplier development were also the webinars on the topic of sustainability and the implementation of corrective measures held by TfS in various  languages,  with  a  total  of  over  2,100  participants.  In addition, the new TfS Academy online learning platform is aimed at buyers and suppliers. It covers the entire spectrum of ESG topics. There  are  currently  over  390  courses  available  in  11  different languages.  We  review  our  suppliers'  progress  according  to  a defined time frame based on the sustainability risk identified, or after five years at the latest. In the case of serious violations of the standards defined in our Supplier Code of Conduct or international principles, we reserve the right to impose commercial sanctions. These can go as far as the termination of the business relationship. In 2023, this happened in three cases.\n\n- 1 In 2012, an extended strike at a platinum mine in Marikana, South Africa, culminated in a violent confrontation between mine workers and armed South African police. Employees of the former mine operator, Lonmin, were among the fatalities. Ownership of the Marikana mine was transferred to Sibanye-Stillwater in 2019. For more information on the supplier relationship with the Sibanye-Stillwater mine, see basf.com/en/marikana\n- 2 Based on the last evaluation (effective until October 2023)\n\n## Good to know\n\n## Together for Sustainability (TfS)\n\nBASF is a founding member of Together for Sustainability. The initiative was established in 2011 to improve sustainability in the supply chain. The focus is on the standardization, simplification and  mutual  recognition  of  supplier  audits  and  assessments. Suppliers are evaluated by independent experts in on-site audits or online assessments. The latter are conducted by EcoVadis, a ratings agency specialized in sustainability evaluations. At the end of 2023, TfS had 50 members with a combined procurement spend  of  around  \u20ac500  billion.  A  total  of  492  audits  and 11,421 online assessments were performed in 2023. As a TfS member, BASF itself is assessed and was ranked among the top 1%  companies  worldwide  in  the  sustainable  procurement category. 2 As  part  of  TfS,  we  are  actively  working  on standardizing the calculation methods of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain and on a digital exchange platform for Product Carbon Footprint data (see page 109).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taxonomy Regulation and the supplementary delegated acts, the Nonfinancial Statement includes  the  share  of  the  Group's  taxonomy-eligible  and taxonomy-aligned sales, investments and operating expenses for 2023 relating to the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation to climate change. In addition, in accordance with the second legal act adopted in the reporting year, we are reporting for the first time on the taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the environmental objectives of sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention  and  control  and  protection  and  restoration  of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nBASF activities that are not yet covered by the E.U. taxonomy, and as such,  are  not  relevant  under  the  taxonomy,  are  reported  as taxonomy-non-eligible in accordance with the delegated acts. These include large parts of BASF's activities that may nevertheless be in line with the E.U.'s environmental objectives and make a considerable contribution to avoiding CO2 emissions. We systematically analyze the sustainability performance of all BASF products using our TripleS method (see page 48).\n\nIn order to derive the financial indicators, an analysis of our product portfolio  identified  the  following  economic  activities  within  the meaning of the E.U. taxonomy under the environmental objective of climate change mitigation as relevant for BASF:\n\n- - Manufacture of batteries 1\n- - Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings 1\n- - Manufacture of hydrogen\n- - Manufacture of soda ash\n- - Manufacture of chlorine\n- - Manufacture of organic basic chemicals\n- - Manufacture of anhydrous ammonia\n- 1 Enabling activities within the meaning of the E.U. taxonomy\n- - Manufacture of nitric acid\n- - Manufacture of plastics in primary form\n\nThe description of the economic activities by the E.U. Commission for the four other environmental objectives not related to the climate was published in November 2023. According to these requirements, the following economic activity under the environmental  objective  of  pollution  prevention  and  control  will be additionally relevant for BASF for the first time from 2023 within the meaning of the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation:\n\n- - Manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) or active substances\n\nAs  the  relevant  activities  only  contribute  to  one  environmental objective in each case, the tables supplementing the templates via footnotes in accordance with Annex II of Delegated Regulation (E.U.) 2023/2486 have been omitted.\n\nTo avoid double counting, assignment to an enabling activity is only made if a taxonomy-eligible product or project had not already been included under another activity. BASF products also enable the production of technologies for renewable energy or low-emission mobility.  However,  since  the  E.U.  taxonomy  focuses  on  the manufacture of technologies and thus excludes precursors, we have classified these activities as taxonomy-non-eligible under the E.U. taxonomy.\n\nIn  addition  to  our  core  business,  the  production  of  chemical products, we have identified further activities that we have analyzed for their materiality in terms of their share of sales, investments or operating  expenditures.  In  determining  the  materiality,  we  were guided by the materiality concept established in financial reporting and also assessed the economic activity 'acquisition and ownership of buildings' as relevant in the environmental objective of climate change  mitigation  for  the  2023  reporting  year.  The  remaining immaterial activities neither exceed the value limit we have set for each economic activity, nor do the immaterial activities in total\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexceed the defined value limit for each reportable indicator (KPI). Immaterial  activities  include  activities  in  the  sectors  forestry; water  supply,  sewerage,  waste  management  and  remediation; transport; information and communication; professional, scientific and technical activities; and accommodation activities. In addition, we have identified the following immaterial activities in the energy  sector:  Electricity  generation  using  solar  photovoltaic technology; production of heat/cool from bioenergy; production of heat/cool  using  waste  heat;  electricity  generation  from  fossil gaseous fuels; high-efficiency cogeneration of heat/cool and power from  fossil  gaseous  fuels;  production  of  heat/cool  from  fossil gaseous fuels in an efficient district heating and cooling system. For the purposes of the templates set out in Annex XII to the Delegated Regulation 2021/2178, we would like to point out that we conduct activities  in  the  areas  of  electricity  generation,  cogeneration  of power and heat/cool, and production of heat/cool from fossil gas. As shown, these are not material in terms of sales, investments and operating expenditures. BASF does not conduct any nuclear energy activities.\n\nFurthermore, BASF does not report any taxonomy-eligible activities under the environmental objective of climate change adaptation . This is firstly to avoid double counting with economic activities already recorded under the climate change mitigation objective. Secondly, in accordance  with  the  notice issued by the E.U. Commission, a prerequisite for taxonomy eligibility under the adaptation objective is the submission of an investment plan for implementing adaptation solutions, which is not present on the part of BASF within the meaning of the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation.",

Taking into account all six environmental objectives, taxonomy-eligible sales revenue accounted for 12.2% of total sales in 2023. The largest contributions were from the activities 'manufacture of plastics in primary form' and  'manufacture  of  organic  basic  chemicals.'  Both  activities are  assigned  to  the  environmental  objective  of  climate  change mitigation. Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures (including acquisitions and excluding goodwill in accordance with the E.U. taxonomy) accounted for 23.1% of the total investments reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital expenditures on the 'manufacture of organic basic chemicals' and in the 'manufacture of  batteries'  contributed  significantly  here.  These  activities  also contribute  to  the  environmental  objective  of  climate  change mitigation. Operating expenditures include uncapitalized costs that relate to research and development, 1 maintenance and repair, and short-term lease expenses. The definition of operating expenditures follows the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation and they are not reported in\n\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in this form. All of the capital expenditures and operating expenditures of a production facility with taxonomy-eligible activity are counted  as  taxonomy-eligible. Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditures accounted for 12.4% of total operating expenditures. The largest contributions under the objective  of  climate  change  mitigation  were  from  the  activities 'manufacture  of  organic  basic  chemicals'  and  'manufacture  of plastics in primary form.'\n\n## Taxonomy-aligned sales revenue, capital expenditures and operating expenditures with a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible activities under the environmental objective of climate  change  mitigation  identified  by  BASF  can  be  classified as  taxonomy-aligned  if  they  make  a  substantial  contribution  to climate  change  mitigation  and  do  no  significant  harm  to  other environmental objectives and, at the same time, ensure minimum social safeguards. As in the previous year, the contribution to climate change mitigation and harm to other environmental objectives were reviewed in a three-step process. The first step involved a two-part analysis based on BASF's internal product databases:\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible sales revenue, capital expenditures and operating expenditures in 2023\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                   | Total   | Taxonomy-  eligible   |    % | Taxonomy-  non-eligible   | %    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|------|---------------------------|------|\n| Sales                                                             | 68,902  | 8,421                 | 12.2 | 60,481                    | 87.8 |\n| Of which climate change mitigation environmental objective        |         | 8,207                 | 11.9 |                           |      |\n| Of which pollution prevention and control environmental objective |         | 215                   |  0.3 |                           |      |\n| Investments (capex)                                               | 6,006   | 1,385                 | 23.1 | 4,621                     | 76.9 |\n| Of which climate change mitigation environmental objective        |         | 1,366                 | 22.7 |                           |      |\n| Of which pollution prevention and control environmental objective |         | 19                    |  0.3 |                           |      |\n| Operating expenditures (opex)                                     | 4,645   | 577                   | 12.4 | 4,068                     | 87.6 |\n| Of which climate change mitigation environmental objective        |         | 536                   | 11.5 |                           |      |\n| Of which pollution prevention and control environmental objective |         | 42                    |  0.9 |                           |      |\n\n- 1 The criteria for the activity 'close to market research, development and innovation' (for example, a technology readiness level of at least six) were used to determine taxonomy-eligible research and development costs.\n- 2 Generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - The manufacture of products was analyzed with respect to the use of critical substances in accordance with Appendix C 2 of the E.U. Commission's Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 to avoid significant  harm  to  the  environmental  objective  of  pollution prevention or control according to the E.U. taxonomy. This also included use in the production process. The amendment to the Delegated Regulation (E.U.) 2023/2485 published by the E.U. Commission in November 2023 was also taken into account. BASF voluntarily applied the full supplement, including Annex 1, point 28, for the 2023 financial year in order to ensure a continuous conformity  assessment  with  regard  to  Appendix  C  for  years subsequent to 2024. Experts assessed and documented in each case that no other suitable alternative substances or technologies are available on the market.\n- - Plastics  in  primary  form  were  analyzed  with  respect  to  the share of renewable raw materials in the product. They were only considered further if this share was at least 5% and thus potentially made a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation through partial or complete production from renewable raw materials. Shares allocated using mass balance approaches (see  page  124)  were  not  taken  into  account  here  because their acceptance under the E.U. taxonomy has not yet been definitively clarified. For this reason, BASF products based on chemically recycled raw materials were not considered further in the assessment either. Mechanical recycling did not play any role for BASF here.\n\nIn  the second  step ,  it  was  assessed  whether  the  potentially taxonomy-aligned  products  make  a  substantial  contribution  to climate change mitigation in accordance with the activity-specific criteria.  Among  other  things,  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  of European and non-European plants to produce soda ash, chemicals and nitric acid were compared with the average values of the most efficient plants under the E.U. emissions trading system. For the production of hydrogen, chlorine, ammonia and plastics in primary form,  the  comparison  was  against  activity-specific  quantitative criteria, such as the energy or emission intensity of a product.

For the assessment of the  investment  in  CO2-free  hydrogen  production  at  the Ludwigshafen, Germany, site (construction of a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer), a funding approval by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action and a study by the German  Environment  Agency  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in hydrogen production were also taken into account.\n\nFinally, in the third step of the process, it was assessed whether the products identified cause significant harm to the other environmental objectives. This included an analysis of risks arising from climate change using climate risk and vulnerability assessments. At sites with material climate risk, the existence of adaptation solutions was additionally analyzed and evaluated. The avoidance of significant harm to water and marine resources 1 , biodiversity and ecosystems 2 , and  pollution  prevention  and  control  were  taken  as  given  for production plants in Europe based on comprehensive and uniform regulatory  requirements  and  additionally  ensured  through  data queries. The conformity of non-European plants was assessed on a case-by-case  basis.  This  was  based  on  joint  assessments  by local and central experts using the evidence of local production requirements submitted.\n\nThe criteria for the minimum social safeguards as a further pillar of  taxonomy  alignment  in  accordance  with  Article  18  of  the E.U. Taxonomy Regulation were reviewed for all activities across the BASF Group on the four core topics of human rights (including labor  rights),  corruption/bribery,  taxation  and  fair  competition, independent of the step-by-step process for the 'contribution to climate  change  mitigation'  and  'harm  to  other  environmental objectives' criteria. Minimum social safeguards were ensured by a systematic, integrated and risk-based approach to safeguarding our human rights due diligence obligations (see page 154), by global labor and social standards (see page 155), and by the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 159), among other things.\n\n- 1 Protection of water and marine resources is taken as given at sites that do not use or treat water.\n- 2 A radius of 3 km around production sites was defined for the analysis of biodiversity-sensitive areas.\n\nTaxonomy-aligned sales  revenue accounted  for  1.6%  of  the total  sales  revenue  defined  and  reported  in  the  BASF  Group's Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  2023  (see  page  227). The 'manufacture of batteries' made the largest contribution (1.2%). Taxonomy-aligned capital  expenditures (including  acquisitions and excluding goodwill in accordance with the E.U. taxonomy) accounted  for  5.2%  of  the  total  investments  reported  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements. At 4.1%, capital expenditures (additions to property, plant and equipment) on the 'manufacture of batteries' contributed significantly here (additions to property, plant and equipment). We are also investing in a plant for the production of CO2-free hydrogen, which will be commissioned in the coming years. This already meets the criteria for taxonomy alignment in 2023 and is accordingly recognized as an investment in accordance with  Annex  I,  section  1.1.2.2.  a)  of  the  Delegated  Regulation 2021/2178. Taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures accounted for 1.8% of total operating expenditures, with the largest contribution  from  the  economic  activity  'manufacture  of  organic  basic chemicals' (0.9%).\n\nThe increase in taxonomy-aligned sales revenue, capital expenditures and operating expenditures compared to the previous year was mainly due to the statutory adjustments to Appendix C of the Delegated Regulation 2021/2139, which BASF already applied in 2023 and which resulted in a taxonomy-aligned assessment of  BASF's  battery  manufacturing  activities.  Due  to  the  legal amendments  to  Appendix  C,  BASF  is  able  to  report  the sustainable contribution for products in complex value chains in accordance with the E.U. taxonomy for the first time in 2023.\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned figure is, as before, significantly lower than the taxonomy-eligible figure due to various factors. Only a small proportion of plastics in primary form contain a share of renewable raw materials above the threshold value. Additionally, the proportion of taxonomy-aligned activities is reduced by the fact that many plants exceed the benchmarks used by the E.U. taxonomy. For example, the strict requirement to calculate emissions in accordance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith  European  emissions  trading  means  that  the  benefits  of renewable energies were not taken into account, which is why the investment in the steam crackers at the site in Zhanjiang, China, and the investment in a demonstration plant for electrified steam cracker furnaces  at  the  Ludwigshafen  site  in  Germany  (see  page  107) had to be classified as not taxonomy-aligned despite avoiding a considerable amount of CO2 emissions. In addition, plants that are not subject to emissions trading and thus cannot be assessed using  the  specified  criteria  were  generally  classified  as  not taxonomy-aligned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on sales revenue, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 249 onward\n\nFor more information on investments, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 264 onward",

        "page_content": "## Forecast\n\nWe expect the global economy to grow by 2.3% in 2024, slightly weaker than in 2023 (+2.6%). The sharp rise in interest rates over the course of 2023 is expected to dampen growth in the United States and Europe and the catch-up effects in services consumption are anticipated to weaken. We expect that the demand structure will gradually normalize and that the share of goods consumption in private consumption will rise again. We expect growth of 2.2% for global industrial production (2023: +1.4%). Following the sharp declines in many countries in the previous year, we expect slightly stronger growth of 2.7% for global chemical production (2023: +1.7%).\n\n## Economic Environment in 2024 1\n\n## At a glance\n\n- \u25aa Continued weak growth in Europe\n- \u25aa Lower growth in North America and Asia\n- \u25aa Sideways movement in chemical production in Europe and the United States\n- \u25aa Further growth in chemical production in Asia\n\nEconomic momentum slowed at the end of 2023. We expect that this weak phase will continue in the first half of 2024 and that growth will only accelerate somewhat over the course of the year. Overall macroeconomic growth in the E.U. is expected to remain at a low level in the year's average. By contrast, we expect a slowdown on average over the year in North America and Asia.\n\nUncertainty about future developments  remains  high.  The purchasing power of private households is on the rise due to wage increases in the previously resilient labor markets of Northwestern Europe and the United States. However, interest rates are likely to remain high despite decreasing inflation rates in the United States\n\nand  Europe.  This  has  a  negative  impact  on  growth  in  capital expenditures and construction investments and dampens the ability of  private  households  to  spend  on  interest-sensitive  consumer goods.  Recovery  in  China  is  extremely  volatile,  particularly  with regard to the stability of the real estate sector and the development of  the  labor  market.  The  geopolitical  situation  remains  tense, especially in light of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. In our forecast, we assume that these conflicts will not escalate further in 2024,  but  we  also  do  not  anticipate  a  fundamentally  positive turnaround.\n\n## Trends in the global economy in 2024\n\nWe  expect  GDP  growth  to  remain  largely  unchanged  in  the European Union (E.U.) (2024: +0.8%, 2023: +0.5%). As catch-up effects in tourism are weakening and demand for goods is expected to stabilize, we forecast growth rates to converge more strongly in Western Europe. While Germany is expected to grow by 0.3% again in 2024 following the slight decline in GDP (2023: -0.1%), we anticipate growth in France (+0.8%) and Italy (+0.5%) to remain largely unchanged. In Spain, however, the economy is likely to\n\n- 1 Our assumptions account for current estimates by external institutions, including economic research institutes, banks, multinational organizations and consulting firms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this section: Economic Environment in 2024 Outlook 2024 Opportunities and Risks\n\ncool (2024: +1.4%, 2023: +2.5%). GDP growth in the Eastern E.U. countries is expected to accelerate somewhat as the high inflation  rates  and  interest  rates  should  decrease  noticeably (2024: +2.1%, 2023: +0.5%).\n\nIn  the United  Kingdom ,  we  expect  growth  to  remain  weak (2024: +0.4%, 2023: +0.5%), as the higher interest rate level is increasingly  reflected  in  mortgage  interest  rates  for  private households. In view of the high home ownership rate and shorter fixed-interest periods, this effect is generally stronger in the United Kingdom than in other European countries.\n\nFollowing strong growth in 2023 (+2.5%), we expect a slowdown in the United States (2024: +1.8%). Here too, the persistently high level of interest rates will slow down growth in private consumption as  well  as  capital  expenditures  and  construction  investments. Furthermore, the depletion of savings built up during the coronavirus crisis is increasingly unable  to  support  consumption.  The forbearance of student loan repayments, which was introduced during the coronavirus pandemic, ended in fall 2023 and is now placing an additional burden on private household budgets.",

        "page_content": "We expect economic recovery in China to continue. Due to the higher starting point, however, growth in 2024 will slow compared with  the  previous  year  (2024:  +4.5%,  2023:  +5.2%).  The international economic environment remains weak and exports are therefore  not  expected  to  provide  any  strong  growth  stimulus overall. Domestic demand continues to be burdened by the crisis in the real estate sector and tight public budgets at provincial level. Private household consumption is expected to grow only moderately in this environment.\n\nIn the other emerging markets of Asia , we expect stable growth overall (2024: +4.9%, 2023: +4.7%) against the backdrop of largely constantly growing domestic demand and the gradual recovery in export demand from China. In India, growth momentum is expected to slow slightly, mainly due to a slowdown in investment growth in an environment of higher interest rates (2024: +6.2%, 2023: +6.5%).\n\nWe expect weaker growth in Japan (2024: +0.8%, 2023: +1.8%), as exports are growing more slowly now that the recovery effects in the automotive industry have come to an end and import prices for raw materials and precursors have risen due to the weaker yen. By contrast, the growth rate of private consumption should remain stable, as real incomes are rising moderately.\n\nGrowth in South America is expected to weaken in 2024 (2024: +1.0%, 2023: +1.4%). Growth in the region is being supported by declining inflation rates in most countries and falling interest rates in many countries. This is offset by narrower fiscal leeway. Particularly in Argentina, further consolidation measures are required to fight hyperinflation and stabilize the currency and to restructure public finances.\n\n## Outlook for gross domestic product 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| World                                     | 2.3%   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| European Union                            | 0.8%   |\n| United States                             | 1.8%   |\n| Emerging markets of  Asia excluding China | 4.9%   |\n| China                                     | 4.5%   |\n| Japan                                     | 0.8%   |\n| South America                             | 1.0%   |\n\n## Trends in gross domestic product 2024-2026\n\nAverage annual real change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| World                                     | 2.6%   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| European Union                            | 1.3%   |\n| United States                             | 1.7%   |\n| Emerging markets of  Asia excluding China | 5.0%   |\n| China                                     | 4.7%   |\n| Japan                                     | 0.9%   |\n| South America                             | 1.9%   |\n\n## Outlook for key customer industries\n\nOverall,  we  anticipate  growth  of  2.2%  (2023:  +1.4%)  in  global industrial production. Industrial production is expected to grow again slightly in the advanced economies (2024: +0.4%, 2023: -0.4%). Growth in the emerging markets is expected to accelerate slightly (2024: +3.5%, 2023: +2.8%).\n\nWe  are  forecasting  weak  growth  of  only  +1.1%  for  the  entire transportation  industry 1 (2023:  +9.5%).  We  expect  global production  volumes  of  passenger  cars  and  light  commercial\n\n- 1 The transportation industry includes the production of motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts and the construction of other vehicles (especially ships and boats, trains, air and spacecraft, and two-wheelers).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvehicles to only stagnate (-0.5%) after the strong growth of the previous year (+9.4%), which was impacted by catch-up effects. Global automotive production will therefore remain at a level of around 90 million vehicles. The share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the total production volume is expected to increase further from around 12% in 2023 to 15% in 2024. Developments will differ from region to region: A slight overall decline is expected in Asia. While Chinese car production is expected to stagnate at a high level, declines are anticipated for Japan and South Korea. In contrast, we are forecasting further slight growth for North and South America. We expect production in the E.U. and the United Kingdom to decline. However, Western Europe also saw the strongest growth in the previous year.\n\nThe energy and raw materials sector is expected to grow slightly faster in 2024 than in 2023. The expected slightly higher industry growth and the associated increase in demand for energy and non-energy  raw  materials  will  contribute  to  this.  In  addition,  a normalization of weather conditions after a warmer-than-average 2023 is expected to increase demand for oil and gas to heat buildings.\n\nGrowth in the construction industry is well below the long-term average due to high interest rates in Europe and the United States and the real estate crisis in China. While we expect a further decline in residential construction in 2024, particularly in Europe and the United States, nonresidential construction is likely to continue to grow.  Investment  in  public  and  private  infrastructure  is  likely to  remain  high,  leading  to  continued  dynamic  growth  in  the infrastructure sector. Overall, we expect only slightly higher growth for the construction industry compared with the previous year.\n\nConsumer goods production is expected to grow at around the same rate as global GDP. Wage and salary increases in Europe and the United States are leading to real income growth in many cases, which should support consumer demand, particularly in the areas of textiles and clothing, electrical household appliances and consumer",

        "page_content": "goods (care products). Demand for furniture, on the other hand, is expected to stagnate. However, we do not expect the furniture industry to shrink any further after the sharp decline in 2023.\n\nThe electronics industry is expected to grow more strongly again in  2024  after  stagnating  in  the  previous  year.  While  growth  in traditional consumer electronics is likely to slow down, we again expect increases in computers and communication electronics due to the short product life cycles. Overall, however, the expected growth in 2024 remains below the average of previous years.\n\nWe anticipate a recovery in growth in the health and nutrition sector. After the decline in pharmaceutical production in Asia in 2022 and 2023, we expect a normalization in 2024. For the nutrition sector, we assume global growth in line with GDP growth. Due to the stronger growth in the pharmaceutical sector, we are forecasting slightly higher growth than GDP for the health and nutrition sector.\n\nProduction in agriculture will presumably grow more moderately in 2024. However, regional trends vary greatly. For Western Europe, moderate growth in agricultural production is expected again after the hot summer of 2023 if weather conditions normalize. Growth in Eastern  Europe  is  expected  to  remain  stable,  provided  that production in Ukraine can be maintained at the current level. In North America, growth is expected to increase slightly. By contrast, we expect agricultural production in South America to grow slightly slower overall. However, this varies widely by country: While growth in Brazil is expected to weaken after the strong previous year, we anticipate that it will pick up in the other countries in the region. For Asia, which accounts for 65% of global agricultural production, we are forecasting a slight slowdown in growth in the agricultural sector overall.\n\n## Outlook for the chemical industry\n\nGlobal chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) is expected to  grow  by  2.7%  in  2024,  faster  than  in  the  previous  year (2023: +1.7%). We anticipate weak growth in production in the\n\nadvanced economies following the sharp decline in the previous year (2024: +0.8%, 2023: -4.9%). Growth in the emerging markets is expected to slow slightly (2024: +3.5%, 2023: +4.8%).\n\nIn China , the world's largest chemical market, we are forecasting lower  but  still  high  growth  in  chemical  production  of  4.0% following the strong growth in the previous year (2023: +7.5%). We expect growth stimulus to come primarily from the consumer goods and electronics industries. Following the considerable decline in chemical production in the other emerging markets of Asia, we expect a gradual recovery (2024: +3.0%, 2023: -2.4%). The main growth driver is India with expected growth of 4.5%.\n\nWe anticipate gradual stabilization in the E.U. Although the situation for the European chemical industry remains challenging in view of its high cost level by international standards and the weak global industrial economy, production is expected to stabilize at the current low level (2024: +0.8%) following the sharp declines of previous years (2023: -7.6%, 2022: -5.2%). This trend was already evident in the course of 2023. The considerable fall in gas prices and the slow recovery in demand for goods due to gains in purchasing power are expected to support demand for chemicals in Europe.\n\nDemand for chemicals is also expected to recover slightly in the United States (2024: +1.1%, 2023: -1.0%) following the previous year, which was characterized by destocking and weak industrial growth. We anticipate slight growth for most customer industries in the manufacturing sector. Further growth is also expected for the automotive  industry  in  North  America.  However,  developments remain uncertain against the backdrop of high interest rates and the associated  risk  of  recession,  particularly  with  regard  to  the construction sector.\n\nFor Japan , we are forecasting stagnation in chemical production after  the  sharp  decline  in  the  previous  year  (2024:  0.0%, 2023: -6.6%). Following very strong growth in the previous year, automotive  production  is  expected  to  fall.  Although  the  other customer industries are compensating for this decline overall, they are unlikely to provide any additional growth stimulus.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn South  America ,  chemical  production  will  presumably  grow slightly  (2024:  +1.3%;  2023:  -4.7%).  We  expect  to  see  slowly increasing  demand  from  the  consumer  goods  industries  and growing automotive production. Demand for chemical products from the agricultural sector is also expected to continue to grow.\n\n## Outlook for chemical production 2024 (excluding pharmaceuticals)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| World                                     | 2.7%   | 2.7%   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| European Union                            | 0.8%   | 0.8%   |\n| United States                             | 1.1%   | 1.1%   |\n| Emerging markets of  Asia excluding China | 3.0%   | 3.0%   |\n| China                                     |        | 4.0%   |\n| Japan                                     |        |        |\n\n## Trends in chemical production 2024-2026 (excluding pharmaceuticals)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Average annual real change                | 2.9%   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| European Union                            | 1.0%   |\n| United States                             | 1.2%   |\n| Emerging markets of  Asia excluding China | 3.4%   |\n| Japan                                     |        |\n| South America                             |        |\n|                                           | 2.1%   |",

        "page_content": "## Outlook 2024\n\nIn line with the Differentiated Steering approach that we introduced at the beginning of the year, we are reporting two new most important key performance indicators for the BASF Group at financial level, which are forecast below at Group and segment level: income from operations before depreciation and amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items) and free cash flow or the corresponding segment cash flow. In addition, we will continue to forecast Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions for the BASF Group.\n\n## Outlook for 2024 at a glance\n\n- \u25aa EBITDA before special items of between \u20ac8.0 billion and \u20ac8.6 billion\n- \u25aa Free cash flow of between \u20ac0.1 billion and \u20ac0.6 billion\n- \u25aa CO2 emissions of between 16.7 million metric tons and 17.7 million metric tons\n- \u25aa Capital expenditures of around \u20ac6.2 billion\n\nWe expect the weakness in global economic momentum from 2023 to continue in the first half of 2024. The main reason for this will be the expected persistently high interest rates, which will continue to dampen growth in the United States and Europe. The positive trend in service consumption will no longer be a significant factor. Global economic growth is only expected to accelerate somewhat later in the year, meaning that we expect the global economy to grow by 2.3% overall in 2024 (2023: +2.6%). In Europe, the comparatively very high energy prices and unfavorable framework conditions for industrial value  creation  continue  to  slow  down  economic development.\n\nWe expect that demand for industrial goods will normalize only gradually and that the share of goods in private consumption will rise again only slowly. For this reason, we only expect very moderate growth in most of our customer industries. Conversely, we expect weak growth overall in the automotive industry following strong growth  in  2023,  which  was  characterized  by  catch-up  effects. Recovery in China remains extremely uncertain, particularly with regard to the real estate sector and the development of the labor\n\nmarket. We do not expect any significant growth stimulus in the E.U. We are forecasting a gradual slowdown in the United States as a result of high interest rates. The geopolitical situation remains critical against the backdrop of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and other geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China. In our forecast, we assume that these conflicts will not escalate even further in 2024, but we also do not anticipate a fundamentally  positive  turnaround.  All  in  all,  global  industrial production  will  likely  expand  by  2.2%  overall  (2023:  +1.4%). Global chemical production is expected to grow faster in 2024, by 2.7% (2023: +1.7%). This will be driven primarily by the expected growth in the Chinese chemical industry. Our planning assumes an average oil price of $80 for a barrel of Brent crude and an exchange rate of $1.10 per euro.\n\n- For more information on our expectations for the economic environment in 2024, see page 167 onward For more information on the material opportunities and risks that could affect our forecast, see page 173 onward\n\n## Earnings and free cash flow forecast for the BASF Group 1\n\nThe BASF Group's EBITDA before special items is expected to rise to between \u20ac8.0 billion and \u20ac8.6 billion in 2024 (2023: \u20ac7.7 billion). Volume and margin growth in all segments will contribute here. Rising fixed costs due to inflation but also in connection with the construction of our new Verbund site in China will weigh down earnings in some segments. The Nutrition & Care, Industrial Solutions and Chemicals segments are expected to considerably increase EBITDA before\n\n- 1 For EBITDA before special items and free cash flow, 'slight' represents a change of 0.1%-10.0%, while 'considerable' applies to changes of 10.1% and higher. 'At prior-year level' indicates no change (+/-0.0%).\n- 2 Capex plus investments in intangible assets and IT\n\nspecial items. We anticipate slight earnings growth in the Materials segment. In the Surface Technologies segment, we are forecasting earnings at the prior-year level. EBITDA before special items in the Agricultural Solutions segment will likely decrease slightly.\n\nWe forecast the BASF  Group's free cash flow to be between \u20ac0.1  billion and \u20ac0.6  billion (2023: \u20ac2.7  billion). This is based on expected cash flows from operating activities from \u20ac6.6 billion to \u20ac7.1 billion, minus expected payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\u00b2 in the amount of \u20ac6.5 billion. The high investment-related cash outflow is mainly due to investments in the new Verbund site in China, which will reach their absolute peak in 2024.\n\nThe BASF Group's free cash flow comprises the cash flows of the segments  and  additionally  includes  transactions  that  are  not allocated operationally as well as adjustments of other noncash effects. For 2024, we expect a considerable decline in cash flows in all segments compared with 2023. The investment-related cash outflow for the construction of the new Verbund site in China will primarily affect the Chemicals segment. In the other segments, the expected decline in cash flows is likely to result primarily from a lower cash inflow from the reduction in working capital compared with the strong previous year.\n\n- For more information on the calculation of free cash flow and segment cash flow, see page 37\n\n<!-- image -->",

'At prior-year level' indicates no change (+/-0.0%).\n\n## CO2 emissions forecast for the BASF Group\n\nCO2 emissions are expected to be between 16.7 million metric tons and  17.7  million  metric  tons  in  2024.  We  anticipate  additional emissions compared with the previous year from higher production volumes based on rising demand. We will counteract this increase\n\nwith targeted measures to reduce emissions, such as increasing energy efficiency and optimizing processes as well as continuing the shift to electricity from renewable energies through the shareholding in the Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm, for example.\n\n## Forecast for the segments\n\nIn the Chemicals segment, we anticipate a considerable increase in income  from  operations  before  depreciation,  amortization  and special items (EBITDA before special items) in 2024 despite the continued difficult environment. Expected volume growth in both divisions will contribute to this. However, higher fixed costs, mainly in connection with the construction of the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, and scheduled turnarounds, will have an offsetting effect. Compared with 2023, we expect a considerable decline in the segment cash flow: This will be caused by expected turnarounds as well as higher investment expenditure.\n\nCompared with 2023, we anticipate a slight growth in EBITDA before  special  items  for  the Materials segment.  This  will  be attributable to targeted volume and margin growth in both divisions. However, in the Monomers division, EBITDA before special items is expected to decrease slightly overall. The main reason for this will be considerably higher fixed costs, as positive one-time effects from the previous year will not occur. Compared with the prior-year figure, we  expect  a  considerable  decline  in  the  segment  cash  flow, particularly as a result of a lower cash inflow from working capital.\n\nThe Industrial  Solutions segment  is  expected  to  considerably increase EBITDA before special items compared with 2023. This will be driven by higher volumes and margins in both divisions, in particular as a result of the expected global economic recovery in the second half of 2024. However, margin growth for Dispersions & Resins  will  be  dampened  by  increasingly  competitive  market conditions. Despite the increase in earnings, segment cash flow is anticipated to be considerably below the previous year, as planned growth will lead to more cash being tied up in receivables and inventories.\n\nThe Surface Technologies segment's EBITDA before special items in 2024 is expected to be at the prior-year level. A slight increase in earnings in the Catalysts division as a result of expected volume growth in the battery materials business should offset the expected slight decline in earnings in the Coatings division.

In  the  Catalysts division, planned investments and a higher amount of cash tied up in working capital, especially in the battery materials business, is expected to lead to lower cash flow. Cash flow in the Coatings division will probably decline, mainly as a result of higher expenditure on efficiency measures.\n\nIn the Nutrition & Care segment, we expect a considerable increase in EBITDA before special items, in particular due to higher volumes and margins. Both divisions are aiming for volume growth above the market  average.  Higher  fixed  costs,  mainly  as  a  result  of  the construction of our new Verbund site in China, are likely to dampen earnings development. Cash flow in both divisions is expected to be considerably  below  the  prior-year  level.  In  the  Care  Chemicals division, this will be mainly attributable to a higher amount of cash tied up in working capital compared with 2023. Cash flow in the Nutrition & Health division will decline mainly as a result of increasing investment expenditures for aroma ingredients in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and in Zhanjiang, China.\n\nIn the Agricultural Solutions segment, we expect EBITDA before special items to decline slightly in 2024. This will be mainly driven by higher fixed costs due to inflation as well as negative currency effects, which can only be partially offset by higher sales volumes. In addition, the receipt of a one-time payment had a positive impact on earnings in 2023. Segment cash flow is expected to be considerably lower in 2024 compared with the prior-year figure, mainly due to a higher amount of cash tied up in working capital.\n\n## Capital expenditures (Capex)\n\nWe are planning capital expenditures (additions to property, plant and equipment excluding acquisitions, IT investments, restoration obligations and right-of-use assets arising from leases) of around \u20ac6.2 billion for the BASF Group in 2024, including \u20ac3.3 billion for our growth projects, in particular the construction of the new Verbund site in China. For the period from 2024 to 2027, we are planning capital expenditures totaling \u20ac19.5 billion, including \u20ac6.8 billion for\n\nour growth projects - the new Verbund site in China, and the expansion of the battery materials business. The investment volume in the next four years will thus be considerably below that of the planning period 2023 to 2026 (\u20ac24.5 billion).\n\nProjects currently being planned or underway include:\n\n## Capex: selected projects\n\n| Location Project                                         |                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Construction of a world-scale-production plant for       | Chalamp\u00e9, France      |\n| Capacity expansion at MDI plants                         | Geismar, Louisiana    |\n| Modernization of chloroformates and acid chlorides plant | Ludwigshafen, Germany |\n| Construction of an integrated Verbund site               | Zhanjiang, China      |\n\n## Capex by segment 2024-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capex by region 2024-2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dividend\n\nWe have an ambitious dividend policy and offer our shareholders an attractive dividend yield.

        "page_content": "## Opportunities and Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe goal of BASF's risk management is to identify and evaluate opportunities and risks as early as possible and to take appropriate measures to seize opportunities and limit risks. The aim is to avoid risks that pose a threat to BASF's continued existence and to make improved managerial decisions to create value. We define opportunities as potential successes that exceed our defined goals. We understand risk to be any event that can negatively impact the achievement of our short-term operational or medium-term strategic goals.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- \u25aa Integrated process for opportunity and risk identification, assessment and reporting\n- \u25aa Decentralized management of specific opportunities and risks: aggregate reporting at Group level\n- \u25aa Material opportunities and risks for 2024 arise from overall economic developments and margin volatility\n\nWhere appropriate, we measure and manage opportunities and risks in terms of probability and economic impact in the event they occur. Where possible, we use statistical methods to aggregate opportunities and risks into risk categories. In addition, we use a qualitative evaluation scale for opportunities and risks to assess both business and sustainability aspects that cannot be quantified. In this way, we achieve an overall view of opportunities and risks, allowing us to prioritize risks at Group level and take effective risk management measures.\n\n## Overall assessment\n\nFor 2024, we anticipate that global economic growth will slow slightly as a result of higher inflation - albeit lower compared with 2023 - and persistently high interest rates. General macroeconomic uncertainty will remain exceptionally high.\n\nA further escalation of current geopolitical conflicts could lead to disruptions in global supply chains and greater restrictions on the\n\nsupply of energy, industrial raw materials and intermediates. The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East pose significant risks for market development and the supply of raw materials in Europe.\n\nFurthermore, there are risks to demand due to high interest rates and consumers' reduced purchasing power. Opportunities will arise in particular from stronger growth in demand resulting from better macroeconomic development than assumed.\n\nIn addition to the uncertainties surrounding market growth, material opportunities and risks for our earnings arise from margin volatility. To assess the opportunities and risks arising from the volatility of market growth, margins and currencies, we switched to forwardlooking market-related assumptions in 2023 in order to reflect the specific expectations of the market. In previous years, this was based on historical volatilities with a greater fluctuation range.\n\nAccording to our assessment, there continue to be no significant individual risks that pose a threat to the continued existence of the BASF SE or the BASF Group. The same applies to the sum of individual risks, even in the case of a global economic crisis.\n\nUltimately, however,  residual  risks  (net  risks)  remain  in  all entrepreneurial  activities  that  cannot  be  ruled  out,  even  by comprehensive risk management.\n\nAs a non-integral shareholding, income from Wintershall Dea AG, Kassel/Hamburg,  Germany,  is  reported  in  net  income  from shareholdings.  The  opportunities  and  risks  resulting  from  the shareholding in Wintershall Dea are therefore not included in the\n\noutlook for the EBITDA of the BASF Group. Opportunities and risks that have an impact on net income from shareholdings and cash flow from the shares in Wintershall Dea are monitored and tracked through BASF's involvement in the relevant governing bodies as a shareholder.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the nonintegral, equity-accounted shareholding in Wintershall Dea, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 253 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its key features are as follows:\n\n## Organization and responsibilities\n\n- - Risk  management  and  the  internal  control  system  is  the responsibility of the Board of Executive Directors. It defines the basic requirements and processes as well as the organization of the risk management system. It also determines the processes for approving investments, acquisitions and divestitures.\n- - The Board of Executive Directors is supported by the Corporate Center. Corporate Finance and Corporate Development, which are units within the Corporate Center, and the Chief Compliance Officer  (CCO)  coordinate  the  risk  management  process  at  a Group level, examine financial and sustainability-related opportunities and risks, and provide the structure and appropriate methodology.  Opportunity  and  risk  management  is  thus integrated into the strategy, planning and budgeting processes.\n- - BASF's risk committee reviews the BASF Group's risk portfolio at  least  twice  a  year  to  evaluate  any  adjustments  to  risk management  measures  and  informs  the  Board  of  Executive Directors  of  these.  Members  of  the  risk  committee  are  the president of Corporate Finance (chair), the president of Corporate Development, the president of Corporate Legal, Compliance & Insurance  and  the  heads  of  the  Corporate  Audit,  Corporate Environmental Protection, Health, Safety and Quality, Corporate Treasury,  and  Group  Reporting  &  Performance  Management departments.\n- - The management and control of specific opportunities and risks is largely delegated to the divisions, the service and research units and the regions, and is steered at a regional or local level. This also  applies  to  sustainability-related  topics  relevant  to  BASF including the impact of climate change on BASF. A network of risk managers in the divisions, service and research units as well as in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe  regions  advances  the  implementation  of  appropriate  risk management practices in daily operations. Financial risks are an exception. The management of liquidity, currency and interest rate risks is conducted in the Corporate Finance department. The management of commodity price risks takes place in the Global Procurement unit or in authorized Group companies.\n\n- - The  BASF  Group's  management  is  informed  of short-term operational opportunities and risks that fall within an observation period of up to one year in the monthly Management's Report produced by Corporate Finance. In addition, Corporate Finance provides information twice a year on the aggregated opportunity/ risk  exposure  of  the  BASF  Group.  Furthermore,  any  arising individual risks which have an impact of more than \u20ac10 million on earnings or risks qualitatively evaluated to have a material impact on our sustainability targets as well as reputational risks, must be reported  immediately.  The  Supervisory  Board  is  informed annually about short-term operational opportunities and risks as well as the risk management system and its further development. - As part of strategy development , the Corporate Development unit additionally conducts strategic opportunity/risk analyses with a  five-year  assessment  period.  These  analyses  are  annually reviewed  as  part  of  strategic  controlling  and  are  adapted  if necessary.  Scenarios  are  also  developed  to  map  possible impacts  beyond  the  five-year  horizon,  for  example  from climate-related developments. The Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board are informed annually about strategic opportunities and risks.\n- - We  also  regularly  consider  exceptional  situations  at  global, regional and local level - from process safety incidents and goods spillages to pandemics and cyberattacks - which are very rarely successful but can have a fundamental impact. In addition, a crisis organization exists to proactively create contingency plans where  necessary  and  appropriate.  The  crisis  management organization is activated in the event of a sudden crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on emergency response, see page 129 onward and for more information on health and safety, see page 143 onward",

The  Board  of  Executive Directors  immediately  informs  the  Audit  Committee  about significant incidents.\n- For more information on compliance, compliance management and monitoring adherence to our compliance principles, see page 202 onward\n- -    Risk-specific monitoring and control systems , some of which are decentralized, have been set up for each area identified in the risk  portfolio.  The  results  of  the  monitoring  processes  are incorporated into regular risk reporting to the Risk Committee and the Board of Executive Directors. Compared with internal control  systems  in  financial  reporting,  these  monitoring  and control systems in other subject areas have a lower degree of formalization. As a rule, however, they also include organizational security precautions such as compliance with the basic principles of transparency, dual control, segregation of duties and least privilege,  deployment  of  sufficiently  qualified  employees  and adequate IT systems. The design of internal controls depends on the subject area. It ranges from monitoring the development of specific key indicators and evaluating internal and external reports or benchmarking analyses to formalized committee meetings in which decisions are made on applications for investments or research projects, for example. In addition, the appropriateness and effectiveness of the topic-specific internal control systems is monitored by the Corporate Center units responsible for the respective topics. To this end, the individual Corporate Center units choose different approaches depending on the subject area, such as the evaluation of questionnaires for self-assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control system, sample tests to validate the implementation and effectiveness of internal controls or the monitoring of compliance-related key indicators.\n- - The  Corporate  Audit  department  is  responsible  for  regularly auditing  the  effectiveness  and  appropriateness  of  the  risk\n\n## Organization of the BASF Group's risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a The Corporate Audit department is part of the Corporate Center.\n- b The Chief Compliance Officer is the head of the Corporate Legal, Compliance & Insurance unit.\n\nmanagement system, internal control system and the compliance management system. In addition, the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee addresses the effectiveness and appropriateness of these systems as part of its monitoring activities. The suitability of the early risk detection system set up by the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act is assessed and evaluated by the auditors.\n\n## Tools\n\n- - The Governance,  Risk  Management,  Compliance  (GRC) Policy , applicable throughout the Group, forms the framework for risk management and is implemented by the operating divisions, the service and research units and the regions according to their specific business conditions.\n- - A catalog of opportunity and risk categories helps identify all relevant financial and sustainability-related opportunities and risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelating to our targets as comprehensively as possible. We derive the sustainability-related opportunities and risks from the materiality analysis.\n\n- - The positive contributions and negative impacts of our business activities on sustainability topics along the value chain, and the impact of sustainability topics on our business are assessed in a materiality analysis . Opportunities and risks for our business activities that could arise from material sustainability topics, or for  sustainability  topics  that  could  arise  from  our  business activities,  can  only  rarely  be  measured  in  specific  financial terms and mainly have a medium to long-term impact. Relevant sustainability topics are systematically considered  in  our strategic and operational risk management through our integrated risk catalog.\n\nFor more information on our materiality analysis, see page 49 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  reflect  these,  risks  for companies in connection with the transition to a low-emission economy (transition risks) as well as physical risks as defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) , among other, were added to this catalog.\n- - Because global climate policy ambitions and the implementation of the relevant measures play a decisive role in the ongoing growth of the chemical industry and its customer industries, we defined and  quantified  global long-term  scenarios (up  to  2050)  with various global warming paths. To assess the impact of different global  climate  policy  approaches  on  our  business  units,  the scenarios were discussed by the business units in workshops.

We also aggregate qualitatively assessed risks at Group level using a risk portfolio.\n- - Our Group-wide Compliance Program aims to ensure adherence to legal regulations and  the  company's  internal  guidelines. Our  global  employee  Code  of  Conduct  firmly  embeds  these mandatory standards into everyday business.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are derived from the separate financial statements of the subsidiaries and joint operations, taking into account the relevant data for the joint ventures and associated companies accounted for using the equity method. The BASF Group's accounting process is based on a uniform accounting guideline that, alongside accounting policies based on the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable in  the  European  Union,  defines  the  significant  processes  and deadlines for the Group. There are binding directives for the internal reconciliations and other accounting operations within the Group. Standard software is used to carry out the accounting processes for the preparation of the individual financial statements as well as for the Consolidated Financial Statements. There are clear rules for the access rights of each participant in these processes.\n\nEmployees involved in the accounting and reporting process meet the qualitative requirements and participate in training on a regular basis. There is a clear assignment of responsibilities between the specialist units, companies and service units involved. We strictly adhere to the principles of segregation of duties and dual control, or the 'four-eyes principle.' Complex actuarial reports and evaluations are produced by specialized service providers or specially qualified employees.\n\nAn  internal  control  system  for  financial  reporting  continuously monitors these principles. To this end, methods are provided to ensure that evaluation of the internal control system in financial reporting is structured and uniform across the BASF Group.

Risks are compiled into a central risk catalog.\n\nMoreover, a centralized selection process identifies companies that are exposed to particular risks, that are material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group, or that provide service processes. The selection process is conducted annually. Persons responsible  for  implementing  the  requirements  for  an  effective control system in financial reporting are appointed at the relevant companies.\n\nThe process for identifying, evaluating, managing and controlling risks related to preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements as well  as  monitoring  these  processes  in  the  selected  companies comprises the following steps:\n\n## -Evaluation of the control environment\n\nAdherence to internal and external guidelines that are relevant to the maintenance of a reliable control environment for financial reporting is checked by means of a standardized questionnaire.\n\n- -Identification and documentation of control activities In order to mitigate the risks to the financial reporting processes listed in our central risk catalog, critical processes and control activities are documented.\n\n## -Assessment of control activities\n\nAfter documentation, a review is performed to verify whether the described controls are capable of adequately covering the risks. In the subsequent test phase, spot checks are carried out to test whether, in practice, the controls were executed as described and were effective.\n\n## -Monitoring of control weaknesses\n\nThe responsible leaders receive reports on any control weaknesses identified and their resolution, and an interdisciplinary committee investigates their relevance to the BASF Group. The Board  of  Executive  Directors  and  the  Audit  Committee  are informed if control weaknesses with a considerable impact on financial  reporting  are  identified.  Only  after  material  control\n\nweaknesses have been resolved does the company's managing director confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system.\n\n## -\n\n- Internal confirmation of the internal control system\n\nAll  managing  directors  and  chief  financial  officers  of  each consolidated  Group  company  must  confirm  to  the  Board  of Executive Directors of BASF SE every half-year and at the end of the annual cycle, in writing, that the internal control system is effective with regard to accounting and reporting.\n\n## Operational opportunities and risks\n\n## Market growth\n\nThe development of our sales markets is one of the strongest sources  of  opportunities  and  risks.  For  more  details  on  our assumptions  regarding  short-term  growth  rates  for  the  global economy,  regions  and  key  customer  industries,  such  as  the chemicals, automotive and construction sectors, see Economic Environment in 2024 on pages 167 to 169.\n\nWe also consider opportunities and risks caused by deviations in assumptions. Macroeconomic opportunities arise from an easing of geopolitical conflicts and the resulting increase in the supply of energy, industrial raw materials and other intermediate goods.\n\nIncreases in energy prices caused, for example, by the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the even higher inflation rates resulting from this for manufacturer and consumer prices also pose a risk to the economy. Additional macroeconomic risks result from the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and a further intensification of the trade conflict between the United States, and, to some extent, the E.U. and China.\n\nWeather-related influences can result in positive or negative effects on our business, particularly in the Agricultural Solutions segment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Margins\n\nOpportunities and risks for the BASF Group primarily result from higher or lower margins in the Chemicals and Materials segments in particular. Declining margins for a number of products and value chains  could  further  increase  pressure  on  margins.  Additional shortages of raw materials could have both a negative and positive impact on margins. This would have a corresponding effect on our EBITDA.\n\nThe year's average oil price for Brent crude was $82 per barrel in 2023, compared with $101 per barrel in the previous year. For 2024, we anticipate an average oil price of $80 per barrel.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe continuously enhance our products and solutions in order to remain competitive. We monitor the market and the competition, and try to take targeted advantage of opportunities. We mitigate increasing competitive risks, especially in the Agricultural Solutions division,  as  far  as  possible  with  suitable  measures,  such  as increasing our competitiveness through the targeted promotion of innovations, for example in the area of sustainability, ongoing cost management and continuous process optimization.\n\n## Regulation/policy\n\nRisks for us can arise from intensified geopolitical tensions, new trade sanctions, a lack of global coordination for stricter emission limits  for  production  plants  and  stricter  energy  and  chemicals legislation as well as a lack of acceptance of new technologies in the E.U. Furthermore, risks can also arise from regulatory delays in the expansion  of  capacities  and  infrastructure  for  electricity  from renewable sources, low-emission hydrogen and the necessary CO2 infrastructure.\n\nHowever, political measures could also give rise to opportunities. For example, we view opportunities around the world to increase energy  efficiency  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  as  a strategic opportunity for increased demand for products such as",

        "page_content": "our insulation foams for buildings, catalysts, battery materials for electromobility, or our solutions for wind turbines.\n\n## Procurement and supply chain\n\nOperational risks in procurement are a key topic for BASF, as they can  impact  the  company's  supply  capability  and  therefore  its competitiveness. Operational risks in procurement include disruptions  and  delays  in  the  delivery  of  raw  materials  due  to weather  conditions,  supplier  insolvencies,  quality  concerns  or geopolitical events, for example. To counter these risks, BASF relies on comprehensive risk assessment and control along the entire supply chain, on global competition and close cooperation with suppliers. We take far-reaching measures to avoid such risks or minimize their effects.\n\n## Investments/production\n\nWe try to prevent unscheduled plant shutdowns by adhering to high technical standards and by continuously improving our plants. We reduce the effects of an unscheduled shutdown on the supply of intermediate and end products through diversification within our global production Verbund.\n\nIn the event of a production outage - caused by an accident, for example - our global, regional or local emergency response plans and crisis management structures are engaged, depending on the scope of impact. Every region has crisis management teams on a local and regional level. They not only coordinate the necessary emergency  response  measures,  they  also  initiate  immediate measures for damage control and resumption of normal operations as quickly as possible.\n\nCrisis  management  also  includes  dealing  with  extreme  weather conditions such as hurricanes (for example, at the sites on the Gulf of Mexico in Freeport, Texas, and Geismar, Louisiana) or significantly elevated water temperatures in rivers due to extended heat waves, which limit the available cooling capacity. Appropriate precautions are taken at the sites in the case of a potential change in risk associated\n\nwith climate change. For example, due to an increase in heat waves, we have implemented several measures at the Verbund sites in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and Geismar, Louisiana, in recent years to increase cooling capacity, such as expanding and optimizing the central recooling plants and optimizing cooling water flows. These optimization measures are designed to prevent production outages due to extreme heat waves.\n\nShort-term  risks  from  investments  can  result  from,  for  example, technical malfunctions or schedule and budget overruns. We counter these risks with stringent project management and controlling.\n\n## Acquisitions/divestitures/cooperations\n\nWe  constantly  monitor  the  market  in  order  to  identify  possible acquisition  targets  and  develop  our  portfolio  appropriately.  In addition, we collaborate with customers and partners to jointly develop new, competitive products and applications.\n\nAcquisitions and divestitures entail both opportunities and risks. These arise in connection with the conclusion of a transaction, or it being completed earlier or later than expected. They relate to the regular  earnings  contributions  gained  or  lost  as  well  as  the realization of gains or losses from divestitures if these deviate from our planning assumptions.\n\n- For more information on opportunities and risks from agreed transactions, see page 45\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Personnel\n\nDue to BASF's worldwide compensation principles, the development of personnel expenses is partly dependent on the amount of variable compensation, which is linked to the company's success, among other factors. The correlation between variable compensation and the success of the company has the effect of minimizing risk. Another factor is the development of interest rates for discounting pension obligations. Furthermore, changes to the legal environment of a particular  country  can  have  an  impact  on  the  development  of personnel expenses for the BASF Group. For countries in which BASF  is  active,  we  therefore  constantly  monitor  the  relevant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndevelopments in order to identify potential risks at an early stage and enable suitable measures to be taken.\n\n- For more information on our compensation system, see page 135\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on risks from pension obligations, see page 180\n\n## Information technology\n\nBASF employs a large number of IT systems. We use technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data and the Internet of Things to develop new business models, corporate concepts and strategies and to respond appropriately to changing customer behavior. The global cybersecurity team is tasked with protecting these IT systems and the data and business processes they handle. In a connected, ever-evolving  world,  the  challenge  of  protecting  BASF  against attackers is becoming ever greater and more complex.\n\nThe threat environment has changed in recent years, as attackers have become better organized, use more sophisticated technology and have far more resources available. This development reflects the fact that internet-based cyberattacks are extremely lucrative: A variety of  vulnerabilities  in  software  and  hardware  products  constantly provide  new  incentives  to  develop  malware,  and  anonymization technologies make it almost impossible to trace and punish attacks.\n\nA  successful  attack  can,  for  example,  negatively  affect  plant availability, delivery quality or the accuracy of our financial reporting. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as personnel records or  customer  data,  competition-related  information  or  research results,  can  result  in  legal  consequences  or  jeopardize  our competitive position. This could also cause monetary losses, a potential loss of reputation and even a loss of customers' and partners' confidence in the security of our products and services.\n\nTo minimize such risks, BASF uses globally uniform processes and systems to ensure IT availability and IT security, which are based on the  recognized  ISO  27001  standard.  These  include  stable  and redundantly  designed  IT  systems,  backup  processes,  virus  and access  protection, encryption systems, and  integrated and standardized  IT  infrastructure,  applications  and  processes.

        "page_content": "systems  used  for  information  security  are  constantly  tested, continuously updated, and expanded if necessary. In addition, our employees receive regular training on information and data protection. IT-related risk management  is  conducted  using  Group -wide regulations for organization and application, as well as an internal control system based on these regulations.\n\nWe employ modern security concepts to keep pace with advanced attackers.  These  range  from  efficient  detection  and  professional response to defense against attacks and minimizing their potential impact. Strong cybersecurity alliances are also crucial here. BASF works closely with security authorities and security associations, for example  as  a  founding  member  of  the  German  Cyber  Security Organization (DCSO) and the Cyber Security Sharing and Analytics (CSSA) platform in Berlin, Germany.\n\nBASF  has  also  established  an  information  security  management system and is internationally certified according to DIN EN ISO/IEC 27001:2017.\n\n## Compliance/legal\n\nWe  constantly  monitor  current  and  potential  legal  disputes  and proceedings, and regularly report on these to the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board. In order to assess the risks from current legal disputes and proceedings and any potential need to recognize provisions, we prepare our own analyses and assessments of the circumstances and claims considered. In addition, in individual cases, we consider the results of comparable proceedings and, if needed, independent legal opinions. Risk assessment is particularly based on estimates as to the probability of occurrence and the range of possible claims. These estimates are the result of close cooperation between  the  relevant  operating  and  service  units  together  with Corporate Legal and Corporate Finance. If sufficient probability of occurrence is identified, we recognize a provision for the proceeding concerned.  Should  a  provision  be  unnecessary,  we  continue  to assess whether these litigations nevertheless represent a risk for the BASF Group's EBITDA as part of general risk management.\n\nWe use our internal control system to limit risks from potential infringements of rights or laws. For example, we try to avoid patent and  licensing  disputes  whenever  possible  through  extensive clearance  research.  As  part  of  our  Group-wide  Compliance Program, our employees receive regular training.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe recognized tax-related opportunities and risks only concern taxes that impact the BASF Group's EBITDA in the short term. These arise when BASF has taken a position that differs from the opinion of a competent administrative authority. If a tax payment has already been made and could be reclaimed, we present this as an opportunity. Conversely, if a potential payment is outstanding in accordance  with  the  administrative  opinion,  this  is  a  risk.  We primarily  evaluate  opportunities  and  risks  with  regard  to  their probability of occurrence and, if necessary, set up a provision for the relevant risk. If a provision is not necessary, we take this into account in determining EBITDA-relevant risks for the BASF Group.\n\n## Financial opportunities and risks\n\nDetailed guidelines and procedures exist for dealing with financial risks.  Among  other  things,  they  provide  for  the  segregation  of financial instrument trading and back-office functions.\n\nWe  continuously  monitor  activities  in  countries  with  transfer restrictions  as  a  part  of  risk  management.  This  includes,  for example,  regular  analysis  of  the  macroeconomic  and  legal environment, shareholders' equity and the business models of the operating units. The chief aim is the management of counterparty, transfer and currency risks for the BASF Group.\n\n## Exchange rate volatility\n\nOur competitiveness on global markets is influenced by fluctuations in exchange rates. For BASF's sales, opportunities and risks arise in particular when the U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates. A full-year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nappreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by $0.01 would increase  the  BASF  Group's  EBITDA  by  around  \u20ac40  million, assuming other conditions remain the same. On the production side, we counter exchange rate risks by producing in the respective currency zones.\n\nFinancial currency risks result from the translation of receivables, liabilities and other monetary items in accordance with IAS 21 at the closing rate into the functional currency of the respective Group company. In addition, we incorporate planned purchase and sales transactions in foreign currencies into our financial foreign currency risk  management.  If  necessary,  we  hedge  these  risks  using derivative instruments.\n\n## Financing costs\n\nFinancing costs are determined in particular by net debt and interest rates. Interest rate risks result from possible changes in the relevant market interest rates and credit risk premiums. These can cause a change in the fair value of fixed interest rates and fluctuations in the interest  payments  for  variable-rate  financial  instruments,  which would positively or negatively affect earnings. We use interest rate swaps and, in individual cases, combined interest and currency derivatives  to  hedge  market  interest  rate  risks.  The  credit  risk premiums are mainly influenced by our credit rating and the market conditions at the time of issue. In the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected from the possible effects on its interest result thanks to the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness.\n\n## Risks from metal and raw materials trading\n\nSome of BASF's divisions are exposed to strong fluctuations in raw materials prices. BASF uses commodity derivatives to hedge these market  price  risks.  In  addition,  BASF  holds  limited  unhedged precious metal and oil product positions for trading on its own account. The value of these positions is exposed to market price volatility. Adverse changes in market prices negatively affect the earnings  and  equity  of  BASF.  These  risks  are  continuously",

        "page_content": "monitored by a central risk management system and limited by strict guidelines.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nRisks from fluctuating cash flows are recognized in a timely manner as part of our liquidity planning. We have access to extensive liquidity at any time thanks to our good ratings, our unrestricted access to the commercial paper market and committed bank credit lines.\n\nIn the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected against potential refinancing risks by the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness as well as through diversification in various financial markets.\n\n## Risk of asset losses\n\nWe limit country-specific risks with measures based on country ratings,  which  are  continuously  updated  to  reflect  changing environment conditions. We selectively use investment guarantees to limit specific country-related risks. We lower credit risks for our financial investments by engaging in transactions only with banks with  good  credit  ratings  and  by  adhering  to  fixed  limits.  We continuously monitor creditworthiness and adjust limits accordingly. We  reduce  the  risk  of  default  on  receivables  by  continuously monitoring  the  creditworthiness  and  payment  behavior  of  our customers and by setting appropriate credit limits. Risks are also limited through the use of individual hedging strategies, such as guarantees. Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the BASF Group, there are no major concentrations of credit default risk.\n\n## Risks from pension obligations\n\nBASF grants most employees company pension benefits from either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. We predominantly finance company pension obligations externally through separate plan assets. This particularly includes BASF Pensionskasse VVaG\n\nand BASF Pensionstreuhand e.V. in Germany, in addition to the large pension plans of our Group companies in North America, the United  Kingdom  and  Switzerland.  To  address  the  risk  of underfunding due to market-related fluctuations in plan assets, we have investment strategies that align return and risk optimization to the structure of the pension obligations. Stress scenarios are also simulated regularly by means of portfolio analyses. Adjustments to the  interest  rates  used  in  discounting  pension  obligations  lead immediately to changes in equity. To limit the risks of changing financial market conditions as well as demographic developments, BASF has, for a number of years now, offered its employees almost exclusively defined contribution plans for future years of service. Some  of  these  contribution  plans  include  minimum  interest guarantees. If the pension fund cannot generate this, it must be provided by the employer. A sustained low interest rate environment could make it necessary to recognize pension obligations and plan assets for these plans as well.\n\n## Strategic opportunities and risks\n\n## Long-term demand development\n\nWe  assume  that  growth  in  chemical  production  (excluding pharmaceuticals) will be slightly higher than that of the global gross domestic product over the next five years and about as strong as the five-year average prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Through our market-oriented and broad portfolio, which we will continue to strengthen in the years ahead, for example, through investments in new production capacities, research and development activities or acquisitions, we aim to achieve volume growth that slightly exceeds this market  growth.  Should  global  economic  growth  see unexpected, considerable deceleration, for example, because of an ongoing  weak  period  in  the  emerging  markets,  protectionist tendencies or bottlenecks in the energy markets, the expected growth rates could prove too ambitious. Additional risks arise from geopolitical tensions and outright military conflicts, which could impact  supply  chains  and  reduce  efficiency  in  the  international allocation of resources.\n\nMoreover,  the  ambitions  of  global  climate  policy  and  its implementation will significantly impact the structure of demand from our customer industries. This is shown by a comparison of climate policy scenarios that envisage limiting global warming to below two degrees Celsius with alternative scenarios that allow for more warming. In ambitious climate policy scenarios, the structure of demand changes due to the use of alternative energy sources and  raw  materials,  high  investment  in  resource-conserving technologies, and changing customer preferences. By contrast, macroeconomic growth rates typically vary little compared with scenarios with pathways with higher levels of warming.\n\nMarket  opportunities  in  such  scenarios  include,  for  example, alternative surface coatings for wind and solar modules, feedstocks that make plastics easier to recycle, stronger demand for insulation materials  for  buildings,  increased  electromobility  with  changed demand  for  plastics,  insulation  materials,  coolants  and  battery materials, and more alternative proteins in agriculture. By contrast,\n\n<!-- image -->",

This requires further decarbonization of production processes and alternative sources of raw materials in order to remain competitive.\n\n- For more information on the corporate strategy, see page 27 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Development of competitive and customer landscape\n\nWe expect competitors from Asia, North America and the Middle East in particular to gain increasing significance in the years ahead, especially as a result of advantageous raw materials and energy prices. Furthermore, we predict that many producers in countries rich in raw materials will expand their value chains in consumeroriented sectors. In addition, the proliferation of large-scale digital marketplaces for chemicals could impact existing customer and supplier relationships.\n\nWe expect a continuous rise in customer demand for sustainable solutions - for example, for products with a low carbon footprint, made from recycled, circular or bio-based raw materials that are biodegradable, or for products with other measurable sustainability benefits. However, an increase in customer demand for sustainable solutions is also highly dependent on regulation. Companies with a proven track record of providing more sustainable solutions will be able  to  achieve  higher  growth  and  profitability  as  a  result. The expansion of sharing economy business models could have a long-term impact on demand in individual customer industries. At the same time, higher demands on product features can also create opportunities for innovation. We are therefore addressing these topics in research and investment offers for the sustainable transformation of BASF.\n\nTo strengthen our competitiveness, we are continuously improving our  production  processes,  streamlining  our  administration  and simplifying processes. Our research and business focus is on highly innovative  businesses  and  differentiation  through  sustainability advantages to make our customers and BASF more successful.\n\n## Regulation/policy\n\nWe expect continued regulatory and societal pressure to achieve environmentally friendly energy production, emission-free energy consumption and a climate-neutral resource and raw material base. The political approaches to address these issues will vary greatly from region to region. However, particularly in Europe, we expect measures  with  a  continuously  high  level  of  detailed  regulation, including changes to chemical and industry-related regulations that have the potential to significantly impact the competitiveness of BASF's operations and product portfolio as well as that of our customers.\n\nWe see the risk of the current geopolitical shifts leading to the establishment  of  uncoordinated  or  divergent  global  legislative standards and regulatory systems, not just in relation to chemicals or the regulatory framework for digitalization, but also to climate, environmental, social and corporate governance criteria. We see risks but also opportunities in the setting of international standards for specific product categories or technologies.\n\nWe explain our strategy in meetings with political decision-makers and social stakeholders. In doing so, we also inform ourselves of the changes we must undergo and advocate for a favorable and stable regulatory framework at both a national and international level. BASF  is  in  a  position  to  make  significant  contributions  toward achieving  the  U.N.  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  particularly regarding climate neutrality, through new technologies, innovative products and processes and its broad product portfolio.\n\n## Innovation\n\nWe expect the trend toward increased sustainability requirements in our customer industries to continue. Our aim is to leverage the resulting opportunities in a growing market with more sustainable innovations.  The  key  areas  are  products  with  a  lower  or  even net-zero carbon footprint, circular economy solutions, and safe and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsustainable products. To be successful in these fields, we have launched specific research and investment opportunities for the sustainable transformation of BASF. Furthermore, in order to steer our innovation portfolio toward increased sustainability, we also began applying the Sustainable Solution Steering method, revised in 2023, to the evaluation of innovation projects and integrated it at an early stage of our research and development processes.\n\nThere are technical and commercial risks of failure associated with every single research and development project. We address this by maintaining a balanced and comprehensive project portfolio as well as through professional, milestone-based project management.\n\nFurther risks may arise from increasing state protectionism and the demand for localization of intellectual property in order to achieve technological independence. Through our Know-How Verbund in research  and  development,  we  ensure  that  critical  intellectual property  is  generated  and  protected  in  countries  with  high intellectual property standards.\n\nWe expect that the digital disruption of established processes will lead to a considerable increase in efficiency and effectiveness in some fields through the use of artificial intelligence, among other things. BASF is therefore committed to taking a leading role in the digital transformation of the chemical industry. Possible applications of digital technologies and solutions are evaluated along the entire value  chain  and  implemented  throughout  the  company,  for example,  in  production,  logistics,  research  and  development, business models and corporate governance.\n\nFor more information on innovation, see page 54 onward\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Procurement and supply chain\n\nStrategic risks in procurement are of great importance to BASF, as they can impact the company's long-term competitiveness and positioning. Strategic risks include structural changes on the global markets,  climate  change  and  political  developments.  Supply security  for  raw  materials,  energy  and  services  is  increasingly affected by trade disputes, protectionism, sanctions and geopolitical conflicts. To counter these risks, BASF relies on close cooperation with strategic suppliers and continuous monitoring of markets and trends.\n\nWe  are  also  seeing  an  expansion  of  the  regulatory  framework affecting us and our suppliers (for example, the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act or the E.U. Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive). Potential noncompliance by our suppliers may lead to a reduced supplier base.\n\nAll risks are continuously analyzed and appropriate strategies and measures developed to avert risks or minimize the impact on BASF.\n\nFor more information on supplier management, see page 158 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investments\n\nWe expect growth in chemical production in emerging markets to remain above the global average in the years to come. This will create opportunities that we want to exploit by expanding our local presence. In addition, regional value chains help mitigate risks from trade conflicts and barriers that pose a challenge to global markets and supply chains.\n\nDecisions  on  the  type,  scope  and  location  of  our  investment projects  are  made  on  the  basis  of  established  comprehensive assessment processes. They take into account long-term forecasts for the market, margin and cost development, and raw materials availability, as  well  as  country,  currency,  sustainability  and technology  risks.  Opportunities  and  risks  arise  from  potential\n\ndeviations in actual developments from our assumptions. Mitigation plans are in place where risks are substantial.\n\nInvestments in more sustainable technologies represent a long-term opportunity, even though they may not be competitive or profitable in the short term, depending on the market and the prevailing regulatory framework.\n\n- For more information on our investment projects, see page 172 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Acquisitions/divestitures/cooperations\n\nIn the future, we will continue to expand and refine our portfolio through smaller, bolt-on acquisitions that promise above-average profitable  growth,  are  innovation-driven  or  offer  a  technological differentiation and help achieve a relevant market position, and make new, sustainable business models possible.\n\nThe evaluation of opportunities and risks plays a significant role during the assessment of acquisition targets. A detailed analysis and quantification is conducted as part of due diligence. Examples of  risks  include  increased  staff  turnover,  delayed  realization  of synergies, or the assumption of obligations that were not precisely quantifiable in advance. If our expectations in this regard are not met, risks could arise, such as a need for impairment. Opportunities could also arise, for example, from additional synergies. We are also continuing  to  develop  our  portfolio  through  carve-outs  and divestitures. In this context, risks could arise as a result of potential warranty claims or other contractual obligations, such as long-term supply agreements.\n\nFor more information on our acquisitions and divestitures, see page 45\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Personnel\n\nBASF anticipates growing challenges in attracting and retaining qualified employees in the medium and long term. This is due to demographic change, particularly in North America and Europe. In addition, the chemical industry, which is heavily dependent on fossil\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nraw materials, is increasingly viewed critically by the public. This increases the risk for the industry that job vacancies may not be filled or may be filled only after a delay, and therefore not enough qualified talent can be attracted, recruited and retained.\n\nWe  address  these  risks  with  opportunities  to  strengthen  our employer branding and our reputation (for example, our 'Change for the  climate'  campaign).  At  local  level,  we  are  taking  steps  to strengthen employee engagement and we are implementing offers such  as  succession  planning,  knowledge  management  and initiatives to improve the balance between personal and professional life and promote healthy living. This increases BASF's appeal as an employer and retains our employees in the long term.\n\n- For more information on individual initiatives and our targets, see page 132 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate\n\nOngoing climate change also poses opportunities and risks for BASF. As an energy-intensive company, climate-related risks arise particularly  from  regulatory  changes,  such  as  in  carbon  prices through emissions trading systems, taxes or energy legislation. In addition, BASF's emissions footprint and intensity could lead to a negative perception and reduced appeal among  external stakeholders such as customers, investors and skilled workers. We counter these risks with our carbon management measures and by transparently  disclosing  our  positions  on  and  contributions  to climate protection, for example, in the form of political demands or through progress in the implementation of our climate strategy, in publicly accessible sources such as this annual report or on the BASF website, and in direct dialog with external stakeholders.\n\nTo assess the changing physical risks for our sites from climate change,  climate  data  based  on  the  latest  scenarios  of  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were compiled for our sites in cooperation with an external partner. This enables the sites to assess the potential physical impact of climate change in the coming decades. Here, we focus on a climate protection scenario,",

It is planned to expand this approach to all of BASF's key sites in the next few years.\n\nIn addition to climate-related risks, there are also opportunities. Our broad product portfolio includes, among other things, solutions for the circular economy and climate protection, such as insulation foams  for  buildings,  materials  for  electromobility  or  bio-based products. Increased societal demands and the resulting regulations offer additional market opportunities for these products. We are working  with  numerous  scientific  and  public  organizations  and initiatives on  solutions  for  sustainable  agriculture  that  meet economic, environmental and social demands over the long term.\n\nFor more information on our sustainability concept, see page 48 onward\n\nFor more information on energy and climate protection, see page 102 onward\n\nFor more information on opportunities and risks from energy policies, see page 177\n\n- For more information on our positions on and contributions to climate protection,\n- see basf.com/climate\\_protection\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Disclosures on BASF SE in Accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB)\n\nThe Management's Report of BASF SE is combined with the Management's Report of the BASF Group for the first time for the  2023  business  year.  As  the  publicly  listed  parent  company  in  the  BASF  Group,  BASF  SE  takes  a  central position: Directly or indirectly, it holds the shares in the companies belonging to the BASF Group, and is also one of the largest operating companies. A complete overview of BASF SE's operating business is provided by the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group.\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nBASF  SE  operates  the  BASF  Group's  largest  Verbund  site  in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and is therefore one the most important operating companies of the BASF Group. In addition to marketing its own production to third parties, BASF SE supplies its products to other BASF Group companies, which process them in downstream production or sell them on the local market. BASF SE also distributes products from other BASF Group companies. All divisions, with the exception of Coatings, are active within BASF SE. As the parent company, BASF SE is also responsible for various central tasks, such as Group management and large parts of the Corporate Center. In addition, extensive research activities are bundled here.\n\nAs the top parent company, BASF SE directly or indirectly holds the shares in the companies belonging to the BASF Group: This is reflected above all in the financial assets and the financial result.\n\nDue to this distinct integration into the BASF Group, BASF SE is managed  within  the  framework  of  the  BASF  Group's  steering concept and has not implemented a separate steering concept. Income from operations is the most suitable indicator for assessing business performance and is therefore BASF SE's most important financial key performance indicator. In contrast to previous years, sales  revenue  is  no  longer  a  most  important  financial  key performance indicator at BASF SE from this reporting year onward.\n\nThe Financial Statements of BASF SE are prepared in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 of October 8, 2001, on the Statute for a European company (SE) and the applicable regulations for public limited-liability companies in the Member State in which it has its registered office, i.e., in accordance with the accounting regulations for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, in particular the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The Consolidated Financial Statements of  the  BASF  Group,  however,  take  into  account  the  Financial Statements of BASF SE, which are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this section:\n\nCorporate Structure Results of Operations of BASF SE Net Assets and Financial Position of BASF SE Forecast, Opportunities and Risks of BASF SE Nonfinancial and Other Disclosures of BASF SE",

Sales decreased in the operating business due mainly to lower sales volumes. The economic environment continues to pose exceptional challenges for the chemical industry. Against this backdrop, lower plant capacity utilization, impairments on  intangible  assets  totaling  \u20ac260  million  and  impairments  on property, plant and equipment totaling \u20ac75 million, had an impact on BASF SE's profit in 2023. Gross profit on sales declined by \u20ac272 million to \u20ac2,762 million.\n\nContrary to our prediction of a considerable increase, income from operations decreased by \u20ac68  million to -\u20ac2,064  million. In the\n\nreporting year, income from operations continued to be negatively impacted by a high inflation rate on pension obligations. In contrast, expenses for variable compensation decreased. Selling expenses decreased by \u20ac410 million, due in particular to lower freight and shipping costs. Administrative costs were \u20ac121 million below the prior-year  level.  In  addition,  research  expenses  decreased  by \u20ac220 million as a result of lower expenditure in the divisions and for exploratory research. The balance of other operating income and expenses declined by \u20ac547 million compared with the previous year to -\u20ac1,284 million. Out-of-period income decreased by \u20ac45 million, primarily  due  to  lower  reversals  of  provisions.  Furthermore, \u20ac396 million higher expenses from agreed cost transfers from Group companies  were  recognized.  In  addition,  \u20ac152  million  higher\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpenses for restructuring measures and \u20ac65 million for portfolio measures were recorded in connection with the implementation of strategic  measures.  By  contrast,  the  foreign  currency  result improved by \u20ac33 million.\n\nThe financial result rose by \u20ac3,360  million compared with the previous year to \u20ac9,909  million. Dividends totaling \u20ac4,807  million from a Dutch subsidiary of BASF SE, which mainly included retained earnings, led to an increase in net income from shareholdings. This was  offset  by  lower  profit  transfers,  which  were  influenced  in particular by a lower distribution of retained earnings from a Belgian Group company. The higher interest result was attributable to a positive result from plan assets and lower interest expenses from pension obligations.\n\nIncome before income taxes increased by \u20ac3,292 million year on year  to  \u20ac7,845  million.  Income  tax  expenses  decreased  by \u20ac293 million in the reporting year. Due to deferred tax assets and liabilities,  \u20ac628  million  lower  expenses  were  recorded  in  the reporting year. By contrast, current income tax expenses increased by \u20ac335 million.\n\nNet  income increased  by  \u20ac3,585  million  compared  with  the previous year to \u20ac7,434 million in 2023.",

Intangible assets declined by \u20ac493 million. In addition to scheduled depreciation, impairments of \u20ac260 million were recognized in the Materials segment.

Receivables from affiliated companies declined by \u20ac4,805  million due to the repayment of financial investments within the Group, lower profit transfers and lower trade accounts receivable within the Group. The \u20ac346 million decrease in trade accounts receivable was partly attributable to the sale of accounts receivable as part of a factoring program launched in the 2023 business year. In addition, deferred  taxes  declined  by  \u20ac408  million  and  inventories  by \u20ac284  million. This was offset by an increase of \u20ac780  million in liquid funds.",

The  net  income  of \u20ac7,434 million was offset by the dividend of \u20ac3,035 million paid for the 2022 reporting year, and effects amounting to \u20ac70 million from the share buyback.\n\nProvisions decreased by a total of \u20ac299 million. Within this item, other provisions declined by \u20ac260 million, primarily as a result of lower provisions for variable compensation. Pension plan assets were offset against pension obligations, which resulted in a surplus of  obligations.  Overall,  provisions  for  pensions  decreased  by \u20ac92 million as a result of this offsetting. The main reason for the \u20ac162 million increase in plan assets was an increase in fair values.\n\nPension obligations increased by \u20ac70 million, in particular due to the effects of the pension adjustments. Provisions for taxes rose by \u20ac53 million.\n\nLiabilities and other items decreased by \u20ac9,635 million. Within this item, liabilities to affiliated companies decreased by \u20ac9,114 million, mainly due to the repayment of intragroup borrowings. In addition, trade accounts payable decreased by \u20ac391 million.\n\nOperating activities generated cash of \u20ac12,369 million in the 2023 reporting  year  (previous  year:  \u20ac903  million),  in  particular  from BASF SE's function as the parent company of the BASF Group. At \u20ac7,434 million, net income was considerably above the prior-year level  (previous  year:  \u20ac3,849  million).  In  addition,  profit  transfers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfrom the previous year and inflows from operating receivables and inventories  had  a  positive  effect  in  the  reporting  year.  This  was partially offset by noncash expenses for deferred taxes as well as cash outflows from the decrease in operating liabilities.\n\nInvesting activities generated cash of \u20ac543 million (previous year: \u20ac3,319 million). Cash inflows from repayments of intragroup cash investments, the sale of marketable securities and capital decreases at subsidiaries exceeded cash outflows for investments in financial assets and property, plant and equipment in the reporting year. Investments in financial assets mainly related to capital increases at foreign subsidiaries.\n\nFinancing activities resulted in a cash outflow of \u20ac11,935  million (previous  year:  \u20ac4,576  million).  This  was  mainly  due  to  the repayment of financial liabilities within the Group and the dividend payment. Issuance of financial debts were offset by repayments of a comparable amount.\n\nIn total, liquid funds rose by \u20ac977 million to \u20ac1,160 million. These comprise cash on hand and balances with banks.",

In 2023, income from operations was negatively impacted  by  lower  plant  capacity  utilization,  impairments  on intangible assets and impairments on property, plant and equipment as well as a one-off cost transfer from a Group company. In addition, ongoing inflation led to high expenses for pension obligations. We do not expect the one-off effects to reoccur in 2024.\n\n## Opportunities and risks, risk management system\n\nBASF SE is generally exposed to the same opportunities and risks as the BASF Group.\n\nBASF SE's internal control and risk management system with regard to the financial reporting process (section 289(4) HGB) is based on a uniform accounting guideline that sets out accounting policies and the significant processes and deadlines on a Group- wide basis.

This relates in particular to the reporting of significant nonfinancial information, which also became mandatory for the parent company of the BASF Group, BASF SE, as a result of the CSR Directive Implementation Act, which came into effect in 2017. The integrated presentation was selected in the Management's Report for the Nonfinancial Statement (NFS) to be issued in the reporting year in accordance with sections 289b to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The table on this and the following page shows the relevant nonfinancial key figures of BASF SE. All disclosures on strategy, due diligence, targets, described processes and  key  figures  contained  in  the  preceding  statements  in  the Combined  Management's  Report  apply  to  the  BASF  Group including BASF SE. No significant deviations were identified for BASF SE.\n\nWithin the scope of the audit of the annual financial statements, the auditor KPMG checked pursuant to section 317(2) sentence 4 HGB that  the  NFS  was  presented  in  accordance  with  the  statutory requirements.

This includes its organization, values, corporate principles and guidelines as well as internal and external control and monitoring mechanisms. Effective and transparent corporate governance ensures that BASF is managed and supervised responsibly with a focus on value creation and sustainability. It fosters the confidence of our investors, the financial markets, our customers and other business partners, employees, other groups affiliated with our company (stakeholders) as well as the public in BASF.\n\nThe fundamental elements of BASF SE's corporate governance system are: its two-tier management system, with a transparent and effective  separation  of  company  management  and  supervision between BASF's Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board;  the  equal  representation  of  shareholders  and  employee representatives on the Supervisory Board; and the shareholders' rights of coadministration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Board of Executive Directors\n\n## At a glance\n\n- \u25aa Responsible for company management and represents BASF SE in business with third parties\n- \u25aa Sets goals and strategic direction\n- \u25aa Strictly separate from the Supervisory Board\n\n## Direction and management by the Board of Executive Directors\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the management of the company and represents BASF SE in business undertakings with third parties. BASF's Board of Executive Directors is strictly separated from the Supervisory Board, which monitors the Board of Executive  Directors'  activities  and  decides  on  its  composition. A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously\n\nbe a member of the Supervisory Board. As the central duty of company management, the Board of Executive Directors defines the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF Group as well as its individual business areas, including the sustainability strategy. In doing so, the Board ensures that the opportunities and risks  associated  with  social  and  environmental  factors  for  our company as well as the ecological and societal impacts of BASF's activities are systematically identified and evaluated. In addition to long-term  economic  goals,  the  corporate  strategy  appropriately takes environmental and social objectives into account, too. The corporate planning defined on this basis comprises financial and sustainability-related goals.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  determines  the company's internal organization and decides on the composition of management  positions  on  the  levels  below  the  Board.  It  also manages and monitors BASF Group business by planning and setting the corporate budget, allocating resources and management capacities, monitoring and making decisions on significant individual measures, and supervising operational management.\n\nThe Board's actions and decisions are geared toward the company's best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably increasing the company's value and developing the company over the long term, taking into account environmental and social goals as well as economic  targets. The  Board's  responsibilities include the preparation of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements of  BASF  SE  and  reporting  on  the  company's  financial  and nonfinancial performance as well as half-year and quarterly reporting.\n\nFurthermore, it must ensure that the company's activities comply with the applicable legislation and regulatory requirements as well as internal corporate  directives  (compliance).  This  includes  the establishment of appropriate systems for control, compliance and risk management  as  well  as  establishing  a  company-wide compliance culture with undisputed standards (see page 202).\n\nDecisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole by law, through the Board of Executive Directors' Rules of Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are made and all important matters of the company are discussed at regularly held Board meetings called by the chair of the Board of Executive Directors. Board decisions are based on detailed information and analyses provided by the business areas and specialist units and, if deemed necessary,  by  external  consultants.  The  chair  of  the  Board  of Executive Directors leads the Board meetings. Board decisions can generally be made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors gives the casting vote. However, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors cannot enforce a decision against the Board of Executive Directors' majority vote. The chair of the Board also does not have the right to veto. Outside  of  matters  that  are  assigned  to  the  entire  Board  for consultation and decision-making, all members of the Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in their designated areas of responsibility.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors can set up Board committees to consult and decide on individual issues such as proposed material acquisition or divestiture projects or to prepare decisions to be\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the preparation of important decisions, such as those on acquisitions, divestitures, investments and personnel, the Board has various commissions at the level below the Board. With the support of the specialist units and independently of the affected business area, these committees thoroughly  assess  the  planned  measures  and  evaluate  the associated opportunities and risks. Based on this information, they report and make recommendations to the Board.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory Board regularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all issues important to the company with regard to planning, business development, risk situation,  risk  management  and  compliance.  Furthermore,  the Board of Executive Directors coordinates the company's strategic orientation with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Statutes of BASF SE and the Supervisory Board have defined certain transactions that require the Board of Executive Directors to obtain the Supervisory Board's approval prior to their conclusion. Such  cases  that  require  approval  include  the  acquisition  and disposal of enterprises and parts of enterprises, as well as the issue of bonds or comparable financial instruments. However, this is only necessary if the acquisition or disposal price or the amount of the issue in an individual case exceeds 3% of the equity reported in the most recent approved Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group.\n\n- For more information on risk management, see the Forecast report from page 173 onward\n\nThe members of the Board of Executive Directors, including their areas of responsibility and memberships in the supervisory bodies of other companies, are listed from page 205 onward.\n\n- For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors,\n- see basf.com/compensationreport\n\nCompetence profile, diversity concept and succession planning for the Board of Executive Directors\n\nThe Supervisory Board works hand in hand with the Board of Executive Directors to ensure long-term succession planning for the\n\n## BASF SE's two-tier management system\n\n## Board of Executive Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6 members appointed by the Supervisory Board Chair\n\nappointed by the Supervisory Board\n\ncomposition of the Board of Executive Directors. BASF aims to fill most Board positions with leaders from within the company. It is the task of the Board of Executive Directors to propose a sufficient number of suitable individuals to the Supervisory Board.\n\nBASF's long-term succession planning is guided by the corporate strategy.  It  is  based  on  systematic  management  development characterized by the following:\n\n- - Early identification of suitable leaders of different professional backgrounds, nationalities and genders\n- - Systematic  development  of  leaders  through  the  successful assumption of tasks with increasing responsibility, where possible in different business areas, regions and functions\n- - Desire to shape strategic and operational decisions and proven success in doing so, as well as leadership skills, especially under challenging business conditions\n- - Role model function in putting corporate values into practice\n\nmonitors the Board of Executive Directors\n\nappoints the Board of Executive Directors\n\nadvises the Board of Executive Directors\n\nreports to the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12 members\n\n6 shareholder representatives elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and 6 employee representatives\n\nChair\n\nelected by the Supervisory Board\n\nThe aim is to enable the Supervisory Board to ensure a reasonable level  of  diversity  with  respect  to  education  and  professional experience,  cultural background,  international  representation, gender and age when appointing members of the Board of Executive Directors. Irrespective of these individual criteria, a holistic approach will determine a person's suitability for appointment to the Board of Executive  Directors  of  BASF  SE.  Both  systematic  succession planning and the selection process aim to ensure that the Board of Executive Directors as a whole has the following profile, which serves as a diversity concept:\n\n- - Many years of leadership experience in scientific, technical and commercial fields\n- - International experience based on background and/or professional experience\n- - At least one female Board member\n- - A balanced age distribution to ensure the continuity of the Board's work and enable seamless succession planning",

        "page_content": "The  first  appointment  of  members  of  the  Board  of  Executive Directors is for a term of no more than three years. The standard age limit  for  members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  is  63. The Supervisory Board determines the number of members on the Board of Executive Directors. It is guided by insights gained by BASF as a company with an integrated leadership culture and is determined by the needs arising from cooperation within the Board of Executive Directors. The Supervisory Board considers six to be an  appropriate  number  of  Board  members  given  the  current business  composition,  future  responsibilities  associated  with development and the fundamental organizational structure of the BASF Group.\n\nThe current composition of the Board of Executive Directors meets the  competence  profile  and  the  requirements  of  the  diversity concept in full.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n## At a glance\n\n- \u25aa Appoints, monitors and advises Board of Executive Directors\n- \u25aa Four Supervisory Board committees\n- \u25aa Composition criteria: professional and personal qualifications, diversity, and independence\n\n## Supervision of company management by the Supervisory Board\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  appoints  the  members  of  the  Board of Executive Directors and supervises and advises the Board of Executive Directors on management issues. It must also be involved in making decisions that are of key importance for the company. This also includes the Board of Executive Directors' consideration of sustainability  topics  with  regard  to  corporate  governance.  The Supervisory Board is also responsible for auditing BASF SE's and\n\nthe  Group's  Annual  Financial  Statements.  As  members  of  the Supervisory Board may not simultaneously be on the Board of Executive  Directors,  a  high  level  of  independence  is  already structurally ensured with regard to the supervision of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nIn addition to the SE Regulation, the relevant legal basis for the size and  composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  is  provided  by  the Statutes of BASF SE and the Agreement Concerning the Involvement of Employees in BASF SE (Employee Participation Agreement). The latter also  includes  the  regulations  applicable  to  BASF  for implementing the statutory gender quota for the Supervisory Board. The German Codetermination Act does not apply to BASF SE as a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea, SE).\n\nThe Supervisory Board of BASF SE comprises 12 members. Six members are elected by the shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting via a simple majority. Six members are elected by the BASF Europa Betriebsrat (BASF Works Council Europe), the European employee representation body of the BASF Group. In accordance with the resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 18, 2020, the period of appointment for newly elected members of the Supervisory Board was reduced from five to four years; and the Statutes were amended accordingly. This ensures that the maximum membership duration of 12 years up to which a Supervisory Board member can be classified as independent in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code corresponds to a total of three election terms.\n\nMeetings of the Supervisory Board and its four committees are called by their respective chairs and independently, at the request of one of their members or the Board of Executive Directors. The shareholder and employee representatives of the Supervisory Board prepare for Supervisory Board meetings in separate preliminary discussions in each case. Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are passed by a simple majority vote of the participating Supervisory Board members. In the event of a tie, the vote of the chair of the Supervisory Board, who must always be a shareholder representative,\n\n- * Classified by the Supervisory Board as an 'independent' member of the Supervisory Board (see page 197 for the criteria used to determine independence)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nshall be the casting vote. This resolution process is also applicable for the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Executive Directors by the Supervisory Board. Resolutions can, as needed, also be made in writing or through electronic communication outside of the meetings, as long as no Supervisory Board member objects to this form of passing a resolution. The Supervisory Board meets regularly even without the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors continually informs the Supervisory Board about matters such as the course of business and expected developments,  the  financial  position  and  results  of  operations, corporate planning, the implementation of the corporate strategy, including  the  sustainability  strategy,  business  opportunities  and risks, risk and compliance management and the internal control system. The Supervisory Board has embedded the main reporting requirements in an information policy. The chair of the Supervisory Board is in regular contact with the Board of Executive Directors, especially with its chair, outside of meetings as well.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- A list of the members of BASF SE's Supervisory Board indicating which members are shareholder or employee representatives and their appointments to the supervisory bodies of other companies can be found from page 207 onward.\n\nFor more information on the compensation of the Supervisory Board,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- see basf.com/compensationreport\n- The Statutes of BASF SE and the Employee Participation Agreement can be found at basf.com/statutes\n- and basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Personnel Committee\n\n## Members\n\nDr. Kurt Bock* (chair) Prof. Dr. Stefan Asenkerschbaumer* Sinischa Horvat* Michael Vassiliadis\n\n## Duties\n\n- - Prepares the appointment of members to the Board of Executive Directors by the Supervisory Board as well as the service contracts",

The sustainability topic is of such pivotal importance to BASF with its economic success, environment and social-related aspects that the entire Supervisory Board regularly discusses it in detail as a cross-cutting issue. This also applies to the significant issue of reducing CO2 emissions and the targeted conversion of business activities to emission-free energy supply and production processes with a lower emission rate.\n\n## Meetings and meeting attendance\n\nIn the 2023 business year, meetings were held as follows:\n\n- - The Supervisory Board met five times.\n- - The Personnel Committee met four times.\n- - The Audit Committee met five times.\n- - The Nomination Committee met once.\n- - The Strategy Committee met once.\n\nWith the exception of one meeting, at which two members were absent,  all  respective  members  attended  all  meetings  of  the Supervisory Board.

In December 2017, the Supervisory Board agreed for the first time on objectives for the composition, the competence profile and the diversity concept of the Supervisory Board. These objectives and the competence profile have since been continuously updated in the implementation of legal requirements and further developed, taking into account the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. The guiding principle for the composition of the Supervisory Board is to ensure qualified supervision and guidance for the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE. For the election of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board, individuals shall only be nominated to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting who can,  based  on  their  professional  knowledge  and  experience, integrity, commitment, independence and character, successfully perform the work of a supervisory board member at an international chemical company.\n\n## Competence profile\n\nThe following requirements and objectives (as amended in December 2022) are considered essential to the composition of the Supervisory Board as a collective body:\n\n- - Leadership experience in managing companies, associations and networks\n- * Classified by the Supervisory Board as an 'independent' member of the Supervisory Board (see page 197 for the criteria used to determine independence)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Members' collective knowledge of the chemical sector and the related value chains\n- - Appropriate knowledge within the body as a whole of finance, accounting,  financial  reporting,  risk  management,  law  and compliance\n- - Appropriate expertise within the body as a whole on sustainability topics that are of key importance for BASF\n- - At least one member with special knowledge and experience (special expertise) in accounting, including sustainability reporting\n- - At least one member with special knowledge and experience (special  expertise)  in  the  annual  audit,  including  the  audit of sustainability reporting\n- - At least one member with in-depth experience in innovation, research and development, and technology\n- - At  least  one  member  with  in-depth  experience  in  the  areas of digitalization, information technology, business models and start-ups\n- - At  least  one  member  with  in-depth  experience  in  the  areas of human resources, society, communications and the media\n- - Specialist knowledge and experience in sectors outside of the chemical industry\n\nThe status of implementation of the Supervisory Board's competence profile is shown in the following qualifications matrix on page 197.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on the Supervisory Board's competence profile, see\n\nbasf.com/competence-profile/supervisoryboard\n\n## Diversity concept\n\nThe Supervisory Board strives to achieve a reasonable level of diversity with respect to character, gender, international representation, professional background, specialist knowledge and experience  as  well  as  age  distribution.  It  takes  the  following composition criteria into account:\n\n- - At least 30% women and 30% men\n- - At least 30% of members have international experience based on their background or professional experience",

Member with special knowledge of and experience in auditing, including sustainability auditing\n- 3 Member with special knowledge of and experience in accounting and reporting, including sustainability reporting\n- SR = shareholder representative\n- ER = employee representative\n- - At least 50% of members have different educational backgrounds and professional experience\n- - At least 30% under the age of 60\n\n## Further composition objectives\n\n- -Character and integrity: Members of the Supervisory Board must  be  personally  reliable  and  have  the  knowledge  and experience required to diligently and independently perform the work of a supervisory board member.\n- -Availability: Each member of the Supervisory Board ensures that they invest the time needed to properly perform their role as a member of the Supervisory Board of BASF SE. The statutory limits on appointments and the recommendations of the German Corporate  Governance  Code  must  be  complied  with  when accepting further appointments.\n- -Age  limit  and  period  of  membership: Persons  who  have reached the age of 72 on the day of election by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting should generally not be nominated for election. Membership on the Supervisory Board should generally not  exceed  three  regular  statutory  periods  in  office,  which corresponds to 12 years.\n- -Independence: To  ensure  the  independent  monitoring  and consultation of the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board  should  have  an  appropriate  number  of  independent members on the board as a whole and an appropriate number of independent shareholder representatives. The Supervisory Board deems this to be the case if more than half of the shareholder representatives and at least eight members of the Supervisory Board  as  a  whole  can  be  considered  independent.  The Supervisory Board's assessment of independence is based on the assessment criteria in the current respective version of the German Corporate Governance Code. Among other things, this\n\nmeans that members of the Supervisory Board are no longer considered independent if they have been a member of the board for 12 years or longer. The Supervisory Board has additionally defined  the  following  principles  to  clarify  the  meaning  of independence: The independence of employee representatives is not compromised by their role as an employee representative or employment by BASF SE or a Group company. Prior membership of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE does not preclude independence following the expiry of the statutory cooling-off period of two years. Material transactions between a Supervisory Board member or a related party or undertaking of the Supervisory Board member on the one hand, and BASF SE or a BASF Group company on the other, exclude a member of the Supervisory Board from being qualified as independent. A material transaction is defined as one or more transactions in a single calendar year with a total volume of 1% or more of the sales of the companies involved in each case. In the same way, if a Supervisory Board member or a related party or undertaking of a Supervisory Board",

Furthermore, if a Supervisory Board member or a related party of a Supervisory Board member holds more than 20% of the shares in a company in which BASF SE is indirectly or directly the majority shareholder, the necessary independence is also not met.\n\n## Status of implementation\n\nAccording to the Supervisory Board's own assessment, its current composition  meets  all  of  the  requirements  of  the  competence profile: 11 of the 12 current members, of which six are shareholder representatives and  five  are  employee  representatives,  are considered  independent  based  on  the  above  criteria.  Only  the employee representative Michael Vassiliadis is no longer considered independent as he has been a member of the Supervisory Board since August 2004, and therefore for over 12 years.\n\n- For more information on the statutory minimum quotas for the number of women and men on the Supervisory Board, see the section on this page 'Commitments to promote the participation of women in leadership positions at BASF SE'\n\nThe independent Supervisory Board members are named under Management and Supervisory Boards from page 207 onward.\n\n## Compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Compensation Report in accordance with section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the assurance statement of  the  substantive  and  formal  audit  issued  by  the  auditor,  the effective compensation system for the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section 87a AktG, as well as the most recent resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on the compensation of the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 113(3) AktG have  been  made  publicly  available  on  the  BASF  website  at basf.com/compensationreport.\n\n## Commitments to promote the participation of women in leadership positions at BASF SE\n\nThe supervisory board of a publicly listed European stock corporation (SE) that is composed of the same number of shareholder and employee representatives must, according to section 17(2) of the SE Implementation Act, consist of at least 30% women and 30% men. Since the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Supervisory Board  of  BASF  SE  comprises  four  women,  of  whom  two  are shareholder representatives and two are employee representatives, and eight men. The Supervisory Board's composition meets the statutory requirements.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the Act to Supplement and Amend the  Regulations  on  Equal  Participation  of  Women  and  Men  in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sector (F\u00fcPoG) on August  12, 2021, if the management board of a listed company consists of more than three persons, at least one woman and one man must be members of the management board (section 76 (3a) AktG).  BASF  met  this  requirement  in  the  reporting  year.  With Dr. Melanie Maas-Brunner, there was one female Board member. With  six  members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors,  this corresponds to a 16.7 percentage of women.\n\nIn compliance with legal requirements of the F\u00fcPoG, the Board of Executive Directors decided on target figures for the proportion of  women  at  the  two  management  levels  below  the  Board  of Executive Directors of BASF SE. For the target-attainment period from  January  1,  2022,  to  December  31,  2026,  the  Board  of Executive Directors resolved as targets the quotas achieved as of December 31, 2021: 20.0% for the proportion of women in the management level directly below the Board and 23.2% for the level below that.\n\nBASF views the further development and promotion of women as a global duty independent of individual Group companies. For this purpose, it has committed to ambitious targets on a worldwide scale. The new target is to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions worldwide to 30% by 2030. BASF will continue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto work systematically on expanding the percentage of women in its leadership  team.  To  achieve  this,  global  measures  will  be implemented and enhanced continuously.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on women in leadership positions in the BASF Group and on the inclusion of diversity, including promotion of women, see the Combined Management's Report from page 138 onward\n\nFor more information on women in leadership positions in the BASF Group in Germany,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- see basf.com/diversity\\_inclusion\n\nThe November 2015 Employee Participation Agreement relevant to the composition of the Supervisory Board is available at basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Shareholders' rights\n\n## At a glance\n\n- \u25aa Shareholders exercise rights of coadministration and supervision at Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n- \u25aa One share, one vote\n\nShareholders exercise their rights of coadministration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which usually takes place within the first five months of the business year. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting elects half of the members of the Supervisory Board (shareholder representatives) and, in particular, resolves on the formal discharge of the Board of Executive Directors and  the  Supervisory  Board,  the  distribution  of  profits,  capital measures, the authorization of share buybacks, changes to the Statutes and the selection of the auditor.\n\nEach BASF SE share represents one vote. All of BASF SE's shares are registered shares. Shareholders are obliged to have themselves entered with their shares into the company share register and to provide  the  information  necessary  for  registration  in  the  share register according to the German Stock Corporation Act. There are no registration restrictions and there is no limit to the number of shares that can be registered to one shareholder. Only the persons listed in the share register are entitled to vote as shareholders. Listed shareholders  may  exercise  their  voting  rights  at  the  Annual",

Individual instructions are only forwarded to the company on the morning of the day of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Voting rights can be exercised  according  to  shareholders'  instructions  by  companyappointed proxies until the beginning of the voting process during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. There are neither voting caps to limit the number of votes a shareholder may cast nor special voting rights. BASF has fully implemented the principle of 'one share, one vote.' All shareholders entered in the share register are entitled to participate in the Annual Shareholders' Meetings, to have their say concerning any item on the agenda and to request information about company issues insofar as this is necessary to make an informed judgment about the item on the agenda under discussion. Registered shareholders are also entitled to file motions pertaining to proposals for resolutions made by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and to contest resolutions of the meeting and have them evaluated for their lawfulness in court. Shareholders who hold at least \u20ac500,000 of the company's share capital, a quota corresponding to 390,625 shares, are furthermore entitled to request that additional items be added to the agenda of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting was held again for the first time as an in-person meeting, i.e., with the shareholders physically present at the meeting venue.\n\nThe  2023  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  resolved  a  series  of amendments to the Statutes in connection with the format of the Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  and  the  participation  options. Accordingly, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized to hold the Annual Shareholders' Meeting or an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting  as  a  virtual  meeting  without  the  physical  presence  of shareholders or their proxies at the venue of the meeting. This authorization for a period of two years is valid until May 8, 2025.\n\nIn a further resolution amending the Statutes, the 2023 Annual Shareholders' Meeting authorized the Board of Executive Directors to provide for shareholders to participate in the Annual Shareholders' Meeting or an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting without being present at the venue and without a proxy and to exercise all or some of their rights in whole or in part by means of electronic communication (hybrid Annual Shareholders' Meeting or Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting). This means that shareholders can also be enabled to participate  in  an  in-person  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  or Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting online in the future.\n\nThe  third  resolution  amending  the  Statutes  relates  to  enabling members of the Supervisory Board to participate in the Annual Shareholders' Meeting or an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting by means of video and audio transmission in cases where they would not be able to be physically present at the venue of the meeting or only with considerable effort. This also applies if the Annual Shareholders' Meeting or an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting is held as a purely virtual event.\n\n- The current Statutes of BASF can be found at basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)\n\nBASF advocates responsible corporate governance that focuses on sustainably increasing the value of the company. BASF SE follows all of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated April 28, 2022 (Code 2022), the version in force at the time of submitting the Declaration of Conformity on December 20, 2023.In the same manner, BASF follows almost all of the nonobligatory suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code. Only suggestion A.7, whereby the duration of the Annual Shareholders'  Meeting  should  not  exceed  six  hours,  was  not complied with by BASF in 2023 due to the large number of questions asked at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n- The joint Declaration of Conformity 2023 by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board of BASF SE is rendered on page 217\n- For more information on the Declaration of Conformity 2023, the implementation of the Code's suggestions and the German Corporate Governance Code, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDisclosures according to sections 289a and 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and explanatory report of the Board of Executive Directors according to section 176(1) sentence 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\n## Share capital and shares\n\nAs of December  31, 2023, BASF SE's subscribed capital was \u20ac1,142,428,369.92 after the redemption of 1,332,765 repurchased own  company  shares  in  July  2023  (December  31,  2022: \u20ac1,144,134,309.12), divided into 892,522,164 registered shares with no par value (December 31, 2022: 893,854,929). Each share entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Restrictions on the right to vote or transfer shares do not exist. The same rights and duties apply to all shares. According to the Statutes, shareholders are not entitled to receive share certificates (issuance of share certificates). There are neither different classes of shares nor shares with preferential voting rights.\n\n## Appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Executive Directors\n\nThe  appointment  and  dismissal  of  members  of  the  Board  of Executive Directors is legally governed by the regulations in Article 39 of the SE Council Regulation, section 16 of the SE Implementation Act and sections 84 and 85 AktG as well as Article 7 of the Statutes of BASF  SE. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board determines the number of members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least two), appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors and can nominate a chair as well as one or more vice chairs. The members of the Board of Executive Directors are appointed for a maximum of five years. The maximum initial term of appointment is three  years.  Reappointments  are  permissible.  The  Supervisory Board can dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if there is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in particular, a gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of Executive Directors and a vote of no confidence by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments and dismissals according to its own best judgment.",

        "page_content": "## Amendments to the Statutes\n\n## Conditional capital\n\nAccording to Article 59(1) of the SE Council Regulation, amendments to the Statutes of BASF SE require a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting adopted with at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, provided that the legal provisions applicable to German stock corporations under the German Stock Corporation Act do not stipulate or allow for larger majority requirements. In the case of amendments to the Statutes, section 179(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act requires a majority of at least three-quarters of the subscribed capital represented. Pursuant to Article 12(6) of the Statutes of BASF SE, the Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve on amendments to the Statutes that merely concern their wording. This applies in particular to the adjustment of the share capital and the number of shares after the redemption of repurchased BASF shares and after an issue of shares from authorized capital.\n\n## Authorized capital\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May  3, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors of BASF  SE is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase, until May 2, 2024, on a one-off basis or in portions on a number of occasions,  the  company's  share  capital  by  a  total  of  up  to \u20ac470 million by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in kind (authorized capital). A right to subscribe to the new shares shall be granted to shareholders. This can also be achieved by a credit institution acquiring the new shares with the obligation to offer these to shareholders (indirect subscription right). The Board of Executive  Directors  is  authorized  to  exclude  the  statutory subscription right of shareholders to a maximum amount of a total of 10% of share capital in certain exceptional cases that are defined in Article 5(8) of the BASF SE Statutes. This applies in particular if, for capital increases in return for cash contributions, the issue price of the new shares is not substantially lower than the stock market price of BASF shares and the total number of shares issued under this authorization does not exceed 10% of the shares currently in issue or, in eligible individual cases, to acquire companies or shareholdings in companies in exchange for surrendering BASF shares.\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2022, the share capital was increased conditionally by up to \u20ac117,565,184 by issuing up to 91,847,800 new shares. The contingent capital increase serves to grant shares to the holders of convertible bonds or warrants attached to bonds with warrants of BASF SE or a subsidiary, which the Board of Executive Directors is authorized to issue up to April 28, 2027, by way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2022. A right to subscribe to  the  bonds  shall  be  granted  to  shareholders.  The  Board  of Executive  Directors  is  authorized  to  exclude  the  shareholders' subscription  right  in  certain  exceptional  cases  -  as  defined  in Article 5(9) of the BASF SE Statutes.\n\n## Authorization of share buybacks\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2022, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to purchase up to 10% of the BASF shares in issue at the time of the resolution (10% of the company's share capital) until April 28, 2027. At the discretion of the Board of Executive Directors, the shares can be bought back via the stock  exchange,  via  a  public  purchase  offer  addressed  to  all shareholders, via a public request to shareholders for the submission of offers to sell or by other means in accordance with section 53a AktG. The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to sell the repurchased company shares again (a) on a stock exchange, (b) through an offer directed to all shareholders, (c) with approval of the Supervisory Board, to third parties by means other than via the stock exchange or through an offer addressed to all shareholders in return for cash payment at a price that is not significantly lower than the stock exchange price of a BASF share at the time of the sale, or (d) with approval of the Supervisory Board, to third parties for contributions in kind, particularly in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts of companies or shares in companies (including increases  in  shareholdings)  or  within  the  scope  of  corporate mergers. In the cases specified under (c) and (d), the shareholders' subscription right is excluded. The Board of Executive Directors is furthermore authorized to retire the shares bought back and to reduce the share capital by the proportion of the share capital accounted for by the retired shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Share buyback program 2022/2023\n\nBased on the authorizations granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meetings on May 12, 2017 and April 29, 2022, altogether 25,956,530 treasury shares were acquired in the period from January 11, 2022 to February 23, 2023, corresponding to 2.8% of the share capital on announcement  of  the  commencement  of  the  share  buyback program on January 11, 2022. The purchase price for these own shares totaled around \u20ac1.4 billion. The shares were acquired by the banks  commissioned  by  BASF  SE  via  the  stock  exchange  in electronic  trading  on  the  Frankfurt  Stock  Exchange  (Xetra).  On February  24, 2023, the Board of Executive Directors announced that  it  would  terminate  the  share  buyback  program  ahead  of schedule in view of the profound changes in the global economy and in line with the company's priorities for the use of cash. All own shares repurchased in connection with this share buyback program in 2022 and 2023 were canceled, and the company's share capital was reduced pro rata by the amount attributable to the canceled shares.\n\n## Rights during a change of control\n\nBonds issued by BASF SE and its subsidiaries grant the bearer the right to request early repayment of the bonds at nominal value if, after the date of issue of the bond, one person - or several persons acting together - hold or acquire a volume of BASF SE shares that corresponds to more than 50% of the voting rights (change of control as a result of a takeover bid) and one of the rating agencies named in the bond's terms and conditions withdraws its rating of BASF SE or the bond or reduces it to a noninvestment grade rating within 120 days of the change of control event.\n\nThe compensation system for the Board of Executive Directors, which  was  approved  by  the  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  on June  18, 2020, does not provide for any special compensation related to a change of control should a member of the Board of Executive Directors unilaterally terminate their contract prematurely in such a case. The general rule for severance payments granted for premature terminations of appointments to the Board of Executive Directors  applies,  which  states  that  the  maximum  severance payment may not exceed the amount of two years' compensation;",

The employee whose service contract has been terminated in such a case will receive a maximum severance payment of 1.5 times the annual salary (fixed component) depending on the number of months that have passed since the change of control event. A change of control is assumed when a shareholder informs BASF SE of a shareholding of at least 25% of the BASF shares or the increase of such a holding.

Furthermore,  the  total  volume  of  BASF  SE  shares  and  related financial instruments held by all members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board accounts for less than 1% of the shares issued by the company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on share dealings of members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see basf.com/en/directorsdealings\n\n## Share dealings of the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board (Obligatory reportable and publishable directors' dealings under Article 19(1) of the E.U. Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 (MAR))\n\nAs legally stipulated by Article 19(1) MAR, all members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board as well as close family relatives are required to disclose the purchase or sale of financial  instruments  of  BASF  SE  (for  example,  shares,  bonds, options, forward contracts, swaps) to the German Federal Financial Supervisory  Authority  (Bundesanstalt  f\u00fcr  Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) and to the company if transactions within the calendar year exceed the threshold of \u20ac20,000. In 2023, a total of 11 purchases by members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board  of  BASF  SE  and  members  of  their  families  subject  to disclosure were reported as directors' dealings, involving between 800 and 3,400 BASF shares or BASF ADRs (American Depositary Receipts). The price per share was between \u20ac45.52 and \u20ac48.76. The volume of the individual transactions was between \u20ac34,134.94 and \u20ac154,779.

KPMG member firms also audit the majority of BASF Group companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. KPMG has been the continuous auditor of BASF SE since the 2006 Financial Statements. A public call to tender was issued in 2015 to all auditors for the audit of the 2016 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, in line with the E.U. Regulation 537/2014 of April 16, 2014 (E.U. Statutory Audit Regulation). Based on the results of the tendering process, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board that it once\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nagain propose KPMG for election. Owing to the German Financial Market Integrity Strengthening Act (FISG), KPMG was proposed for election by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting as BASF's auditor for the last time for the 2023 business year. Dr. Axel Th\u00fcmler has been the auditor responsible for the Consolidated Financial Statements since  auditing  the  2022  Financial  Statements.  Since  the  2020 Financial  Statements,  the  auditor  responsible  for  the  Separate Financial Statements has been Dr. Stephan Kaiser. The total fee paid to KPMG and auditing firms of the KPMG group by BASF SE and other BASF Group companies for nonaudit services, in addition to the auditing fee, was \u20ac1.9 million in 2023. This represents around 7.0% of the fees for auditing the financial statements.\n\nDuring its meeting on October 20, 2022, BASF SE's Supervisory Board, acting on the recommendation of the Audit Committee and after conducting a tendering process in line with the E.U. Statutory Audit Regulation, resolved to propose to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2024 that Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft be elected as auditor for BASF SE's Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2024 business year. It is legally required to change the auditor starting from the 2024 business year as KPMG will reach the maximum period for annual audits shortened by the Financial Market Integrity Strengthening Act when auditing the 2023 Financial Statements. The decision was preceded by a public and discrimination-free tendering process for the selection of a new auditor in line with the relevant provisions of the E.U. Statutory Audit Regulation. The selection process was conducted at an early stage in order to give the new auditor enough time to complete nonauditing services, in this way ensuring its independence and a seamless transition.\n\nFor more information, see Note 31 on page 315\n\n<!-- image -->",

The principles embedded in our Code of Conduct are established and  recognized  in  our  day-to-day  business.  We  expect  all employees to act in line with these principles. Our leaders play a key role here - they serve as an example of and communicate our values and  culture  both  internally  and  externally.  That  is  why  special workshops on integrity as a leadership task were again held in 2023 for newly appointed senior executives.\n\n## Monitoring adherence to our compliance principles\n\nBASF's Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and manages the further development of our global compliance organization and our Compliance Management System. The CCO is supported in this task by the Corporate Compliance department and more than 100  compliance  officers  and  representatives  worldwide  in  the regions and countries as well as in the operating divisions, service units and in the Corporate Center. Material compliance topics are regularly discussed in the compliance committees established at global and regional level. The compliance organization reports to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee in at least one of its meetings each year on the status of the Compliance Program as well  as  any  major  developments.  In  the  event  of  significant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nWe particularly encourage our employees to actively and promptly seek guidance if in doubt. They can consult their supervisors, specialist departments, such as the Legal department, and the\n\ncompliance  officers  and  representatives  of  the  company.  The internal platform and the corresponding app also help employees to  access  advice  by  enabling  direct  contact.  In  addition,  our employees  can  contact  our  compliance  hotline  -  including anonymously - to report potential violations of laws or company guidelines. An independent external company has been contracted to  manage  this  global  hotline  so  that  reported  cases  are systematically  recorded  and  processed  worldwide  in  a  single, uniform system. The central point of contact is a website that informs  all  employees  worldwide  about  the  hotline  and  the grievance procedure in their national language. In addition to local phone numbers, the website also offers an online contact option, which  is  available  via  PC  or  smartphone.  The  website  is  also available to the public. Each concern is documented according to specific criteria, properly investigated in line with standard internal procedures and answered as quickly as possible. The outcome of the investigation as well as any measures taken are documented accordingly and included in internal reports.\n\nIn 2023, 643 reports were received by our external hotlines (2022: 453). Our updated training materials and the option to contact us online have contributed to the increased use of our hotline. The information  received  related  to  all  categories  of  our  Code  of Conduct, including respect in the workplace, corruption, handling of company property and environmental, health and safety issues. We carefully investigated all cases of suspected misconduct that came to our attention and, when necessary, took countermeasures on a case-by-case basis. These included, for example, improved control mechanisms,  additional  informational  and  training  measures, clarification and expansion of the relevant internal regulations, as well as disciplinary measures as appropriate. Most of the justified cases  related  to  violations  of  our  principles  on  respect  in  the workplace  and  personal  misconduct  in  connection  with  the protection  of  company  property  or  inappropriate  handling  of conflicts of interests. In such isolated cases, we took disciplinary measures in accordance with uniform internal standards and also pursued claims for damages where there were sufficient prospects of success. In 2023, violations of our Code of Conduct led to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntermination of employment in a total of 48 cases (2022: 34). This relates to diverse employee groups, including executives.\n\nBASF's Corporate  Audit  department monitors  adherence  to compliance  principles,  covering  all  areas  in  which  compliance violations could occur. It checks that employees uphold regulations and make sure that the established processes, procedures and monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient to minimize potential risks or preclude violations in the first place. In 2023, 64 audits of this kind were performed Group-wide (2022: 47). Our compliance management system itself is also regularly audited by the internal Corporate Audit department, most recently in December 2022. Overall,  the  audit  results  speak  for  the  effectiveness  of  the compliance  management  system.  Building  on  our  internal Compliance Management System (CMS) policy made available in September 2022, we stipulated additional supplementary guidelines in 2023 to describe the principles, core processes and roles in our system in a dedicated manner. A particular focus of our compliance activities is to draw attention to the increasingly stringent legal regulations, such as data protection or the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (see page 156), and to further develop our internal systems accordingly.\n\nWe monitor our business partners in sales for potential compliance risks based on the global Guideline on Business Partner Due Diligence using a checklist, a questionnaire and an internet-based analysis. The results are then documented. If business partners are not prepared to answer the questionnaire, we do not enter into a business relationship with them. A dedicated global Supplier Code of Conduct applies to our suppliers, which covers compliance with environmental, social and corporate governance standards, among other requirements. As part of our trade control processes, we also check whether persons, companies or organizations appear on sanction lists due to suspicious or illegal activities and whether there are business processes with business partners from or in countries under embargo. One focus of our activities in 2023 was on the continuous  monitoring  and  implementation  of  the  dynamically evolving sanctions law requirements in light of the war in Ukraine.",

To aid in the achievement of the U.N. SDGs and to meet our own standards for the creation of economic and social value, we contribute to public finances in accordance with legal requirements and our corporate values.

At the same time, the focus was on BASF's strategic development: investments for future profitable growth, especially in Asia; further measurable progress toward the goal of climate neutrality; changes to the portfolio, first and foremost the separation from the oil and gas business; and finally, measures for the differentiated steering of the various businesses. Last but not least, decisions were made regarding the future composition of the Board of Executive Directors and its Chairman.\n\nSales and earnings performance remained considerably below expectations in 2023. The measures developed by the Board of Executive Directors to strengthen the competitiveness of the German sites in particular were discussed in detail. The Supervisory Board supports the measures to adjust production structures and reduce\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninvestments and personnel costs, which are also unavoidable due to the increasing tightening of regulations for the European chemical industry. Achieving an adequate return on capital and securing a good cash flow are prerequisites for achieving BASF's strategic goals.\n\nThe use of resources to invest in future growth and to further reduce greenhouse gases  was  also  discussed  against  the  backdrop  of  market  changes,  political uncertainties  and  technological  change.  High  levels  of  investment  in  renewable energies and lower-emission production processes will continue to be necessary in the future. The path pursued by the Board of Executive Directors of playing a pioneering role in transforming the BASF Verbund and in supporting customers in achieving their own CO2 targets is expressly supported.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board repeatedly and extensively discussed the future of Wintershall  Dea  AG's exploration and production business. The contribution to Harbour Energy plc will achieve the goal of a gradual and, above all, value-retaining separation from the oil and gas business. The legal separation of the activities expropriated in Russia is currently underway. Solutions are also being developed for the remaining gas transportation activities.\n\nThe Supervisory Board places great value on good corporate governance. It fulfills all legal and other requirements with regard to its composition, competencies and independence. It proposes Tamara Weinert to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for election as successor to Dame Alison Carnwath, who has been a member of the Supervisory Board since 2014. Alessandra Genco has been selected to succeed Dame Alison Carnwath as chair of the Audit Committee.\n\nLast year, the Supervisory Board appointed three members to the Board of Executive Directors following intense discussions. They meet the requirements in terms of proven leadership and professional competence and strengthen the team for the successful further development of BASF. Dr. Markus Kamieth was appointed as successor to Dr. Martin Bruderm\u00fcller as the new Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nCooperation with the Board of Executive Directors remained intensive and constructive, characterized  by  the  joint  pursuit  of  the  best  solutions  for  BASF's  future.  The Supervisory Board would like to thank the members of the Board of Executive Directors for their energetic commitment and good management of the company in difficult  times.  Personally,  I  would  like  to  thank  Dr.  Martin  Bruderm\u00fcller  for  his",

Finally, the Supervisory Board would like to thank the employees all over the world for their exceptional commitment in what was a challenging year for everyone.\n\n## Monitoring and consultation in an ongoing dialog with the Board of Executive Directors\n\nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board of BASF SE exercised its duties in full as required by law and the Statutes. It regularly monitored the management of the Board of Executive Directors and provided advice on the company's strategic development and important individual measures, about which the Supervisory Board was regularly and thoroughly informed by the Board of Executive Directors. This occurred both during and outside of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the form of written and oral  reports  from  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  on,  for  example,  business developments including the major financial key performance indicators of the BASF Group and its segments, macroeconomic developments and the economic situation in  the  main  sales  and  procurement  markets,  and  on  deviations  in  business developments from original plans. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board addressed fundamental questions of strategic corporate planning, including financial, investment, sales volumes and personnel planning, as well as measures for designing the future of research  and  development.  There  was  a  particular  focus  on  the  accelerated transformation toward CO2 neutrality and digitalization. Regular topics of in-depth discussion with the Board of Executive Directors comprised occupational and process safety, topics relating to sustainability, the environmental and social impact of the company's activities and the challenges of climate change for the future development of BASF's business. The further development of the organization and processes to further increase the competitiveness of BASF and its individual businesses was also discussed  intensely.  The  Supervisory  Board  was  convinced  of  the  lawfulness, expediency and propriety of the Board of Executive Directors' company leadership.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors were also in regular contact outside of Supervisory Board meetings. The Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board  was  always  promptly  and  comprehensively informed of current developments and significant individual matters. The Supervisory Board was involved immediately at an early stage in decisions of major importance. The Supervisory Board passed resolutions on all of those individual measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors that by law or the Statutes required the approval\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the Supervisory Board. Resolutions were generally passed at Supervisory Board meetings and, if necessary, by written circulation procedure.\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nThe Supervisory Board held five meetings in the 2023 business year. With the exception of one meeting, at which two members were absent, all respective members attended all meetings. The meetings were held in person with the additional option of virtual participation. One Supervisory Board member took part in two of the five meetings via video call. The members of the Supervisory Board elected by shareholders and those elected by the employees prepared for the meetings in separate preliminary discussions in each case, which were also attended by members of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nAll members of the Board of Executive Directors attended the Supervisory Board meetings unless it was deemed appropriate that the Supervisory Board discuss individual topics - such as personnel matters relating to the Board of Executive Directors - without them being present. In addition, each Supervisory Board meeting included an agenda item that provided an opportunity for discussion without the Board of Executive Directors (executive session). These agenda items concerned either the Board of Executive Directors itself or internal Supervisory Board matters.\n\n- An overview of members' personal attendance at meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees is available at basf.com/supervisoryboard/meetings\n\nA significant component of all Supervisory Board meetings was the Board of Executive Directors' reports on the current business situation with detailed information on sales and earnings development, opportunities and risks for business development, the status of important investment projects and important portfolio measures (current and planned), important economic, environmental and social aspects, sustainability topics, developments in the regulatory environment, developments on the capital markets, significant managerial measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors, and innovation projects.\n\nIn all meetings held in 2023, the Supervisory Board also discussed the progress of major investments and ongoing portfolio projects, such as the construction of the new Verbund site in Southern China and the options for the oil and gas business of Wintershall Dea AG.",

        "page_content": "An important topic at all Supervisory Board meetings in the reporting period was the impact of the structurally persistently high natural gas and electricity prices on the business activities and competitiveness of our customers and on the BASF Group in Europe as well as the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, in particular. In this regard,  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors'  reporting  and  the  discussions  in  the Supervisory  Board  in  particular  addressed  the  possibilities  of  supplying  the BASF  Group's  European  sites  with  renewable  energy  in  the  future.  The  further development of the management and steering systems was also discussed.\n\nAbout the meetings in detail: On February 22, 2023, the Supervisory Board reviewed the Financial Statements of BASF SE and the BASF Group for the 2022 business year that  were  submitted  by  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors,  the  corresponding Management's Reports, including the Nonfinancial Statements as well as the dividend proposal, and approved the Financial Statements. In preparation, the auditor had explained the process and results of the audit in detail the previous day and discussed them with the Supervisory Board. In addition, the Supervisory Board discussed and approved the Compensation Report in accordance with section 162 of the German Stock  Corporation  Act  (AktG).  It  also  discussed  the  agenda  for  the  Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April  27, 2023, and adopted proposals for resolutions. Furthermore,  the  Supervisory  Board  approved  the  holding  of  the  2023  Annual Shareholders'  Meeting  as  an  in-person  meeting.  Other  topics  discussed  at  the meeting were general business development and the future steering of the Agricultural Solutions, the Coatings and the Battery Materials business units.\n\nThe Supervisory Board met on April 26, 2023, to prepare for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting being held the next day. The general conditions and trends in the battery materials  business  and  the  conversion  of  the  SAP  system  for  future  business management were also discussed.\n\nThe meeting on July 25 and 26, 2023, focused on the status of the implementation of BASF's corporate strategy and the further development of the BASF Group. Key individual topics here were:\n\n- - The challenge of growth and the competitive environment of the BASF Group\n- - Strategic options for the further development of Wintershall Dea AG's exploration and production business\n- - Further development of the battery materials business\n- - The status of the construction of the Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - The status of the road map to reduce CO2 emissions and the project portfolio to achieve the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 25% by 2030 compared with the 2018 baseline\n- - Strategy and operational measures to improve performance in the Nutrition & Health division\n- - The concept for the future differentiated steering of the BASF Group and the resulting consequences under company law\n\nThe Supervisory Board meeting on October 25, 2023 took place in Shanghai, China. One  focus  of  the  meeting  was  the  status  of  negotiations  on  the  sale  of Wintershall Dea  AG's  exploration  and  production  business  to  U.K.-based Harbour  Energy plc. The Supervisory Board also approved the recommendation of the Board of Executive Directors to hold an in-person Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2024. The BASF Group's medium-term financial planning was also discussed. The Supervisory Board then visited the Verbund site in Zhanjiang, in the Southern Chinese province of Guangdong, which is currently under construction, and gained a detailed overview of the construction progress and the plans for the starting operations at some important plants in 2025 during a guided tour.\n\nAt its meeting on December 20, 2023, the Supervisory Board discussed operational and financial planning, including the investment budget for 2024, and, as in previous years, authorized the Board of Executive Directors to procure the necessary financing in 2024 within a set limit. In addition, the Supervisory Board dealt with leadership development and measures to achieve diversity targets. Resolutions were also passed on the future composition of the Board of Executive Directors. In addition, at the proposal of the Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board nominated Tamara Weinert,  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Business  Area  Americas  of Outokumpu,  as  a  candidate  for  election  as  shareholder  representative  on  the Supervisory Board at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 25, 2024. Tamara Weinert is to succeed Dame Alison Carnwath, who will not stand for reelection to BASF's Supervisory Board in 2024.\n\n## Compensation and composition of the Board of Executive Directors\n\nIn several meetings over the 2023 business year, the Supervisory Board discussed and passed resolutions on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors. In addition, four decisions on the composition of the Board of Executive Directors had to be taken.",

In line with the recommendation of the Personnel Committee, the Supervisory Board also resolved to appoint Dr. Stephan Kothrade as a member of the Board of Executive Directors,  succeeding  Saori  Dubourg,  whose  contract  was  terminated  effective March 1, 2023.\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  December  20,  2023,  the  Supervisory  Board  discussed  the appointment of a successor for the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, Dr. Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, who will step down from the Board of Executive Directors as of April  25, 2024, and, in line with the recommendation made by the Personnel Committee, appointed Dr.  Markus Kamieth as Chairman the Board of Executive Directors, effective from the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 25, 2024, and until the end of the 2029 Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAlso on the recommendation of the Personnel Committee, it was resolved to appoint Dr.  Katja Scharpwinkel as a member of the Board of Executive Directors effective February 1, 2024, as successor to Dr. Melanie Maas-Brunner - who left the company at her own request on January 31, 2024 - and Anrup Kothari effective March 1, 2024. Dr. Katja Scharpwinkel was also appointed as Industrial Relations Director. Following the recommendation by the Personnel Committee, it was resolved to extend the appointment  of  Michael  Heinz  by  two  years  until  the  end  of  the  2026  Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Furthermore, at its meeting on December  20, 2023, the Supervisory Board evaluated, based on the discussions and the corresponding recommendation of the Personnel Committee, the Board of Executive Directors' performance in 2023 and set the performance factor for the short-term incentive 2023. Finally, the Supervisory Board discussed adjustments to the compensation systems for the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board from the 2024 financial year onward and resolved to submit these to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for a decision.\n\n- For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see the Compensation Report, which has been made publicly available on the company's website at basf.com/compensationreport\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board of BASF SE had four committees during the reporting period:\n\n- 1. the committee for personnel matters of the Board of Executive Directors and the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngranting of loans in accordance with section 89(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Personnel Committee); 2. the Audit Committee; 3. the Nomination Committee; and 4. the Strategy Committee. The committees prepare resolutions and topics to be discussed by the entire Supervisory Board. Following each Committee meeting, the chairs of the Committees reported in detail about the meetings and the activities of the Committees at the subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  has  not  established  a  special  sustainability  committee. Sustainability is of such fundamental importance to the BASF Group that it is the focus of the work of the entire Supervisory Board and is discussed intensively in plenary sessions. As a material crosscutting issue, sustainability affects all the Supervisory Board's supervision activities and is therefore considered in depth by the entire Supervisory Board. Sustainability expertise is therefore broadly embedded in the Supervisory Board and has long been a very important requirement for its work.\n\n- For information on the composition of the committees and the tasks assigned to them by the Supervisory Board, see the Corporate Governance Report from page 192 onward\n\nThe Personnel Committee met four times during the reporting period. All meetings were held in person with the additional option of virtual participation. All committee members attended all meetings. Two committee members took part in one meeting via video call. At the meeting on February  21, 2023, the Personnel Committee prepared the proposed resolution to terminate the employment contract with Saori Dubourg and to nominate her successor. It discussed the target agreement for the Board of Executive Directors for 2023 (short-term incentive) and the targets for the long-term compensation for the Board of Executive Directors for the period 2023-2026 (long-term incentive). At its meeting on July  25, 2023, the Personnel Committee  focused  on  the  development  of  leadership  at  BASF's  top  levels  of management below the Board of Executive Directors and long-term succession planning for the Board of Executive Directors, including potential successor candidates. The main agenda item at the meeting on October 17, 2023, was the review of the further development of the compensation system for the Board of Executive Directors. The proposals for the further development of the compensation system and their appropriateness  were  reviewed  in  advance  with  an  external  consultant,  whose recommendations were also taken into account. The Personnel Committee also discussed  succession  planning  for  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  and  the appointment of a successor to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, Dr. Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, who will step down after the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April  25, 2024.

With the exception of one meeting, which one member did not attend, all Audit Committee members attended all meetings. At two meetings, one Audit Committee member took part via video call. The Audit Committee is responsible for all the tasks listed in section 107(3) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation  Act  (AktG)  and  the  recommendations  of  the  German  Corporate Governance Code. The Audit Committee is also responsible for monitoring the internal process for identifying related party transactions and adopting resolutions to approve related party transactions.\n\nThe auditor also attended the meetings in February, July and December. The Audit Committee also discussed matters with the auditor in a separate part of the meeting without the Board of Executive Directors present (executive session). The chair of the Audit Committee also maintains regular contact with the auditor between meetings, in particular  regarding  the  progress  of  the  annual  audit,  and  reports  back  to  the committee.\n\nAt the meeting on February 21, 2023, the auditor reported in detail on its audits of BASF SE's Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2022 business year, including the corresponding management's reports, and discussed the results of its audit with the Audit Committee. The committee's audit also included the Nonfinancial Statements of BASF SE and the BASF Group, sustainability reporting as well as the Compensation Report of BASF SE in accordance with section 162 AktG, which had been audited by the auditor.

The focus areas and scope of the annual audit were discussed and defined together with the auditor.\n\nOn October 20, 2023, the Audit Committee discussed the BASF Group's Quarterly Statement for the third quarter of 2023 and addressed the post-audit on major acquisitions and divestitures. The meeting also addressed the reporting on related party  transactions  as  well  as  the  Committee's  annual  self-assessment  of  the effectiveness and efficiency of its work.\n\nAt the meeting on December 19, 2023, the auditors reported on the status of the annual audit, as well as the focus areas and the most important individual items. The Audit Committee also received reports on the internal control system for financial reporting and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system and the risk management system. Furthermore, the head of the Corporate Compliance unit reported on compliance topics.

The committee was informed in detail about the status of the negotiations by the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and the Chief Financial Officer and approved the next steps.\n\n## Corporate governance and Declaration of Conformity\n\nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board was once again intensely occupied with the corporate governance standards practiced in the company and the implementation of the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated April 28, 2022 (GCGC 2022).\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code  and  the  guiding  principles  for  the  dialog  between  investors  and  German supervisory boards, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board again sought dialog with investors where appropriate in 2023.\n\nSpecial onboarding events are held for the new members of the Supervisory Board to familiarize them with the basics of corporate governance at BASF, the organization and internal structures of the BASF Group, and the composition of its businesses and their strategies. Above and beyond this, the company also supports the members of the Supervisory Board with training for their activities on the Supervisory Board, whether  through  external  offerings  such  as  topic-specific  seminars  or  internal information offerings such as site and plant visits to give them an insight into the portfolio as well as production and manufacturing methods.\n\nAt its meeting on December  20, 2023, the Supervisory Board approved the joint Declaration of Conformity by the Supervisory Board and the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF  complies  with  all  recommendations  of  the  GCGC  2022.  The  Corporate Governance Report provides extensive information on the BASF Group's corporate governance.\n\n- The full Declaration of Conformity is rendered on page 217 and is available at basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Independence and efficiency review\n\nAn important aspect of good corporate governance is the independence of Supervisory Board members and their freedom from conflicts of interest. The Supervisory Board bases the assessment of the independence of its members on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code and the additional criteria for assessing the independence of Supervisory Board members contained in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board. The criteria used to assess independence are presented in the  Corporate  Governance  Report  on  page  197.  Based  on  these  criteria,  the Supervisory Board came to the conclusion that all of the six shareholder representatives and five of the six employee representatives - 11 of the 12 members of the Supervisory Board in total - are considered to be independent as of the end of 2023. Employee representative Michael Vassiliadis was formally classified as nonindependent due to the length of his membership on the Supervisory Board, which exceeds 12 years. Above and beyond this, the Supervisory Board does not see any indications that the Supervisory Board role is not performed completely independently. In cases where Supervisory Board members hold supervisory or management positions at companies with which BASF has business relations, we see no impairment of their independence. The scope of these businesses is not material and furthermore, they are conducted at arm's length.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its activities in the form of a self-assessment. To this end, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board most recently conducted a written survey of all Supervisory Board members in the fourth quarter of 2022 on the basis of a detailed questionnaire covering the entire range of relevant Supervisory Board topics, supplemented by individual discussions. In 2023, individual discussions were held between members of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. These discussions confirmed that the Supervisory Board works together professionally and with a high degree of trust. The composition and structure of the Supervisory Board continue to be regarded as effective and efficient.\n\nThe Audit Committee conducted a detailed self-assessment of its activities in 2023. This was based on a questionnaire sent to all members of the Audit Committee, the",

In  addition,  we  have  audited  the management  report  of  the  Company  and  the  Group  (combined management  report)  of  BASF  SE  for  the  financial  year  from January 1 to December 31, 2023.\n\nIn  accordance  with  German  legal  requirements,  we  have  not audited  the  content  of  those  components  of  the  combined management report specified in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report.\n\nThe  combined  management  report  includes  cross-references, marked  as  unaudited,  that  are  not  provided  for  by  law.  In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the  cross-references  and  the  information  to  which  the  crossreferences refer.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all  material  respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, as well  as  the  IFRSs  in  the  version  adopted  by  the  International Accounting Standards Board and the additional requirements of German  commercial  law  pursuant  to  Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch:  German  Commercial  Code],  and,  in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the  assets,  liabilities,  and  financial  position  of  the  Group  as  of Decemb er  31, 2023,  and  of  its  financial  performance  for  the\n\nfinancial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, and\n\n- - the  accompanying  combined  management  report  as  a  whole provides  an  appropriate  view  of  the  Group's  position.  In  all material respects, this combined  management  report  is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities  and  risks  of  future  development.  Our  opinion  on the combined management report does not cover the content of the  combined  management  report  specified  in  the  'Other Information'  section  of  the  auditor's  report.  The  combined management  report  includes  cross-references,  marked  as unaudited,  that  are  not  provided  for  by  law.  Our  audit  opinion does not extend to the cross-references and the information to which the cross-references refer.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) s entence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit  has  not  led  to  any  reservations  relating  to  the  legal compliance  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  of  the combined management report.\n\n## Basis for the Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and  of  the  combined  management  report  in  accordance  with Section  317  HGB  and  the  EU  Audit  Regulation  No  537/2014 (referred  to  subsequently  as  'EU  Audit  Regulation')  and  in compliance  with  German  Generally  Accepted  Standards  for Financial  Statement  Audits  promulgated  by  the  Institut  der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer  [Institute  of  Public  Auditors  in  Germany]  (IDW).

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Recoverability of goodwill\n\nFor information on  the  accounting  principles  applied,  the underlying  assumptions  used  in  the  measurement  and  the disclosure  on  the  impairment  tests  performed  please  refer  to Note 14 to the cons olidated financial statements from page 264.",

        "page_content": "## The financial statement risk\n\nIntangible  assets  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of B ASF SE  include  goodwill  in  the  amount  of  EUR  7,499  million. Goodwill accounts for 9.7 % of total assets and thus has a material impact on the Parent Company's net assets.\n\nGoodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  annually,  irrespective  of  any indication  of  impairment.  If  any  indications  of  impairment  arise during the financial year, an event-driven goodwill impairment test is  also  carried  out  during the year. As a result of impairments on assets,  an  additional  event-driven  test  was  carried  out  on  the battery materials cash-generating unit as at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe  goodwill  impairment  test  involves  the  carrying  amount  being compared with  the  recoverable  amount  of  each  cash-generating unit.  If  the  carrying  amount  exceeds  the  recoverable  amount,  an impairment  loss  must  be  recognized.  The  recoverable  amount  is the higher amount of fair value less costs to sell and value in use of the cash-generating unit.\n\nImpairment testing of goodwill is complex and based on a number of assumptions requiring judgment. These include the forecasts for future  cash  inflows  in  the  detailed  planning  period,  the  assumed growth rate for subsequent periods and the cost of capital. These assumptions  have  a  material  impact  on  the  recoverability  of goodwill. The growth forecasts of the Board of Executive Directors are associated with risks and can be revised in light of volatile raw materials prices and an unstable macroeconomic environment.\n\nBased on the impairment tests conducted, the Company did not identify  any  need  to  recognize  impairment  losses.  However,  the Group's  sensitivity  analysis  showed  for  the  cash-generating  unit Battery Materials and Catalysts (excluding Battery Materials) that a possible change in the cost of capital, the EBITDA margin of the last detailed planning year would reduce the respective value to the recoverable amount.\n\nThere is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that any existing impairment as at the reporting date was not identified. In addition, there is a risk that the disclosures in the notes on the key assumptions are not appropriate.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWith  the  involvement  of  our  valuation  specialists,  we  assessed, among other things, the appropriateness of the key assumptions as well as the Group's methods of calculation for both the eventdriven and the annual impairment test.\n\nFor cash-generating units selected from a risk-oriented perspective, we examined the forecast for the expected business and  earnings  development  and  the  resulting  cash  flows  in  the detailed planning period, in particular with respect to whether the expected  development  of  the  relevant  sales  markets  was  given appropriate  consideration  and  was  consistent  with  the  current budgets approved by management. We compared internal growth forecasts  with  industry  expectations  and  those  of  significant competitors and we assessed whether the assumptions contained in  the  planning  regarding  the  future  development  of  margins  and the  amount  of  investments  were  appropriate.  Our  review  of  the appropriateness  of  the  budgets  approved  by  management  also included a comparison of planning in past business years with the results  actually  achieved.  For  selected  cash-generating  units,  we examined whether reasons for not reaching budgeted figures in the past were given appropriate consideration in current planning, to the extent that this was relevant.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the assumed growth rate for the  period  following  the  detailed  planning  period  on  the  basis  of industry-specific  and  macroeconomic  studies.  We  evaluated  the methodological  appropriateness  of  the  calculation  and  the appropriateness  of  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  To  this end, we calculated our own expected values for the assumptions and  data  underlying  the  weighted  cost  of  capital  rates  and compared these with the assumptions and data used.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor  the  cash-generating  units  battery  materials  and  catalysts (excluding  battery  materials),  we  used  our  own  calculations  to assess  the  methodologically  and  mathematically  appropriate implementation of the valuation method and analysed deviations.\n\nIn order to take forecast uncertainty into account, we examined the impact  of  potential  changes  in  the  cost  of  capital,  the  EBITDA margin  of  the  last  detailed  planning  year  on  the  recoverable amount  by  evaluating  alternative  scenarios  as  calculated  by  the Company (sensitivity analysis).\n\nFinally,  we  assessed whether the disclosures in the notes on the key assumptions are appropriate. This also included an assessment of the appropriateness of the disclosures pursuant to IAS 36.134(f) on sensitivities in the event of a reasonably possible change in key assumptions underlying the evaluation.\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe calculation method underlying both the event-driven and the annual impairment test of goodwill is appropriate and in line with the accounting policies to be applied.\n\nThe  assumptions  and  data  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors underlying the measurement are appropriate overall.\n\nThe  disclosures  in  the  notes  on  the  key  assumptions  are appropriate.",

The  other  information  does  not  include  the consolidated  financial  statements,  the  combined  management report  information  audited  for  content  and  our  auditor's  report thereon.\n\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information  and,  in  so  doing,  to  consider  whether  the  other information\n\n- - is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the combined management report information audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- - otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is  a  material  misstatement  of  this  other  information,  we  are required  to  report  that  fact.  We  have  nothing  to  report  in  this regard.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the preparation of  consolidated  financial  statements  that  comply,  in  all  material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, as well as the IFRSs in the  version  adopted  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards Board and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant  to  Section  315e  (1)  HGB,  and  that  the  consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets,  liabilities,  financial  position,  and financial  performance  of  the  Group.  In  addition,  the  Board  of Executive Directors is responsible for such internal control as it has determined  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  consolidated financial  statements  that  are  free  from  material  misstatement, whether  due  to  fraud  (i.e.,  fraudulent  financial  reporting  and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Board  of Executive Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  is  responsible  for the  preparation  of  the  combined  management  report  that,  as  a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in  all  material  respects,  consistent  with  the  consolidated  financial statements,  complies  with  German  legal  requirements,  and appropriately  presents  the  opportunities  and  risks  of  future development.  In  addition,  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  is responsible  for  such  arrangements  and  measures  (systems)  as they  have  considered  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  a combined  management  report  that  is  in  accordance  with  the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  of  the  Combined  Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the  combined  management  report  as  a  whole  provides  an appropriate  view  of  the  Group's  position  and,  in  all  material respects, is  consistent  with  the  consolidated  financial  statements and  the  knowledge  obtained  in  the  audit,  complies  with  the German  legal  requirements  and  appropriately  presents  the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German  Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW)  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement.  Misstatements can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these  consolidated  financial  statements  and  this  combined management report.",

We also:\n\n- - Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a basis  for  our  opinions.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  of  arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Board  of  Executive  Directors  and  the  reasonableness  of estimates made by the Board of Executive Directors and related disclosures.\n- - Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  Board  of  Executive Directors'  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt  on  the  Group's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern.  If  we  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we are  required  to  draw  attention  in  the  auditor's  report  to  the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's  report.  However,  future  events  or  conditions  may cause  the  Group  to  cease  to  be  able  to  continue  as  a  going concern.\n- - Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  present  the underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,  financial  position  and  financial  performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, as well  as  the  IFRSs  in  the  version  adopted  by  the  International Accounting Standards Board and the additional requirements of\n- German commercial law purs uant to Section 315e ( 1) HG B. - Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business  activities  within the  Group  to  express  opinions  on  the  consolidated  financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.\n- - Evaluate  the  consistency  of  the  combined  management  report with  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  its  conformity  with [German] law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- - Perform  audit  procedures  on  the  prospective  information presented by the Board of Executive Directors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used  by  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  as  a  basis  for  the prospective  information,  and  evaluate  the  proper  derivation  of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on  the  assumptions  used  as  a  basis.  There  is  a  substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements,  and  communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and other  matters  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our independence,  and  where  applicable,  the  actions  taken  or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.\n\nFrom  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the  current  period  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit  matters.  We describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor's  report  unless  law  or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.",

In  accordance  with  German  legal  requirements,  this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the combined management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained in these renderings nor to any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our  opinion,  the  rendering  of  the  consolidated  financial statements  and  the  combined  management  report  contained  in the electronic file made available, identified above and prepared for publication  purposes  complies,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format.  Beyond  this  assurance  opinion  and  our  audit  opinion  on the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the accompanying combined management report for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, contained in the 'Report on  the  Audit  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  the Combined  Management  Report'  above,  we  do  not  express  any assurance  opinion  on  the  information  contained  within  these renderings  or  on  the  other  information  contained  in  the  file identified above.\n\nWe  conducted  our  assurance  work  on  the  rendering  of  the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report contained in the file made available and identified above in accordance  with  Section  317  (3a)  HGB  and  the  IDW  Assurance Standard:  Assurance  Work  on  the  Electronic  Rendering  of Financial  Statements  and  Management  Reports  Prepared  for Publication  Purposes  in  Accordance  with  Section  317  (3a)  HGB (IDW  AsS  410  (06.2022)).

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work.

Its official address is Carl-Bosch-Str. 38, 67056 Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.\n\n## 1.2 Changes in accounting principles\n\nAccounting policies applied for the first time in 2023\n\nThe  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  BASF  SE  as  of December 31, 2023, have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IASB),  and  section 315e  (1)  of  the  German  Commercial  Code  (HGB).  IFRSs  are generally  only  applied  after  they  have  been  endorsed  by  the European Union. For the 2023 fiscal year, all of the binding IFRSs and  pronouncements  of  the  International  Financial  Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) were applied. The Consolidated Financial  Statements  are  for  the  period  from  January  1,  2023  to December 31, 2023, and are presented in euros. They are written in  German and translated into English. All amounts, including the figures  for  previous  years,  are  given  in  million  euros  unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe amendments presented in the following table had no material effect  on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  BASF  SE. Especially transactions within the scope of application of IFRS 17 were identified for BASF to a minor extent only.\n\n## Accounting policies applied for the first time in 2023\n\n| Standard/interpretation                           | Name of standard/interpretation or amendments                                                                                            | Date of publication        | Date of endorsement by the E.U.   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Introduction of IFRS 17                           | Insurance Contracts Insurance Contracts                                                                                                  | May 18, 2017 June 25, 2020 | November 19, 2021                 |\n| Amendments to IFRS 17                             | (Including Amendments to the Standard) (Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information)                             | December 9, 2021           | September 8, 2022                 |\n| Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 | Presentation of Financial Statements and Making Materiality Judgements (Disclosure of Key Accounting Policies)                           | February 12, 2021          | March 2, 2022                     |\n| Amendments to IAS 8                               | Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors  (Definition of Changes in Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates) | February 12, 2021          | March 2, 2022                     |\n| Amendments to IAS 12                              | Income Taxes  (Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction)                                         | May 7, 2021                | August 11, 2022                   |\n| Amendments to IAS 12                              | Income Taxes (International Tax Reform - Guidelines on Global Minimum Taxation (Pillar Two Model Rules))                                 | May 23, 2023               | November 8, 2023                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDue to rounding, individual figures in this report may not add up to the totals shown and percentages may not correspond exactly to the figures shown.\n\nThe individual financial statements of the consolidated companies are  prepared  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date  of  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.

        "page_content": "## 1.3 Group accounting principles\n\nScope of consolidation: The scope of consolidation is based on the application of the standards IFRS 10 and 11.\n\nAccording to IFRS 10, a group consists of a parent entity and the subsidiaries  controlled  by  the  parent.  'Control'  of  an  investee assumes the simultaneous fulfillment of the following three criteria:\n\n- - The  parent  company  holds  decision-making  power  over  the relevant activities of the investee\n- - The  parent  company  has  rights  to  variable  returns  from  the investee\n- - The  parent  company  can  use  its  decision-making  power  to affect the variable returns\n\nFulfillment  of  these  three  criteria  is  analyzed  based  on  the corporate governance structure of the companies.\n\nAccording  to  IFRS  11,  which  regulates  the  accounting  of  joint arrangements, a distinction must be made between joint ventures and joint operations. In the case of a joint venture, the parties that have joint control of a legally independent company have rights to the net assets of that arrangement. In joint operations, the parties that  have  joint  control  have  direct  rights  to  the  assets  and obligations  for  the  liabilities  relating  to  the  arrangement.  This requirement  is  particularly  fulfilled  if  the  production  output  of  the joint  arrangement  is  almost  entirely  transferred  to  the  partners, through  which  the  partners  guarantee  the  joint  arrangements' ongoing financing.\n\nCompanies whose corporate governance structures classify them as joint arrangements are analyzed to determine if they meet the criteria  for  joint  ventures  or  joint  operations  in  accordance  with IFRS  11.  Should  the  arrangement  be  structured  through  a separate  vehicle,  its  legal  form,  contractual  arrangements  and  all other facts and circumstances are reviewed.\n\nIn  addition  to  BASF  SE,  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements include  all  material  subsidiaries  on  a  fully  consolidated  and  all material  joint  operations  on  a  proportionally  consolidated  basis. Companies of minor importance for the presentation of a true and fair  view  of  the  net  assets,  financial  position  and  results  of operations,  are  not  consolidated,  but  rather  are  reported  under other  shareholdings.  These  companies  are  carried  at  amortized cost  and  are  written  down  in  the  case  of  an  impairment.  The aggregate assets and equity of these companies amount to less than 1% of the corresponding value at Group level.\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the  equity  method  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. Associated  companies  are  entities  that  are  not  subsidiaries,  joint ventures  or  joint  operations,  and  over  whose  operating  and financial policies significant influence can be exercised. In general, this  applies  to  companies  in  which  BASF  has  an  investment  of between 20% and 50%. Associated companies and joint ventures that are fully or predominantly allocated to operating divisions are classified  as  integral  because  they  are  integrated  into  the  value chain of the respective division; are controlled by the divisions; and they  generate  their  income  in  close  cooperation  with  the  other assets  of  the  BASF  Group  and/or  of  these  divisions.  Equityaccounted  income  from  integral  joint  ventures  or  associated companies is reported as part of income from operations (EBIT). Equity-accounted income from non-integral associated companies is reported in net income from shareholdings.\n\n- B For more information, see Note 10 from page 253 onward\n\nConsolidation  methods: Assets  and  liabilities  of  consolidated companies are uniformly recognized and measured in accordance with the principles described herein. For companies accounted for using  the  equity  method,  material  deviations  in  measurement resulting  from  the  application  of  other  accounting  principles  than those applied by BASF are adjusted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransactions between  consolidated  companies  as  well  as intercompany  profits  resulting  from  trade  between  consolidated companies are eliminated in full. Sales and material other balances and  transactions  between  joint  operations  and  fully  consolidated Group  companies  are  also  eliminated.  Material  intercompany profits  related  to  companies  accounted  for  using  the  equity method are eliminated.\n\nCapital  consolidation  is  conducted  at  the  acquisition  date according to the purchase method. Initially, all assets, liabilities and additional intangible assets that are to be capitalized are measured at fair value regardless of the scope of any noncontrolling interests. Subsequently, the cost of acquiring the company is compared with the proportional share of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The  resulting  positive  differences  are  capitalized  as  goodwill. Negative  differences  are  reviewed  once  more,  then  recognized directly in the income statement.\n\nNon-controlling interests are measured at fair value on the date of acquisition  proportional  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method).\n\nThe  incidental  acquisition  costs  of  a  business  combination  are recognized  in  the  income  statement  under  other  operating expenses.\n\n- B For more information, see Note 13 on page 263\n\nForeign  currency  translation: The  cost  of  assets  acquired  in foreign currencies and revenue from sales in foreign currencies are determined  by  the  exchange  rate  on  the  date  the  transaction  is recognized. Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are valued at  the  exchange  rates  on  the  balance  sheet  date.  Changes  in assets  and  liabilities  arising  from  foreign  currency  translation  are recognized in the income statement. They are then reported under other operating income or expenses, other financial result, and, in the  case  of  financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income, in other comprehensive income.",

        "page_content": "Translation  of  foreign  currency  financial  statements: The translation of foreign currency financial statements depends on the functional currency of the consolidated companies. For companies whose  functional  currency  is  not  the  euro,  translation  into  the reporting  currency  is  based  on  the  closing  rate  method:  Balance sheet  items  are  translated  into  euros  using  closing  rates  on  the balance  sheet  date;  expenses  and  income  are  translated  into euros at monthly average rates and accumulated for the year. The difference  between  a  company's  equity  translated  at  historical rates at the time of acquisition or retention and its equity translated at closing rates on the balance sheet date is reported under other comprehensive income (translation adjustments) and is recognized in the income statement only upon the disposal of the company or a foreign business.\n\nFor  certain  companies  outside  the  eurozone  or  U.S.  dollar  zone, the  euro  or  U.S.  dollar  is  the  functional  currency  (among  others, BASF  Tuerk  Kimya  Sanayi  ve  Ticaret  Ltd.  Sti.,  Istanbul,  Turkey, and BASF Argentina S.A., Buenos Aires, Argentina). In such cases, financial  statements  prepared  in  the  local  currency  are  translated into  the  functional  currency  using  the  temporal  method:  All nonmonetary assets and related depreciation and amortization as well as equity are translated at the exchange rate applying to the respective  transactions.  All  other  balance  sheet  items  are translated  using  closing  rates  on  the  balance  sheet  date;  other expenses and income are translated at monthly average rates. The resulting  translation  differences  are  recognized  in  the  income statement under other operating income or expenses. If necessary, financial  statements  in  the  functional  currency  are  translated  into the presentation currency according to the closing rate method.\n\n## Selected exchange rates\n\nEUR 1 equals\n\n|                      | Closing rates   | Closing rates   | Average rates   | Average rates   |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                      | Dec. 31,  2023  | Dec. 31,  2022  | 2023            | 2022            |\n| Brazil (BRL)         | 5.36            | 5.64            | 5.40            | 5.44            |\n| China (CNY)          | 7.85            | 7.36            | 7.66            | 7.08            |\n| Japan (JPY)          | 156.33          | 140.66          | 151.99          | 138.03          |\n| Malaysia (MYR)       | 5.08            | 4.70            | 4.93            | 4.63            |\n| Mexico (MXN)         | 18.72           | 20.86           | 19.18           | 21.19           |\n| Switzerland (CHF)    | 0.93            | 0.98            | 0.97            | 1.00            |\n| South Korea (KRW)    | 1,433.66        | 1,344.09        | 1,412.88        | 1,358.07        |\n| United States (USD)  | 1.11            | 1.07            | 1.08            | 1.05            |\n| United Kingdom (GBP) | 0.87            | 0.89            | 0.87            | 0.85            |\n\n## 1.4 Accounting policies\n\nThe  accounting  policies  for  the  individual  items  in  the  balance sheet  and  the  income  statement  are  presented  in  the  respective sections of the Notes.\n\nBusiness combinations: In  business combinations, the acquired assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  at  fair  value  on  the  date  the acquirer  effectively  obtains  control.  The  fair  value  of  acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition, as well as the  useful  lives  of  the  acquired  assets,  are  largely  based  on projected  cash  flows.  Actual  cash  flows  can  deviate  significantly from those. Independent external appraisals are typically used for the  purchase  price  allocation  of  material  business  combinations. Valuations  in  the  course  of  business  combinations  are  based  on existing information as of the acquisition date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe carrying amount of assets, liabilities and provisions, contingent liabilities and other financial obligations reported in the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  depends  on  the  use  of estimates, assumptions and discretionary scope. Specific estimates  or  assumptions  used  in  individual  accounting  or valuation methods are disclosed in their respective sections of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. They are based on  the  circumstances  and  estimates  on  the  balance  sheet  date and thus affect the amounts of income and expenses shown for the  reporting  periods  presented.  These  assumptions  primarily relate to the determination of discounted cash flows in the context of impairment tests and purchase price allocations; the useful lives of  depreciable  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible assets; the carrying amount of shareholdings; and the measurement of provisions for items such as employee benefits, warranties, trade discounts, environmental protection or the extent of  recognition  of  assets,  liabilities  and  provisions  for  taxes. Although uncertainty is appropriately incorporated in the valuation factors, actual results can differ from these estimates. Furthermore, extraordinary  challenges  resulting  from  current  geopolitical  and economic  developments  are  also  considered.  Current  inflation developments were taken into account both in the measurement of pension provisions and other provisions as well as in the fixed asset impairment tests.",

BASF  is  committed  to  the  Paris Climate Agreement: Using resources as efficiently and responsibly as  possible  and  the  concept  of  a  circular  economy  are  firmly embedded  in  BASF's  strategy  and  its  actions.  BASF  pursues clearly  defined  goals  to  reduce  CO 2 as  well  regarding  the  use  of renewable  and  recycled  raw  materials.  In  this  context,  BASF always strives to employ raw materials more efficiently and improve production processes as well as to continually seek ways to use non-fossil, renewable or recycled feedstocks. Despite the current\n\nglobal political situation, the path to climate neutrality is resolutely being  pursued.  For  this  reason,  current  developments  and measures relating to climate change and sustainability do not lead to fundamentally changed expectations with regard to useful lives or recoverability of the majority of noncurrent assets. There is also no  material  need  for  adjustments  to  provisions  for  environmental and  restoration  obligations.  In  individual  cases,  however,  plants may  be  shut  down  if  necessary  for  reasons  of  environmental protection.

The transaction mainly  covered  facilities  for  the  production  of  nickel-based catalysts, including the associated infrastructure and inventories. The  production  site  was  part  of  the  Catalysts  division.  The purchase price was \u20ac13 million, and the after-tax disposal loss was \u20ac4 million.\n\nBASF sold the following activities in 2022:\n\n- - On April 12, 2022, BASF completed the sale of a 51% share in HKZ  Investor  Holding  B.V.,  Arnhem,  Netherlands,  the  holding company for  the  investment  in  the  Hollandse  Kust  Zuid  (HKZ) wind  farm,  to  Allianz  Capital  Partners,  Luxembourg,  acting  as party to the contract on behalf of Allianz Insurance Companies. Since then, BASF's  remaining  shares  in HKZ  Investor Hold ing B.V. have been accounted for using the equity method. The proportional net income was presented in the B ASF Group's income from operations. The integral investment is  not  allocated  to  any  division  but  reported  under  Other.  The disposal group of the wind farm investment was derecognized in April  2022  when  the  shares  were  sold.  The  disposal  gain included the gain from the transition from full consolidation to the equity  method  and  was  likewise  presented  in  income  from operations.\n- - On  September  30,  2022,  BASF  closed  the  divestiture  of  its kaolin  minerals  business  to  KaMin,  a  global  performance minerals  company  headquartered  in  Macon,  Georgia.  The divestiture comprised the production hub with sites in Daveyville, Toddville, Edgar, Gordon and related mines, reserves and mills in Toomsboro and Sandersville in Georgia. The refinery catalysts production  located  at  the  same  site  remained  part  of  BASF operations  and  was  not  included  in  the  divestiture.  The  kaolin minerals business was allocated to the Performance Chemicals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndivision. The disposal group of the kaolin minerals business was derecognized in September 2022 when the transaction closed. The adjustment of  the  disposed  net  assets  led  to  a  \u20ac6  million increase in disposal loss after taxes in 2023.\n\n- - On  October  31,  2022,  BASF  completed  the  sale  of  its production site in Quincy, Florida, and the associated attapulgite business  in  the  Dispersions  &  Resins  division  to  Clariant Corporation,  Louisville,  Kentucky.  The  Quincy  site  employed around  75  employees  and  manufactured  clay-based  mineral products  used  in  a  variety  of  industrial  applications.  The purchase price was $60 million.\n\nThe  following  overview  shows  the  effects  of  the  divestitures  in 2023  and  2022  on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The sales  line  item  shows  the  year-on-year  decline  resulting  from divestitures.  The  impact  on  equity  related  mainly  to  gains  and losses  from  divestitures.  Payments  received  from  divestitures amounted to \u20ac32 million and related to various smaller transactions as  well  as  to  payments  received  in  connection  with  outstanding purchase price receivables and the purchase price adjustment for a transaction from previous years.",

According  to  the  agreement,  Wintershall  Dea's  E&P  business, consisting  of  its  producing  and  development  assets  as  well  as exploration rights in Norway, Argentina, Germany, Mexico, Algeria, Libya  (excluding  Wintershall  AG),  Egypt  and  Denmark  (excluding Ravn), as well as Wintershall Dea's carbon storage (CCS) licenses will be transferred to Harbour. Upon completion of the transaction, which is targeted for the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to further antitrust approvals and regulatory approvals for foreign investments in various countries, Wintershall Dea shareholders will receive  a  cash  consideration  totaling  $2.15  billion  (BASF  share: $1.56 billion) and new shares to be issued by Harbour equating a\n\ntotal shareholding of 54.5% in the enlarged Harbour (BASF share: 39.6%).  As  a  non-integral  shareholding,  Wintershall  Dea  is accounted for using the equity method.\n\n- B For more information, see Non-integral oil and gas business on page 97\n\n## 4 BASF Group list of shares held pursuant to section 313(2) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)\n\nThe  list  of  consolidated  companies  and  the  complete  list  of  all companies  in  which  BASF  SE  holds  shares  as  required  by s ection 313(2)  HGB  as  well  as  information  on  the  exemption  of subsidiaries  from  accounting  and  disclosure  obligations  are  an integral component  of  the  audited  Consolidated  Financial Statements submitted to the electronic Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).

Activities that are not allocated to any of the divisions are recorded under Other.\n\nThe  same  accounting  rules  are  used  for  segment  reporting  as those  used  for  the  Group,  which  are  presented  in  these  Notes. Transfers  between  the  segments  are  generally  executed  at adjusted market-based prices, taking into account the higher cost efficiency and lower risk of intragroup transactions. Assets, as well as  their  depreciation  and  amortization,  are  allocated  to  the segments based on economic control. Assets used by more than one segment are allocated according to the percentage of usage.\n\nIncome from operations (EBIT) before special items was used for the internal steering of the segments and to complement the key performance indicator, return on capital employed (ROCE), up to and  including  2023.  It  is  determined  based  on  EBIT,  which  is calculated  from  gross  profit  on  sales,  selling  expenses,  general administrative  expenses,  research  and  development  expenses, other  operating  income  and  expenses,  and  income  from  integral companies  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method.  To  calculate EBIT before special items, this  figure  is  then  adjusted  for  special items.  Special  items  arise  from  the  integration  of  acquired businesses,  restructuring  costs,  impairments  and  reversals  of impairments, gains or losses on divestitures and sales of integral investments  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method,  as  well  as other expenses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities.  EBIT  and  EBIT  before  special  items  as  well  as  EBITDA and  EBITDA  before  special  items  are  alternative  performance measures  that  are  not  defined  under  IFRS  and  are  to  be considered complementary to the indicators defined by IFRS.\n\nB For more information on changes in the steering concept, see the Combined Management's Report from page 37 onward\n\n## Explanation of segments\n\nThe BASF Group's business is run by 11 divisions, structured in six segments:\n\n- -Chemicals: Petrochemicals, Intermediates\n- -Materials: Performance Materials, Monomers\n- -Industrial Solutions: Dispersions & Resins, Performance Chemicals\n- -Surface Technologies: Catalysts, Coatings\n- -Nutrition & Care: Care Chemicals, Nutrition & Health\n- -Agricultural Solutions: Agricultural Solutions\n\nThe Chemicals segment  comprises  the  Petrochemicals  and Intermediates divisions and is the cornerstone of BASF's Verbund structure. It supplies the other segments with basic chemicals and intermediates,  thereby  contributing  to  the  organic  growth  of  the BASF Group. In addition to internal transfers, the segment mainly serves  customers  in  downstream  industries,  especially  in  the chemical and plastics industries. The segment's competitiveness is strengthened by technological leadership and operational excellence,  process  and  product  innovations  as  well  as  the development of sustainable technologies.\n\nThe Materials segment is composed of the Performance Materials and  the  Monomers  divisions.  The  segment  offers  advanced materials  and  their  precursors  for  new  applications  and  systems. Its  product portfolio includes isocyanates and polyamides as well as  inorganic  basic  products  and  specialties  for  plastics  and plastics processing. In addition to specific technological knowledge, industry expertise and customer proximity, particularly products  that  contribute  to  the  circular  economy  as  well  as sustainable  production  methods  help  differentiate  BASF  from  its competitors in this segment.\n\nThe Industrial  Solutions segment  consists  of  the  Dispersions & Resins  and  the  Performance  Chemicals  divisions.  This  segment develops  and  markets  ingredients  and  additives  for  industrial applications,  such  as  polymer  dispersions,  resins,  electronic materials,  antioxidants  and  additives.  As  part  of  the  sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstrategy, this segment's focus is on the creation of more efficient production structures and  processes  that  better  conserve resources.  Its  customers  come  from  key  industries  such  as automotive, plastics and electronics.\n\nThe Surface  Technologies segment  bundles  chemical  solutions for  surfaces  in  the  Catalysts  and  Coatings  divisions.  Its  portfolio range serves the automotive and chemical industries and includes catalysts, battery materials, automotive OEM and refinish coatings, surface  treatment,  and  precious  and  base  metal  services. Innovations  and  solutions  customized  in  collaboration  with  its customers in the field of sustainable mobility are growth drivers for this segment.\n\nThe Nutrition  &  Care segment  comprises  the  Care  Chemicals division and the Nutrition & Health division. This segment produces ingredients  for  consumer  applications  in  the  areas  of  nutrition, home  and  personal  care.  Its  customers  include  food  and  feed producers  as  well  as  the  pharmaceutical,  cosmetics,  and  the detergent and cleaner industries. The segment's competitiveness is  strengthened,  among  other  things,  by  focusing  on  trends  in digitalized  business  models  and  sustainability  in  the  consumer goods markets. An example of the latter is the expansion of the portfolio with bio-based and biodegradable products.\n\nThe Agricultural Solutions segment consists of the division of the same  name.  As  an  integrated  provider,  its  portfolio  comprises fungicides,  herbicides,  insecticides  and  biological  crop  protection products,  as  well  as  seeds  and  seed  treatment  products. Furthermore,  Agricultural  Solutions  offers  farmers  innovative  and sustainable solutions based on digital technologies combined with practical advice.\n\nOther is  comprised  of  the  remaining  businesses.  These  include commodity  trading,  engineering  and  other  services,  as  well  as rental  income  and  leases.  Discontinued  operations  and  certain activities remaining after divestitures are also reported here.",

Furthermore, it focuses on the development  of  specific  key  technologies,  which  are  of overriding importance for the divisions.\n- - Trade with renewable energies as well as the activities of the Net Zero Accelerator unit, which bundles cross-company projects to achieve climate protection targets.\n- - Foreign  currency  results  not  allocated  to  the  segments  and measurement  effects  from  the  hedging  of  raw  materials  price and foreign currency exchange risks; as well as gains and losses from the long-term incentive programs (LTI programs).\n- - Remanent fixed costs resulting  from  organizational  changes  or restructuring  that  are  not  allocated  to  a  division;  idle  capacity costs from internal human resource platforms; and consolidation effects that cannot be allocated to a division.\n\n## Income from operations (EBIT) of Other\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                  |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Costs for cross-divisional corporate research                    |   -250 |   -326 |\n| Costs of corporate headquarters                                  |   -222 |   -258 |\n| Other businesses                                                 |     38 |    -46 |\n| Foreign currency results, hedging and other  measurement effects |    -29 |     33 |\n| Miscellaneous income and expenses                                |   -315 |     74 |\n| Income from operations of Other                                  |   -778 |   -523 |\n\nIncome from operations of Other decreased by \u20ac256 million year on year to -\u20ac778 million. This resulted mainly from miscellaneous income  and  expenses,  which  in  the  previous  year  had  included special income from the disposal of shares in the Hollandse Kust Zuid  offshore  wind  farm.  A  special  charge  in  the  amount  of \u20ac110 million  arose  in  the  current  reporting  year  primarily  for severance  payments  in  connection  with  restructuring.  Foreign currency  results,  hedging  and  other  measurement  effects  were down by \u20ac62 million year on year, due mainly to lower gains on the valuation  of  commodity  derivatives  as  well  as  expenses  from  the long-term incentive programs, following gains in the previous year. Improved income from other businesses as well as lower costs for corporate research had an offsetting effect.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 7 Sales revenue\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nSales revenue from contracts with customers is recognized in the amount of the consideration BASF expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services when the customer obtains control of the goods or  services.  Control  is  considered  to  be  transferred  when the customer can direct the use of the goods or services and can obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them.\n\nBASF primarily generates income from the sale of goods. Because the  customer  obtains  control  of  the  goods  at  a  specific  point  in time,  the  corresponding  sales  revenue  is  recognized  based  on  a given point in time. Determination of this point in time occurs in the context  of  an  overall  assessment  of  the  circumstances  which considers the existence of a present claim to payment, the legal title  to  the  goods,  actual  physical  possession  of  the  goods,  the transfer of risks and rewards as well as customer acceptance. The transfer  of  risks  and  rewards  takes  into  account  the  underlying terms of delivery (especially Incoterms) and is of particular practical significance. According to these principles, sales revenue from the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery. If products are delivered  to  a  consignment  warehouse,  BASF  normally  retains control of the goods. Accordingly, sales revenue is not recognized until  the  customer  collects  the  goods  from  the  consignment warehouse. Long-term supply agreements usually contain variable prices, which depend, among other factors, on the development of raw materials prices, and variable volumes.\n\nServices rendered to customers by BASF are invoiced according to work completed and recognized as revenue accordingly.\n\nBASF  generates  a  portion  of  its  sales  revenue  from  license agreements. Sales revenue from license agreements is recognized based on a point in time or a period of time depending on whether the licensee is being granted a right to use (revenue recognized at a point in time) or a right to access (revenue recognized over time) the intellectual property of BASF. Revenues from sales and usagebased royalties are recognized when the underlying sale or usage occurs.\n\nSales  revenue  from  the  sale  of  precious  metals  to  industrial customers  is  recognized  on  delivery  and  the  corresponding purchase  prices  are  recorded  as  cost  of  sales.  In  the  trading  of precious metals and their derivatives with traders, where there is usually  no  physical  delivery,  revenues  are  netted  against  the corresponding  costs.  Commodity  swaps  that  do  not  lead  to  a transfer of economic control are eliminated.\n\nIf a consideration that is contractually agreed upon by a customer includes variable components, BASF estimates the amount of the consideration.  Variable  components  are  recognized  as  revenue only  to  the  extent  that  it  is  highly  probable  that  previously recognized sales revenue will not have to be cancelled as soon as there  is  no  longer  uncertainty  about  the  actual  amount  of  the consideration. Primarily rebates and other discounts are recognized  as  a  reduction  in  revenue  in  accordance  with  the principle  of  individual  measurement.  BASF  grants  customers rebates,  among  other  things,  if  the  goods  purchased  by  the customer  exceed  a  contractually  defined  threshold  within  the period  specified.  Rebates  are  usually  deducted  from  amounts payable by the customer. Taking into account the specific terms of the underlying contract, BASF uses the expected value method or the  most  likely  amount  to  estimate  a  variable  consideration amount.  The  method  is  selected  based  primarily  on  number  of possible  results  such  as  the  number  of  volume  thresholds  with rebates.

The  actual  expected amount of the consideration BASF is entitled to receive in this case is estimated using the expected value method. Refund liabilities are recognized in the amount of considerations paid by the customer for goods that are expected to be returned.\n\nBASF opts to apply the practical expedient in IFRS 15.63 to not adjust the amount of the agreed consideration for the effects of a material financing component if, at the beginning of a contract, no more than one year is expected to lapse between the transfer of control of the goods or services and payment by the customer.\n\nBASF also applies  the  practical  expedient  in  IFRS  15.121  of  not reporting information on  remaining  performance  obligations resulting from a contract with a maximum expected original term of one year. Furthermore, information on performance obligations is not reported if the resulting revenue is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15.B16.",

In both years, additional expenses were largely attributable to restructuring measures to improve competitiveness in various operating divisions and site closures in Europe and North America. Expenses also resulted in 2022 from the adjustment of business  activities  in  Russia.  In  both  years,  expenses  from integration  measures  related  almost  entirely  to  the  integration  of the battery materials business, which had been acquired in 2021.\n\nEnvironmental  protection  and  safety  measures,  costs  of demolition  and  removal,  and  project  costs  not  subject  to mandatory  capitalization were  expensed  if  requirements  for mandatory capitalization pursuant to IFRS were not met.

These comprised impairments on property,  plant  and  equipment  in  the  Surface  Technologies segment, especially in the battery materials business, on plants in the  Agricultural  Solutions  segment  and  on  property,  plant  and equipment and intangible assets in the Materials segment. In 2022, impairments amounted to \u20ac393 million relating primarily to plants in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and De Meern, Netherlands.

Furthermore, expenses arose from changes in the fair value  of  currency  derivatives  and  other  hedging  transactions.  LTI programs led to expenses in the amount of \u20ac35 million in 2023. In the previous year, income resulted from the reversal of provisions for LTI programs.\n\nIn  both  years, losses  from  divestitures  and  the  disposal  of noncurrent assets were mainly in connection with the divestiture of the site in De Meern, Netherlands. Additional expenses in 2023 resulted  from  purchase  price  adjustments  for  divestitures  in previous years as well as consulting costs.\n\nIn both years, other expenses included expenses for litigation, for REACH,  for  the  provision  of  services  and  for  warranties. Furthermore,  other  expenses  for  societal  engagement  arose  in both years.\n\n10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method and other financial assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the  equity  method.  The  carrying  amounts  of  shareholdings  are adjusted  annually  based  on  the  pro  rata  share  of  net  income, dividends and other changes in equity. Should there be indications of a reduction in the value of an investment, an impairment test is conducted and, if  necessary,  an  impairment  is  recognized  in  the income  statement.  In  the  case  of  publicly  listed  associated companies, share prices are included in the impairment test and form the basis of valuation if there is an indication for permanent impairment  or  reversal  of  an  impairment.  Furthermore,  earnings and  the  carrying  amount  are  adjusted  when  accounting  policies deviate or as a result of purchase price allocations, which primarily affects Wintershall Dea AG, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany.\n\nExploration  and  development  expenses  in  the  oil  and  gas business,  for  which  the  equity  method  is  applied,  are  accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, costs of  successful  exploratory  drilling  as  well  as  successful  and  dry development wells are capitalized.",

In  2023,  however,  income  was\n\nnegatively impacted by the addition of restructuring provisions and the depreciation of the Argentine peso.\n\nValues in use were determined in the impairment test in December 2023 for  the  assets  held  by  Wintershall  Dea  for  which  purchase price adjustments exist at BASF level.

The value contribution of the remaining  activities  is  derived  based  mainly  on  the  expected compensation  values  for  the  expropriated  assets  in  Russia (considering various possible but not unlikely scenarios regarding reimbursement scope and payment timing), the anticipated gain on the  sale  of  the  shareholding  in  WIGA  Transport  BeteiligungsGmb H & Co.

        "page_content": "## 12 Income taxes\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn Germany, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15.0% as well as  a  solidarity  surcharge  of  5.5%  thereon  are  levied  on  all distributed and retained earnings. In addition to corporate income tax,  income  generated  in  Germany  is  subject  to  a  trade  tax.  It varies  depending  on  the  municipality  in  which  the  company  is represented.  The  weighted  average  tax  rate  was  14.6%  in  2023 (2022: 14.6%). The 30% rate used to calculate deferred taxes for German  Group  companies  remained  unchanged  in  2023.  The income  of  foreign  Group  companies  is  assessed  using  the  tax rates applicable in their respective countries.\n\nDeferred taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements according to IFRS and the carrying amounts for tax purposes as well  as  for  tax  loss  carryforwards  and  unused  tax  credits.  These also comprise  temporary  differences  arising  from  business combinations, with the exception of goodwill. Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are  calculated  using  the  respective  country-specific tax rates applicable for the period in which the asset or liability is realized  or  settled.  Tax  rate  changes  enacted  or  substantively enacted  on  or  before  the  balance  sheet  date  are  taken  into consideration.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  are  offset  against  deferred  tax  liabilities provided they are related to the same taxation authority. Surpluses of  deferred  tax  assets  are  only  recognized  provided  that  the  tax benefits  are  likely  to  be  realized.  The  valuation  of  deferred  tax assets is based on the assessment of the ability to utilize tax loss carryforwards  and  unused  tax  credits.  This  depends  on  whether future taxable profits will exist during the period in which temporary differences are reversed and in which tax loss carryforwards and unused  tax  credits  can  be  claimed.  The  assessment  of recoverability of deferred  tax  assets  is  based  on  internal projections of the future earnings of the particular Group company.\n\nChanges in deferred taxes in  the  balance  sheet  are  recorded  as deferred tax expense or income unless the underlying transaction is  recognized  directly  in  equity  or  in  income  and  expenses recognized  in  equity.  For  those  effects  which  have  been recognized  in  equity,  changes  to  deferred  tax  assets  and  tax liabilities are also recognized directly in equity.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities  are  recognized  for  differences  between  the proportional IFRS equity and the tax base of the investment in a consolidated  subsidiary  if  a  reversal  of  these  differences  is expected  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Deferred  tax  liabilities  are recognized for dividend distributions planned for the following year if these distributions lead to a reversal of temporary differences.\n\nProvisions for German trade tax, corporate income tax and similar income  taxes  are  calculated  and  recognized  based  on  the expected taxable income of the consolidated companies less any prepayments  that  have  been  made.  Provisions  are  set  up  for interest  accrued.  This  interest  is  reported  under  other  financial result, not tax expense. Other taxes to be assessed are considered accordingly.\n\nIFRIC 23  clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement  policies  from  IAS  12  when  there  is  uncertainty regarding  income  tax-related  treatment  of  individual  transactions. They are accounted for with the assumption that tax authorities will examine  the  questionable  transaction  and  have  all  relevant information.  The  amount  of  risk  provisions  is  calculated  and reviewed  with  consideration  for  the  results  of  past  tax  audits  as well  as  the  legal  assessment  of  not  yet  audited  transactions  and the  risk  of  a  deviating  tax-related  interpretation  by  the  tax authorities.  The  most  probable  value  of  the  individual  risks  is recognized.\n\nBASF falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two Model Rules. The relevant Pillar Two legislation was enacted in Germany and will be applicable in the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. BASF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpects  the  application  of  the  OECD  Pillar  Two  Model  Rules  to result in an increase in taxes on income and earnings by a low to mid double-digit million euro amount since the relevant tax rate is under  15% in  a  small  number  of  jurisdictions.  The  actual  impact may differ from this projection.\n\nBASF  applies  the  exception  in  IAS  12  whereby  no  deferred  tax assets  or  liabilities  are  recognized  in  connection  with  Pillar  Two income  taxes  under  the  OECD  Model  Rules;  nor  are  any disclosures made on the matter.\n\n## Tax expense and tax rate\n\nThe  BASF  Group  tax  rate  amounted  to  73.3%  in  2023.  It  was impacted by non-recognition of deferred tax assets, especially in Germany.  The  higher  tax  rate  from  the  previous  year  of  132.9% resulted mainly from non-tax-effective impairments of Winters hall  Dea AG,  which  is  accounted  for  using  the  equity method,  particularly  from  the  deconsolidation  of  its  Russian exploration and production activities.\n\nThe tax effects of various underlying matters are presented in the following reconciliation of income taxes and the effective tax rate. This reconciliation was changed with respect to the expected tax rate  from  the  previous  15% (the applicable corporate income tax rate in Germany) to 30% (a tax rate combining corporate income and trade tax). This is intended to better illustrate the effects of not recognizing  deferred  tax  assets,  because  otherwise  only  the amounts relevant to corporate income tax would be included in the corresponding  line.  This  change  made  a  separate  disclosure  of trade tax and the solidarity surcharge superfluous. The prior-year figures were adjusted accordingly.",

Impairment  testing  for  goodwill  is  performed  once  a  year  and whenever  there is an indication of impairment. Goodwill impairments are not reversed.\n\nAcquired  intangible  assets  (excluding  goodwill) with  defined useful  lives  are  generally  measured  at  cost  less  straight-line amortization and impairments. The useful life is determined using the  period  of  the  underlying  contract  or  the  period  of  time  over which the intangible asset can be expected to be used.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives are  trade  names and trademarks that have been acquired as part of acquisitions. These are measured at cost and tested for impairment annually, or if there is an indication that their value has declined.\n\nInternally generated  intangible  assets primarily comprise internally  developed  software.  Such  software  and  other  internally generated intangible  assets  are  measured  at  cost  and  amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairments are recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount. In addition to those costs directly attributable to the asset, costs of internally  generated  intangible  assets  also  include  an  appropriate portion of overhead costs.\n\nThe expected useful lives and amortization methods of intangible assets are based on historical values, plans and estimates.\n\nEmission rights: Emission  certificates,  which  are  granted  free  of charge  by  the  German  Emissions  Trading  Authority  (Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle) or a similar authority in other countries, are recognized  in  the  balance  sheet  with  a  value  of  zero.  Emission rights  purchased on the market are capitalized at cost and were reported  as  intangible  fixed  assets  in  2022.  Emission  rights purchased  on  the  market  have  been  recognized  under  other receivables  and  miscellaneous  assets  since  2023.  Emissions generated  create  an  obligation  to  surrender  the  emission certificates.  Intangible  assets  purchased  on  the  market  are subsequently measured at amortized cost. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount on the balance sheet date, the emission rights are impaired.\n\nDepending on the type of intangible asset, amortization is reported under cost of sales, selling expenses, research and development expenses or other operating expenses.",

        "page_content": "## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment are  measured  at  cost  less depreciation and impairment over their useful lives. The revaluation method is not applied. Low-value assets are fully expensed in the year of acquisition.\n\nThe  cost  of  self-constructed  plants  includes  direct  costs, appropriate allocations of material and production overhead costs, and  a  share  of  the  general  administrative  costs  of  the  divisions involved in the construction of the plants.\n\nExpenses  related  to  the  scheduled  maintenance  of  large-scale plants  are  capitalized  separately  and  depreciated  using  the straight-line  method  over  the  period  until  the  next  planned turnaround.  Costs  for  the  replacement  of  components  are recognized  as  assets  if  an  additional  future  benefit  is  expected. The carrying amount of the replaced components is derecognized. Costs  for  maintenance  and  repair  as  part  of  normal  business operations are recognized as an expense.\n\nInvestment properties held to realize capital gains or rental income are  immaterial.  They  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  fair  value  or  cost less depreciation.\n\nThe estimated useful lives and depreciation methods of property, plant  and  equipment  are  based  on  historical  values,  plans  and estimates.  The  depreciation  methods,  useful  lives  and  residual values  are  reviewed  at  each  balance  sheet  date.  Movable  and immovable property, plant and equipment are principally depreciated using the straight-line method.\n\nBorrowing costs: If  borrowing costs are directly incurred as part of the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, they are capitalized as part of the acquisition or production cost of that  asset.  A  qualifying  asset  is  an  asset  for  which  the  process necessary to make it ready for its  intended  use  or  sale  is  longer than one year. Borrowing costs are capitalized up to the date the asset  is  ready  for  its  intended  use.  Borrowing  costs  were calculated  based on a rate of 1.75% (previous year: 1.25%) and adjusted  on  a  country-specific  basis,  if  necessary.  All  other borrowing  costs  are  recognized  as  an  expense  in  the  period  in which they are incurred.\n\nGovernment  grants: Government  grants  for  the  acquisition  or construction  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  reduce  the acquisition  or  construction  cost  of  the  respective  assets.  Other government  grants  or  government  assistance  are  recognized immediately  as  other  operating  income  or  treated  as  deferred income and released over the underlying period.\n\n## Impairment tests\n\nImpairment  tests  are  carried  out  on  intangible  assets,  property, plant  and  equipment,  and  goodwill  whenever  certain  triggering events  indicate  potential  impairment.  External  triggering  events include, for example, changes in customer industries, technologies used  and  economic  downturns.  Internal  triggering  events  for  an impairment  test  include  lower  product  profitability,  planned restructuring measures or physical damage to assets. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment annually.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImpairment tests entail a comparison of the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. As a rule, value in use  is  determined  using  the  discounted  cash  flow  method.  The estimation  of  cash  flows  and  the  assumptions  used  consider  all information  available  on  the  respective  balance  sheet  date  about the  future  development  of  the  operating  business.  Actual  future developments may vary. Impairment testing relies upon the cashgenerating unit's long-term earnings forecasts, which are based on macroeconomic trends.\n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) after taxes based on the  capital  asset  pricing  model,  which  is  used  in  calculating  the discount  for  cash  flows,  plays  an  important  role  in  impairment testing.  It  comprises  a  risk-free  interest  rate,  the  market  risk premium  and  an  industry-specific  spread  for  the  credit  risk. Additional important assumptions are the forecasts for the detailed planning period and the terminal growth rates used.\n\nAn  impairment  of  assets  (excluding  goodwill)  is  recognized  if  the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. An  impairment  is  recognized  for  the  difference  between  the carrying  amount  and  the  recoverable  amount.  If  the  reasons  for impairment  of  an  asset  (excluding  goodwill)  no  longer  exist,  the write-downs  are  reversed  up  to  the  value  of  the  asset,  had  an impairment  not  been  recognized.  Impairments  and  reversals  of impairments are reported in other operating income and expenses.",

        "page_content": "## The goodwill impairment test is based on cash-generating units.\n\nAt  BASF,  these  largely  correspond  to  the  business  units,  or  in individual cases the divisions. If there is a need for impairment, the existing  goodwill  is,  if  necessary,  completely  written  off  as  a  first step. If there is further need for impairment, this is allocated to the remaining assets of the cash-generating unit. Goodwill impairments are reported under other operating expenses.\n\nThe  respective  recoverable  amounts  were  determined  using  the value in use. Plans approved by company management and their respective  cash  flows  for  the  next  five  years  were  used.  For  the period thereafter, a terminal value was calculated using a forward projection  from  the  last  detailed  planning  year  as  a  perpetual annuity. Planning is based on experience, current performance and management's best possible estimates on the future development of  individual  parameters.  These  include  sales  revenue  (excluding precious metals), contribution margins, fixed costs and investments from which income from operations before depreciation  and  amortization  and,  based  on  this,  the  EBITDA margin  are  determined.  Market  assumptions  regarding,  for example, gas and raw materials prices, exchange rates, economic development,  inflation  expectations  and  market  growth  of  the respective  customer  industries  are  included  based  on  external macroeconomic and industry-specific sources.\n\nIn  addition,  planning  is  also  based  on  the  strategies  of  the individual  strategic  business  units  which  comprise  the  respective cash-generating  units.  The  digitalization  and  sustainability  trends identified  in  the  strategies  are  thus  taken  into  account  in  the respective impairment tests.\n\n- B For  more  information  on  strategy  and  identified  digitalization  and  sustainability  trends  in  the Combined Management's Report, see page 30 onward and page 48 onward\n\n## 14.1 Explanation of intangible assets\n\nThe  weighted  average  amortization  periods  of  intangible  assets were as follows:\n\n## Weighted average amortization in years\n\n|                                               | 2023   | 2022                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Distribution and similar rights               | 14     | 13                      |\n| Product rights, licenses and trademarks       | 18     | 18                      |\n| Know-how, patents and production technologies | 16     | 15                      |\n| Internally generated intangible assets        | 6      | 6                       |\n|                                               | 7  9   | Other rights and values |\n\n<!-- image -->",

These related mainly to other rights in the  Materials  segment  and  resulted  from  changed  market conditions which meant that the economic advantage of access to a precursor no longer applied. The cost of capital after taxes used to  determine  the  relevant  value  in  use  was  8.60%,  which  is 10.08% before taxes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Because  there  were  no  material  changes  in planning assumptions from the previous year, the growth rate for perpetual  annuity  remained  unchanged at  -0.7%.  In  the  planning period, the demand for catalysts is still expected to remain stable as a result of higher environmental standards. In the medium term, the transition from combustion engines to electromobility will lead to a steady decline in demand.\n\nIncreased  volatility  in  gas  and  raw  materials  prices  can  be expected during the year due to geopolitical conflicts. Average gas and raw materials prices are however expected to remain stable over the next three years. These and other macroeconomic factors such  as  the  high,  albeit  declining,  level  of  inflation  in  industrial countries will be accounted for in future business expectations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The calculation also takes into account capital structure and the beta factor of the respective peer group as well as the average tax rate of each cash-generating unit.  Impairment  tests  were  performed  on  the  units  assuming  a weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes of between 6.47% and 8.56% (2022: between 5.97% and 7.75%). This corresponds to a weighted average cost of capital rate before taxes of between 8.12% and 11.33% (2022: between 6.96% and 10.80%).\n\nAn additional impairment test triggered by impairments recognized on plants was performed for the battery materials cash-generating unit on Decemb er 31, 2023, It d id not lead to any impairments.\n\nAfter determining the recoverable amounts for the cash-generating units, the conclusion was that reasonable possible deviations from the key assumptions would not lead to the carrying amount of any significant  unit  exceeding  the  respective  recoverable  amounts except in the two units in the Catalysts division, which is allocated to the Surface Technologies segment.\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  for  the  Catalysts  (excluding  battery materials)  cash-generating unit exceeded the carrying amount by \u20ac598  million  in  2023.  A  weighted  cost  of  capital  after  taxes  of 8.14% (2022: 7.75%) and an EBITDA margin in the last detailed planning year were used as the basis for calculating the final value of 29.09%  (2022:  29.60%)  for  the  impairment  test.  The recoverable amount would be equal to the unit's carrying amount if the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  rose  by  1.06  percentage points or the EBITDA margin in the last detailed planning year as the  basis  for  calculating  the  final  value  were  3.87  percentage points lower.\n\nA weighted cost of capital after taxes of 8.36% (2022: 7.49%) and an EBITDA margin in the last detailed planning year as the basis for calculating the final value of 11.84% (2022: 10.15%) were used for the annual impairment test of the battery materials cash-generating unit.  The  recoverable  amount  for  this  unit  exceeded  the  carrying amount by \u20ac397 million. The recoverable amount would be equal to  the  unit's  carrying  amount  if  the  weighted  average  cost  of capital  rose  by  1.01  percentage  points,  the  growth  rate  were 1.64 percentage  points  lower,  or  the  EBITDA  margin  in  the  last detailed  planning  year  as  the  basis  for  calculating  the  final  value w ere 1.74 p ercentage points lower.\n\n## 14.2 Explanation of property, plant and equipment\n\nThe weighted average depreciation periods were as follows:\n\n## Weighted average depreciation in years\n\n|                                   | 2023   | 2022                                   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------|\n|                                   | 18  17 | Buildings and structural installations |\n| Machinery and technical equipment | 11  11 |                                        |\n| 7                                 | 7      | Miscellaneous equipment and fixtures   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Investments were made at the following sites in particular: Zhanjiang,  China;  Ludwigshafen,  Germany;  Geismar,  Louisiana; Antwerp,  Belgium;  Schwarzheide,  Germany;  and  Chalamp\u00e9, France. Material investments  included  the  development  of infrastructure and technical equipment at the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, construction of the hexamethylenediamine plant in Chalamp\u00e9, France, construction of infrastructure and production plants for battery materials in Schwarzheide, Germany, as well as\n\nmodification  and  capacity  expansion  of  the  phosgene  plant  in Geismar, Louisiana. Investments also included modernization and expansion  of  the  heating  oil  plant  as  well  as  modification  of  the acid chlorides and chloroformates plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany and  construction  and  expansion  of  the  ethylene  oxide  and polyethylene  oxide  production  plants  in  Antwerp,  Belgium. Government  grants  for  funding  investment  measures  reduced asset additions by \u20ac48 million.\n\nIn 2023, impairments of \u20ac883 million and reversals of impairments of \u20ac6 million were included in accumulated depreciation.\n\nImpairments  of  \u20ac370  million  were  recognized  for  construction  in progress und  buildings (including right-of-use assets from buildings)  as  well  as  for  technical  equipment  in  the  Surface Technologies segment. These impairments were due in particular to  the  delayed  startup  of  production  plants,  as  well  as additional official  requirements,  and  affected  two  sites  in  Europe,  one  of which was fully impaired.

This corresponds to a cost  of  capital  rate  before  taxes  of  11.94%.  Resulting  from  a deteriorated competitive situation, technical equipment at two sites in  Europe in the Agricultural Solutions segment was written off in full  in  the  amount of \u20ac334 million.

Low-value assets are generally defined as leased assets worth a maximum of \u20ac5,000.\n\nA lease is an agreement that conveys the right to control the use of identified asset for a defined period of time in return for a payment.\n\nLeases can be embedded within other contracts. If separation is required under IFRS, the embedded lease is recorded separately from  its  host  contract  and  each  component  of  the  contract  is accounted  and  measured  in  accordance  with  the  applicable regulations.\n\nLeases in which BASF is a lessee mainly relate to real estate and transportation and technical equipment.\n\nAs lessee,  BASF accounts for all  leases,  recognizing  right-of-use assets for leased assets and liabilities for lease agreements subject to the following principles:\n\n- - Lease  liabilities  are  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the remaining lease payments, taking into account the incremental borrowing rate.\n- - As a general rule, BASF separates non-lease components, such as services, from lease payments.\n- - A right-of-use asset is generally recognized at the same amount as  the  lease  liability.  Differences  may  arise  from  the  lease payments made prior to the provision of the leased asset, less any lease incentives received.\n- - After capitalization the right-of-use asset is generally depreciated over the lease term using the straight-line method.\n- - A  number  of  leases,  particularly  for  real  estate  and  barges, include  extension  and  termination  options.  Extension  and termination options are taken into account on recognition of the lease  liability  only  if  BASF  is  reasonably  certain  that  these options will be exercised in the future. When contract terms are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbeing  determined,  consideration  is  given  to  all  facts  and circumstances  that  offer  an  economic  incentive  for  exercising extension options or not exercising termination options. Changes in lease terms arising from the exercise of an extension option  or  non-exercise  of  a  termination  option  are  only considered if sufficient certainty exists. Estimates and expectations which are asserted at the commencement date of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset and pertain to future payments  not  yet  determined  on  the  date  of  provision  are assessed  continuously  during  the  lease  term.  If  subsequently improved  or  changed  knowledge  influences  the  expected payment profile over time, the lease liability is remeasured.\n\n- - If  an  existing  lease  contract  is  modified,  the  lease  liability  and right-of-use asset must be remeasured, provided the modification  changes  the  payment  profile  (pursuant  to  the interest and principal plan) or the scope (either quantitatively or time-related) of use of the asset.",

The  change  in current  derivatives  with  positive  fair  market  values  was  largely attributable  to  the  decline  in  fair  values  of  precious  metals commodity derivatives.\n\nBank  acceptance  drafts are  used  as  an  alternative  form  of payment  in  China.  Bank  acceptance  drafts  are  issued  at  a discount from their par value. They can be held to maturity, traded or redeemed prematurely at a discount. If BASF discounts a bank acceptance  draft  with  recourse,  a  liability  toward  the  credit institution is recognized in the amount of the payment received.\n\nPrepaid  expenses in  2023  mainly  included  prepayments  of \u20ac38 million related to operating activities compared with \u20ac45 million in  2022,  as  well  as  \u20ac72  million  in  prepayments  for  insurance  in 2023 compared with \u20ac77 million in 2022. Prepayments for license costs increased from \u20ac55 million in 2022 to \u20ac59 million in 2023.\n\nAs in the previous year, defined benefit assets were recognized in 2023 mainly at Group companies in Switzerland and the United Kingdom. An asset ceiling was in effect in 2023 and in the previous year for the pension plans in Switzerland.\n\n- B For more information on plan assets, see Note 21 from page 282 onward\n\nThe change in current receivables for income taxes was largely attributable to the decline in receivables for income tax refunds.\n\nPrecious metal trading items primarily  comprise physical items, precious  metal  accounts  as  well  as  long  positions  in  precious metals,  most  of  which  were  hedged  through  forward  sales  or derivatives.\n\nThe decline in current other receivables and assets, which do not represent financial instruments, was due to lower advance payments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are no preferential rights or other restrictions.\n\nThe subscribed capital of BASF SE as of December 31, 2023, was \u20ac1,142 million, divided into 892,522,164 qualifying shares with no par value. The share capital and the number of shares decreased in  2023  due  to  the  redemption  of  acquired  treasury  shares  in connection  with  the  share  buyback  program;  the  subscribed capital as of December 31, 2022, was \u20ac1,144 million, divided into 893,854,929 shares.\n\n## Share buyback / treasury shares\n\nBy  way  of  a  resolution  of  the  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  of May 29, 2022, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to buy  back  shares  until  May  28,  2027,  in  accordance  with s ection 71( 1) no. 8 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe buyback may not exceed 10% of the company's share capital at the time the resolution was passed and can take place via the stock  exchange,  a  public  purchase  offer  addressed  to  all shareholders, or a public invitation  to  the  shareholders  to  submit sales offers.\n\nThe  Board  of  Executive  Directors  is  authorized  to  redeem  the shares  bought  back  without  a  further  resolution  of  the  Annual Shareholders'  Meeting  and  to  reduce  the  share  capital  by  the proportion  of  the  share  capital  accounted  for  by  the  redeemed shares.  The  Board  of  Executive  Directors  can  also  redeem  the shares without reducing the share capital so that the proportion of the  other  shares  in  relation  to  the  share  capital  is  increased through  the  redemption.  In  that  event,  the  Board  of  Executive Directors  is  authorized  to  adjust  the  number  of  shares  in  the Statutes.\n\nThrough buyback authorizations in 2023, BASF purchased a total of  1,332,765  shares  (2022:  24,623,765  shares)  or  0.15%  (2022: 2.68%) of the share capital at an average price of \u20ac52.56 per share (2022: \u20ac53.83 per  share)  up  to  the  end  of  the  share  buyback program  on  February  24,  2023.  All  repurchased  shares  were redeemed and the share capital was reduced accordingly. BASF did not hold any treasury shares as of the balance sheet date or December 31, 2022.\n\nBASF's  expenditure  in  2023  for  the  share  buyback  totaled \u20ac70 million.  The  amount  was  taken  from  other  retained  earnings and also reduced subscribed capital by \u20ac2 million. This reduction was reclassified to capital reserves.\n\n## Authorized capital\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  resolution  of  the  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting  on  May  3,  2019,  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  was authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase, until May 2, 2024, on a one-off basis or in portions on a number of occasions,  the  company's  share  capital  by  a  total  of  up  to \u20ac470 million by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in  kind.  In  principle,  shareholders  are  entitled  to  a  subscription right. However, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the  approval  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  to  exclude  shareholders' statutory  subscription  rights  in  the  cases  specified  in  the authorizing  resolution.  The  Board  of  Executive  Directors  is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to lay down the  further  contents  of  the  share  rights  and  the  details  of  the execution  of  the  capital  increase.  The  total  shares  issued  on  the basis  of  the  above  authorization  with  the  exclusion  of  the shareholders' subscription right in the case of capital increases in return for contributions in cash or in kind must not exceed 10% of the  share  capital  at  the  time  that  this  authorization  comes  into effect  or  -  if  this  value  is  lower  -  at  the  time  of  its  exercise.  The proportionate amount of the share capital of those shares that are to be issued on the basis of conversion or option bonds granted during  the  term  of  this  authorization  under  the  exclusion  of  the subscription  right,  must  be  credited  against  the  aforementioned\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nceiling of 10%. This authorization had not been exercised as of the end of the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n## Conditional capital\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 29, 2022, the Board of  Executive  Directors  was  authorized,  with  the  approval  of  the Supervisory Board, up to April 28, 2027, on a one-off basis or in portions on more than one occasion to issue bearer or registered convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants or a combination of these  instruments  with  or  without  maturity  limitations  with  a  total nominal value of up to \u20ac10 billion and to grant or impose holders and/or  creditors  of  these  debt  instruments  conversion  or  option rights for up to 91,847,800 registered shares in the company with a pro rata amount of share capital of up to \u20ac117,565,184 subject to  the  respective  terms  and  conditions  of  the  debt  instruments. The debt instruments can be issued in exchange for contributions in cash, but also for contributions in kind, particularly shareholdings in other companies.\n\nTo  hedge  the  subscription  right  to  conversion  and  option  rights issued  under  the  authorization,  the  share  capital  was  increased conditionally  by  up  to  \u20ac117,565,184  with  the  option  of  issuing  a maximum  of  91,847,800  new  registered  BASF  shares.  The conditional capital increase shall only be carried out to the extent to  which  holders  of  convertible  bonds  or  warrants  attached  to bonds  with  warrants  issued  by  the  company  or  one  of  its subsidiaries up to April 28, 2027, under the authorization granted to  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors,  exercise  their  conversion  or option  rights  and/or  fulfill  their  conversion  or  option  obligations, and provided that no other forms of fulfillment of delivery are used. The new BASF shares shall be issued at the conversion or option prices determined in each case in the terms and conditions of the debt  instruments  and/or  the  warrants  in  accordance  with  the above-mentioned  authorization.  The  new  BASF  shares  issued under this provision shall participate in profits from the beginning of the financial year in which they are issued. This authorization had not been exercised as of the end of the 2023 fiscal year.",

        "page_content": "## Capital reserves\n\nCapital  reserves  include  effects  from  BASF's  share  program, premiums  from  capital  increases  and  consideration  for  warrants and negative goodwill from the capital consolidation resulting from acquisitions of subsidiaries in exchange for the issue of B ASF SE shares  at  par  value.  In  2023,  the  valuation  of  BASF  shares  in connection with the BASF 'plus' share program led to a decline in capital  reserves  of  \u20ac9  million,  compared  with  an  increase  of \u20ac9 million in the p revious year.\n\nThe  proportion  of  share  capital  accounted  for  by  the  redeemed treasury  shares  in  2023  was  reclassified  to  capital  reserves in 2023.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained  earnings  include  earnings  generated  in  the  past  and  in 2023  by  companies  included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nThe acquisition of shares in companies that BASF already controls or that are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a joint arrangement is treated as a transaction between shareholders,  as  long  as  this  does  not  lead  to  a  change  in  the consolidation method. There were no material transactions of this type in 2023, as in the previous year.\n\nIn connection with the share buyback, the amount in excess of the nominal  value  was  deducted  from  retained  earnings.  Upon redemption of the shares, the previously openly deducted amounts were offset against share capital and retained earnings. Additionally,  the  value  of  share  capital  accounted  for  by  the redeemed shares was reclassified from retained earnings to capital reserves. This resulted in a total reduction of retained earnings of \u20ac70 million in 2023 and \u20ac1,325 million in 2022.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                         | Dec. 31, 2023   | Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Legal reserves          | 1,066           | 1,032           |\n| Other retained earnings | 31,450          | 34,422          |\n| Retained earnings       | 32,517          | 35,453          |\n\nLegal reserves rose by \u20ac35 million in 2023 and by \u20ac74 million in 2022 due to reclassifications from retained earnings.\n\nIn  2023,  the  amount  of  \u20ac59  million  from  the  remeasurement  of defined benefit plans was reclassified to retained earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Payment of dividends\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  resolution  of  the  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting on April 27, 2023, BASF SE paid a dividend of \u20ac3.40 per qualifying  share  from  the  retained  profit  of  the  2022  fiscal  year. With 892,522,164 qualifying shares as of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting,  this  represented  total  dividends  of  \u20ac3,034,575,357.60. The  remaining  \u20ac814,148,142.03  in  retained  profits  was  allocated to retained earnings.",

        "page_content": "## 19 Other comprehensive income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe expenses and income shown in other comprehensive income are divided into two categories: Items that will be recognized in the income  statement  in  the  future  (known  as  'recycling')  and  items that will not be reclassified to the income statement in the future. The  first  category  includes  gains  and  losses  from  currency translation, the measurement of certain securities classified as debt instruments,  and  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  held  to hedge future cash flows. Items that will not be reclassified to the income  statement  at  a  future  date  include  effects  from  the remeasurement of defined benefit plans.\n\n## Remeasurement of defined benefit plans\n\nIn  2023,  changes  in  the  value  of  defined  benefit  plans  led  to  a decrease  in  other  comprehensive  income  of  \u20ac591  million  (after taxes)  of  which  \u20ac16  million  related  to  investments  accounted  for using the equity method. In the previous year, there was a rise of \u20ac2,586 million (after taxes); of that amount, \u20ac83 million related to investments  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method.  Deferred taxes  amounted  to  \u20ac100  million  in  2023  and  to  -\u20ac1,256  million in 2022.\n\n- B For  more  information  on  the  remeasurement  of  defined  benefit  plans,  see  Note  21  from  page  282 onward\n\n## Currency translation\n\nDifferences resulting from currency translation led to a decrease in equity  by  a  total  of  \u20ac1,220  million  in  2023;  of  that  amount, \u20ac234 million related to investments accounted for using the equity method. In the previous year, an increase resulted in the amount of \u20ac1,135 million; of that amount, \u20ac583 million related to investments accounted for using the equity method. These amounts included \u20ac12 million in deferred taxes in 2023 (2022: -\u20ac7 million). In 2023, the difference resulted mainly from the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar, and, in 2022, from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real relative to the euro.\n\nWith  the  deconsolidation  of  the  Russian  shareholdings  held  by Wintershall  Dea  AG,  Kassel/Hamburg,  Germany,  total  differences arising  from  currency  translation  of  \u20ac868  million  were  reclassified as earnings to the income statement in 2022.\n\n## Measurement of securities at fair value\n\nMeasurement of securities at fair value in 2023 led to a decrease in other comprehensive income of \u20ac172 million (2022: -\u20ac16 million). This  was  due  to  impairments  of  equity  instruments  measured  at fair value through other comprehensive income pursuant to IFRS 9 in  the  amount  of  \u20ac180  million  at  Wintershall  Dea  AG,  Kassel/ Hamburg,  Germany,  which  is  accounted  for  using  the  equity method.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  designated  in  hedging relationships (cash flow hedges) adjusted for deferred taxes in the amount of \u20ac8 million (2022: -\u20ac8 million) increased equity by a total of  \u20ac570  million  (2022:  -\u20ac33  million).  In  2023,  \u20ac588  million  (2022: \u20ac37 million) was attributable to the hedging of future cash flows at shareholdings accounted for using the equity method.\n\n- B For more information on cash flow hedge accounting, see Note 25.5 from page 303 onward",

Benefits  generally  depend  on  years  of service, contributions or compensation, and take into consideration the legal framework of labor, tax and social security laws of the countries where the companies are located. To limit the risks of changing  financial market  conditions  as  well  as demographic  developments,  employees  have,  for  a  number  of years  now,  been  almost  exclusively  offered  defined  contribution plans for future years of service.\n\nThe  Group  Pension  Committee  monitors  the  risks  of  all  pension plans  of  the  Group  with  regard  to  the  financing  of  pension commitments  and  the  portfolio  structure  of  existing  plan  assets. The  organization,  responsibilities,  strategy,  implementation  and reporting requirements are documented for the units involved.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In some countries - especially in Germany, in the United States, in the  United  Kingdom  and  in  Switzerland  -  there  are  pension obligations  subject  to  government  supervision  or  similar  legal restrictions. For example, there are minimum funding requirements to  cover  pension  obligations,  which  are  based  on  actuarial assumptions  that  differ from those pursuant to IAS 19. Furthermore,  there  are  qualitative  and  quantitative  restrictions  on allocating plan assets to certain asset categories. This could result in annual fluctuations in employer contributions, financing measures and the assumption of obligations in favor of the pension funds to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe obligations and the plan assets used to fund the obligations are exposed to demographic, legal and economic risks. Economic risks are primarily due to unforeseen developments on commodity and capital markets. They affect, for example, pension adjustments based  on  the  level  of  inflation  in  Germany  and  in  the  United Kingdom, as well as the impact of discount rates on the amount of the defined benefit obligation.\n\nThe strategy of the BASF Group with regard to financing pension commitments takes into account country-specific supervisory and tax regulations.\n\nIn  some  countries,  pension  benefits  were  granted  for  which  the employer has a subsidiary liability. Pension benefits in a number of countries include minimum interest guarantees to a limited extent. If the pension fund cannot generate the income needed to provide the minimum guarantee, this guarantee must be provided by the employer under the subsidiary liability. To the extent that recourse to the employer is unlikely based on the structure and execution of the pension benefits as well as the asset situation of the pension fund, these plans are treated as defined contribution plans.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWith  regard  to  pensions  and  similar  obligations,  a  distinction  is made between defined benefit and defined contribution plans. In the  case  of  defined  contribution  plans,  current  contributions  are recognized as an expense.\n\nIn  the  case of defined benefit obligations, provisions for pensions are  calculated  on  an  actuarial  basis  in  accordance  with  the projected unit credit method. Assumptions relating to the following valuation parameters, among others are used: future developments in compensation, pensions and inflation, employee turnover, and the life expectancy of beneficiaries. Actuarial reports are used  to  calculate  the  amount  of  pension  provisions. Obligations  are  discounted  based  on  the  market  yields  on  highquality corporate fixed-rate bonds.  Pension  provisions  are recognized as a net defined benefit liability if the discounted benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets used to cover it.\n\nA  plan  asset  surplus  exists  if  a  defined  benefit  plan's  assets exceed the plan's obligations. IAS 19 requires the employer to test any  such  surplus  for  impairment.  If  no  economic  benefit  (for example,  reduced  contributions  or  a  refund)  to  the  company  is present, an asset ceiling must be reported. Such an asset ceiling was  applied  to  the  BASF  Group's  Swiss  pension  plans  in  2022 and 2023.\n\nSimilar obligations, especially those arising from commitments by North American Group companies to pay the healthcare costs and life  insurance  premiums of retired staff and their dependents, are reported under provisions for similar obligations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe assumptions used to ascertain the defined benefit obligation as of December 31 are used in the following year to determine the expenses for pension plans.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  from  changes  in  estimates  relating  to the  actuarial  assumptions  used  to  calculate  defined  benefit obligations,  the  difference  between  standardized  and  actual returns on plan assets, as well as the effects of the asset ceiling are recognized directly in equity as other comprehensive income.\n\nThe interest on the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of the year is recognized in the financial result. This is the difference between the interest cost of the defined benefit obligation and the standardized return on plan assets as well as the interest cost for the asset ceiling. Net interest expense of the respective fiscal year is based on the discount rate and the defined benefit obligation at the  beginning  of  the  year.  The  expected  contribution  payments and benefits paid over the course of the fiscal year are taken into account when determining net interest.\n\nThe standardized return on plan assets is calculated by multiplying plan assets at the beginning of the year with the discount rate used for existing defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year, taking into account benefit and contribution payments to be made during the year.",

        "page_content": "## Description of the defined benefit plans\n\nThe  following  section  describes  the  typical  plan  structure  in  the individual countries. Different arrangements may exist, in particular due to the assumption of plans as part of acquisitions; however, these do not have any material impact on the description of plans in the individual countries.\n\n## Germany\n\nFor  BASF  SE  and  German  Group  companies,  a  basic  level  of benefits  is  provided  by  BASF  Pensionskasse  VVaG,  a  legally independent  plan,  which  is  financed  by  employer  and  employee contributions  as  well  as  the  return  on  plan  assets.  BASF  SE ensures  the  necessary  contributions  to  adequately  finance  the benefits  promised  by  BASF  Pensionskasse  VVaG.  Some  of  the benefits  financed  via  BASF  Pensionskasse  VVaG  are  subject  to adjustments that must be borne by its member companies to the extent that these cannot be borne by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG due  to  the  regulations  imposed  by  the  German  supervisory authority.  In  2004,  the  basic  benefit  plan  was  closed  for  newly hired employees at German BASF companies and replaced by a defined  contribution  plan.  A  new  defined  contribution  plan  was introduced as of July 1, 2021, for new hires in the German BASF companies.  At  BASF  SE,  occupational  pension  promises  that exceed the basic level of benefits are financed under a contractual trust  arrangement  by  BASF  Pensionstreuhand  e.V.;  at  German Group companies, these benefits are financed primarily via pension provisions. As of 2022, new employees receive a securities-based pension  award  while  other  employees  are  granted  benefits primarily  based  on  cash  balance  plans.  Furthermore,  employees are given the option of participating in various deferred compensation schemes.\n\n## United States\n\nEmployees  are  granted  benefits  based  on  defined  contribution plans.\n\nEffective  2010,  the  existing  defined  benefit  plans  were  closed  to further increases in benefits based on future years of service, and benefits earned in the past were frozen. There is no entitlement to pension adjustments to compensate for cost-of-living increases.\n\nThe  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  governing  the  plans  are based  on  the  U.S.  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act (ERISA),  which  requires  the  plan  sponsor  to  ensure  a  minimum funding  level.  Any  employer  contributions  necessary  to  meet  the minimum  funding  level  are  based  on  the  results  of  an  actuarial valuation. Furthermore, there are unfunded pension plans that are not subject to ERISA requirements.\n\nAdditional  similar  obligations  arise  from  plans  that  assume  the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired employees and  their  dependents.  Such  plans  have  been  closed  to  new entrants  since  2007.  In  addition,  the  amount  of  the  benefits  for such plans has been frozen.\n\n## Switzerland\n\nThe  employees  of  the  BASF  Group  in  Switzerland  receive  a company  pension,  which  is  financed  through  a  pension  fund  by employer and employee contributions as well as the return on plan assets.  The  pension  plans  are  accounted  for  as  defined  benefit plans, as the obligatory minimum pension guaranteed by law under the Swiss Pension Fund Act (BVG) is included in the scheme. All benefits  vest  immediately.  According  to  government  regulations, the  employer  is  obligated  to  make  contributions,  so  that  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npension funds are able to grant the minimum benefits guaranteed by  law.  The  pension  funds  are  managed  by  boards,  where employer and employees are equally represented, which steer and monitor the benefit plans and asset allocation.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nEmployees are granted  benefits  based  on  a  defined  contribution plan.\n\nThe BASF Group also maintains defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, which have been closed for further increases based on future years of service. Adjustments to compensate for increases in  the  cost  of  living  until  the  beginning  of  retirement  are  legally required for beneficiaries of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe financing of the pension plans is determined by the provisions of the regulatory authority for pensions and the relevant social and labor law requirements. The defined benefit plans are administered by  a  trust  company,  whose  Board  of  Trustees,  according  to  the trustee  agreement  and  law,  represents  the  interests  of  the beneficiaries  and  ensures  that  the  benefits  can  be  paid  in  the future. The  required  funding  is  determined  using  technical valuations according to local regulations every three years.\n\n## Other countries\n\nFor  Group  companies  in  other  countries,  defined  benefits  are covered  in  some  cases  by  pension  provisions,  but  mainly  by external insurance companies or pension funds.",

The last pension adjustment was on  January  1,  2022.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  a  cumulative inflation  rate  of  15.00%  since  the  last  pension  adjustment  was assumed  (December  31,  2022:  10.00%).  The  long-term  inflation assumption was adjusted in 2022 from 1.60% to 2.20% and left unchanged in 2023.\n\nThe  valuation  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  is  generally performed  using  the  most  recent  actuarial  mortality  tables  as  of December  31  of  the  respective  business  year;  these  were  last updated  in  2019  for  the  pension  obligations  in  Germany  and  in 2021  for  the  pension  obligations  in  Switzerland.  The  actuarial mortality  tables  for  the  pension  obligations  in  United  States  were adjusted in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assumptions used to determine expenses for pension benefits in the respective business year\n\n## Actuarial mortality tables (significant countries) as of Decembe r 31, 2023\n\n| Germany                                                                                       | Heubeck Richttafeln 2018G (modified)                                  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pri-2012 base mortality tables with Scale MP-2021 projection                                  | United States                                                         |\n|                                                                                               | Switzerland BVG 2020 generational with CMI 2018 mortality improvement |\n| United Kingdom S2PxA (standard actuarial mortality tables for self-administered plans (SAPS)) |                                                                       |\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nA  change  in  the  material  actuarial  assumptions  would  have  the following effects on the defined benefit obligation:\n\n## Sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation as of Decembe r 31\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                            | Increase by 0.5 percentage points   | Increase by 0.5 percentage points   | Decrease by 0.5 percentage points   | Decrease by 0.5 percentage points   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                            | 2023                                | 2022                                | 2023                                | 2022                                |\n| Discount rate              | -1,303                              | -1,305                              | 1,459                               | 1,477                               |\n| Projected pension increase | 1,026                               | 985                                 | -867                                | -846                                |\n\nAn  alternative  valuation  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  was performed to determine how  changes  in  the underlying assumptions influence the amount of the defined benefit obligation.

Accordingly,  plan  assets  are aligned with the long-term development of the obligations, taking into  consideration  the  risks  associated  with  the  specific  asset classes  and  the  regulations  relating  to  the  investment  of  plan assets. The existing portfolio structure is based on the target asset allocation. In addition, current market assessments are taken into consideration.  In  order  to  mitigate  risks  and  maximize  returns,  a widely spread global portfolio of individual assets is held.\n\nLiability-driven  investment  (LDI)  techniques,  such  as  hedging  the risk  of  changes  in  interest  rates  and  inflation,  are  used  in  some pension plans, especially in U.K. and U.S. plans, and as of 2023, in Germany as well.\n\n## Structure of plan assets\n\n%\n\n|                                 |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equities                        |     19 |     21 |\n| Debt instruments                |     45 |     42 |\n| of which for government debtors |     19 |     16 |\n| for other debtors               |     26 |     26 |\n| Real estate                     |      8 |      7 |\n| Alternative investments         |     27 |     29 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents       |      1 |      1 |\n| Total                           |    100 |    100 |\n\nThe  asset  class debt  instruments comprises  promissory  notes and debentures (Pfandbriefe) as well as corporate and government bonds. Government bonds primarily relate to bonds from countries with very high credit ratings, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Switzerland. Government bonds from  emerging  countries  are  also  held  to  a  limited  extent. Corporate  bonds  mainly  comprise  bonds  from  creditworthy debtors,  although  particular  high-yield  bonds  are  also  held  to  a limited  extent.  In  connection  with  the  continuous  monitoring  of default risk based on a given risk budget and on the observation of the development of the creditworthiness of issuers, the plan asset allocation  may  be  adjusted  in  the  case  of  a  revised  market assessment. Alternative investments largely comprise investments  in  private  and  infrastructure  equity,  absolute  return funds and senior secured loans.\n\nAlmost  all  of  the equities are  priced  on  active  markets.  The category debt  instruments includes  promissory  notes  and debentures (Pfandbriefe) acquired through private placements with a market value in the amount of \u20ac262 million as of December 31, 2023,  and  \u20ac138  million  as  of  December  31,  2022.  For  such securities, especially those held by domestic pension plans, there is no active market. There is also no fungible market price for the additional  amount  of  \u20ac4,380  million,  especially  in  the  category  of alternative  investments and real  estate .  The  capital  market compensates  for  this  lack  of  fungibility  with  yield  premiums depending on the maturity.\n\nPlan  assets  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date  did  not  include  any significant volumes of securities issued by BASF Group companies in  2023  or  2022.  The  market  value  of  the  properties  of  legally independent pension funds rented to BASF Group companies was \u20ac115 million as in the previous year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Provisions are recognized at the probable settlement value.\n\nThe  probable  amount  required  to  settle  noncurrent  provisions  is discounted if the effect of discounting is material. In this case, the provision is recognized at present value. Financing costs related to unwinding  the  discount  of  provisions  in  subsequent  periods  are shown in other financial result.\n\nProvisions for restoration obligations include expected costs for dismantling  existing  plants  and  buildings.  If  BASF  is  the  only responsible  party  that  can  be  identified,  the  provision  covers  the entire expected obligation. At sites operated together with one or more partners, the provision generally covers only BASF's share of the expected obligation. The amount of the provision is determined based  on  the  available  technical  information  on  the  site,  the technology used, legal regulations,  and  official  requirements.  The calculation accounts for expected significant changes in obligations.\n\nProvisions for environmental protection and remediation costs are recognized for expected costs for rehabilitating contaminated sites, recultivating landfills, removal of environmental contamination at existing production or storage sites, and for similar measures as well as for obligations to surrender emission certificates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Provisions  are  recognized  for these  expenses  when  the  relevant  measures  have  been  planned and announced by management.\n\nProvisions for litigation, damage claims and similar obligations contain anticipated expenses from lawsuits in which BASF is the defendant  party,  as  well  as  obligations  under  damage  claims against BASF and fines. In order to determine the amount of the provisions, the company takes into consideration the facts related to  each  case,  the  size  of  the  claim,  compensation  awarded  in\n\nsimilar cases  and  independent  expert  advice  as  well  as assumptions  regarding  the  probability  of  a  successful  claim  and the range of possible claims.

In  December  2018,  a  multidistrict litigation was created to coordinate claims brought against manufacturers, distributors and suppliers of aqueous film forming foam  (AFFF)  in  particular,  which  plaintiffs  allege  contains  toxic levels of certain PFAS compounds including perfluorooctanoic acid and  perfluorooctane  sulfonate.  Plaintiffs  typically  allege  that exposure  to  AFFF  has  caused  loss  of  use  and  enjoyment  of property,  diminished  property  value,  remediation  costs,  and personal injuries including various types of cancers. The complaints name BASF as a defendant in connection with its 2009 acquisition of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc. and the legacy Ciba/ BASF Lodyne fluorochemical product lines. BASF is a defendant in over 4,200 lawsuits as of January 2024 and is defending against these claims.\n\nAt this time, BASF cannot predict the outcome of resolving these matters  or  what  potential  actions  may  be  taken  by  regulatory agencies.  An  adverse  outcome  could  be  material  to  BASF's financial results.\n\nFurthermore, BASF SE and its affiliated companies are defendants in  or  parties  to  a  variety  of  legal  or  regulatory  proceedings  on  a recurring  basis.

Financial  assets  are  derecognized when  BASF  no  longer  has  a  contractual  right  to  the  cash  flows from the financial asset or when the financial asset is transferred together with all material risks and rewards of ownership and BASF does  not  have  control  of  the  financial  asset  after  it  has  been transferred. For example, receivables are derecognized when they are  definitively  found  to  be  uncollectible  such  as  in  the  event  of concluded insolvency proceedings. Financial liabilities are derecognized  when  the  contractual  obligations  expire,  are discharged  or  cancelled.  Regular-way  purchases  and  sales  of financial instruments are accounted for using the settlement date; in precious metal trading, the trade date is used.\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If  pricing on an active market is available, for example in the form of  exchange  prices,  these  are  used  as  the  basis  for  the measurement.  Otherwise,  the  measurement  is  based  on  either internal measurement models using current market parameters or external  measurements,  for  example,  from  banks.  These  internal measurements rely predominantly on the net present value method and option pricing models. These models incorporate, for example, expected future cash flows as well as discount factors adjusted for term and, potentially, risk. Depending on the availability of market parameters,  BASF  assigns  financial  instruments'  market  values one  of  the  three  levels  of  the  fair  value  hierarchy  pursuant  to IFR S 13.  Reassignment to a different  level  during  a  fiscal  year  is only carried out if the availability of observable market parameters for identical or similar items changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf  the level 3 fair values calculated at the time of initial recognition using  a  valuation  model,  differ  from  the  transaction  price,  the differences  are  deferred  and  reported  in  the  balance  sheet together  with  the  positive  or  negative  fair  value  of  the  respective financial instrument  according  to  the  valuation  model.  The differences are amortized over the terms of the contracts using the straight-line method.\n\nThe classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow condition (the 'solely payments of principal and interest' criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model used for managing financial asset  portfolios.  Based  on  these  two  criteria,  BASF  uses  the following measurement categories for financial assets:\n\n- -Financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss include all financial assets whose cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow  condition  established  in  IFRS  9.  At  BASF,  derivatives,  for example,  are  allocated  to  this  measurement  category.  In general, BASF does not exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which  permits  the  allocation  of  financial  instruments  not  to  be measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances.",

        "page_content": "- -Financial  assets  measured  at  amortized  cost include  all assets  with  contractual  terms  that  give  rise  to  cash  flows  on specific  dates,  provided  that  these  cash  flows  are  solely payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal  amount outstanding  in  accordance  with  the  cash  flow  condition  in IFR S 9, to the extent that the asset is held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows over its term. At BASF,  this  measurement  category  includes  trade  accounts receivable, as  well as  receivables  reported  under  other receivables and miscellaneous assets and certain securities.\n\nInitial  measurement  of  these  assets  is  generally  at  fair  value, which usually corresponds to the transaction price at the time of acquisition  or,  in  the  case  of  trade  accounts  receivable,  to  the transaction price pursuant to IFRS 15. Subsequent measurement  effects  are  recognized  in  income  using  the effective interest method.\n\nImpairments are recognized for expected credit losses at both initial and subsequent measurement, even before the occurrence  of  any  default  event.  Counterparties  are  generally considered  to  default  when  they  become  insolvent,  become  a debtor  in  a  creditor  protection  program  or  are  in  a  financerelated  legal  dispute  with  BASF,  or  more  than  half  of  BASF's receivables portfolio with them is more than 90 days overdue. In these  cases,  individual  impairments  are  recognized  for  the financial  assets  measured  at  amortized  cost  that  are  then considered to be credit impaired.\n\nThe extent of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit  risk  of  a  financial  asset,  as  well  as  any  changes  to  this credit  risk:  If  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  asset  has  increased significantly  since  initial  recognition,  expected  credit  losses  are generally recognized over the lifetime of the asset. If, however, the  credit  risk  has  not  increased  significantly  in  this  period, impairments  are  generally  only  recognized  as  12-month expected  credit  losses.  By  contrast,  under  the  simplified approach  for  determining  expected  credit  losses  permitted  by IFRS  9,  impairments  for  receivables  such  as  lease  receivables and  trade  accounts  receivable  always  cover  the  lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable concerned.\n\nAt  BASF,  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  asset  is  assessed  using both internal  information  and  external  rating  information  on  the respective counterparty. A significant increase in the counterparty's credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain  number  of  notches.  It  is  generally  assumed  that  the credit  risk  for  a  counterparty  with  a  high  credit  rating  will  not have increased significantly.\n\nRegional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and  expectations  are  taken  into  account  when  assessing  the extent of impairment as part of the calculation of expected credit losses  and  individual  impairments.  In  addition,  BASF  uses internal  and  external  ratings  and  the  assessments  of  debt collection agencies and credit insurers, when available. Individual impairments are also based on experience relating to customer solvency  and  customer-specific  risks.  Factors  such  as  credit insurance,  which  covers  a  portion  of  receivables  measured  at amortized  cost,  are  likewise  considered  when  calculating impairments. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to an  immaterial  extent.  Expected  credit  losses  and  individual impairments  are  only  calculated  for  those  receivables  that  are not  covered  by  insurance  or  other  collateral.  Impairments  on receivables  whose  insurance  includes  a  deductible  are  not recognized in excess of the amount of the deductible.\n\nA decrease in impairment due, for example, to a reduction in the credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event occurring after the  impairment  is  recorded  in  profit  or  loss.  Reversals  of impairments may not exceed amortized cost, less any expected future credit losses.\n\n-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive  income include  all  assets  with  contractual terms  that  give  rise  to  cash  flows  on  specified  dates  that  are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding,  in  accordance  with  the  cash  flow  condition  in IFR S 9.  Furthermore,  the  assets  in  this  measurement  category may not just be held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows over their term, but also generating cash flows  from  their  sale.  At  BASF,  trade  accounts  receivable  that are  available  for  sale  as  part  of  a  factoring  agreement  are allocated to this category. Additionally, certain securities that are reported  as  other  financial  assets  or  marketable  securities  are allocated to this category. BASF does not exercise the option to subsequently measure equity instruments through other comprehensive income. Assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value, which  usually  corresponds  to  the  transaction  price  of  the receivables and securities allocated to this category at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income  and  reclassified  to  the  statement  of  income  when  the asset is disposed of. Impairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized in profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "The  following  measurement  categories  are  used  for  financial liabilities:\n\n- -Financial  liabilities  measured  at  amortized  cost generally include  all  financial  liabilities,  provided  these  do  not  represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of  initial  recognition,  which  usually  corresponds  to  the  value  of the consideration received. Subsequent  measurement  is recognized in profit or loss at amortized cost using the effective interest  method. At BASF, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks  reported  under  financial  indebtedness  are  measured  at amortized cost.\n- -Financial liabilities  measured at fair value through profit or loss contain  derivative  financial  liabilities.  These  are  likewise measured at the value of the consideration received as the fair value of the liability on the date of initial recognition. Fair value is also  applied  as  a  measurement  basis  for  these  liabilities  in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently measure non-derivative  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  is  not  exercised. Derivative  financial  instruments  can  be  embedded  within  other contracts, creating a hybrid financial instrument. If IFRS policies require  separation,  the  embedded  derivative  is  accounted  for separately from its host contract and measured at fair value. If IFRS 9 does not provide for separation, the hybrid instrument is accounted for at fair value in its entirety.\n\nFinancial  guarantees of  the  BASF  Group  are  contracts  that require  compensation  payments  to  be  made  to  the  guarantee holder if a debtor fails to make payment when due under the terms of  a  transaction  entered  into  with  the  holder  of  the  guarantee. Financial  guarantees  issued  by  BASF  are  measured  at  fair  value upon  initial  recognition.  In  subsequent  periods,  these  financial guarantees are carried at the higher of amortized cost or the best estimate of the present obligation as of the reporting date.\n\nIn cash  flow  hedges, future  cash  flows  and  the  related  income and expenses are hedged against the risk of changes in value. To this  end,  future  underlying  transactions  and  the  corresponding hedging  instruments  are  designated  in  a  cash  flow  hedge accounting  relationship  for  accounting  purposes.  The  effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument, which often meets the definition of a derivative, and the cost of hedging are  recognized  directly  in  equity  under  other  comprehensive income  over  the  term  of  the  hedge,  taking  deferred  taxes  into account.  The  ineffective  portion  is  recognized  immediately  in  the income statement. In the case of future transactions that lead to recognition  of  a  nonfinancial  asset  or  a  nonfinancial  liability,  the cumulative fair value changes of the hedge in equity are generally charged  against  the  cost  of  the  hedged  item  on  its  initial recognition.  For  hedges  based  on  financial  assets,  financial liabilities or future transactions, cumulative fair value changes of the hedges are transferred from equity to the income statement in the reporting  period  in  which  the  hedged  item  is  recognized  in  the income  statement.  The  maturity  of  the  hedging  instrument  is aligned with the effective date of the future transaction.\n\nWhen fair  value  hedge accounting  is  used,  the  asset  or  liability recognized is hedged against the risk of a change in fair value. The hedging  instruments  used,  which  often  take  the  form  of  a derivative, are measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized  in  the  statement  of  income.  The  carrying  amounts  of the assets or liabilities designated as the underlying transaction are also measured at fair value through the statement of income.\n\n## 25.2 Financial risks\n\n## Market risks\n\nForeign currency risks: Changes in exchange rates could lead to losses in the value of financial instruments and adverse changes in future cash flows from planned transactions. Foreign currency risks from financial instruments result from the translation at the closing rate  of  financial  receivables,  loans,  securities,  cash  and  financial liabilities  into  the  functional  currency  of  the  respective  Group company.  Foreign  currency  contracts  in  various  currencies  are used to hedge foreign exchange risks from nonderivative financial instruments and planned transactions.\n\nThe foreign currency risk exposure corresponds to the net amount of  the  nominal  volume  of  the  primary  and  the  derivative  financial instruments  that  are  exposed  to  currency  risks.  In  addition, planned  purchase  and  sales  transactions  of  the  respective following  year  are  included  if  they  fall  under  the  currency  risk management  system.  Long  and  short  positions  in  the  same currency are offset against each other.\n\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  by  simulating  a  5%  and 10% appreciation of the respective functional currency against the other  currencies.  A  5%  appreciation  of  the  respective  functional currency would have reduced BASF's income before income taxes by \u20ac165 million as of December 31, 2023. A 10% appreciation of the  respective  functional  currency  would  have  resulted  in  a negative  effect  on  BASF's  income  before  income  taxes  in  the amount  of  \u20ac310  million.  A  5%  appreciation  of  the  respective functional  currency  would  have  resulted  in  a  negative  effect  on BASF's income before income taxes in the amount of \u20ac156 million (-\u20ac293  million  applying  10%  appreciation)  as  of  December  31, 2022.  The  effect  from  the  items  designated  under  hedge accounting  would  have  reduced  shareholders'  equity  before income  taxes  by  \u20ac3  million  applying  5%  appreciation  to  the functional currency and by \u20ac2 million applying 10% appreciation to the functional currency as of December 31, 2023 (2022: increase\n\n<!-- image -->",

Interest  rate  swaps  and  combined interest rate and currency derivatives are used in individual cases to hedge these risks. The derivatives are presented in Note 25.5. Interest rate risks are relevant to BASF's financing activities but are not of material significance for BASF's operating activities.\n\nThe variable interest risk exposure, which also includes fixed rate bonds maturing in the following year, amounted to -\u20ac427 million as of  December 31, 2023 (2022: -\u20ac2,441 million). An increase in all relevant  interest  rates  by  one  half  of  a  percentage  point  would have  raised  income  before  income  taxes  by  \u20ac2  million  as  of December 31, 2023. An increase in  all  relevant  interest  rates  by one  percentage  point  would  have  raised  income  before  income taxes by \u20ac3 million as of the same date. An increase in all relevant interest  rates  by  one  half  of  a  percentage  point  would  have lowered  income  before  income  taxes  by  \u20ac7  million  as  of Decemb er 31,  2022 (an increase of one percentage point would have  lowered  income  before  income  taxes  by  \u20ac15  million).\n\nBecause  no  interest  derivatives  were  designated  in  hedge accounting  relationships  as  of  December  31,  2023,  a  change  in interest  rates  would  not  have  had  an  effect  on  shareholders' equity.

No derivatives were identified that are associated with contracts yet to be adjusted in either year.\n\nCommodity price risks: Some of BASF's divisions are exposed to strong  fluctuations  in  raw  materials  prices.  These  result  primarily from  raw  materials  (for  example  naphtha,  benzene,  natural  gas, LPG condensate) as well as from metals. BASF takes the following measures  to  reduce  price  risks  associated  with  the  purchase  of raw materials:\n\n- - BASF uses derivatives to hedge the risks of raw materials prices. These are primarily options on crude oil, oil products and natural gas.\n- - The Catalysts division enters into both short-term and long-term purchase contracts with precious and battery metal producers. It  also  buys  metals  on  spot  markets  from  various  business partners. The price risk from metals purchased to be sold on to third parties, or for use in the production of catalysts and battery materials, is hedged using derivative instruments. This is mainly performed using forward contracts, which are settled by either entering into offsetting contracts or by delivering the metal.\n- - In the Agricultural Solutions division, the sales prices of products are  sometimes  pegged  to  the  price  of  certain  agricultural commodities.  To  hedge  the  resulting  risks,  derivatives  on agricultural commodities are concluded.\n\nIn  addition,  BASF  holds  limited  unhedged  precious  metal  and  oil product  positions,  which  can  also  include  derivatives,  for  trading on  its  own  account.  The  value  of  these  positions  is  exposed  to market price volatility and is subject to constant monitoring.",

        "page_content": "By  holding  commodity  derivatives  and  precious  metal  trading positions and unhedged oil product positions, BASF is exposed to price  risks.  The  valuation  of  commodity  derivatives  and  precious metal trading positions at fair value means that adverse changes in market  prices  could  negatively  affect  the  earnings  and  equity of B ASF.\n\nBASF holds several physical power purchase agreements (physical PPAs)  with  terms  of  up  to  25  years.  Under  the  physical  PPAs, BASF  procures  electricity and  associated  green  electricity certificates,  known  as  guarantees  of  origin  (GoOs).  If  BASF  can consume in full the electricity provided through the physical PPAs, these  fall  under  the  own  use  exemption  and  are  therefore  not recognized  as  derivatives  in  the  balance  sheet  even  when electricity and green electricity certificates are purchased at a fixed price. Additionally, BASF also holds physical PPAs in the USA and Asia;  the  electricity  from  these  PPAs  cannot  be  consumed  in  full due to major deviations between supply profiles and consumption patterns.  The  electricity  forward  agreements  embedded  in  them are not eligible for the own use exemption and are recognized as derivatives  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  if  electricity  is purchased  at  a  fixed  price.  In  contrast  to  electricity,  green electricity  certificates  obtained  from  physical  PPAs  recognized  as derivatives can be stored and consumed at a later date. Thus, they continue to fall under the own use exemption even if purchased at a  fixed  price.  In  the  event  of  adverse  changes  in  energy  market prices, valuation of the electricity forward agreements for physical PPAs can lead to negative effects on BASF's earnings.\n\nFurthermore, BASF  holds  several virtual power purchase agreements (virtual PPAs) in the United States with terms of up to 15 years. The electricity forward agreements embedded in virtual PPAs are recognized separately as derivatives at fair value through profit  or  loss.  In  the  event  of  adverse  changes  in  energy  market prices, measurement of electricity forward agreements at fair value can lead to negative effects on BASF's earnings.\n\nBASF performs value-at-risk analyses for all commodity derivatives and  precious  metal  trading  positions.  Value  at  risk  continuously measures the market price risk and quantifies the loss that is not exceeded by a specific confidence level during a defined holding period. BASF bases the value-at-risk calculation on a confidence interval of 95% and a holding period of one day. BASF applies the variance-covariance method to calculate value at risk.\n\nBASF uses value at risk in conjunction with other risk management tools. Besides value at risk, BASF sets volume-based limits as well as exposure and stop-loss limits.\n\n## Risk positions from commodity derivatives not eligible for the own use exemption\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n2\n\n0\n\n4\n\n|                                                | Decembe r 31, 2023   | Decembe r 31, 2023   | Decembe r 31, 2022   | Decembe r 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                | Exposure             | Value at  Risk       | Exposure             | Value at  Risk       |\n| Crude oil, oil products and natural gas        | 129                  | 15                   | 388                  | 23                   |\n| Precious metals                                | 94                   | 1                    | 46                   |                      |\n| Agricultural commodities                       | 76                   | 0                    | 87                   |                      |\n| Electricity and green electricity certificates | 918                  | 28                   | 228                  |                      |\n\nThe exposure corresponds to the net amount of all long and short positions of the respective commodity category.\n\n- B For  more  information  on  BASF's  financial  risks  and  risk  management,  see  Opportunities  and  Risks from page 173 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Default and credit risk\n\nDefault and credit risks arise when customers and debtors do not fulfill  their  contractual  obligations.  BASF  regularly  analyzes  the creditworthiness  of  the  counterparties  and  grants  credit  limits  on the basis of this analysis. Due to the global activities and diversified customer  structure  of  the  BASF  Group,  there  is  no  significant concentration  of  default risk. The  carrying  amount  of  all receivables, loans and interest-bearing securities plus the nominal value  of  financial  obligations  stemming  from  contingent  liabilities not  to  be  recognized  represents  the  maximum  default  risk for B ASF.\n\n- B For more information on credit risks, see Note 17 from page 275 onward\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nBASF promptly recognizes any risks from cash flow fluctuations as part of liquidity planning. BASF has ready access to sufficient liquid funds from the ongoing commercial paper program and confirmed lines of credit from banks.",

All insignificant shareholdings are measured at cost (carrying amount: \u20ac536 million). Fair value level 1 is applied to publicly listed shareholdings. Level 2 is applied to shareholdings for which valuation is based on parameters observable in the market to the greatest extent possible. These may be adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective shareholding in the fair value.\n- b AC: amortized cost; FVTOCI: fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss; a more detailed description of the categories can be found in Note 25.1 from page 291 onward.\n- c Fair value was determined based on quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.\n- d Fair value was determined based on parameters for which directly or indirectly quoted prices on active markets were available.\n- e Fair value was determined based on parameters for which there was no observable market data.\n- f Does not include separately shown derivatives or receivables and liabilities from finance leases. If miscellaneous receivables are valued at fair value through profit or loss, their valuation is generally based on parameters observable on the market. These are adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective assets in the fair value.\n- g The carrying amount of the electricity forward agreements reported in the balance sheet under other receivables and miscellaneous assets is \u20ac53 million after subtracting the differences of \u20ac145 million described on page 300.\n- h The carrying amount of the electricity forward agreements reported in the balance sheet under other liabilities is \u20ac10 million after subtracting the differences of \u20ac58 million described on page 300.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All insignificant shareholdings are measured at cost (carrying amount: \u20ac539 million). Fair value level 1 is applied to publicly listed shareholdings. Level 2 is applied to shareholdings for which valuation is based on parameters observable in the market to the greatest extent possible. These may be adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective shareholding in the fair value.\n- b AC: amortized cost; FVTOCI: fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss; a more detailed description of the categories can be found in Note 25.1 from page 291 onward.\n- c Fair value was determined based on quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.\n- d Fair value was determined based on parameters for which directly or indirectly quoted prices on active markets were available.\n- e Fair value was determined based on parameters for which there was no observable market data.\n- f Does not include separately shown derivatives or receivables and liabilities from finance leases. If miscellaneous receivables are valued at fair value through profit or loss, their valuation is generally based on parameters observable on the market. These are adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective assets in the fair value.\n- g The carrying amount of the electricity forward agreements reported in the balance sheet under other receivables and miscellaneous assets is \u20ac8 million after subtracting the differences of \u20ac24 million.\n- h The carrying amount of the electricity forward agreements reported in the balance sheet under other liabilities is \u20ac17 million after subtracting the differences of \u20ac46 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reduction  in  trade  accounts  payable  was  \u20ac72  million  and  the reduction in advance  payments  received  on  orders  was \u20ac957 million.  Accordingly,  the  net  amount  for  trade  accounts receivable  was  \u20ac10,414  million  (gross  amount  before  offsetting: \u20ac11,443  million).  The  resulting  net  amount  for  trade  accounts payable  was  \u20ac6,741  million  (gross  amount  before  offsetting: \u20ac6,813 million). The net amount for advance payments received on orders was  \u20ac779  million  (gross  amount  before  offsetting:\n\n\u20ac1,736 million). In 2022, trade accounts receivable were also offset against  trade  accounts  payable  and  the  advance  payments received on orders included in current other liabilities. This reduced trade accounts receivable by \u20ac992 million. The reduction in trade accounts payable was \u20ac103 million and the reduction in advance payments  received  on  orders  was  \u20ac889  million.  Accordingly,  the net  amount  for  trade  accounts  receivable  was  \u20ac12,055  million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac13,047 million). The resulting net amount  for  trade  accounts  payable  was  \u20ac8,434  million  (gross amount  before  offsetting:  \u20ac8,537  million).  The  net  amount  for advance  payments  received  on  orders  was  \u20ac926  million  (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac1,815 million).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Hedge accounting\n\nBASF  is  exposed  to  commodity  price  risks  in  the  context  of procuring naphtha. Some of the planned purchases of naphtha are hedged using options on oil and oil products. The main contractual elements of these items are aligned with the characteristics of the hedged  item.  Cash  flow  hedge  accounting  was  employed  for  a portion  of  these  hedging  relationships  in  2023  and  2022.  The average exercise price of the designated options was $684.51 per metric  ton  as  of  December  31,  2023  (December  31,  2022: $737.71  per  metric  ton).  Cash  flows  from  designated  hedging instruments  and  hedged  transactions  occur  in  the  following  year and are also recognized in profit or loss for that year.\n\nFurthermore,  cash  flow  hedge  accounting  continued  to  be employed  to  a  minor  extent  for  procuring  natural  gas,  which  is likewise  exposed  to  commodity  price  risks.  Commodity  pricebased options as well as swaps serve as hedging instruments, for which contract terms are defined to reflect the risks of the hedged item. Depending on where trading took place, the average exercise price of the designated options was \u20ac72.00 per MWh or $4.02 per mmBtu as of December 31, 2023. The average hedged exercise price  of  the  designated  swaps  was  \u20ac48.31  per  MWh  as  of December 31, 2023. The average exercise price of the designated options  was  \u20ac71.36  per  MWh  or  $5.00  per  mmBtu  as  of December 31, 2022. Cash flows from not yet realized hedging and underlying transactions are generally recognized in profit or loss in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe change in the options' time value is recognized separately in equity  as  costs  of  transaction-related  hedging  and,  in  the  year during which the hedged items mature, it is initially derecognized against  the  carrying  amount  of  the  procured  assets  and recognized  in  profit  or  loss  when  the  assets  are  consumed.  In 2023,  a  decrease  in  fair  value  of  \u20ac63  million  was  recognized  in\n\nequity,  and  \u20ac64  million  was  initially  derecognized  against  the carrying amount of the inventories procured and then recognized upon  consumption  in  profit  or  loss.  In  2022,  a  decrease  in  fair value of \u20ac60 million was recognized as a reduction in equity, and \u20ac49 million was derecognized against the carrying amount of the acquired assets.\n\nDue to planned sales in U.S. dollars, BASF is exposed to foreign currency  risks,  which  are  partially  hedged  with  currency  options and designated in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship. The hedged  transaction  -  the  designated  share  of  expected  sales  in U.S.  dollars  -  is  calculated  based  on  internal  thresholds.  The hedged volume is always below the total amount of expected sales in  U.S.  dollars  for  the  following  fiscal  year.  The  average  hedged rate  was  $1.0863  per  euro  as  of  December  31,  2023,  and $1.0255  per  euro  in  the  previous  year.  The  impact  on  earnings from  designated  transactions  in  2023  will  be  recognized  in  the following year. The decrease in the options' time value component arising  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac9  million  in  2023  was  recognized separately  in  equity  as  the  cost  of  hedging  and  resulted  in  a reduction  in  equity.  Due  to  the  maturity  of  hedged  items, accumulated changes in the options' time values were reclassified as  a  reduction  in  earnings  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac12  million.  In  the previous  year,  \u20ac8  million  was  recognized  as  a  change  in  the options'  time  value  component,  thereby  reducing  equity;  and \u20ac9 million w as reclassified as a reduction in earnings.\n\nBASF  SE's  fixed-rate  U.S.  private  placement  of  $1.25  billion, issued  in  2013,  was  converted  to  euros  using  cross-currency swaps,  as  the  private  placement  exposes  BASF  to  a  combined interest  rate  and  currency  risk.  BASF  is  also  exposed  to  a combined interest rate and currency risk associated with the issue of  several  tranches  of  a  fixed-interest  U.S.  private  placement  it committed to for 2024. The resulting currency risks were hedged with currency swaps in 2023. These hedges were designated as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncash flow hedges. No ineffectiveness was recognized in 2023 or 2022. The hedged interest rate was 3.66% in 2023 (2022: 3.12%). The hedged foreign exchange rate was $1.2052 per euro in 2023 (2022: $1.3589 per euro). For U.S. private placements hedged in 2023,  changes  in  value  in  the  forward  component  totaling \u20ac14 million were recognized separately in equity as hedging costs in 2023, leading to an increase in equity.\n\nFurthermore, BASF was exposed to foreign currency risks in 2023 through  U.S.  dollar-denominated  commercial  paper.  These  risks were  hedged  with  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  and designated  in  a  cash  flow  hedge  accounting  relationship.  The changes in  value  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac30  million  resulting  from  the change in the forward rate were recognized separately in equity as hedging costs, leading to an increase in equity (2022: \u20ac30 million). Because all underlying transactions and hedging instruments had expired by December 31, 2023, the amount of \u20ac30 million, which was  initially  recognized  in  equity,  was  reclassified  in  full  as  an increase in earnings (2022: \u20ac30  million). There was  no ineffectiveness at any time during the year.\n\nIn  connection  with  construction  of  the  new  Verbund  site  in Zhanjiang,  China,  BASF  is  exposed  to  foreign  currency  risks especially  from  expenditures  in  euros  that  were  hedged  with foreign  currency  forward  contracts  and  designated  in  cash  flow hedge  accounting  relationships.  The  hedged  exchange  rate  was \u00a57.5738 per euro in 2023. The expenditures in euros hedged with foreign currency forward contracts are firm commitments. In 2023, \u20ac3 million was derecognized from the cash flow hedge reserve and included in acquisition or production costs of property, plant and equipment. Hedging results are recognized in profit or loss upon depreciation of property, plant and equipment.",

Amounts  accumulated  in  the  cash  flow  hedge  reserve  for commodity  price  risks  are  derecognized  against  the  carrying amount of acquired  assets  once  the  hedged  transaction  occurs. Thus,  there  is  no  immediate  reclassification  of  the  amounts recognized  in  the  cash  flow  hedge  reserve  to  profit  or  loss  in thes e cas es.\n\n## 26 Capital structure management and statement of cash flows\n\n## 26.1 Capital structure management\n\nThe  aim  of  capital  structure  management  is  to  maintain  the financial  flexibility  needed  to  further  develop  BASF's  business portfolio  and  take  advantage  of  strategic  opportunities.  The objectives  of  the  company's  financing  policy  are  to  ensure solvency, limit financial risks and optimize the cost of capital.\n\nCapital structure management focuses on meeting the requirements needed to ensure unrestricted access to the capital market and a solid A rating. The capital structure is managed using selected  financial  ratios,  such  as  dynamic  debt  ratios,  as  part  of the company's financial planning.\n\nThe  equity  of  the  BASF  Group  as  reported  in  the  balance  sheet amounted  to  \u20ac36,646  million  as  of  December  31,  2023 (Decemb er 31, 2022: \u20ac40,923 million); the equity ratio was 47.3% on December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: 48.4%).\n\nBASF prefers to access external financing on the capital markets and,  when  advantageous,  via  bank  loans.  A  commercial  paper program  is  used  for  short-term  financing,  while  corporate  bonds are  used  for  financing  in  the  medium  and  long  term.  These  are issued in euros and other currencies with different maturities. The goal  is  to  create  a  balanced  maturity  profile,  achieve  a  diverse range  of  investors  and  optimize  BASF's  debt  capital  financing conditions.  Since  2020,  BASF  has  employed  green  corporate bonds  to  finance  the  development  of  sustainable  products  and projects with a clear environmental benefit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Income  tax  payments  from  ongoing business are also allocated to cash flows from operating activities. In the case of material transactions, however, these are reported in the corresponding section of the statement of cash flows.\n\nCash flows from financing activities include payments for leases in which BASF is lessee as well as dividend payments.\n\nOther  financing-related  liabilities primarily  comprise  liabilities from  accounts  used  for  cash  pooling  with  BASF  companies  not included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  They  are reported  in  miscellaneous  liabilities  within  the  balance  sheet  item other liabilities that qualify as financial instruments.\n\nAssets/liabilities  from  hedging  transactions included  in  cash flows from financing activities form part of the balance sheet items derivatives  with  positive  and  negative  fair  values  respectively  and include  only  those  transactions  which  hedge  risks  arising  from financial  indebtedness  and  financing-related  liabilities  secured  by micro hedges.\n\n- B For more information on receivables and miscellaneous assets, see Note 17 from page 275 onward For more information on liabilities, see Note 20 from page 280 onward For more information on the statement of cash flows, see the Combined Management's Report from page 70 onward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPayments  are  netted  in  cash  flows  from  investing  activities  and cash  flows  from  financing  activities  if  they  are  items  with  a  high turnover  rate,  represent  large  amounts  and  have  short-term maturities.\n\n## Explanation of the statement of cash flows\n\nTo improve the understanding and interpretation of the statement of  cash  flows,  the  presentation  of  cash  flows  from  operating activities was modified in the 2023 fiscal year.

In  the  previous  year,  these  amounted  to  \u20ac11,400  million.  The decline was mainly due to the lower additions of bonus provisions, currency effects, particularly from the U.S. dollar and the Argentine peso,  as  well  as  lower  pension  expenses.

The rise was primarily due to staff increases in  Asia  Pacific,  especially  for  the  new  Verbund  site  in  Zhanjiang, China. This was partially offset by retirements and departures due to  dormant  employment  as  well  as  measures  in  connection  with the cost savings program focusing on Europe.\n\nEmployees  of  joint  operations  are  included  in  the  number  of employees  relative  to  BASF's  share  in  the  company.

Moreover,  the  divestiture  of  the  kaolin  minerals business  as  of  Septemb er  30, 2022,  and  the  suspension  of business activities in Russia in the previous year had an offsetting impact.\n\n- B For more information on acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 from page 240 onward\n\nOn  average,  1,202  employees  worked  at  joint  operations  (2022: 1,188 employees).\n\n28\n\n## Share price-based compensation programs and BASF incentive share program\n\n## Share price-based compensation programs\n\nThe BASF Group's share price-based compensation programs, or long-term  incentive  (LTI)  programs,  are  cash-settled  programs.  If vested, the cash-settlement obligation is measured at fair value on every balance sheet date and recognized as a provision.\n\nIn 2023, the BASF Group continued offering its share price-based compensation program (LTI program), known as Strive!, which was launched in 2020. The share price-based compensation program known as 'BOP' (BASF Option Program), which had existed since 1999,  was  offered  for  the  last  time  in  2020.  All  option  rights granted during the BOP program years remain valid until the end of their respective exercise periods.\n\nGenerally,  members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  and  all senior executives are entitled to participate in the LTI programs.\n\n## Strive!\n\nStrive!  is  based  on  a  performance  share  plan  and  takes  into account the achievement of strategic goals and the development of  the  BASF  share  and  dividend  (total  shareholder  return)  over  a period of four years.\n\nParticipation  in  Strive!  is  voluntary  for  senior  executives  and  is linked  to  a  share  ownership  obligation.  Strive!  offers  rolling eligibility, without a deadline for participation. In 2023, 684 people were eligible to participate in Strive!. About 93% of eligible senior executives  and  Members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors participated.  Unlike  for  senior  executives,  participation  is  not voluntary for the members of the Board of Executive Directors and is  outlined  in  their  service  contracts.  The  same  plan  conditions generally apply to members of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Strive! plan includes a four-year performance period with a fixed disbursement  date.  A  target  amount  is  determined  at  the beginning of each new Strive! plan for every participant. This target amount  is  converted  into  a  preliminary  number  of  virtual performance share units (PSUs) by dividing it by the average BASF share price in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The number of PSUs that are ultimately paid out at the end of the performance periods depends on the achievement of the three strategic targets: growth (volume growth compared with global chemical production), profitability  (increase  in  EBITDA  before  special  items) and sustainability (CO 2 emissions).\n\nAchievement of each strategic target is calculated for each year of the  four-year  performance  period.  Upon  conclusion  of  the performance period, the average degree of target achievement for each strategic goal is equal to the arithmetic mean of the degrees of  target  achievement  for  the  four  years.  The  total  target achievement for the respective Strive! plan is determined by adding the target achievement degree for the three strategic targets after having multiplied each by the corresponding weighting factor. To calculate the final number  of  PSUs,  this  weighted  target achievement is multiplied by the preliminary number of PSUs. The payment  amount  upon  conclusion  of  the  four-year  performance period is calculated by multiplying the final number of PSUs by the average BASF share price for the fourth quarter of the last year of the performance period, plus the accumulated dividend payments in the four fiscal years. The payment occurs in May of the following year and is capped at 200% of the target amount. The payment amount  therefore  not  only  reflects  achievement  of  the  strategic targets,  but  performance  of  BASF's  dividend  and  share  price as w ell.",

Participants  are  required  to  own  BASF shares  amounting  to  a  predetermined  percentage  of  their  base salary for the duration of the performance period. A set-up phase applies  to  first-time  participants.  During  this  period,  they  are\n\nrequired  to  hold  a  percentage  of  shares  as  their  predetermined personal  investment.  The  set-up  phase  for  the  2023  Strive! program ends on December 31, 2026. The 2023 Strive! program has  the  same  fundamental  structure  as  the  Strive!  programs  in previous years.\n\n## Fair value of PSUs and parameters used as of Decembe r 31, 2023\n\n## Strive! program of the year\n\n|                                        |    | 2023      | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|----------------------------------------|----|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Number of PSUs granted                 |    | 1,106,496 | 763,140 | 746,244 | 625,033 |\n| Number of PSUs vested                  |    | 276,624   | 381,570 | 559,683 | 625,033 |\n| Fair value including fluctuation / PSU | \u20ac  | 43.25     | 40.50   | 69.57   | 68.69   |\n| Fair value excluding fluctuation / PSU | \u20ac  | 48.88     | 43.94   | 72.47   | 68.69   |\n| Weighted target achievement            | %  | 100.00    | 79.91   | 126.42  | 119.80  |\n| Base price                             | \u20ac  | 46.45     | 61.82   | 57.15   | 67.85   |\n\nPSUs  vested  by  the  deadline  were  measured  at  fair  value.  Fair value is determined based on the BASF share price of \u20ac48.78 on the  balance  sheet  date  plus  expected  dividend  payments  during the  term  of  the  program  and  taking  into  account  the  weighted target achievement rate of the respective Strive! plan. A fluctuation rate of 4% is assumed for the fair value of senior executives' PSUs.\n\nThe  LTI  provision  for  Strive!  rose  from  \u20ac71  million  as  of Decemb er 31,  2022,  to  \u20ac118  million  as  of  December  31,  2023, due to the increased number of vested PSUs. The expense from the  addition  of  provisions  totaled  \u20ac47  million  in  2023  and \u20ac23 million in 2022. On the basis of preliminary degrees of target achievement, a payment amount of \u20ac43 million was recognized in current provisions for the fully vested 2020 program year.\n\n## BASF Option Program (BOP)\n\nThe 'BOP' LTI program last offered in 2020, grants virtual option rights. When exercised, the option rights are settled in cash.\n\nParticipation  in  BOP  was  voluntary.  In  order  to  take  part  in  the program,  a  participant  had  to  make  a  personal  investment:\n\nParticipants  were  required  to  hold  BASF  shares  representing between 10% and 30% of their respective variable compensation for  a  two-year  period  from  the  granting  of  the  option  (holding period). The number of shares to be held was determined by the amount  of  variable  compensation  and  the  volume-weighted average  share  price  on  the  first  trading  day  after  the  Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nParticipants  received  four  option  rights  per  invested  share.  Each option  consists  of  two  parts,  right  A  and  right  B,  which  may  be exercised  if  defined  thresholds  have  been  met:  The  threshold  of right A is met if the price of the BASF share has increased by more than 30% in comparison with the base price on the option grant date  (absolute  threshold).  The  value  of  right  A  is  the  difference between  the  market  price  of  BASF  shares  on  the  exercise  date and the base price; it is limited to 100% of the base price. Right B may be exercised (relative threshold) if the cumulative percentage performance of BASF shares exceeds the percentage performance  of  the  MSCI  World  Chemicals  IndexSM  (MSCI Chemicals).  The  value  of  right  B  is  the  base  price  of  the  option multiplied  by  twice  the  percentage  by  which  the  BASF  share outperforms the MSCI Chemicals Index on the exercise date. It is\n\nlimited  to  the  closing  price  on  the  date  of  exercise  less  the calculated nominal value of the BASF share. Right B may only be exercised if the price of the BASF share equals at least the base price. When a two-year vesting period is over, options granted can be exercised until the end of the respective exercise period. When a  two-year  vesting  period  is  over,  options  granted  can  be exercised  until  the  end  of  the  respective  exercise  period.  During the exercise period, there are certain times (closed periods) during which the options may not be exercised. Each option can only be exercised in full, and one of the thresholds must be exceeded. If the other threshold is not exceeded, the other option right lapses. A participant's maximum gain from exercising an option is limited to  five  times  the  original  individual  investment.  Option  rights  are nontransferable  and  are  forfeited  if  the  option  holders  no  longer work  for  the  BASF  Group  or  have  sold  part  of  their  individual investment before the expiry of the two-year vesting period. They remain  valid  in  the  case  of  retirement.  For  the  members  of  the Board  of  Executive  Directors,  the  long-term  orientation  of  the program  has  been  strengthened  significantly  compared  with  the conditions  applying  to  the  other  participants.  Members  of  the Board  of  Executive  Directors  were  required  to  participate  in  the BOP  program  with  at  least  10%  of  their  actual  annual  variable\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "compensation. In view of this binding personal investment (in the form  of  BASF  shares),  an  extended  holding  period  of  four  years applies.  Members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  may  only exercise their option rights four years after they have been granted at the earliest (vesting period).\n\nAs a result of a resolution by the Board of Executive Directors in 2002 to settle  option  rights  in  cash,  all  outstanding  option  rights under the 2016 to 2020 programs were valued at fair value as of December 31, 2023. A proportionate provision was recognized for programs in the vesting period.\n\nThe  number  of  outstanding  options  declined  from  9,328,238  in 2022 to 7,731,844 in 2023, due mainly to the expiration of options from the 2015 BOP program.\n\nThe exercisable options had no intrinsic value as of Decemb er 31, 2023, or Decemb er 31, 2022.\n\nThe models used in the valuation of the option plans are based on the arbitrage-free valuation model according to Black-Scholes. The fair values of the options are determined using the binomial model. Volatility  is  determined on the basis of the monthly closing prices over a historical period corresponding to the remaining term of the options.\n\nThe  LTI  provision  for  BOP  decreased  from  \u20ac64  million  as  of December 31, 2022, to \u20ac50 million as of December 31, 2023, due to  lower  fair  values  and  a  lower  number  of  outstanding  option rights. In 2022, the amount of \u20ac1 million was utilized due to senior executives  leaving  the  company,  whereas  in  2023,  less  than \u20ac1 million  was  utilized  due  to  senior  executives  leaving  the company.  Income  from  the  reduction  in  provisions  totaled \u20ac13 million in 2023 and \u20ac46 million in 2022.\n\n## BASF 'Plus' Incentive Share Program\n\nThe 'plus' incentive share program was introduced in 1999 and is currently  available  to  employees  in  Germany,  other  European countries and Mexico. Simultaneous participation in both the 'plus' program and an LTI program is not permitted.\n\nEmployees  who  participate  in  BASF's  'plus'  incentive  share program  and  acquire  shares  in  BASF  as  a  personal  investment from  their  variable  compensation.  For  every  10  BASF  shares purchased in the program, a participant receives one BASF share at  no  cost  after  one,  three,  five,  seven  and  10  years  of  holding these shares. As a rule, the first  and  second  block  of  10  shares entitles the participant to receive one BASF share at no extra cost in each of the next 10 years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe right to receive free BASF shares lapses if a participant sells the  individual  investment  in  BASF  shares,  if  the  participant  stops working  for  a  Group  company  or  one  year  after  retirement.  The number of free shares to be granted has developed as follows:\n\n## Number of free shares to be granted\n\nShares\n\n|                             | 2023      | 2022       |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|------------|\n| As of January 1             | 2,497,355 | 3,079,123  |\n| Newly acquired entitlements | 1,239,700 | 1,239,700  |\n| Bonus shares issued         | -665,428  | -478,925   |\n| Lapsed entitlements         | 849,211   | -1,342,543 |\n| As of December 31           | 3,920,838 | 2,497,355  |\n\nThe free shares to be provided by the company are measured at the  fair  value  on  the  grant  date.  Fair  value  is  determined  on  the basis  of  the  BASF  share  price,  taking  into  account  the  present value  of  dividends,  which  are  not  paid  during  the  term  of  the program.  The  weighted-average  fair  value  on  the  grant  date amounted  to  \u20ac45.88  for  the  2023  program,  and  \u20ac47.74  for  the 2022 program.\n\nThe fair value of the free shares to be granted is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in capital reserves over the term of the program.\n\nPersonnel  expenses  for  BASF's  'plus'  incentive  share  program totaled \u20ac26 million in 2023 and \u20ac20 million in 2022.",

A factor known as the global warming potential (GWP) shows the impact of the individual gases compared with CO2 as the reference value.\n\nD\n\n## Differentiated Steering\n\nIn order to increase the competitiveness of its businesses, BASF is introducing a set of measures. These include the introduction of new  financial  steering  indicators  tailored  to  each  business. Additionally, our business areas are continuing to adjust their specific business models and processes, supported by adapted process structures, IT systems and governance frameworks.\n\nE\n\n## Eco-Efficiency Analysis\n\nThe Eco-Efficiency Analysis is a method developed by BASF for assessing the economic and environmental aspects of products and processes. The aim is to compare products with regard to profitability and environmental compatibility.\n\nF\n\n## Formulation\n\nFormulation  describes  the  combination  of  one  or  more  active substances with excipients like emulsifiers, stabilizers and other inactive  components  in  order  to  improve  the  applicability  and effectiveness of various products, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, paints and coatings.\n\nG\n\n## Genome editing\n\nGenome editing refers to a series of new molecular biological methods  to  make  specific  changes  in  the  genome.  Naturally occurring  processes  are  used  to  make  small  changes  to  an\n\norganism's  genes  to  modify  a  specific  characteristic.  Such techniques  have  great  potential  for  innovative  solutions  in healthcare, agriculture and industrial applications, for example.\n\nP\n\n## Peak sales potential\n\nThe  peak  sales  potential  of  the  Agricultural  Solutions  pipeline describes the total peak sales forecast for individual products in the research and development pipeline. Peak sales are the highest sales value  to  be  expected  from  one  year.  The  pipeline  comprises innovative products that have been on the market since 2023 or will be launched on the market by 2033.\n\nS\n\n## SEEbalance \u00ae\n\nSEEbalance \u00ae is  the  Socio-Eco-Efficiency  analysis  developed  by BASF. It can be used to evaluate and compare the environmental impact, costs and social aspects of products and manufacturing processes. SEEbalance \u00ae makes sustainable development measurable and manageable for companies by combining the three dimensions of sustainability - economy, environment and society - in an integrated product assessment tool.\n\n## Steam cracker\n\nA steam cracker is a plant in which steam is used to 'crack' naphtha (petroleum) or natural gas. The resulting petrochemicals are the raw materials used to produce most of BASF's products.\n\nT\n\n## Traits\n\nTraits are commercial plant characteristics, such as an inherent resistance to certain herbicides or an inherent defense against certain insects.\n\nV\n\n## Value Chain\n\nA  value  chain  describes  the  successive  steps  in  a  production process: from raw materials through various intermediate steps, such as transportation and production, to the finished product.\n\na\n\nTrademarks\n\n## Responsible Care \u00ae\n\nRegistered trademark of the European Chemical Industry Council\n\n## Sodium-sulfur batteries (NAS \u00ae batteries)\n\nRegistered trademark of NGK INSULATORS LTD.\n\n## Operation Clean Sweep \u00ae\n\nRegistered  trademark  of  OCS  from  the  Plastics  Industry Association  (PLASTICS)  and  the  Plastics  Division  of  the American Chemistry Council (ACC)\n\nAll other trademarks referred to in the BASF Report are registered trademarks of the BASF Group (identified with the \u00ae symbol), trademarks pending (identified with the TM symbol), or trademarks used by the BASF Group.\n\n- a Trademarks are not registered/used in all countries.\n\n## Image Sources\n\nPage 23:\n\nShutterstock: close-up of soybeans\n\nPage 90:\n\nGetty Images: multiwell plate with samples\n\nPage 123:\n\nGetty Images: moringa\n\nPage 149:\n\nGetty & Thinkstock: drone over farmland\n\n<!-- image -->",
