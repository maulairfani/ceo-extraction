Lazaro for his stewardship over the past year and acknowledge the commitment and dedication of our teams in navigating a challenging landscape and delivering at pace.\n\nIt is an honor and a privilege for me to serve as your chairman. Our company's shared sense of purpose, focus on customer centricity and passion for excellence are among the core values I consider as powerful strengths and differentiators.\n\n## Better than Expected\n\nThe global economy in 2023 grew better than expected at 3.1% amidst the headwinds of slower growth in more advanced countries, the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the higher costs of living. The global electronics manufacturing services industry was up by approximately 5%, driven by increased demand in the electric vehicle ecosystem and the requirement for more digitalization in the industrial space.\n\nIMI was able to capture an increased market share in these key areas as the company leveraged its experience in manufacturing high-reliability products that also utilized the company's capabilities in power electronics.\n\nWith the easing of inflation, global demand slowly increased, resulting in pockets of electronics component shortages that lingered for particular items. Generally, the electronics industry was still in contraction mode with the Purchasing Managers' Index ending the year below 50 basis points. Inventory destocking efforts muted new order volumes as manufacturers served a portion of the increased demand from existing supplies. Moving forward, we expect conditions to improve as the supply of in-demand components catches up, and customers start the year with leaner levels of inventory.\n\nThrough deeper collaboration with major partners to address the uncertainties of the supply chain and the operating landscape, the core businesses of IMI have managed to stay profitable for the past three years. However, overall margins were weighed down by the operating results of its non-wholly owned subsidiary group. This prompted IMI to sell its shares in STI Enterprises Limited to focus on priority markets in the mobility and industrial space.\n\nThe divestment has allowed IMI management teams to concentrate their efforts and resources towards the company's target markets like electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems, and smart energy applications. Moreover, the core businesses of the company also sustained the recovery from the previous year with margins further improved by better manufacturing efficiency and restructured overhead costs.\n\n## Chief Executive Succession\n\nAs announced on February 13, 2024, Arthur Tan is retiring after 22 years as CEO of IMI. Art has made invaluable contributions to the business, having successfully led IMI through the global financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic, among other turbulent periods in the industry. He transformed the company from a contract manufacturer to one of the world's 25 largest EMS providers and among the top 10 suppliers to the automotive electronics industry. On behalf of the Board and everyone at IMI, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for the leadership and the distinguished service that he has provided over the years.\n\nAhead of Art's retirement, a rigorous succession process for the selection of the company's next CEO was conducted. Following careful consideration, Lou Hughes was nominated to succeed Arthur Tan effective May 1, 2024. The\n\nBoard recognized Lou and his several years of experience in the industry, depth of experience in sales, engineering, sourcing, and operations, and a broad range of executive duties for both private and publicly listed EMS companies as key attributes suited to the role and IMI's medium- to long-term objectives.\n\nI look forward to working with my colleagues on the Board in supporting IMI through this transition process and helping Lou as he takes on the reins in leading IMI to its next chapter.\n\n## A Vision with Clear Priorities\n\nToday is an excellent time to take stock of the progress made over the past decades and the actions needed for IMI to return to better profitability. As we face a dynamic market environment, we will double down on our core expertise within our automotive and industrial capabilities. We will continue to build on our reputation within niche areas and carve inroads in emerging sub-segments that highlight our focus in the electrification of vehicles, intelligent machines, and their ecosystems. We remain aligned with our purpose of innovating production solutions for our customers, contributing to the development of the electronics industry, and playing a responsible role in shaping a future that improves the world.\n\nLastly, we would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support and unwavering trust in the management team. We are optimistic of what is ahead as we all work together in creating the future, today.\n\nThank you.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With teamwork, we faced the momentous task of building the company into one of the largest players in the industry. We shaped IMI into a thriving organization serving the most respected and recognized brands around the globe.\n\nThis journey is a testament to our unique areas of expertise and approach, with the focus of our high-performing teams. And I stand today with an immense sense of pride for everything we have achieved and the path forward that we have laid for the company.\n\n## A long-term advantage\n\nWhile there is much work to be done, the business is on solid footing with the right resources in the right places, benefiting from our early actions in the last decade. Despite a challenging year in 2023 with still raised levels of costs of inputs and geopolitical issues holding back global supply chains, IMI continued to bring in business with a total sales of $1.3 billion. With our capabilities, certifications, and management approach which remain as a key strategic advantage and longterm value driver, IMI won new projects that have an annual revenue potential of $291 million, mostly in the mobility and industrial segments.\n\nStill, staying the course requires a constant evolution given the trends in our business. In October 2023, we completed the divestment of STI Enterprises Limited, a UK-based subsidiary offering electronics design and manufacturing solutions to aerospace, security, and defense customers. This transaction allowed our leadership to refine and execute our strategy as well as allocate capital to our priority markets.\n\n## Beyond compliance\n\nOn a broader level, I would also highlight the greater emphasis we are placing on sustainability. In 2022, we aligned our direction with our parent company, Ayala Corporation, towards a net zero carbon target by 2050. In 2023, we have committed to reducing 50% of our carbon (emission) intensity in Scopes 1 and 2 by 2030, and 25% in Scope 3 by the same year. To ensure accuracy and transparency, we have engaged a third-party consultant to validate our emission numbers. To date, 14 of our top 20 customers have current ESG engagements which include separate sustainability audits, net zero commitments, and sustainable procurement. By the end of 2023, the combined revenues of all our customers engaged in ESG activities is at $737 million, or 66% of our total core revenues.\n\nWe are also furthering our efforts to drive sustainability in the value chain through our total quality management approach and proactive risk-based thinking. With a total savings of $3.6 million from Kaizen Projects from our IMI Production System,\n\nwe continue to display increased global participation in our quality journey. We have also ensured that our 150 top suppliers are compliant with IMI's code of conduct, as they all signed the commitment aligned with our ESG objectives. At the same time, we continue to introduce a range of initiatives to support our people in different ways, such as the enhancement of our own IMI culture, increased training opportunities for employees and continuous review of corporate rewards and benefits. This has resulted in a high total employee engagement score of 89% for the year.\n\nAs IMI embarks on the next chapter, I have no doubt that it will follow the right path, doing right by our all stakeholders: our shareholders, employees, customers, vendor partners, and the environment.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nOn February 13, the Board announced that Lou Hughes had been nominated to succeed me as CEO. While this presents a significant transition for the company, at its core, IMI has always embraced change. It is a key guiding principle that has steered us to greater horizons.\n\nOn a personal note, I would like to thank all of you for the trust and mutual respect we have shared over the years. Along the way, I have been blessed with friendship, compassion, kindness, and patience from everyone.\n\nTo my IMI associates, it has been a tremendous honor to serve you. Of all our achievements, I have always been most proud of the IMI culture that we have established and nurtured, and I will miss it greatly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo our customers, it has been an honor and a privilege working with you, and I am incredibly grateful for the relationship we have built over the years. My most sincere gratitude for the trust and support you have extended to me and IMI.\n\nTo our shareholders and all our stakeholders, thank you for your engagement and the role that you have played in our efforts throughout my tenure as CEO. I hope that you are as proud as I am of what we have accomplished and also looking forward to what is to come.\n\nThank you to everyone who has shared this vision of IMI that continues to be a catalyst for enabling all these wonderful products to change our lives and make the world a better place to live.\n\nMy achievement extends beyond the financial performance of the company, but to the thousands of lives we have been able to touch.  For every employee who has been able to send their children to school, to have a place to call home, to be able to better their lives-these are what I look back on as the proudest achievements I have been blessed to be a part of.  May the next generation of IMI leadership never forget why we continue to drive IMI into the future.\n\nTO ALL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOD BLESS!\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## ' ...our customers see us as a key partner in the growth and development of their businesses.'\n\nOne of IMI's key competitive advantages in the past decade has been our strategic geographic positioning, which enables us to address the needs of global players in the electronics space.\n\n## Our year in review\n\nThe global electronics market has been through a period of significant change and uncertainty in the last four years. Many factors have caused this change but most of them involved challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the electronics component shortage, and their lingering effects on the industry. The year 2023 showed continued normalization in the supply chain recovery that started in the previous year as well as the easing of global inflation. Geopolitical conflicts and the general slowdown of the global economy, however, are headwinds that we believe will hinder the path to a strong recovery.\n\nTo proactively address the challenges, we focused on driving margin expansion mainly from assertive price negotiations with customers the continuous productivity improvements in manufacturing operations, which enabled improved utilization of fixed overhead, and the reduction of direct material costs through the normalization of the global supply chain. A more global and rigorous supervision of our supply chain management helped ensure the allocation of restricted components among our manufacturing sites, which mitigated shortfalls and delays in the delivery of finished goods to our customers. We also made certain that our approach was aligned with the increasing regionalization of sourcing that continues to drive lower levels of freight expenses.\n\nWe believe these actions also allowed us to be in a better position to secure new business wins over the past several years, with US$291 million of annual revenue potential wins in 2023 largely coming from our target sectors in the mobility and industrial markets.\n\nWith more than 12,000 people in 21 manufacturing plants across nine countries, labor management was a key challenge for us this year. One of IMI's key competitive advantages in the past decade has been our strategic geographic positioning, which enables us to address the needs of global players in the electronics space. However, given the current industry landscape, the regions we operate in have also become pivotal technology hubs, driving extremely competitive labor environments in Europe and North America.\n\nThe global economic slowdown and our customers' focus on depleting excess inventory presented another challenge. This inventory correction stemmed from inflated levels during the electronics component shortage when increased ordering was necessary to secure parts. Due to the unstable market in recent years that led to industry-wide backlogs, we focused on managing our inventory levels.\n\nWe are thankful that our customers see us not only as a supplier but as a key partner in the growth and development of their businesses. Such a strong relationship afforded us to share some of the burden of the overall weak market by renegotiating prices and commercial terms to ensure business relationships that settle on a healthy middle ground. This allowed our wholly owned core subsidiaries to further develop the turnaround that started in 2022. While revenue levels were maintained, operating margins improved through better manufacturing efficiency and enhanced utilization of our restructured overhead costs.\n\nIt is still too early to draw firm conclusions on whether such an environment will persist longer than expected, but we continuously examine and closely monitor our business for the markets\n\nahead. For one, we started to specialize in areas where we have a competitive advantage. In October 2023, we sold IMI's 80% share of its subsidiary STI Enterprises Limited to Rcapital, a private investment firm based in London with a portfolio of UK-based companies as well as a precision engineering solution provider in the aerospace and defense sectors. The conclusion of this divestment allowed us to sharpen our capabilities and focus on driving growth and profitability in our core segments: the mobility and industrial markets, fueled by interconnectivity and the electrification of vehicles which are driving the technology megatrends of the future.\n\n## Financial review\n\nIMI ended the year with total revenues of US$1.3 billion. The 6% decrease versus the previous year is driven by factors attributable to its non-wholly owned subsidiary group, including the shorter fiscal year of STI Enterprises Limited which was divested on October 31, 2023. Gross profitability grew to 9.0%, an improvement of 121 basis points driven by renegotiated prices and the improved supply chain environment. Of the US$105.6 million net loss we booked, US$107.5 million is related\n\nFUTURE POSSIBILITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Automotive new business wins\n\nThis sector will be bolstered by our new business wins from the past three years as these projects ramp up, which include our manufacturing partnership with Zero EV motorcycles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto one-time losses that stemmed from the sale of STI and the impairment of goodwill and certain assets. Despite the slowdown in demand in the EMS market, our whollyowned subsidiaries posted financial results in line with 2022 figures. Sales levels were maintained, with a 0.4% improvement in contribution margins and net income improving by 14% to US$13 million.\n\nThe automotive segment, which includes mobility and camera, remained our largest segment with US$800 million in revenues representing 60% of total sales. This sector will be further bolstered by our new business wins from the past three years as these projects ramp up, which includes our manufacturing partnership with Zero EV motorcycles. We are also expanding the steering application program of one of our top customers with the next-generation models at IMI Mexico. There are also multiple EV-dedicated projects including HVAC systems that address the need for cabin heating in the absence of internal combustion engines in our European and Mexican facilities. IMI remains on\n\nthe cutting edge of mobility technology as products in advanced camera applications in LIDAR are being developed in partnership with one of the biggest tier 1 players in the industry. I am confident that by leveraging the experience we have built these past decades, we will continue to be a global leader in this space, helping develop safer and more sustainable mobility solutions for the world.\n\nThe industrial segment which ended the year with US$390 million in revenues, or a 29% share of IMI's total revenues is still anchored on our products in security solutions. Growth will be driven by increased demand for solutions that enable IoT and its many applications. We also continue to venture into energy management products with recently won projects in battery management systems that support the push for EVs and renewable energy. Industrial LED lighting likewise continues to grow with additional business secured in a sector that has historically been a profit leader in our portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## We remained agile and adaptive in our approach to maintaining the level of quality that we have always been known for.\n\n## Facing the headwinds\n\nThe component shortage that resulted from a variety of factors including supply chain disruptions and semiconductor manufacturing constraints brought about unique hurdles. Although such challenges impacted production schedules and posed logistical constraints for the industry, they also brought opportunities for innovation and collaboration that allowed us to manifest our resilience which we believe sets us apart from the competition.\n\nThroughout the year, we continued to prioritize the needs of our customers, building strong relationships based on trust, reliability, and mutual support. We remained agile and adaptive in our approach to maintaining the level of quality that we have always been known for. Our management teams spent time with both our clients and supplier partners to develop customer-centric solutions. We provided proactive support, anticipating potential challenges and disruptions of our customers. By embracing the principles of the IMI Production System or IPS, we have been able to take advantage of the associated benefits of global best practices such as the continuous improvement ideals of Kaizen and the efficiency of lean manufacturing. Despite our wide geographic footprint, the IPS ensures that each of our sites delivers consistent, reliable, and top-quality solutions for all our customers.\n\nWith direct materials costs close to 70% of our revenues, effective procurement\n\nstrategies are crucial in serving our customers and generating value for IMI. Our supply chain teams explored alternative sourcing options which expanded the company's supply chain base, allowing us to cope with customer order timelines and the rising cost of raw materials. We also dedicated resources to address the market's supply gap by implementing spot buy strategies while aiming to minimize additional expenses. By engaging in Design for Manufacturing, we maximized quality and flexibility through the co-designing of projects with strategic suppliers that enabled us to even exceed customer quality and efficiency expectations.\n\nWith our efficient commercial team who has nurtured deep-rooted partnerships with key players in the industry, we were able to renegotiate prices to align with the current market environment. Collections of approximately US$15 million were made in 2023 for unfavorable price variances that we had incurred during the height of the pandemic and the component shortage, helping recoup the expenses that had strained our financial results over the past three years. The improvements stretched beyond profitability, as inventory management was also a main focus across all departments. Significant recoveries amounting to approximately US$24 million were made in 2023 to address excess and obsolete materials, further strengthening our robust balance sheet. We also secured agreements for advanced deposits for raw material purchases, easing some of the pressure we face in this high-interest rate environment. We are confident that\n\nRECAP 2023\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total Revenues\n\n## $1.3B\n\n6% decrease from previous year driven by factors attributable to its non-wholly owned subsidiary group, including the shorter fiscal year of STI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCore net income Improved by 14%\n\n$13M\n\nLOOKING FORWARD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeveraging expertise to support the growing electric vehicles and automated driving industry\n\nthe improved credit terms with both customers and suppliers that were revised in 2023 will result in better cash flow generation for IMI in the years to come.\n\nIn the process, we have also kept our cost base under scrutiny and used the talent and resources that we have to maintain financial stability and competitiveness. Employee engagement is one of the main reasons this has been effective. At every level of the business, our employees are empowered and trained to identify opportunities that could increase our performance outcomes while maintaining our high-quality standards. Added to this, our talent development efforts such as cross-training programs have proven to be valuable in bringing new perspectives.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThe electrification of vehicles and the adoption of automated driving continue to be the key growth drivers in the electronics industry. With EVs relying heavily on electronic components for their engine, battery management, steering systems, and ADAS applications, we are bullish about leveraging the expertise we have built these past several years. The current and future demands for sophisticated power electronics systems also give us confidence in building our power module capabilities in the Philippines. We believe that IMI is ahead of the curve in this regard, helping push the boundaries of technological innovation to enable a safer, more sustainable future. The past years have seen an increased share in our new pipeline wins\n\nfor EV and PHEV dedicated applications. This year is no different, with a total of US$291 million of the annual revenue potential of new businesses secured across the whole group, $174 million of which came from the mobility segment while $106 million from industrial.\n\nAs market conditions appear to be promising, we shall continue to maximize our scale, expertise, and experience to improve our financial results. IMI management is bent on promoting Excellence, Accountability, and Collaboration in all facets of the company. These pillars are interconnected and mutually reinforcing the principles that we believe shall drive organizational success and enable us to achieve our goals of sustainable profitable growth.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank all our shareholders for your unwavering support for IMI. The past few years have not been easy, but I am glad that we remained united and are now starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I am also grateful to our more than 12,000 employees who have worked tirelessly to help us navigate through the headwinds. Without your hard work and dedication, none of our successes would have been possible.\n\nThank you.\n\nJerome S. Tan President\n\n<!-- image -->",

Alongside this, we are also firming up our social targets, focusing on employee health, safety, and a higher than average employee engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|         | 2022                                                                                                                    | 2023                                                                                                                 |    | 2024                                                                                                   |                          |         | 2025   |                                |    | 2030                                                                                         |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|--------|--------------------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ; ; ; ; | GHG reduction target by  2030 Net Zero 2050 Energy efficiency & PPA  initiatives IPS ESG Awards                         | ; IMI Scope 3 strategy  ; ESG awareness  initiatives (FC, Plastic  free week, etc) ; Sustainability Internal  Audits | \u0086 \u0086 \u0086 \u0086 ;    | SouthPole Project Science Based Target  Initiative (SBTi) Carbon Disclosure  Project (CDP)             | R B A                    | C o m p | \u0086 Validation  of carbon  emission  reduction  roadmap        | R B                            | \u0086 \u0086 \u0086    | 50% reduction in  Scope 1 & 2 GHG 25% reduction in  Scope 3 Green Energy  utilization \u2265 50 % |\n| ; ; ; ; | Firming up of social targets Training and certification of ESG Team IMI Global cascade workshops ESG KPI on BSC         | Firming up of social targets Training and certification of ESG Team IMI Global cascade workshops ESG KPI on BSC      | ;  | IMI COC full rollout   ESG Upskilling for  leaders Working hour  compliance                            | l i a nc e  A u d i t Pr | C o m p | \u0086 IMI-initiated  community  outreach  programs        | A C e r t i fi c a t i o n - 2 | \u0086 \u0086    | Healthy & safe work  environment Stakeholder  collaboration                                  |\n| ; ; ;   | IMI Sustainability table of  organization ESG organizational  alignment to business  strategies DNV 3rd party assurance | ; IMI Supplier Code of  Conduct ; IMI Supplier Audit  procedure ; Supplier engagement  workshops                     | \u0086 \u0086 \u0086 \u0086    | SEC new guidelines on  sustainability reporting IFRS RBA COC Version 8 Audit 20% of top IMI  Suppliers | e p a r a t i on         |         | \u0086 Sustainability  audits covering  20% of our top  150 suppliers        | 0 2 5                          | \u0086    | Ethical & sustainable  business practices  aligned with global  standards                    |\n\n## CARBON INTENSITY\n\nCarbon intensity in manufacturing refers to the amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions released per unit of production. It is a way to better measure how environmentally impactful the manufacturing process is. IMI will be using this metric in targeting reductions in CO 2 emissions by 2030.\n\n## ESG ENGAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATION\n\nOne of the most important elements in ensuring employee engagement is communicating the ESG objectives. Continuous training and onboarding, as well as an annual acknowledgment of the company's code of conduct, are required for all employees. We also ensure that we have materials for reference in the various networks we continue to engage with such as universities, government, industry associations, and other events and forums.\n\n## TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\n\nAs one of the top 25 EMS providers globally, IMI recognizes the critical role it plays in the transition to a low-carbon future. In 2021, we demonstrated our commitment to climate action by joining Ayala Corporation and its other subsidiaries in pledging Net Zero emissions by 2050. Additionally, we further strengthened our position by aligning with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to ensure transparency in our climate-related efforts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nDisclose the organization's governance around climaterelated risks and opportunities.\n\nDescribe the Board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.

The Manual outlines our company's vision, mission, and core values and reinforces accountability, ethical corporate behavior, fairness, and transparency. It is reviewed and updated to ensure consistency with internal policies, laws, and regulations.\n\nImportantly, we continuously look to external frameworks to better inform us of the evolving standards of responsibility and sustainability. From this perspective, we are compliant with the Code of Corporate Governance for Publicly-Listed Companies set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), except for the following deviations:\n\n## DEVIATIONS FROM THE COD E EXPLANATION\n\nExecutive remuneration not disclosed on an individual basis\n\nFor executive remuneration, only the aggregate remuneration of the top five highestpaid officers is disclosed for the protection and privacy of the individual officers.\n\nNotice of annual and special shareholders' meeting not sent at least 28 days before the meeting.\n\nIndependent director serving for a term of more than nine years\n\nThe 2023 definitive information statement was distributed to stockholders on March 27, 2023, at least 25 calendar days before the annual stockholders' meeting on April 20, 2023, in compliance with SEC's required timeline of at least 21 calendar days before the date of the annual stockholders' meeting.\n\nAs discussed in the 2023 definitive information statement, Messrs. Nishimura and Chua have served as independent directors for more than nine years. The corporate governance and nomination committee endorsed their nominations as independent directors notwithstanding the fact that if elected once again, their services as such will exceed the recommended nine-year term provided in the SEC corporate governance code for publicly-listed companies after taking into consideration their commitment and dedication in fulfilling their mandate and their invaluable contribution to board discussions with their expert insights and independent judgment. They were both duly elected by IMI's stockholders' during the 2023 annual stockholders meeting.\n\nSupporting this compliance is an attestation from the company's Chief Executive Officer, Compliance Officer, and  the Chief Audit Executive for 2023 on the adequacy of the company's system of internal controls, risk management, compliance, and governance processes. The Attestation is available at www.global-imi.com .\n\nAs we seek to improve our practices around processes and controls, we appreciate being consistently recognized for our work on corporate governance. In 2023, we were awarded a 4 Golden Arrow by the Institute of Corporate Directors (ICD) in relation to our 2022 performance based on the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard (ACGS), a globallybenchmarked scoring system designed for improving the corporate governance performance of publicly-listed companies from participating ASEAN countries. The ACGS was jointly developed by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to promote regional integration and the ASEAN region as an asset class. The 4-arrow recognition is given to companies that achieved a score between 110 to 119 points out of 130 points. We were named to the list of Golden Arrow awardees for three consecutive years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BOARD STRUCTURE AND PROCESS\n\nThe Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is the supreme authority in matters governing and overseeing our business. Within their authority under the Revised Corporation Code and other applicable laws and the By-laws of the company, the Directors, acting as a Board, have the fullest powers to regulate the concerns of the company according to their best judgment. They are responsible for promoting and adhering to the principles and best practices of corporate governance, to foster the long-term success of the company and to ensure sustained competitiveness in the global environment in a manner consistent with its fiduciary responsibility. The details of the Board's roles and responsibilities as formalized in its Charter are accessible on our company website.\n\nIn performing strategic oversight, the Board formulates and continuously reviews our vision, mission, strategic objectives, policies, and procedures that guide our activities, including the means\n\nto effectively monitor management's performance. To this end, the Board reviews the appropriateness of our vision and mission statement every year. Additionally, they oversee the development and approval of our business objectives and strategy, and monitor its implementation to sustain the company's longterm viability and strength.\n\nThe Board also reviews and affirms the adequacy of internal control mechanism and risk management practices, accuracy and reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the proper implementation of the company's Code of Conduct. This includes affirming the true and fair representation of the annual financial statements and adopting an effective succession planning programs for directors, key officers, and management.\n\nIn 2021, we became a supporter to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, which means we commit to increasing\n\ntransparency through adopting and reporting consistent disclosure of relevant information on our climate-related risks and opportunities. To carry on this commitment, the Board responsibility extends to managing the risks and opportunities associated with natural resources and climate change, and we continue to develop our understanding and integrate our learnings into our business operations.\n\nIn line with our corporate goals, we participate in governance summits and internal councils, as part of Ayala Corporation's (Ayala Corp) oversight controls to put management decisions in check and ensure that we conform to regulatory requirements and global best practices. IMI is also part of Ayala Corp's sustainability council, keeping us abreast of current sustainability matters concerning Ayala Corp as well as learning from shared experiences, which is crucial particularly as sustainability and climate change are developing subject areas with research and practical guidance constantly being produced.\n\nW\n\nE\n\nI\n\nV\n\nER\n\nV\n\nO",

These include safety electronics in cars, automotive camera, and airbag control to help prevent road accidents, pollution reduction systems to help care for our environment, theft prevention systems for homes and buildings, and medical diagnostic devices.'\n\n## Board Composition\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee to review and monitor the structure, size and composition of the Board and ensure the appropriate mix of competencies of directors that are aligned with the company's vision, mission, and strategic objectives. The Board is composed of eleven (11) members who are elected individually by stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting and shall hold office for one year until their successors are elected in the next annual meeting. Majority of the directors have no executive responsibility and do not perform any work related to the operations (Non-Executive Directors). Among the board members are three independent non-executive directors.\n\n## Board Diversity Policy\n\nIMI's board diversity policy encourages the selection of an appropriate mix of competent directors, each of whom can add value and independent judgment in the formulation of sound corporate strategies and policies. Diversity includes business experience, age, gender, and ethnicity.  By 2025, the Board will strive to be at least 30 percent or two (2) female directors whichever is lower as stated in its board diversity policy with respect to gender.\n\n## Lead Independent Director\n\nIn 2023, Mr. Edgar O. Chua was appointed Lead Independent Director by the Board.

Chua, Hiroshi Nishimura, and Sherisa P. Nuesa.\n\nIndependent directors, apart from their fees and shareholdings, hold no interests or relationship with the company that may hinder their independence from the company, management, or shareholder which could, or could reasonably perceived to, materially interfere with his exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities as a Director of the company.\n\n## BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nThe Board created six committees as it may deem necessary to support in the performance of its functions in accordance with the By-Laws, Corporate Governance Manual, and Board Charter of the Corporation and to aid in good governance. The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to each of these Committees and these Committees had been formed and are guided by their respective committee charters which are available in the Company's official website.\n\n## Executive Committee\n\nThe Executive Committee, in accordance with the authority granted by the Board, or during the absence of the Board, shall act by majority vote of all its members on such specific matters within the competence of the Board of Directors as may from time to time be delegated to the Executive Committee in accordance with the Corporation's By-Laws, subject to the limitations provided by the Revised Corporation Code.\n\n## Finance Committee\n\nThe Finance Committee oversees the company's financial risk management, including the company's capital structure strategies, mergers, acquisitions and other strategic investments, as well as divestitures of any material operations of the Company, and make appropriate recommendations to the Board of Directors.

Nishimura and Chua served the recommended nine-year term for independent directors (reckoned from 2012). The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee endorsed their nominations as independent directors notwithstanding the fact that if elected once again, their services as such will exceed the recommended nine-year term provided in the SEC Corporate Governance Code for PubliclyListed Companies after taking into consideration their commitment and dedication in fulfilling their mandate and their invaluable contribution to Board discussions with their expert insights and independent judgment. They are both elected by IMI's stockholders during the 2023 annual stockholders meeting.

As provided in the company's By-Laws, the presence of at least two-thirds of the number of directors, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of corporate business.\n\nAll members of the board, including independent directors, are expected to attend and actively participate in all of the Board, Committee and Shareholders in person or remote communication,\n\n## Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee\n\nThe Committee reviews and monitors the structure, size, and composition of the Board and makes recommendations to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations as well as the Corporation's By-Laws, Board Charter and Corporate Governance Manual. The Committee also assesses the company's needs to identify the best mix of competencies of directors that would be aligned with the company's vision, mission and strategic objectives; Identifies, reviews and evaluates the qualifications and disqualifications, skills, and abilities that would result in a proper mix of competent Directors, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and President; for this purpose, the Committee may make use of professional search firms or other external sources of candidates to search for qualified candidates to the Board; Develops, updates, and recommends to the Board policies for considering nominees for Directors to ensure that all nominations to the Board are fair and transparent; Assesses the effectiveness of the Board's processes and procedures in the election or replacement, and recommends and reviews succession plans for members of the Board, including for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and President; Oversees the implementation of the corporate governance framework and periodically reviews the said framework; Adopts corporate governance policies and ensures that these are reviewed and updated regularly, and consistently implemented in form and substance.\n\n## Audit and Risk Committee\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is expected, through the provision of checks and balances, to bring positive results in supervising and supporting the management of the Corporation. The Committee, through the Global Internal Audit (GIA) department of the company, monitors and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the corporation's internal control system, integrity of financial reporting, and security of physical and information assets.

However, the absence of an independent director shall not affect the quorum requirement if he is duly notified of the meeting.\n\n## Related Party Transaction Committee\n\nThe Committee was assigned by the Board to review all material RPTs for endorsement to the Board to ensure that these are at arm's length, the terms are fair, and they will inure to the best interest of the company and its subsidiaries or affiliates and their shareholders.

As such, the Board engages in an annual process of self-assessment and evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees, the individual members, the CEO and the President to measure the effectiveness of the company's governance practices and identify areas for improvement, and to adopt new methodologies towards further strengthening the company's corporate governance standards. Every three years, an independent consultant is appointed to assist in the evaluation process of the Board. AON plc facilitated the 2023 board evaluation exercise.\n\nEach director was requested to complete a self-assessment form which included criteria such as: Part I: Board effectiveness; Part II: Committee effectiveness; Part III: Individual effectiveness; and Part IV: President and CEO effectiveness.\n\nThe board assessment survey resulted to a favorable overall perception on board effectiveness. The evaluation report also included relevant comments of the Board members that would help in enriching and improving board effectiveness to carry out its responsibilities.\n\n## Training of Directors\n\nPrior to assuming office, all new directors are required to undergo at a minimum an eight-hour orientation program on the company's business and corporate structure, vision and mission, corporate strategy, Articles, By-Laws and Corporate Governance Manual, Board and Committee Charters, and SEC-\n\nmandated topics on corporate governance and other relevant matters essential for the effective performance of their duties and responsibilities. This ensures that directors are equipped with the knowledge and skills required to perform their roles effectively.\n\nDirectors shall likewise attend at least once a year, a four-hour annual continuing training program involving courses on corporate governance matters relevant to the company. It is the responsibility of the Compliance Officer to ensure that each director has undergone the necessary trainings for the year.\n\nTrainings and seminars were administered by Institute of Corporate Directors, an accredited training provider of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAs part of the Board's commitment to climate governance, the board and management team attend annual integrated summits held by Ayala Corporation, which covers materials on climate action and sustainability.\n\nOn October 3, 2023, the Board's Agenda 2023: Ayala Integrated Corporate Governance, Risk Management, and Sustainability Summit was held which included sessions on Sustainability, Governance and Risk Management.\n\nPrior to this, the Integrated CG, RM and Sustainability Summit conducted by the Ayala Group in collaboration with the Institute of Corporate Directors (ICD) was held on October 18, 2022. These summits have been held since 2014 in an effort to supplement continuous education.\n\n## Corporate Governance Programs Attended in 2023\n\n| Director                                                                                         | Program                                                                                                                   | Training Institute                      | Date of Training                             |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Delfin L.

The external auditors are directly accountable to the Audit Committee in helping ensure the integrity of the company's financial statements and financial reporting process. Their responsibility is to assess and provide an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards and the overall quality of the financial reporting process. The Audit Committee oversees the work of the external auditors and ensures that they have unrestricted access to records, properties, and personnel to enable performance of the required audit.\n\nThe Committee meets with the external auditors without the presence of the management team to discuss any issues or concern. To ensure that the external auditor maintains the highest level of independence from the company, both in fact and appearance, the Audit Committee had approved all audit, audit-related, and permitted non-audit services rendered by the external auditor. Non-audit services expressly prohibited by regulations of the SEC were awarded to other audit firms to ensure that the company's external auditor carries out its work in an objective manner.\n\nDuring the Annual Stockholders' Meeting last April 20, 2023, the shareholders re-appointed Sycip, Gorres, Velayo and Co. (SGV & Co.) as the company's external auditor for the year 2023, with Ms. Cyril Jasmin B. Valencia as the lead engagement partner. The audit partner principally handling the company's account is rotated every five years in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.\n\nThe aggregate fees billed for the current year and each of the last two years for professional services rendered by SGV & Co.:\n\n|                               |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Audit and Audit-related fees* |   5.32 |   5.43 |   4.65 |\n| All other fees**              |   1.02 |   0.13 |   0.06 |\n| TOTAL                         |   6.34 |   5.56 |   4.71 |\n\n## In PMillions\n\n*\n\nAudit and Audit-Related Fees. This category includes the audit of annual financial statements and services that are normally provided by the independent auditor in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those calendar years, including the review of the audit work of the other independent auditors and any additional scope identified during the course of the audit. The fees are exclusive of out-of-pocket expenses incidental to the independent auditors' work.\n\n- ** All Other Fees. This category includes other services rendered by SGV & Co. such as agreed-upon procedures, validation of votes during Annual Stockholders' meetings and integrated report assurance requirements.\n\n## GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT\n\nGlobal Internal Audit (GIA) serves as a vital support in the effective discharge of the Board of Directors' Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) oversight role and responsibilities. Its main role is to undertake independent and systematic review of the system of internal controls, risk management, governance, and compliance, with the view to provide reasonable assurance that the system of internal control is adequate and continue to operate effectively in all material aspects.\n\nThrough its Chief Audit Executive, Lorlyn Arceo, GIA reports functionally to the Board's Audit and Risk Committee, with the operations governed by an Internal Audit Charter that is reviewed on an annual basis, presented to senior management, and approved by ARC and the Board, ensuring its independence and objectivity. Periodically, the Committee also meets the Chief Audit Executive without the presence of Management.\n\nGIA adopts the Institute of Internal Auditors' Three Lines Model to establish clear lines of defense against risks and promote accountability and collaboration, as well as to avoid duplication of efforts across different levels and functions within IMI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE\n\nX\n\nT\n\nE\n\nR\n\nN\n\nA\n\nL A\n\nS\n\nS\n\nU\n\nR\n\nA\n\nN\n\nC\n\nE P\n\nR\n\nOV\n\nI\n\nD\n\nE\n\nR\n\nS\n\nAyala Group Chief Audit Executives Forum: IMI's Chief Audit Executive Lorlyn Arceo (third from left) attended the forum together with other Chief Audit Executives from ACEN, Globe, Ayala Corporation, GCash, and ACI among other AC subsidiaries.\n\nThree Lines Model\n\nKey Activities\n\nOutcome\n\nR E G U L AT O R S",

There were also no cases of noncompliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to significant or material RPTs in the past three years.\n\n## POLICY ON INSIDER TRADING\n\nTo protect the shareholders of the company, all directors, officers, consultants and employees, including their immediate family members living in the same household, who may have knowledge of material non-public information about the company are strictly prohibited from trading IMI shares during the trading blackout period.\n\nIMI updated its Insider Trading Policy in 2021 to clarify the definition of Covered persons and to reiterate the reporting obligations of the covered persons as indicated in the revised policy.\n\nThe blackout period starts from five trading days before and two trading days after the disclosure of quarterly and annual financial results for structured disclosures. While for nonstructured disclosures, the blackout period is two trading days after disclosure of any material information other than the quarterly and annual financial results. The Compliance Officer issues a black-out period notice via e-mail before the release of structured reports or disclosure of other material information to ensure compliance with the policy.\n\nIt is the company's policy that all directors and reportable officers must report all acquisitions and disposals, or any changes in their shareholdings in the company within three trading days from the transaction date, two days earlier than the five-day disclosure requirement of the PSE. All other officers and employees must submit a quarterly report on their trades of company securities to the Compliance Officer.",

The Policy provides a process whereby employees and other stakeholders of IMI will report in good faith, instances of actual and suspected non-compliance with the Code of Conduct, and in a manner that is outside the normal chain of commands that preserves confidentiality. It encourages an atmosphere that allows individuals to exercise their obligations to responsibly disclose violations of law and serious breaches of conduct and ethics covered by the Code of Conduct through IMI's reporting channels. It provides the process which protects the whistleblowers from retaliation or reprisals by adverse disciplinary or employment penalties as a result of having disclosed wrongful conduct.\n\nWhistleblowers may report, among others, conflicts of interest; misconduct or policy violations; theft, fraud, or misappropriation; falsification of documents; financial reporting concerns; and any act of retaliation taken against persons covered by the policy.\n\nThe whistleblower may choose the manner by which he or she may be contacted without compromising his or his anonymity. It can be through a face-to-face meeting with any member of the Committee or the Human Resource Department (HRD) at the option of the employee or stakeholder, through email imi-integrityhotline@global-imi.com , or through hotline 0917-629-7074 and 0917-557-9323.\n\nIntegrated MIcro-electronIcs, Inc.\n\nnorth scIence avenue, specIal export processIng Zone\n\nlaguna technopark, BI\u00f1an, laguna, 4024 phIlIppInes\n\ntel no.: +63 2 7756 6840\n\nwww.global-imi.com\n\n## STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS\n\n## Shareholder Meeting and Voting Procedures\n\nNotice of Annual Stockholders' Meetings is sent to all shareholders at least twenty eight (28) days before the meeting by adopting SEC-allowed alternative modes of distributing the notice and other meeting materials. The notice includes the agenda and a detailed explanation on the same, the allowed means of participation and voting, and sets the date, time, place for validating proxies, which must be done at least five business days prior to the meeting.\n\nEach outstanding common share of stock entitles the registered holder to one vote.\n\nIn response to the challenge brought about by the pandemic, the company has held its virtual stockholders' meeting since 2020. The company ensures that its shareholders actively participate by attending via remote communication, voting in absentia using the Ayala Group Voting System, voting through proxy forms assigning the Chairman as proxy, and sending their questions and comments through the company's established communication channels. Shareholders, who notified the company of their participation in the meeting by remote communication, were included in the determination of quorum as well as those who voted in absentia, either electronically or through proxy.\n\nThe requirements and procedure for electronic voting in absentia are included in the Notice and the Definitive Information Statements (Annex 'C'), which is sent to the stockholders at least 21 calendar days prior to the date of the meeting. The company also provides non-controlling or minority shareholders the right to nominate candidates for board of directors and to propose items for inclusion in the meeting agenda.\n\n2022 Integrated Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dividend Policy\n\nDividends declared by the company on its shares of stocks are payable in cash or in additional shares of stock. The payment of dividends in the future will depend upon the earnings, cash flow, and financial condition of the company and other factors. There are no other restrictions that limit the payment of dividends on common shares.\n\nCash dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors, but no stockholder approval is required. Property dividends, which may come in the form of additional shares of stock, are subject to approval by both the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the company. In addition, the payment of stock dividends is likewise subject to the approval of the SEC and PSE.\n\n## Shareholder and Investor Relations\n\nThe company maintains strong and transparent relationships with its investors and encourages active participation and regular communication with various stakeholders. Through the Investor Relations team, information requirements of the investing public and minority shareholders are fully disclosed to securities regulators on time.\n\nAfter the release of quarterly financial results, the company management team conducts briefings for the media, investors, and credit analysts. Since 2020, these briefings have been done virtually through the online app Zoom.\n\nPresentation materials used in the briefings are posted in the company's official website https://www.global-imi.com/investors\n\nTypically, the company conducts roadshows two or three times a year to engage potential investors from other regions.\n\n## IMI Code of Conduct\n\nThe company's official website provides information on its compliance to Corporate Governance, matters related to the Board, and investor relations program. www.global-imi.com\n\nAnnual Stockholders' meeting held on April 20, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

This commitment extends beyond compliance to driving impactful initiatives that create a sustainable future for our company, our stakeholders, and the communities we touch.\n\nThis section outlines our strategic roadmap for ESG integration across all levels of our operations. Here, we delve into four key areas, where we are implementing initiatives to address the social, economic, environment, digital infrastructure, and supply chain pillars:\n\n- 1. Accountability and Collaboration: We explore how we foster an ownership culture of sustainability through collaboration and transparent reporting.\n- 2. Digital Roadmap: We unveil our strategic plan for digital transformation, highlighting how it contributes to our overall sustainability vision.\n- 3. IMI Production System (IPS): We showcase how this system, including the annual IPS event, drives continuous improvement in quality, efficiency, and environmental impact across production and operations.\n- 4. Supplier Sustainability Audits: We detail our commitment to extending our sustainability focus throughout the supply chain by conducting audits of our top suppliers.\n\nThese initiatives represent a significant step forward in our journey toward a more sustainable future. By focusing on these key areas, IMI aims to maximize its positive impact while minimizing its environmental footprint, creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.\n\n## ACCOUNTABILITY AND COLLABORATION\n\nOur culture journey espouses accountability and collaboration as our way of life in IMI, establishing this through global programs and activities that aim to promote and embed these practices into  daily activities and interactions of employees. From understanding our culture benchmarks to identifying our standards and ensuring common understanding across the organization, to applying accountability and collaboration principles, this culture journey made our global team more aligned and focused on our common goals and objectives-creating the future through products and innovations.\n\n## Building a Culture of Accountability:\n\n- \u00b7 Set Clear Expectations: Clearly define goals, roles, and responsibilities for everyone on the team. This ensures everyone understands what is expected of them and how their work contributes to the overall project or objectives and goals. Use the SMART goal framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) to create well-defined goals.\n- \u00b7 Regular Feedback and Recognition: Provide timely and constructive feedback to team members. This helps them course-correct, identify strengths and areas for improvement, and stay motivated. Recognize and appreciate achievements to reinforce desired behaviors and celebrate successes.\n- \u00b7 Open Communication: Encourage open and honest communication where team members feel comfortable discussing challenges, asking questions, and seeking help. This fosters trust and transparency, allowing for early identification and resolution of issues.\n- \u00b7 Empowerment and Ownership: Delegate tasks and empower team members to take ownership of their work. This increases their sense of responsibility and accountability for the outcome.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccountability & Collaboration Course and Sessions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCulture Toolkit Material Example\n\n## Enhancing Collaboration:\n\n- \u00b7 Teamwork and Shared Goals: Structure work to encourage teamwork and collaboration. Set shared goals that require collective effort and celebrate team achievements to foster a sense of 'we're in this together.'\n- \u00b7 Effective Communication Channels: Establish clear communication channels that are accessible and efficient. This could involve project management tools, communication platforms, or even dedicated team huddles.\n- \u00b7 Active Listening and Respectful Discussions: Encourage active listening and respectful discussions where all team members feel valued and heard. This fosters an environment where diverse perspectives and ideas are welcome.\n- \u00b7 Shared Knowledge and Recognition of Expertise: Promote knowledge sharing and collaboration by creating opportunities for team members to learn from each other's expertise. Recognize individual strengths and encourage team members to seek help from peers when needed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal achievements and events aligned with Accountability and Collaboration",

If any discrepancies are identified, we work with our suppliers to address them and ensure they are sourcing responsibly.\n- \u00b7 Supplier engagement: We hold our suppliers accountable for upholding responsible sourcing practices within their own operations and supply chains. This is explicitly stated in our contractual agreements and IMI Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\n## 2024 and Beyond\n\nOur third-party consultant is in the process of completing the assessment and validation of our carbon emission numbers. The findings will enable us to map out our detailed emissions and project our yearly progress towards 2030. We will prepare IMI to be compliant and eventually certified with the Responsible Business Alliance's (RBA) evaluation. On supply chain and procurement, we are working to organize engagement workshops for our top suppliers to align them with our Code of Conduct and apply it to their own supply chain, thus collectively driving the positive change across the value chain.

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) addresses this by developing industryspecific accounting standards for sustainability factors.\n\n## What SASB Standards Offer\n\n- \u00b7 Focus on Financially Material Issues: SASB standards target a specific set of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues that can significantly impact a company's financial performance within a particular industry.\n- \u00b7 Investor-Friendly: These standards provide investors with consistent and comparable data on these financially important sustainability factors, allowing them to compare companies within the same industry more effectively.\n- \u00b7 Cost-Effective and Streamlined: By focusing on industry-specific issues, SASB reduces unnecessary reporting and highlights the most relevant sustainability information for each company.\n\n## IMI Code of Conduct - Our ESG and Sustainability Framework\n\nThe IMI Code of Conduct and Sustainability Framework serves as cornerstone of our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles for our stakeholders. We leverage the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct as a guiding force, focusing on its four core pillars: Labor, Ethics, Health and Safety, and Environment all under one Management System. By adhering to these principles, we ensure responsible and sustainable business practices throughout our operations and supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| LABOR                     | HEALTH AND SAFETY                              |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Treat employees with      | Maintain a safe and healthy                    |\n| dignity and respect       | work environment                               |\n| Freely  Chosen Employment | Occupational Safety                            |\n| Child Labor Avoidance     | Emergency Preparedness                         |\n| Working Hours             | Occupational Injury and Illness                |\n| Wages and Benefits        | Industrial Hygiene                             |\n| Humane Treatment          | Physically Demanding Work                      |\n| Non-Discrimination        | Machine Safeguarding                           |\n| Freedom of Association    | Sanitation, Food and Housing Health and Safety |\n|                           | Communication                                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ENVIRONMENT\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\n## ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Protect the environment\n\nEnvironmental Permits\n\nand Reporting\n\nPollution Prevention and\n\nResource Reduction\n\nHazardous Substances\n\nWaste and Solid Waste\n\nAir Emissions\n\nProduct Content Restrictions\n\nWater Management\n\nEnergy Consumption\n\nand Greenhouse Gas\n\nEmission Energy\n\n## IMI CODE OF CONDUCT & SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK\n\n## ETHICS\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\n\nUphold the highest standards\n\nBusiness Integrity RBA\n\nRequirements\n\nNo Improper Advantage\n\nDisclosure of Information\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nFair Business, Advertising\n\nand Competition\n\nProtection of Identity\n\nand Retaliation\n\nResponsible Sourcing\n\nof Minerals\n\nPrivacy\n\nInsider Trading\n\nEnsure compliance to RBA\n\nstandards and the four pillars\n\nCompany Commitment\n\nManagement Accountability\n\nand Responsibility\n\nLegal Customer Requirements\n\nRisk Assessment and\n\nRisk Management\n\nImprovement Objectives\n\nTraining\n\nCommunication\n\nWorker Feedback and\n\nParticipation\n\nAudits and Assessment\n\nCorrective Action Process\n\nDocumentation and Records\n\nSupplier Communication\n\nCollaboration with Government\n\n& Academe\n\n## How IMI Uses SASB\n\nIMI, an electronics manufacturer, utilizes SASB standards specifically for the Electronic Manufacturing Services & Original Design Manufacturing industry (SICS\u2122 #TC0101). This helps the company report on the most relevant sustainability factors for the EMS industry.\n\n## Compatibility with Other Frameworks\n\nSASB standards can be used alongside other sustainability reporting frameworks, such as GRI Standards. They can also be a helpful tool for implementing broader sustainability principles outlined by organizations like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).\n\n<!-- image -->",

North Science Avenue, Special Export Processing Zone Laguna Technopark, Bi\u00f1an, Laguna, 4024 Philippines\n\n## Scope\n\nWe have been engaged by Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc. ('IMI' or the 'Company') to perform a 'limited assurance engagement,' as defined by Philippine Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) [PSAE 3000 (Revised)], Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information , hereafter referred to as the engagement, to report on IMI's sustainability information (the 'Subject Matter') contained in the 2023 IMI Integrated Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 'Report').\n\nOther than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information included in the Report, and accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this information.\n\n## Criteria applied by IMI\n\nIn preparing the Subject Matter, IMI applied the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, International Integrated Reporting (IR) framework, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards and Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## IMI's responsibilities\n\nIMI's management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for presenting the Subject Matter in accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects.  This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## SGV's responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Subject Matter based on the evidence we have obtained.\n\nWe conducted our engagement in accordance with the Philippine Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ['PSAE 3000 (Revised)'], and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with the Company on February 16, 2024. Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion on whether we are aware of any material modifications that need to be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report.  The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusions.\n\n## Our independence and quality management\n\nWe have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants in the Philippines, and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.\n\nSGV also applies Philippine Standard on Quality Management 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services engagements , which requires that we design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n- 2 -\n\n## Description of procedures performed\n\nProcedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nAlthough we considered the effectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.\n\nA limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the Subject Matter and related information, and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.\n\n## Our procedures included the following:\n\n- 1. Conducted interviews with management and relevant process owners to:\n- a. Understand the principal business operations and reporting process;\n- b. Understand the processes for collecting, collating and reporting the Subject Matter during the reporting period;\n- 2. Checked that calculation criteria used have been correctly applied in accordance with the methodologies outlined in the Criteria;\n- 3. Undertook analytical procedures of the data and made inquiries of management to obtain explanations for any significant differences we identified;\n- 4. Tested, on a sample basis, underlying source documentation/reports to check accuracy of information disclosed.\n\nWe also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures and evidence obtained, except for the possible effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Conclusion section, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the Subject Matter for the year ended December 31, 2023, in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.\n\n## Basis for Qualified Conclusion\n\nThe management was unable to provide supporting documents for training hours for Chengdu location amounting to 52,332 hours and employee turnover of 1,942 headcount for Mexico location for the year ended December 31, 2023. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether adjustments might have been necessary in respect of the training hours disclosed in the 'Metrics and Targets' section and the employee turnover used to calculate the turnover rate disclosed in the 'Our Integrated Value Chain' section of the 2023 IMI Integrated Report.\n\nSYCIP, GORRES, VELAYO & CO.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKatrina F.

        "page_content": "MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Review of 2023 Performance\n\n## Revenues from Sales and Services\n\nThe Company posted consolidated full year 2023 revenues of US$1.3 billion, 6 percent lower than the previous year, driven by factors attributable to its non-wholly owned subsidiary group including the shorter fiscal year of STI Limited which was divested on October 31, 2023. The core business maintained the same level of revenues from last year at $1.11 billion.\n\nThe automotive segment, which includes mobility and camera, remained our largest segment with US$800 million of revenues representing 60% of total revenues. On the other hand, the industrial segment ended the year with US$390 million in revenues, or a 29% share to total IMI. The Company also won new projects that have an annual revenue potential of US$291 million largely coming from these target sectors.\n\n## Gross Margins and Net Profits\n\nThe full year gross profit of $120.0 million increased 9% versus 2022. GP% also improved from 7.8% last year to 9.0% this year as component shortage situation eased and overhead restructuring that enabled better utilization of fixed costs.\n\nGroup net loss was at US$105.6 million, with one-time losses of US$107.5 million related to the sale of STI and impairment of goodwill and certain assets. Meanwhile, wholly-owned subsidiaries maintained the momentum from 2022, with revenues at par with the previous year, and better profitability margins netting a reported net income of US$13 million, an improvement of 14 percent vs 2022.\n\n## Financial Condition\n\nIMI's balance sheet remains robust with a current ratio of 1.4 4:1 and debt-to-equity ratio of 1.15:1.\n\nOn cash flows and liquidity, the Company achieved positive operating cash flows of $6.8 million from improved working capital management with specific focus on managing inventory levels.\n\nIn 2023, IMI spent $27.6 million on capital expenditures related to new programs, higher than last year's $21.2 million.\n\n## STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe management of Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc. (the Company) is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements including the schedules attached therein for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, in accordance with the prescribed financial reporting framework indicated therein, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and its subsidiaries ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company and its subsidiaries or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company's and its subsidiaries' financial reporting process.\n\nThe Board of Directors reviews and approves the consolidated financial statements including the schedules attached therein, and submits the same to the stockholders.\n\nSyCip Gorres Velayo & Co., the independent auditor appointed by the stockholders, has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries in accordance with Philippine Standards on Auditing, and in its report to the stockholders, has expressed its opinion on the fairness of presentation upon completion of such audit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ALBERTO M.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants in the Philippines (Code of Ethics) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Recoverability of Goodwill\n\nUnder PFRS, the Group is required to annually test the amount of goodwill for impairment. As of December 31, 2023, the Group's goodwill attributable to the following cash -generating units (CGUs): Integrated MicroElectronics, Inc., Speedy-Tech Electronics, Ltd., IMI Czech Republic s.r.o., and VIA Optronics GmbH (VIA), amounted to $70.18 million, which is considered significant to the consolidated financial statements, were tested for impairment. Impairment loss amounting to $15.59 million was recorded in 2023. In addition, management's assessment process requires significant judgment and is based on assumptions which are\n\nsubject to higher level of estimation uncertainty due to the current economic conditions, specifically revenue growth rate, gross margin, cost ratios and discount rates.\n\nThe Group's disclosures about goodwill are included in Note 4 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Audit Response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the Group's impairment assessment process and the related controls. We involved our internal specialist in evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate. We tested the parameters used in the determination of the discount rate against market data. We compared the key assumptions used such as revenue growth rate, gross margins and cost ratios against actual historical performance of the CGU and industry outlook. We also reviewed the Group's disclosures about those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is more sensitive, specifically those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill.\n\n## Recoverability of Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nUnder PFRS, the Group is required to test the recoverability of nonfinancial assets when indicators of impairment exist. In 2023, the continuing gross loss for the production line for certain customers in Philippines, Mexico and Germany has been assessed as an impairment indicator requiring an impairment assessment. Accordingly, the related items of property, plant, and equipment with an aggregate depreciated cost of $33.07 million as of December 31, 2023, which is significant to the consolidated financial statements, were tested for impairment. The Group recorded impairment loss amounting to $5.05 million in 2023. The management's impairment assessment process requires significant judgment and is based on assumptions which are subject to higher level of estimation uncertainty, specifically revenue growth rate, gross margin, cost ratios and discount rates.\n\nThe Group's disclosures about the property, plant and equipment are included in Notes 4 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Audit Response\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the Group's impairment assessment process. We involved our internal specialist in evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate. We tested the parameters used in the determination of the discount rate against market data. We compared the key assumptions used such as revenue growth rate, gross margins and cost ratios against actual historical performance attributable to the property, plant, and equipment and industry outlook. We also reviewed the Group's disclosures about those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is more sensitive, specifically those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nWe have previously issued our auditor's report dated April 1, 2024 which contains a qualified opinion on the Group's consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023 because we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on the carrying amount of the VIA Group balances, including the impairment loss on the goodwill of VIA Group as a CGU. Likewise, certain required disclosures in relation to VIA Group have not been made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Group reissued its 2023 financial statements and adjusted the carrying amounts of certain VIA Group balances arising from the completion of the audit procedures of the VIA Group component auditors and included additional note disclosures (see Note 3) including subsequent events up to the date of this report. In view of the foregoing, our report on these 2023 reissued consolidated financial statements has been updated.\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the SEC Form 20-IS (Definitive Information Statement), SEC Form 17-A and Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 , but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with PSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with PSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's abi lity to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our\n\nauditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Cyril Jasmin B.

Germaneers provides solutions for a range of well-known highend original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\n\nGermaneers is known for creating innovative and state-of-the-art digital car interiors to achieve the next level of customer experience through human machine interfaces (HMI), sensor and camera solutions.\n\nThe control concept according to PFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements , sets out three elements of control consisting of power over investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from involvement with the investee and the ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of these returns. Based on\n\nassessment, VIA has control over Germaneers and needs to consolidate Germaneers in its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2021, the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Germaneers has been prepared on a preliminary basis due to unavailability of certain information to facilitate fair valuation computation, and reasonable changes are expected as additional information becomes available. The provisional goodwill recognized on the acquisition can be attributed to its years of knowledge and experience of market requirements, system-level design, and innovative technologies in the automotive sector. The purchase price allocation has been finalized in 2022 and there were no significant changes in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and the resulting goodwill (see Note 11).\n\n## Sale of STI Enterprise Limited\n\nOn August 3, 2023,  Integrated Micro-Electronics UK Limited (IMI UK) and the minority shareholders of STI Enterprises Limited (STI) have entered into an agreement to sell their respective 80% and 20% shares in STI to Rcapital, a private investment firm based in London with a portfolio of UK-based companies including precision engineering solution providers in the aerospace and defense sectors, for an agreed consideration of \u00a32.5 million GBP ($3.2 million).\n\nAs part of the pre-completion covenant, \u00a32.5 million of funding (\u00a32.24 million or $2.76 million being the share of IMI UK) was provided by the existing shareholders to STIL by way of unsecured loan ('Interim Funding') in order that STI shall be in a positi on to continue to be able to pay its trade creditors. At completion date, the consideration payable to IMI UK amounted to \u00a32.24 million ($2.76 million). Both the interim funding and the consideration are payable on the earlier of the date falling: (i) two years after the Completion date; and (ii) five business days after the occurrence of a trigger event (the Repayment Date). In each case, interest shall accrue daily (but shall not compound) at 5% per annum, repayable on the Repayment Date.\n\nWith the condition precedent having been met, particularly, the UK government's clearance under the National Security and Investment Act 2021, and closing deliverables having been exchanged by the parties, the transaction was completed on October 31, 2023. The balance sheet accounts as of October 31, 2023 were deconsolidated and subsequently, the financial results of STI Limited will no longer be consolidated into the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe conclusion of this divestment initiative allows IMI management to sharpen its portfolio and focus on driving growth and profitability in its core segments. The mobility and industrial markets remain at the forefront for IMI, with interconnectivity and the electrification of vehicles driving technology megatrends of the near future.\n\nAt the date of disposal, the carrying amounts of STI's net assets were as follows:\n\n|                                       | October 31, 2023   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents             | $1,759,283         |\n| Receivables                           | 15,098,908         |\n| Contract assets                       | 11,416,661         |\n| Inventories                           | 21,488,832         |\n| Other current assets                  | 2,211,370          |\n| Property, plant and equipment         | 4,803,583          |\n| Right-of-use assets                   | 2,842,737          |\n| Deferred tax assets                   | 1,095              |\n| Total Assets                          | 59,622,469         |\n| Accounts payable and accrued expenses | 95,248,308         |\n| Loans payable                         | 2,306,057          |\n| Lease liabilities                     | 2,666,986          |\n| Other noncurrent liabilities          | 1,102,874          |\n| Total Liabilities                     | 101,324,225        |\n| Total Net Liabilities                 | ($41,701,756)      |",

        "page_content": "## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023.\n\nControl is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:\n\n- a. Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)\n- b. Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and\n- c. The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns\n\nWhen the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\n- a. The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee\n- b. Rights arising from other contractual arrangements\n- c. The Group's voting rights and potential voting rights\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included or excluded in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control or until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\nNon-controlling interests pertain to the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly to the Parent Company. Any equity instruments issued by a subsidiary that are not owned by the Parent Company are non-controlling interests including preferred shares and options under share-based transactions. The portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries not wholly-owned are presented separately in the consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of financial position, separately from the Parent Company's equity. Non -controlling interests are net of any outstanding subscription receivable.\n\nLosses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.\n\nIn accounting for call and put options over non-controlling interests, management determines whether it has present access to the returns associated with the non-controlling interests. If the options give the Group access to the returns over the non-controlling interests, the Group consolidates the acquiree as if it acquired a 100% interest.\n\nIf the options do not give the Group present access to the returns over the non-controlling interests, the Group takes the view that the non-controlling interests should be accounted for in accordance with PFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, and must be presented within equity separate from the equity of the Parent Company, until the option is exercised.\n\nThe call option is accounted for under PFRS 9, Financial Instruments, as a derivative instrument carried at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe financial liability for the put option is accounted for under PFRS 9 like any other written put option on equity instruments. On initial recognition, the corresponding debit is made to a component of equity attributable to the parent, not to the non-controlling interest. All subsequent changes in the carrying amount of the financial liability that result from the remeasurement of the present value payable on exercise are recognized in profit or loss also attributable to the parent.\n\nIf the put option is exercised, the entity accounts for an increase in its ownership interest. At the same time, the entity derecognizes the financial liability and reverses the component of equity that was reduced on initial recognition. If the put option expires unexercised, the financial liability is reclassified to the same component of equity that was reduced on initial recognition.\n\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Parent Company. The difference is included as part of additional paid-in capital.\n\nIf the Group losses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while the resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value.\n\n## Changes in Accounting Policies and Disclosures\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial years except for the new PFRS, amended PFRS and improvements to PFRS which were adopted beginning January 1, 2023. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, adoption of these new standards did not have significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to Philippine Accounting Standards (PAS) 1 and Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRS) Practice Statement 2, Disclosure of Accounting Policies\n\nThe amendments provide guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by:\n\n- \u00b7 Replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their 'significant' accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their 'material' accounting policies, and\n- \u00b7 Adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures\n\nThe amendments to the Practice Statement provide non-mandatory guidance.\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to PAS 8, Definition of Accounting Estimates\n\nThe amendments introduce a new definition of accounting estimates and clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also, the amendments clarify that the effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors.\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to PAS 12 Income Taxes, Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n\nThe amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under PAS 12, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nThe amendments also clarify that where payments that settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of judgement (having considered the applicable tax law) whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to the liability recognized in the financial statements (and interest expense) or to the related asset component (and interest expense).",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Amendments to PAS 12, Income Taxes, International Tax Reform -Pillar Two Model Rules\n\nThe amendments introduce a mandatory exception in PAS 12 from recognizing and disclosing deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nThe amendments also clarify that PAS 12 applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two Model Rules published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes. Such tax legislation, and the income taxes arising from it, are referred to as 'Pillar Two legislation' and 'Pillar Two income taxes', respectively.\n\nThe temporary exception from recognition and disclosure of information about deferred taxes and the requirement to disclose the application of the exception, apply immediately and retrospectively upon adoption of the amendments in June 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the disclosure of the current tax expense related to Pillar Two income taxes and the disclosures in relation to periods before the legislation is effective are required for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nPronouncements issued but not yet effective are listed below. Unless otherwise indicated, the Group does not expect that the future adoption of the said pronouncements will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Group intends to adopt the following pronouncements when they become effective. Unless otherwise stated, the following pronouncement is not expected to have material impact to the Group.\n\n## Effective beginning on or after January 1, 2024\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to PAS 1 , Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n\nThe amendments clarify:\n\n- \u00b7 That only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before reporting date will affect a liability's classification as current or non -current.\n- \u00b7 That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right.\n- \u00b7 That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 and must be applied retrospectively.\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to PFRS 16 , Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback\n\nThe amendments specify how a seller-lessee measures the lease liability arising in a sale and leaseback transaction in a way that it does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use retained.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 and must be applied retrospectively. Earlier adoption is permitted and that fact must be disclosed.\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to PAS 7 and PFRS 7 , Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements\n\nThe amendments specify disclosure requirements to enhance the current requirements, which are intended to assist users of financial statements in understanding the effects of supplier finance arrangements on an entity's liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. Earlier adoption is permitted and that fact must be disclosed.\n\n## Effective beginning on or after January 1, 2025\n\n- \u00b7 PFRS 17, Insurance Contracts\n\nPFRS 17 is a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, PFRS 17 will replace PFRS 4, Insurance Contracts . This new standard on insurance contracts applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply.\n\nThe overall objective of PFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In contrast to the requirements in PFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting policies, PFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects. The core of PFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:\n\n- \u00b7 A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach)\n- \u00b7 A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts\n\nOn December 15, 2021, the FSRSC amended the mandatory effective date of PFRS 17 from January 1, 2023 to January 1, 2025. This is consistent with Circular Letter No. 2020-62 issued by the Insurance Commission which deferred the implementation of PFRS 17 by two (2) years after its effective date as decided by the IASB.\n\nPFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025, with comparative figures required. Early application is permitted.\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to PAS 21 , Lack of exchangeability\n\nThe amendments specify how an entity should assess whether a currency is exchangeable and how it should determine a spot exchange rate when exchangeability is lacking.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025. Earlier adoption is permitted and that fact must be disclosed. When applying the amendments, an entity cannot restate comparative information.\n\n## Deferred effectivity\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to PFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements , and PAS 28, Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture\n\nThe amendments address the conflict between PFRS 10 and PAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture. The amendments clarify that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transfer to an associate or joint venture involves a business as defined in PFRS 3. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that does not constitute a business, however, is recognized only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the associate or joint venture.\n\nOn January 13, 2016, the Financial and Sustainability Reporting Standards Council deferred the original effective date of January 1, 2016 of the said amendments until the IASB completes its broader review of the research project on equity accounting that may result in the simplification of accounting for such transactions and of other aspects of accounting for associates and joint ventures.\n\n## Current versus Noncurrent Classification\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on current or noncurrent classification.\n\n## An asset is current when it is:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;\n- \u00b7 Held primarily for the purpose of trading;",

Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less and that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Short-term Investments\n\nShort-term investments are short-term placements with maturities of more than three months but less than one year from the date of acquisition. These earn interest at the respective short-term investment rates.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\n## a) Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified at fair value, at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and Fair value through profit and loss (FVPL).\n\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group's business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVPL, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under PFRS 15.\n\nIn order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)' on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.\n\nThe Group's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.\n\nPurchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at FVOCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)\n- \u00b7 Financial assets designated at FVOCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments)\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at FVPL\n\nThe financial assets of the Group as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consist of financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments) and financial assets designated at FVOCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments).\n\n## Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)\n\nThis category is the most relevant to the Group. The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nFinancial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.\n\nThe Group's financial assets at amortized cost includes cash and cash equivalents, short -term investments, receivables and miscellaneous deposits included under 'Other noncurrent assets' account.\n\n## Financial assets designated at FVOCI (equity instruments)\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity under PAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognized as other income in the consolidated statement of income when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\nThe Group elected to classify irrevocably its investments in club shares and non-listed common equity shares under this category.\n\n## Financial assets at FVPL\n\nFinancial assets at FVPL include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVPL, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at FVPL, irrespective of the business model. Notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortized cost or at FVOCI, as described above, debt instruments may be designated at FVPL on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.\n\nFinancial assets at FVPL are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with net changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income.",

        "page_content": "This category includes derivative instruments which the Group had not irrevocably elected to classify at FVOCI.\n\nAn embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host contract with the effect that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative.\n\nAn embedded derivative within a financial asset host is not accounted for separately. The financial asset host together with the embedded derivative is required to be classified in its entirety as either at amortized cost or at fair value depending on whether the cash flows of the hybrid contract are solely payments of principal and interest and the assessment of the business model within which the financial asset is held. On the other hand, an embedded derivative with a financial liability or a nonfinancial host is separated from the host and accounted for as a separate derivative if: its economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to the host; a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nSeparated embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modified the cash flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the Group's consolidated balance sheet) when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or\n- \u00b7 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass -through' arrangement\u037e and either (a) the Group has transferr ed substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.\n\nContinuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.\n\n## Impairment of Financial Assets\n\nThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at FVPL. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\n\nFor those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision\n\nmatrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.\n\n## b) Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at FVPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\n\n## Financial liabilities at FVPL\n\nFinancial liabilities at FVPL include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by PFRS 9. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at FVPL are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in PFRS 9 are satisfied.\n\nThis category applies to the Group's derivative liabilities and financial liabilities on put options over the non-controlling interests.\n\n## Other financial liabilities\n\nThis category pertains to financial liabilities that are not held for trading or not designated as at FVPL upon the inception of the liability. These include liabilities arising from operations and borrowings.\n\nAfter initial measurement, other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on the acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when other financial liabilities are derecognized, as well as through the EIR amortization process.\n\nThis category applies to the Group's accounts payable and accrued expenses (excluding advances from customers, advances from third party, statutory payables and taxes payables), loans payable and long-term debt.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or has expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "## c) Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheets if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement\n\nThe Group measures its derivatives, financial assets at FVOCI and financial liabilities at FVPL at fair value at each balance sheet date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortized cost are disclosed in Note 32.\n\nThe fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u00b7 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure the fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which the fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at balance sheet date.\n\nFor purposes of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV). Cost is determined using the moving average method for raw materials and supplies. For finished goods and work-in-process, cost includes direct materials, direct labor, and a proportion of manufacturing overhead costs based on normal operating capacity determined using the moving average method. NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. In the event that NRV is lower than cost, the decline shall be recognized as an expense in profit or loss.\n\n## Deferred Charges\n\nDeferred charges are recognized when the Group incurred expenses but the benefits are not expected to be realized on a short-term basis. These are normally chargeable to the customers as part of the selling price of the manufactured items.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of property, plant and equipment consists of its purchase price and any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Expenditures incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are normally charged to profit or loss in the period in which the costs are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditures have resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of an item of property, plant and equipment beyond its originally assessed standard of performance, the expenditures are capitalized as additional costs of property, plant and equipment.\n\nConstruction in progress is stated at cost, less impairment loss, if any. This includes costs of construction and installation of equipment and machinery items, and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its intended use. Construction in progress is not depreciated until such time as the relevant assets are completed and put into operational use.\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment commences once the property, plant and equipment are available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (EUL) of the assets as follows:\n\n|                                                       | Years     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Buildings                                             | 20  -  30 |\n| Building improvements                                 | 5         |\n| Machineries and facilities equipment (Notes 4 and 10) | 3  -  13  |\n| Furniture, fixtures and office equipment              | 3  -  5   |\n| Transportation equipment                              | 3  -  5   |\n| Tools and instruments                                 | 2  -  5   |\n\nThe EUL and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. The EUL of property, plant and equipment are based on expected asset utilization as anchored on business plans and strategies that also consider expected future technological developments and market behavior to ensure that the period of depreciation is consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items of property, plant and equipment.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.\n\nFully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the accounts until these are no longer used and no further depreciation is charged to profit or loss.\n\n## Borrowing Costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that the Group incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.\n\n## Business Combinations and Goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects to measure the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the proportionate share of the acquiree's",

        "page_content": "identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in the consolidated statements of income under 'Operating expenses' account.\n\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability, that is a financial instrument and within the scope of PFRS 9 is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. Other contingent consideration that is not within the scope of PFRS 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash -generating unit (CGU), or group of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units.\n\nEach unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated should:\n\n- \u00b7 Represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and\n- \u00b7 Not be larger than an operating segment determined in accordance with PFRS 8, Operating Segments .\n\nWhen goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill allocated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of the combination can be determined only provisionally, the acquirer shall account for the combination using those provisional values. The acquirer shall recognize any adjustment to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial accounting within 12 months of the acquisition date as follows: (i) the carrying amount of the identifiable asset, liability or contingent liability that is recognized or adjusted as a result of completing the initial accounting shall be calculated as if its fair value at the acquisition date had been recognized from that date; (ii) goodwill or any gain recognized shall be adjusted by an amount equal to the adjustment to the fair value at the acquisition date of the identifiable asset, liability or contingent liability being recognized or adjusted; and (iii) comparative information presented for the periods before the initial accounting for the combination is complete shall be presented as if the initial accounting has been completed from the acquisition date.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value as of the date of acquisition.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognized as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate:\n\n- (a)  The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale;\n- (b)  Its intention to complete and ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- (c)  How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset;\n- (d)  The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and\n- (e)  Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.\n\nAfter initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortization begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortized over the period of expected benefit.\n\nThe EUL of intangible assets is assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their EUL and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset is impaired. The amortization period and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least at the end of each balance sheet date. Changes in the EUL or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe EUL of intangible assets of finite useful life are as follows:\n\n|                           | Years   |\n|---------------------------|---------|\n| Customer relationships    | 5       |\n| Unpatented technology     | 5       |\n| Licenses                  | 2-5     |\n| Intellectual properties   | 5       |\n| Product development costs | 5       |\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives and those not yet available for use are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.\n\nGains or losses arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## Group as Lessee\n\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognizes lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.\n\n## Right-of-use Assets\n\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and",

        "page_content": "lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-ofuse assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment.\n\n## Lease Liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\n\n## Short-term Leases (STL) and Leases of Low-value Assets\n\nThe Group applies the STL recognition exemption to those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. The Group applies the lowvalue assets recognition exemption to leases of underlying assets with a value, when new, of US$5,000 and below. Lease payments on short-term leases and low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Extension Options\n\nSome property leases contain extension options exercisable by the Group up to one year before the end of the noncancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Group re-assesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.\n\n## Impairment of Nonfinancial Assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each balance sheet date, whether there is an indication that a nonfinancial asset (e.g., deferred charges, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets) is impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less costs to sell and its value -in-use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\nIn determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\n\nThe Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGU to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally covered a period of five years.\n\nFor nonfinancial assets, excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group e stimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortization, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\n\nSuch reversal is recognized in profit or loss. After such reversal, the depreciation and amortization expense is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining EUL.\n\nAll goodwill of the Group are tested for impairment annually as of December 31 and also tested for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount is impaired. Provisional goodwill allocated to a CGU is also tested for impairment even if the fair value exercise is not complete during the year.\n\nImpairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.\n\n## Provisions and Onerous Contracts\n\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nWhen the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.\n\nMany contracts (for example, some routine purchase orders) can be cancelled without paying compensation to the other party, and therefore there is no obligation. Other contracts establish both rights and obligations for each of the contracting parties. Where events make such a contract onerous, the contract falls within the scope of PAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, and a liability exists which is recognized. Executory contracts that are not onerous fall outside the scope of PAS 37.\n\nPAS 37 defines an onerous contract as a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.\n\nThe cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. Costs that relate directly to a contract consist of both:\n\n- (a) the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract -for example, direct labour and materials; and\n- (b) an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts -for example, an allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling that contract among others.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense.",

        "page_content": "Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.\n\n## Equity\n\n## Capital stock\n\nCapital stock is measured at par value for all shares issued and outstanding. When the Parent Company issues more than one class of stock, a separate account is maintained for each class of stock and the number of shares issued.\n\nPreferred shares may be issued with various rights. In determining whether a preference share is financial liability or equity instrument, the issuer is required to assess the particular rights attaching to the share to determine whether it exhibits the fundamental characteristic of a financial liability. A preference share redeemable only at the holder's option is an equity instrument because the issuer does not have a present or future obligation to transfer financial assets to the shareholder.\n\n## Additional paid-in capital\n\nAdditional paid-in capital pertains to the difference of the par value and selling price of issued and outstanding shares of stock. Direct costs incurred related to equity issuance, such as underwriting, accounting and legal fees, printing costs and taxes are charged to 'Additional paid -in capital' account. If additional paidin capital is not sufficient, the excess is charged against 'Retained earnings' account.\n\nAn increase or decrease in a parent's ownership interest that does not result in a loss of control of a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction, i.e. a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners. A parent's ownership interest may chan ge without a loss of control, e.g. when a parent buys shares from or sells shares to a non-controlling interest, a subsidiary redeems shares held by a non-controlling interest, or when a subsidiary issues new shares to a non-controlling interest.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. PFRS 10 states that 'the entity shall recognize directly in equity any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received, and attribute it to the owners of the parent. The Group recognize this difference under 'Additional paid -in capital' account.\n\n## Subscriptions receivable\n\nSubscriptions receivable pertains to the uncollected portion of the subscribed shares.\n\n## Retained earnings and dividends on capital stock of the Parent Company\n\nRetained earnings represent net accumulated earnings of the Group, less dividends declared. Dividends on capital stock are recognized as a liability and deducted from equity when they are approved by Parent Company's BOD.\n\n## Treasury stock\n\nTreasury stock is recorded at cost and is presented as a deduction from equity. When the shares are retired, the 'Capital stock' account is reduced by its par value and the excess of cost over par value upon retirement is debited to 'Additional paid -in cap ital' account to the extent of the specific or average additional paidin capital when the shares were issued and to 'Retained earnings' account for the remaining balance.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n- a) Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nThe Group is in the business of providing electronic manufacturing and other related services to various customers. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\n## Manufacturing of goods\n\nThe Group provides manufacturing services in accordance with the customer's specifications. The Group promises to provide a combined performance obligation comprised of non-distinct goods or services, which include issuance of materials to production, assembly, testing and packaging.\n\nContracts with customers are generally classified as turnkey or consignment. In a turnkey contract, the Group procures the materials and provides the assembly services to the customer. In a consignment contract, the Group only provides assembly services to the customer.\n\nFor turnkey contracts, revenue is recognized over time since the products created have no alternative use to the Group and the Group has right to payment for performance completed to date including the related profit margin, in case of termination for reas ons other than the Group's failure to perform as promised.\n\nFor goods manufactured not covered by customer purchase orders or firm delivery schedule, revenues are recognized at a point in time, when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally when goods are shipped or goods are received by the customer, depending on the corresponding agreement with the customer.\n\nFor consignment contracts, revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the Group performs.\n\nFor R&D engineering services, revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance completed to date.\n\nRevenue from optical bonding technology and metal mesh touch sensors (VIA and VTS) Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nFor optical bonding services performed under the consignment model, revenue is recognized at a point in time based on the fact that the assets created have alternative use to the Group entities. This is when the enhancement process is finalized, the customer removes the enhanced products from the consignment stock and is invoiced, according to contract.\n\nFor the sale of products under the full service model, revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the products are transferred to the customers, generally on delivery of the products.\n\n## Non-recurring engineering services\n\nNon-recurring engineering charges, tooling and other pre-production revenue stream (NREs) are recognized at a point in time since the criteria for over time recognition is not met. This is based on the assessment that while, in general, the Group has no alternative use for these NREs, either due to customization or restrictions by the customer, there is no assurance or relevant experience that IMI has enforceable right to payment or can recover the cost, plus reasonable margin, in case of contract termination. Point in time revenue recognition for NREs would mean revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the NREs (transfer of control).\n\nThe Group considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g., customer options that provide material rights to customers, warranties). In determining the transaction price, the Group considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing components, noncash consideration and consideration payable to the customer, if any.\n\n## Variable consideration\n\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that",

        "page_content": "a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\n\n## Significant financing component\n\nThe Group's contracts with its customers are short -term in nature. Using the practical expedient in PFRS 15, the Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration of the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n\nThe Group does not have significant separate performance obligations wherein the transaction price needs to be allocated as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## b) Contract balances\n\n## Contract asset\n\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional.\n\n## Contract liability\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognized when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). A contract liability is recognized as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.\n\n## c) Cost to obtain a contract\n\nThe Group pays sales commission to its employees for each contract that they obtain. The Group has elected to apply the optional practical expedient for costs to obtain a contract which allows the Group to immediately expense sales commissions (included under operating expenses) because the amortization period of the asset that the Group otherwise would have used is one year or less.\n\n## Other Income\n\n## Interest income\n\nInterest income is recognized as it accrues using the EIR method.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividend income is recognized when the right to receive the payment is established.\n\n## Miscellaneous income\n\nMiscellaneous income is recognized as the Group earns the right over it.\n\n## Expenses\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nThis account includes cost of goods sold and cost of services. These expenses pertain to the direct expenses incurred by the Group in relation to the products and services offered. Cost of sales is recognized when the related goods are sold and when services are rendered.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nThis account pertains to the general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses are recognized when incurred, except for short term and low value rental expense, which is computed on a straight linebasis over the lease term.\n\n## Government Grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is initially recognized as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet and recognized as income on a systematic\n\nbasis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to the acquisition or construction of a fixed asset, it is initially recognized as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet and recognized as income in equal amounts over the period of depreciation of the related asset.\n\n## Foreign Currency Transactions\n\nFunctional currency is determined for each entity within the Group and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured and recorded using that functional currency. For consolidation purposes, the foreign subsidiaries' balances are translated to USD, which is the Parent Company's functional and presentation currency.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to profit or loss. Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction. Nonmonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined.\n\nThe functional currencies of the Group's foreign subsidiaries are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As at the balance sheet date, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Parent Company at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their profit and loss accounts are translated monthly using the monthly weighted average exchange rates. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and reported as a separate component of equity.\n\nExchange differences arising from elimination of intragroup balances and intragroup transactions are recognized in profit or loss. As an exception, if the exchange differences arise from intragroup balances that, in substance, forms part of an entity's net investment in a foreign operation, the exchange differences are not to be recognized in profit or loss, but are recognized in OCI and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nOn disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted as of the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable profit.\n\nCurrent tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in profit or loss. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions, when appropriate.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is provided using the liability method on all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes as of the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences and carryforward benefits of unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carryforward benefits of unused tax losses can be utilized, except:\n\n- \u00b7 When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and",

Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same tax authority.\n\nFor periods where an Income Tax Holiday (ITH) is in effect, no deferred taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as the ITH status of the Group neither results in a deductible temporary difference or taxable temporary difference. However, for temporary differences that are expected to reverse beyond the ITH, deferred taxes are recognized.\n\n## Earnings per Share (EPS) Attributable to Equity Holders of the Parent Company\n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common equity holders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and adjusted to give retroactive effect to any stock dividends declared during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common equity holders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the weighted average number of common shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential common shares. The calculation of diluted EPS does not assume conversion, exercise or other issue of potential common shares that would have an antidilutive effect on EPS.\n\n## Retirement and Other Employee Benefits\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Parent Company, PSi, STIPH, IMI BG and IMI Serbia maintain separate defined benefit plans covering substantially all of their employees. The plans of the Parent Company, PSi and STIPH are funded and noncontributory retirement plans administered by their respective Boards of Trustees, while that of IMI BG and IMI Serbia is unfunded and noncontributory.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is actuarially determined using the projected unit credit method. This method reflects services rendered by employees up to the date of valuation and incorporates assumptions concerning employe es' projected salaries. Actuarial valuations are conducted with sufficient regularity, with the option to accelerate when significant changes to underlying assumptions occur.\n\nService costs which include current service costs, past service costs and gains or losses on non-routine settlements are recognized as expense in profit or loss. Past service costs are recognized when plan amendment or curtailment occurs.\n\nNet interest on net retirement liabilities is the change during the period in net retirement liabilities that arises from the passage of time which is determined by applying the discount rate based on government bonds to net retirement liabilities. Net interest on retirement liabilities is recognized as expense or income in profit or loss.\n\nRemeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets and any change in the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding net interest on net retirement liabilities) are recognized immediately in OCI in the period in which they arise. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.\n\nNet retirement liabilities are the aggregate of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the balance sheet date reduced by the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for any effect of limiting a net retirement asset to the asset ceiling. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nPlan assets are assets that are held by a long-term employee benefit fund. Plan assets are not available to the creditors of the Group, nor can they be paid directly to the Group. The fair value of plan assets is based on market price information. When no market price is available, the fair value of plan assets is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects both the risk associated with the plan assets and the maturity or expected disposal date of those assets (or, if they have no maturity, the expected period until the settlement of the related obligations).\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Parent Company's subsidiaries in Singapore, China, Czech Republic, Mexico, Germany, Japan, and UK participate in the respective national retirement schemes defined by the laws of the countries in which it has operations. These retirement schemes are considered as defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a plan under which the subsidiary pays fixed contributions. Each subsidiary has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The required contributions to the national retirement schemes are recognized as retirement expense as accrued.\n\n## Singapore\n\nThe subsidiaries incorporated in Singapore make contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme in Singapore, a defined contribution scheme. Contributions to the CPF scheme are recognized as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed.\n\n## China\n\nThe subsidiaries incorporated and operating in China are required to provide certain staff retirement benefits to their employees under existing China regulations, a defined contribution scheme. Retirement contributions are provided at rates stipulated by China regulations and are contributed to a retirement fund managed by government agencies, which are responsible for administering these amounts for the subsidiaries' employees. Contributions to this defined contribution scheme are recognized as expense in the period in which the related service is performed.\n\n## IMI CZ\n\nIMI CZ, under its collective agreement, is committed to pay contributions to life and retirement insurance of its loyal employees. This is done on a monthly basis as part of payroll expenses and only over the employment period. IMI CZ is not obliged to any other payments if employment terminates.\n\n## IMI MX\n\nIn accordance with the Mexican Labor Law, IMI MX provides seniority premium benefits to its employees under certain circumstances. These benefits consist of a one-time payment equivalent to twelve days of wage for each year of service (at the employee's mo st recent salary, but not to exceed twice the legal minimum wage), payable to all employees with fifteen or more years of service, as well as to certain employees terminated involuntarily prior to the vesting of their seniority premium benefit.\n\nIMI MX also provides statutorily mandated severance benefits to its employees terminated under certain circumstances. Such benefits consist of a one-time payment of three months wages plus twenty days wages for each year of service payable upon involuntary termination without just cause. These are recognized when such an event occurs.",

        "page_content": "## VIA\n\nPensions and similar obligations relate to VIA's statutory pension obligations for defined contribution plans. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense when incurred. VIA Group has no defined benefit plans.\n\n## STI\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense in the period in which the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.\n\nWhen contributions are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting date in which the employees render the related service, the liability is measured on a discounted present value basis. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.\n\n## Employee leave entitlement\n\nEmployee entitlements to annual leave are recognized as a liability when they accrue to the employees. The undiscounted liability for leave expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the balance sheet date is recognized for services rendered by employees up to the end of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Share-based Payment Transactions\n\nCertain employees (including directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares ('equity -settled transactions').\n\nThe Group has an employee stock ownership plan (ESOWN) which allows the grantees to purchase the Parent Company's shares at a discounted price. The Group recognizes employee benefit expense over the holding period. The Group treats its ESOWN plan as option payable within a given period. These are accounted for similar to the methods outlined in PFRS 2. Dividends paid on the awards that have vested are deducted from equity while those paid on awards that are unvested are charged to profit or loss.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nThe Group is organized and managed separately according to geographical locations of businesses. The geographical segments are segregated as follows: Philippines, China, Europe, Mexico, Germany/UK, and USA/Japan/Singapore/IMI UK. These geographical businesses are the basis upon which the Group reports its operating segment information presented in Note 29.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. These are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. Contingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\n## Events after the Balance Sheet Date\n\nPost period events that provide additional information about the Group's financial position at the balance sheet date (adjusting events) are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Post period events that are non-adjusting events are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements when material.\n\n## 4. Significant Accounting Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with PFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Uncertainty about these judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## Judgments\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements:\n\nDetermining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options - Group as lessee The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n\nThe Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal or termination. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate (e.g., a change in business strategy, construction of significant leasehold improvements or significant customization to the leased asset).\n\nThe Group's leases consist mainly of land, production facilities and warehouses and office buildings (land and buildings). The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of land and buildings due to the significance of these assets to its operations. These leases have a lease term of more than one year and there will be a significant negative effect on the business if a replacement is not readily available.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying contracts with customers\n\nGenerally, a valid and approved manufacturing service agreement (MSA), scheduling agreement (SA), customer accepted quote, customer forecast, and/or customer purchase order or firm delivery schedule will be in place before the Group provides services or manufacture goods for the customers. The Group is not obligated to transfer any goods or provide services until the customer submits a purchase order or firm delivery schedule under the MSA or SA, respectively. The purchase order or firm delivery schedule creates the enforceable rights and obligations and is therefore evaluated together with the MSA or SA for revenue recognition in accordance with PFRS 15.\n\n- \u00b7 Determining the timing of revenue recognition\n\nThe Group assessed that revenue from manufacturing of goods shall be recognized over time or point in time. For turnkey contracts wherein the products created have no alternative use to the Group and the Group has right to payment for performance completed to date including the related profit margin, in case of termination for reasons other than the Group's failure to perform as promised, revenue is recognized over time. For goods manufactured not covered by customer purchase orders or firm delivery schedule, revenues are recognized at a point in time. For consignment contracts, revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the Group performs.\n\n- \u00b7 Determining the method of measure of progress for revenue recognized over time\n\nThe Group measures progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation using an input method (i.e., costs incurred). Management believes that this method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services to the customer because the Group provides integration service to",

        "page_content": "produce a combined output and each item in the combined output may not transfer an equal amount of value to the customer.\n\n## Product development costs\n\nExpenditures for the development of new products or production systems are recognized as intangible assets if such expenditures, with a high degree of certainty, will result in future economic benefits for the Group. The rules require stringent criteria to be met for these development expenditures to be recognized as assets such as determining technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset. Management assessed that it is able to meet the identifiability and separability criteria provided in PAS 38, Intangible Assets, on the premise that the projects involved are in separate locations from other existing lines and that each project arises from a contractual right between the Group and each customer. Moreover, management is able to demonstrate that the projects are in the advanced stage of development.\n\n## Functional currency\n\nPAS 21, Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates , requires management to use its judgment to determine each entity's functional currency such that it most faithfully represents the economic effects of the underlying transactions, events and conditions that are relevant to the Group. In making this judgment, each entity within the Group considers the currency in which the sales prices for its goods and services are denominated and settled.\n\nIn 2021, the Group has determined that there was a change in functional currency for VIA GmbH and VIA Suzhou, wholly owned subsidiaries of VIA. In prior years, the functional currency of VIA GmbH and VIA Suzhou is Euro and RMB, respectively, and both were changed to USD since majority of its sales and purchases are denominated in this currency.\n\n## Onerous contracts -costs of fulfilling a contract\n\nWhen the Group assessed that it has contracts that are onerous, the present obligation under the contract shall be recognized and measured as a provision. The Group defines an onerous contract as a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it.\n\nThe Group applies judgment in assessing loss-making projects and determining commitment period or non-cancellable period of the contract.\n\nFurther details are disclosed in Notes 18 and 22.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe Group is currently involved in various legal proceedings. The estimates of the probable costs of the resolutions and assessments of these claims have been developed in consultation with outside counsels handling the defense in these matters and are based upon analyses of potential results. The Group currently does not believe that these proceedings and tax assessments will have a material effect on the Group's financial position. It is possible, however, that future results of operations could be materi ally affected by changes in the estimates or in the effectiveness of the strategies relating to these proceedings.\n\nFurther details are disclosed in Note 34.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet dates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. The Group based its estimates and assumptions on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n## Estimated Useful Lives (EUL) of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE)\n\nThe Group estimates the useful lives of its PPE based on expected usage, wear and tear, and technological or commercial obsolescence. The Group reviews the EUL of PPE annually. If the result of the review indicates that the PPE will continue to be used for a period longer or shorter than the existing policy and practice, the EUL is revised. The change in EUL is accounted for prospectively (no restatement of prior periods) and applied to existing assets at the time of change and to future assets to be acquired in future periods. An increase in the EUL of PPE will result in lower depreciation since the carrying values of the PPE will be depreciated over the extended remaining lives.\n\nIn 2022, the Group has concluded its assessment that most of its production machineries and equipment were historically being used in operations for about ten (10) years which is beyond the EUL of seven (7) years. The review also disclosed that the repairs being incurred for these production machineries and equipment, after seven (7) years, remain to be low or not more than 50% of the annual depreciation. Because of this, the Group changed the EUL of production machineries and equipment from seven (7) to ten (10) years (see Note 10).\n\nLease commitments - Group as lessee\n\n## Leases - Estimating the incremental borrowing rate\n\nThe Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group 'would have to pay', which requires estimation when no observabl e rates are available (such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing transactions) or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease (for example, when leases are not in the subsidiary's functional currency).\n\nThe Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain entityspecific estimates (such as the subsidiary's stand -alone credit rating).\n\n## Fair value of the financial liabilities on put options\n\nThe acquisition of VIA in 2016 and STI in 2017 included call and put options over the non-controlling interests. These options are considered when determining whether the entity has obtained control over the acquiree if in substance the entity already has access to the returns associated with that ownership interest. Management assessed that the options do not give the Group present access to the returns associated with the non-controlling interests in subsidiary and, therefore, accounted for the non-controlling interests under PFRS 10, while the financial liability was accounted for under PFRS 9 measured at the present value of the redemption amount, with a debit to a component of equity attributable to the parent.\n\nManagement assessed that the discounted, probability-weighted cash flow methodology is the appropriate model to derive the present value of the redemption amount. The key estimates and assumptions used in the valuation include impact of coronavirus pandemic, the current equity value of the acquiree, forecasted interest rate and probability of trigger events occurring. The equity value of VIA is determined using the discounted cash flow approach. The future cash flows are projected using the projected revenue growth rate of VIA. The discount rate represents the current market assessment of the risk specific to the acquiree, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the acquiree and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital. For STI, management used the market approach by approximating the EBITDA multiple taken from comparable companies of STI that are engaged in providing electronic services solutions to derive its current equity value. Management computed EBITDA as the difference of forecasted gross profit and selling and administrative expenses before depreciation and amortization.\n\nFurther details on the valuation of the put options are disclosed in Note 19.\n\n## Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables and contract assets\n\nThe Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar",

        "page_content": "loss patterns (i.e., customer type and rating, and coverage by letters of credit and other forms of credit insurance, etc.).\n\nThe provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. For instance, if forecast economic conditions (i.e., industry compounded annual growth rate) are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the manufacturing sector, the historical default rates are adjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analyzed.\n\nThe assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group's histo rical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.\n\nThe Group has considered the macroeconomic variables and loss rates in the computation of ECL. The changes in the gross carrying amount of receivables from the sales of the Group during the year did not materially affect the allowance for ECLs.\n\nFurther details on the expected credit loss are disclosed in Note 6.\n\n## Estimating NRV of inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and NRV. This requires the Group to make an estimate of the inventories' estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, costs of completion and costs necessary to make a sale to determine the NRV. In the event that NRV is lower than cost, the decline is recognized as an expense.  Further details on inventories are disclosed in Note 8.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nThe Group computes depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets with finite useful life on a straightline basis over the assets' EUL. The EUL and depreciation and amortization method are reviewed annually to ensure that these are consistent with the expected pattern of the economic benefits from the assets. This requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected asset utilization from business plans and strategies, future technical developments and market behavior to determine the expected pattern of economic benefits from the assets. Changes in the EUL or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the depreciation and amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are recognized in profit or loss, in the expense category, consistent with the function of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nFurther details on property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and right-of-use assets are disclosed in Notes 10, 11, 12 and 30, respectively.\n\n## Evaluation of impairment of nonfinancial assets\n\nThe Group reviews property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill, intangible assets and deferred charges, for impairment of value. Except for the impairment for goodwill which is assessed at least annually, the impairment evaluation for the other nonfinancial assets includes considering certain indications of impairment such as significant changes in asset usage, significant decline in assets' market value, obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends.\n\nThe Group estimates the recoverable amount as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value-inuse. In determining the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use of the assets, the Group is required to make estimates and assumptions that may affect property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, intangible assets and deferred charges. For goodwill, this requires an estimation of the recoverable amount which is the fair value less costs to sell or value-inuse of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows for the cash generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of cash flows. Further details on\n\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, deferred charges, and right-of-use assets are disclosed in Notes 10, 11, 12, 14 and 30, respectively.\n\nDetails of the impairment loss recognized are disclosed in Notes 10, 12 and 24.\n\n## Taxes\n\nUncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws and the amount and timing of future taxable profits. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience on previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences in interpretation may arise for a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the entities within the Group.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences and carryforward benefits of unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carryforward benefits of unused tax losses can be utilized. Significant judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\n\nFurther details on taxes are disclosed in Note 25.\n\n## Retirement and other employee benefits\n\nThe cost of defined benefit plans and other long-term employee benefits as well as the present value of defined benefit obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions. These include the determination of the discount rates, turnover rates, mortality rates, salary increase rates, and future retirement increases. Due to the complexity of the actuarial valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date.\n\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, with extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation. The turnover rate represents the proportion of the current plan members who will resign from service prior to their retirement date and hence, be entitled to resignation benefits instead of retirement benefits. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables and is modified accordingly with estimates of mortality improvements. Salary increase rates and future retirement increases are based on expected future inflation rates.\n\nThe Group also estimates other short-term employee benefit obligations and expenses, including the cost of paid leaves based on historical leave availments of employees, subject to the Group's policies. These estimates may vary depending on the future changes in salaries, turn-over rates, mortality rates and actual experiences during the period.\n\nFurther details on retirement and other employee benefits are disclosed in Note 27.\n\n## Onerous contracts -costs of fulfilling a contract\n\nThe Group estimates the provision on onerous contract by determining the revenues less unavoidable costs during the commitment period based on financial budgets approved by management. In determining unavoidable costs, the Group excludes other non-directly related costs such as costs of wasted materials, labor inefficiencies and other costs of resources that were not reflected in the pricing of the contract.\n\nWhere the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. Because of the time value of money, provisions relating to cash outflows that arise soon after the reporting period are more onerous",

Provisions are therefore discounted, where the effect is material.\n\nThe discount rate shall be a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The discount rate shall not reflect risks for which future cash flow estimates have been adjusted. The Group assessed that the time value of money is not applicable in the determination of the current provision as the committed periods are normally not exceeding one year.\n\nFurther details on onerous contracts are disclosed in Notes 18 and 22.\n\n## 5.

The change, which was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2022, resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of $7.63 million in 2022. The assets affected will result to a lower depreciation expense annually over its remaining life.\n\nConstruction in progress pertains to the construction and development of manufacturing production lines of the Group.

The pre-tax discount rates applied to cash flow projections follows:\n\n|        | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| STI    | -      | 11.57% |\n| VIA    | 12.01% | 19.71% |\n| STEL   | 13.37% | 13.51% |\n| IMI CZ | 12.87% | 13.79% |\n\nCash flows beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 1% to 3.47%, which does not exceed the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the area-specific electronics manufacturing services (EMS) industry, specifically on automotive, industrial equipment, consumer electronics and telecommunications segments.\n\n## Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations\n\nThe calculations of value-in-use for the CGUs are most sensitive to the following assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue Revenue forecasts are management's best estimates considering factors such as industry CAGR, existing customer contracts and projections, historical experiences and other economic factors.\n- \u00b7 Forecasted gross margins - Gross margins are based on the mix of business model arrangements with the customers. Significant assumptions include freight cost, labor costs and material costs.\n- \u00b7 Overhead and administrative expenses - estimates are based on applicable inflation rates in the respective countries of the cash generating units considering expected future cost efficiencies and production facilities rationalization.\n- \u00b7 Pre-tax discount rates - Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. This is also the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital.\n\nNo impairment loss was assessed for STEL and IMI CZ in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Sensitivity to changes in assumptions\n\nValue in use calculation is sensitive to pre-tax discount rates and inflation rate. With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of VIA, STEL and IMI CZ, an increase in the pre-tax discount rate by more than 9.43%, 0.73% and 20.90%, respectively, would result to impairment of goodwill. In addition, an increase in inflation rate affecting overhead and administrative costs by more than 67.87%, 0.67% and 3.31% for VIA, STEL and IMI CZ, respectively, would also result to impairment.",

Accordingly, the Group neither recognizes nor discloses information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions where the Group operates. However, the legislation will not be effective before 31 December 2023 and as such, there is no current tax impact for the year ended December 31, 2023. Based on the Group's Country -byCountry Report ('CbCR') for FY2023, the Group may have potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes on profits earned in the following countries, namely: IMI Bulgaria and IMI NIS Serbia, where the expected Pillar Two effective tax rate is likely to be lower than 15%. However, the potential exposure, if any, to Pillar Two income taxes is currently not known or reasonably estimable until the 2024 financial data becomes available and after carrying out the full impact assessment when the Pillar Two rules are already in effect.\n\n## 26.

The latest actuarial valuations were made on December 31, 2023.\n\nThe plan is administered by local banks as trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the investment direction of the assets. It defines the investment strategy as often as necessary, at least annually, especially in the case of significant market developments or changes to the structure of the plan participants. When defining the investment strategy, it takes into account the plan's objectives, benefit obligations and risk capacity. The investment strategy is defined in the form of a long-term target structure (investment policy). The Board of Trustees delegates the implementation of the investment policy in accordance with the investment strategy, as well as various principles and objectives to an Investment Committee, which also consists of members of the Board of Trustees, and the Treasurer. The Treasurer oversees the entire investment process.\n\nThe defined benefit plans of the Parent Company, STIPH and PSi meet the minimum retirement benefit specified under R.A. No. 7641, Retirement Pay Law , while IMI BG and IMI Serbia are in accordance with the labour legislation and the Collective Labour Contract.\n\nThe Group has net retirement liabilities attributable to the following:\n\n|                | 2023       | 2022       |\n|----------------|------------|------------|\n| Parent Company | $6,391,640 | $4,225,271 |\n| IMI BG         | 2,381,158  | 1,910,386  |\n| Psi            | (219,459)  | (225,090)  |\n| STI            | -          | 856,149    |\n| IMI Serbia     | 54,062     | 20,946     |\n|                | $8,607,401 | $6,787,662 |",

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies\n\nThe Group's principal financial instruments, composed of loans payable, long -term debt and other financial liabilities, were issued primarily to raise financing for the Group's operations. The Group has various financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, receivables and accounts payable and accrued expenses which arise directly from its operations.\n\nThe main purpose of the Group's financial instruments is to fund its operational and capital expenditures. The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk. The Group also enters into currency forwards to manage the currency risk arising from its operations and financial instruments.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are summarized below:\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its short -term and long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Group's policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group's income before income tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. There is no other impact on the Group's equity other than those already affecting income.\n\n|                                   | Effect on Net Loss before Tax   | Effect on Net Loss before Tax   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Increase/Decrease in Basis Points | 2023                            | 2022                            |\n| +100                              | ($2,178,962)                    | ($2,143,904)                    |\n| -100                              | 2,178,962                       | 2,143,904                       |\n\nThe following table shows the information about the Group's debt as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 that are exposed to interest rate risk presented by maturity profile:\n\n|                   | 2023         | 2022         |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Within one year   | $70,634,080  | $67,025,099  |\n| One to five years | 147,262,150  | 147,365,278  |\n|                   | $217,896,230 | $214,390,377 |\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. The Group's exposure to liquidity risk relates primarily to its short -term and long-term obligations. The Group seeks to manage its liquidity profile to be able to finance its capital expenditures and operations. The Group maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed sufficient to finance its operations. As part of its liquidity risk management, the Group regularly evaluates its projected and actual cash flows. To cover financing requirements, the Group intends to use internallygenerated funds and loan facilities with local and foreign banks. Surplus funds are placed with reputable banks.\n\nThe table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments:\n\n|                                         | 2023      | 2023                | 2023            | 2023         | 2023         |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                         | On Demand | Less than  3 Months | 3 to  12 Months | 1 to 5 Years | Total        |\n| Accounts payable and accrued expenses:  |           |                     |                 |              |              |\n| Trade payables                          | $-        | $197,238,858        | $-              | $-           | $197,238,858 |\n| Employee-related accruals and           | -

The Group's major credit risk exposure relates primarily to its holdings of cash and cash equivalents and receivables from customers and other third parties. Credit risk management involves dealing with institutions for which credit limits have been established. The treasury policy sets credit limits for each counterparty. The Group trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. The Group has a well-defined credit policy and established credit procedures. The Group extends credit to its customers consistent with sound credit practices and industry standards. The Group deals only with reputable, competent and reliable customers who pass the Group's credit standards. The credit evaluation reflects the customer's overall credit strength based on key financial and credit characteristics such as financial stability, operations, focus market and trade references. All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.\n\nThe Group defines a financial asset as in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full. Such internal or external information includes discontinuance of orders, financial difficulty or insolvency, probable bankruptcy or other financial reorganization. Actual historical experience shows low defaulted accounts which were also substantially recovered subsequently resulting to insignificant write-offs.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 is the carrying amounts of the financial assets. The Group's maximum exposure for cash and cash equivalents excludes the carrying amount of cash on hand.\n\nThe Group has 24% and 19% of trade receivables relating to three major customers as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aging analysis of receivables, contract assets and miscellaneous deposits follows:\n\n|                           | 2023                       | 2023       | 2023          | 2023                 | 2023          | 2023          | 2023                    |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n|                           |                            |            | Days Past Due | Days Past Due        | Days Past Due | Days Past Due | Days Past Due           |\n|                           | Total                      | Current    |               | <30 Days  30-60 Days | 60-90 Days    | 90-120  Days  | >120 Days               |\n| Receivables:              |                            |            |               |                      |               |               |                         |\n| Trade                     | $260,623,416  $206,109,745 |            | $29,531,821   | $8,138,296           | $4,955,965    |               | $1,143,199  $10,744,390 |\n| Nontrade                  | 16,590,926                 | 15,437,369 | 725,781       | 79,284               | 156,299       | 129,190       | 63,003                  |\n| Receivable from employees | 223,780                    | 208,595    | 15,185        | -

        "page_content": "## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nThe Group's foreign exchange risk results primarily from movements of the functional currency of each legal entity against other currencies. As a result of significant transactions denominated in RMB, PHP and EUR the consolidated statements of income can be affected significantly by movements in the USD versus these currencies. In 2023 and 2022, the Group entered into currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nThe Group also has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases denominated in other than the Group's functional currency. Approximately 51% and 48% of the Group's sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 53 % and 53% of costs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are denominated in currencies other than USD.\n\nThe Group manages its foreign exchange exposure risk by matching, as far as possible, receipts and payments in each individual currency. Foreign currency is converted into the relevant domestic currency as and when the management deems necessary. The unhedged exposure is reviewed and monitored closely on an ongoing basis and management will consider hedging any material exposure where appropriate.\n\nInformation on the Group's foreign currency -denominated monetary assets and liabilities and their USD equivalent follows:\n\n## Renminbi (RMB)\n\n|                                  | 2023         | 2023          | 2022         | 2022           |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|\n|                                  | In USD       | In RMB        | In USD       | In RMB         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | $1,947,777   | RMB13,795,521 | $255,404     | RMB1,778,784   |\n| Receivables                      | 9,389,369    | 66,502,083    | 13,244,212   | 92,240,641     |\n| Accounts payable and             |              |               |              |                |\n| accrued expenses                 | (10,898,081) | (77,187,838)  | (14,606,522) | (101,728,582)  |\n| Net foreign currency-denominated |              |               |              |                |\n| assets (liabilities)             | $439,065     | RMB3,109,766  | ($1,106,906) | (RMB7,709,157) |\n\n## Philippine Peso (P=)\n\n|                                               | 2023          | 2023              | 2022          | 2022            |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n|                                               | In USD        | In PHP            | In USD        | In PHP          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                     | $ 1,004,584   | P=55,623,830      | $1,044,085    | P=58,212,959    |\n| Receivables                                   | 1,345,465     | 74,498,404        | 1,249,406     | 69,660,655      |\n| Miscellaneous deposits                        | 655,805       | 36,311,942        | 649,932       | 36,236,942      |\n| Accounts payable and  accrued expenses        | (10,403,845)  | (576,060,904)     | (10,348,754)  | (576,994,759)   |\n| Net retirement liabilities                    | (11,814,529)  | (654,170,479)     | (4,313,259)   | (240,485,773)   |\n| Net foreign currency-denominated  liabilities | ($19,212,520) | (P=1,063,797,207) | ($11,718,590) | (P=653,369,976) |\n\n## Euro ( \u20ac)\n\n|                                  | 2023         | 2023           | 2022         | 2022         |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                  | In USD       | In EUR         | In USD       | In EUR       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | $ 1,922,215  | \u20ac1,737,674     | $3,081,643   | \u20ac2,899,005   |\n| Receivables                      | 24,355,149   | 22,016,949     | 15,552,641   | 14,630,894   |\n| Accounts payable and             |              |                |              |              |\n| accrued expenses                 | (33,141,647) | (29,959,905)   | (17,664,812) | (16,617,885) |\n| Net foreign currency-denominated |              |                |              |              |\n| assets (liabilities)             | ($6,864,283) | ( \u20ac 6,205,282) | $969,472     | \u20ac 912,014    |\n\nInformation on the Group's USD -denominated monetary assets and liabilities of the Parent Company's subsidiaries with functional currencies other than USD and which is also affected by movements of USD compared with their respective functional currencies as at December 31, 2023 and 2022 follows:\n\n|                                                        | 2023         | 2023         | 2023            | 2023         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n|                                                        | In USD       | In EUR       | In RMB          | In GBP       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                              | $41,539,707  | \u20ac35,077,560  | RMB19,384,715   | \u00a3 -

The reasonably possible change was computed based on one year average historical movement of exchange rates between the USD and other currencies.\n\nThere is no other impact on the Group's equity other than those already affecting income. The increase in USD rate as against other currencies demonstrates weaker functional currency while the decrease represents stronger USD value.\n\n|          | Increase/Decrease   | Effect on Net Income before Tax   | Effect on Net Income before Tax   |\n|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Currency | in USD Rate         | 2023                              | 2022                              |\n| RMB      | +1%                 | ($5,351)                          | $10,595                           |\n|          | -1%                 | 5,351                             | (10,595)                          |\n| PHP      | +1%                 | 123,838                           | 110,305                           |\n|          | -1%                 | (123,838)                         | (110,305)                         |\n| EUR      | +1%                 | 99,421                            | 6,365                             |\n|          | -1%                 | (99,421)                          | (6,365)                           |\n| USD*     | +1%                 | 184,350                           | 98,736                            |\n|          | -1%                 | (190,285)                         | (98,391)                          |\n\n*The USD-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated using EUR0.9040 for $1 and RMB7.0827 for $1.\n\n## 34.

        "page_content": "## 35. Events After the Balance Sheet Date\n\n## VIA optronics AG files Annual Report 2022 or Form 20-F\n\nVIA optronics AG ('VIA'), a leading supplier of interactive display solutions, announced on April 26, 2024 that it has filed its Annual Report on Form 20F for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the 'Annual Report') with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC').\n\nThe changes in the final audited financial statements of VIA have no material impact on the IMI's audited consolidated financial statements filed with Philippine Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission for the years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Conclusion and Findings of Internal Review\n\nAn internal review was conducted by BDO AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft ('BDO') and DLA Piper UK LLP ('DLA Piper' and, together with BDO, the 'Advisors'), who were appointed by VIA's Supervisory Board to investigate the potential incidents and to review compliance with VIA's policies and business guidelines during the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2022 (the 'Investigation Period').\n\nThe  Advisors' preliminary findings indicated deviations from the Company's compliance procedures during the Investigation Period primarily involving VIA's former Chief Executive Officer, J\u00fcrgen Eichner (Mr. Eichner).\n\nIn February 2024, the Advisors furnished a final report to the VIA Supervisory Board which identified failures by Mr. Eichner and one other employee to comply with company policies and business guidelines. In particular, the Advisors identified discrepancies that occurred during the Investigation Period in areas including expense recording and reimbursement, company credit card usage for personal transactions, the receipt of annual bonus payments in contravention of Mr. Eichner's service agreement, unearned compensation for vacation days, inadequate documentation of vehicle usage, and other unapproved payments made to Mr. Eichner.\n\nThe Advisors believe that certain of these incidents may constitute fraud and/or embezzlement, and under German law, VIA is required to initiate legal claims for the reimbursement of any such improperly transferred sums. While the total value of the impermissible transactions and any consequential damages relating thereto remains under consideration, currently the Advisors have identified improper payments amounting to a minimum of between \u20ac300,000 to \u20ac500,000 that they believe could be subject to reimbursement, plus consequential damages. The amount is not material to the consolidated financial statement of the Group.\n\nBased on these findings, the VIA Supervisory Board determined that the actions taken by Mr. Eichner in connection with his service as VIA's former CEO were material violations of his fiduciary duties and led to a loss of trust. Accordingly, on February 23, 2024, the Supervisory Board terminated the service agreement between Mr. Eichner and VIA for 'cause' and revoked the appointment of Mr. Eichner as a member of VIA's Management Board, effective immediately.\n\n## VIA Voluntary Delisting and Deregistration of its American Depositary Shares\n\nVIA announced on April 9, 2024 its intention to voluntarily delist its American Depository Shares ('ADSs') from the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE'), terminate its registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('US SEC'), and terminate its ADS program.\n\nVIA notified the NYSE on April 9, 2024 of its intent to voluntarily delist its ADSs from the NYSE, pursuant to a resolution adopted by its Supervisory Board. VIA has also notified The Bank of New York Mellon (which acts as depositary under the ADS program) of the termination of the ADS program.\n\nSubsequently, VIA filed Form 15 or Certification and Notice of Termination of Registration under Section 12(g) of the Securities Change Act of 1934 on April 29, 2024. As of reporting date, no change in the status of VIA's voluntary delisting and deregistra tion.",
