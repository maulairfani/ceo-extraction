        "page_content": "## Message from CEO\n\n## The 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan Cra/f\\_ted on the Simple Concept of Transformation\n\nIn our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, the Meiji Group introduced Meiji ROESG\u00ae* as its top management goal and it worked to realize both profit growth and sustainability activities. While we achieved our target of 13 points for Meiji ROESG in FY2022 only, we succeeded in maintaining a high level throughout the duration of the plan. Despite ROE unfortunately continuing its downward trend, the total scores were bolstered by our highly rated ESG e/fforts. Implementation of Meiji ROESG Management is putting us on par with the leading group of Japanese companies in terms of sustainability activities. I see this as the true outcome of our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\nOn the other hand, even though we were impacted by rapid rises in the price of raw materials and a protracted weakening of the yen, we take our undershooting the financial targets seriously. In light of this, we designed our 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan to return the Meiji Group to a growth trajectory. In formulating the plan, we put a strong focus on long-term transformation and fundamental management reform. Rather than short-term business improvements, this focus represents our long-term management goal. We are also placing a single concept at the center of consistent action guidelines for the Group as a whole. And the concept is simple: transformation. In our 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we will implement three transformations to achieve evolution for the Meiji Group.\n\n- * ROESG is a registered trademark for a management indicator developed by Kunio Ito, a professor at Hitotsubashi University.\n\n## Pursuing High Overseas Growth to Transform Focus Markets\n\nOur first transformation under the plan is 'transforming focus markets.' Overseas net sales for the Meiji Group currently stands at about JPY 130 billion, an overseas sales ratio representing around 12%, but we have set ourselves the challenging target of 30% by 2030. Rather than fixating on our strengths of\n\nstrong brand power and high market share in Japan, we are driving corporate transformation by changing course to target growth in overseas markets.\n\nTo achieve this goal of transforming focus markets, it is extremely important that we improve profitability of our domestic businesses at the same time. Business growth in overseas markets carries an investment risk. There is a time lag between when we make an investment and when it generates profits, so there is always an upfront cost burden. Our domestic businesses have to carry the burden of these risks and costs in focus market transformation. I am determined therefore to make drastic changes that will make these domestic businesses more profitable.\n\n## Adding Social Issues to Our Own Business Challenges to Transform Business Structure\n\nOur second transformation under the plan is 'transforming business structure.' In our 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we have identified important social issues, that are high priorities for the sustainability activities of the Meiji Group, as materialities and we have set KPIs related to each. I want to incorporate these materialities as drivers for our business structure transformation.\n\nFor example, focusing on the materiality of health and nutrition, we are implementing business reform based on the Meiji Nutritional Profiling System (Meiji NPS). While implementing product improvements according to the Meiji NPS, we aim to step out ahead of other companies in the area of package labeling and provide health information from the perspective of nutrition. Global food companies have already started labeling their packages according to their own nutrition evaluation systems. Here at the Meiji Group, we plan to incorporate our commitment to the social issue of health and nutrition into our products, and we will convert that into business growth.\n\nWe are also implementing initiatives based on the materiality of stable supply of pharmaceuticals. To achieve this, we are building a bulk drug production line at the Gifu plant of Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd. to supply antibacterial bulk drugs in Japan. We currently rely too much on overseas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 40 Sustainability Strategy Message from CSO\n\nPage 33 Food Segment Business Strategy Trade-On Initiatives\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Message from CEO\n\nsupplies of antibacterial bulk drugs. This presents an issue for achieving stable supply in an emergency. This truly is a social issue, and we are working to establish business toward solving it.\n\nIn this way, the Meiji Group will incorporate a range of social issues into its own business challenges to accelerate business reform. The direction for such transformation, based on the Meiji Group founder's spirit of 'contributing to the country through nutrition,' has become our identity. Businesses that help to address social issues are businesses that have an impact on the world and improve the lives of people. By continuing to be needed by society, they also have potential for enormous growth. This is something that we will keep in our mind as we move forward.\n\n## Encouraging Human Resources to Become Challenge and Change Leaders by Transforming Our Behavior\n\nOur third transformation under the plan is 'transforming our behavior.' First, we will reform our human resources system to encourage behavioral change among our human resources. These are people who will drive change and proactively tackle the major management goals of strengthening global expansion, fusing sustainability and business strategies, and maximizing Group value. The keywords of this human resources system reform are external competitiveness, diversity and strong ethics. For companies, the greatest capital for creating value is human capital. If we cannot achieve transformation here, then everything else is not practical. The question is how to e/ffect the behavioral change of our employees. Management reform starts from this question, so we will focus particularly on this transformation.\n\nFurthermore, we will change our organizational structure by focusing on and strengthening our functions as Meiji Holdings. At the time of our management integration, we launched Meiji Holdings as a small holding company specializing in corporate development, governance and finances for the Group. With the Group needing to unify and enhance growth potential going forward, Meiji Holdings will take the lead in pursuing the ideal form for the Group to take.\n\n## Continuing with Meiji ROESG as Top Priority and Fusing Sustainability and Business Strategies\n\nHaving decided to transform focus markets, business structure, and our behavior, we dared to establish two top priority management goals in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan. The first is Meiji ROESG as a continuation from our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, and the second is enhancing corporate value.\n\nBy setting Meiji ROESG as a top priority management goal in our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, we were able to improve employee attitudes toward ESG. I think this really helped drive our e/fforts toward sustainability. As a result, the Meiji Group has been selected by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange as one of 15 Sustainability Transformation (SX) Brands. SX Brands are a group of leading companies using SX to enhance their corporate value. Of course, rather than just being satisfied with this result, we will continue, through the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, to drive our own transformation into a Group that is able to create growth sources continuously through sustainability activities.\n\nOur goal for Meiji ROESG in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan is the fusion of sustainability and business strategies, which is a more evolved target than we set in the previous plan. Taking the opportunity of being selected as an SX Brand, we will evolve ROESG that, as I just explained when talking about transforming business structure, by incorporating social issues within our own business challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 63 Technological Development Strategy Ensuring a Reliable Supply of Critical Pharmaceuticals\n\nPage 49\n\nHuman Resource Strategy\n\nMessage from CHRO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a specific action under this plan, we will select groups of products, in each of the Food and Pharmaceutical segments, that contribute to sustainability. We will then add achievement of net sales for those products to our target indicators. We hope to deepen general understanding of our targets by highlighting accomplishment of net sales targets of our own products alongside the ratings of external evaluation bodies. ROESG is still only used rarely by companies as a KPI. However, I think that this also makes ROESG much more a part of the uniqueness of the Meiji Group.",

In the past, this was a concept expressed in things like our long-term vision and corporate philosophy. This time, we dared to express this concept as a management goal in our medium-term business plan, which is for a comparatively short period of time and is numerical in nature. This comes from the idea that the more important a business plan is, the more we believe that incorporating corporate value and improving the daily processes of management and all employees is the best approach for achieving our financial goals. A singular focus on numbers does not help us improve management. I want everyone in the Meiji Group to fully understand that we cannot achieve our financial targets without improving brand value, making upfront investments in intangible assets, and most importantly, improving engagement with employees in the process toward management improvement.\n\nWe have established four indicators for enhancing corporate value: market capitalization, brand value, employee engagement and investment in intangible assets. We will carefully monitor these indicators each year and reflect them broadly in overall management, from business strategies to investment plans and human resource policies. It is essentially only through process transformation that we can improve financial indicators. And to transform those processes, we will focus on actions that improve corporate value.\n\nWhen setting targets, we also reviewed our stakeholders. While referring to customers and shareholders/investors the same as always, we have decided to unify the way we refer to all members working in the Meiji Group as\n\n'employees,' regardless of their employment status, with the aim of recognizing them as people who grow together with the Group. We have also decided to refer to our suppliers as 'business partners' from the perspective of working together to create value. We have also added 'local communities, nature and future generations' and 'government agencies, NPO/NGOs and related bodies' to our list of stakeholders. We will also reinforce the understanding within the Group that the expectations from a wide range of stakeholders, and the necessity of engagement with those stakeholders, are prerequisites for enhancing corporate value.\n\n## More E/ffective Management of Business Portfolio-Related Strategies\n\nThe keys to successful business growth and reform are optimization of the business portfolio and appropriate investment strategies. So how should we strategically manage our portfolio? We will do that by building structures that put Meiji Holdings and our operating companies on a level footing. ROIC by business is the common language for monitoring, considering and discussing this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will make significant changes to the portfolio-related management cycle. We will also conduct new business strategy reviews based on ROIC by business. Initially, business managers in each division will join Chief O/fficers in business strategy-focused discussions. We will then decide on the directions for businesses and investments. Following this procedure, we will conduct a review of the Medium-Term Business Plan as an integrated strategy and then reflect those decisions in planning for the next\n\n<!-- image -->",

By increasing coordination between the medium-term business plan and fiscal year plan, and between management and businesses, we will develop a more e/ffective strategy. We will also simultaneously monitor multiple business strategies. We will take an overview of both segments to decide which businesses to focus our resources on. In this way, I believe we will be able to increase the e/ffectiveness of individual strategies across the whole Group.\n\n## Creating a Group Management Structure for Taking on Global Markets\n\nWe also plan to dramatically strengthen the Group management structure. This is because a global risk management structure is essential for transforming focus markets. We will strengthen oversight of the Group by connecting governance-specific audits at Meiji Holdings with internal audits at each operating company. At the same time, we have to build a global-level business management structure. From FY2027, the Meiji Group plans to transition to an IFRS Accounting Standard, which we will fully prepare for as well.\n\nWe will also consolidate the various functional strategy departments previously spread around the operating companies, and bring them into Meiji Holdings, which will become the new command center for the Group. Specifically, Meiji Holdings will take the initiative to strengthen and expand the four functional strategies: technology development, intellectual property, digital technology and communication. In fact, Meiji Holdings already established its intellectual property strategy department in FY2023. In all functional strategies, we aim to stimulate innovation and reduce risks through higher quality activities.\n\nPage 64 Creating Innovation | Intellectual Property Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Continuing to Provide Universal Social Value to Become an Essential Company for the Next 100 Years\n\nWithin the Meiji Group, we will use the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan as a launching pad to respond to the expectations of our stakeholders by transforming ourselves, returning to a growth trajectory, and delivering much higher corporate value. And at the root of these e/fforts is the unwavering philosophy of the Group. The history of the Meiji Group spans more than 100 years, and the reason for that achievement is that we have continually provided universal social value. For 100 years, we have been charged by society with the responsibility for solving the health issues of people. I believe this is what has enabled us to develop in the way we have. Going forward, we will continue to pursue businesses that create social value globally while protecting our uniqueness. I want the Meiji Group to be needed by society for the next 100 years as well.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

I see my mission as helping to evolve Meiji ROESG Management from both financial and non-financial perspectives so that we can improve corporate value sustainably. I have worked for many years in the food business, in areas such as corporate development, budget management and marketing. Leveraging this experience, I will endeavor to improve ROE and enhance engagement with capital markets to increase market capitalization, which is a clear indication of corporate value.\n\nROE can be broken down into return on sales, total asset turnover, and financial leverage. Financial leverage varies according to capital demand and other factors. Right now, we are preparing for large-scale investments in the future by expanding borrowing capacity and equity. It is therefore a top priority that we improve return on sales and total asset turnover. Our aim in this is to achieve our ROE target by improving ROIC. We introduced ROIC management in the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan and have been continually improving its operation. In our 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we began specifying business-specific ROIC targets in the Food segment. However, we will further expand the spread going forward by strengthening dialogue with shareholders and investors with a focus on medium- to long-term improvement in corporate value. At the same time, we will further work on improving company-wide asset e/fficiency, enabled by reducing cross-shareholdings, and withdrawing from or transferring unprofitable businesses.\n\nAs part of the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we will focus on fusion of sustainability and business strategies ('Trade-on'). This means fusing financial and non-financial areas, and linking non-financial areas to corporate value. My role is to support initiatives to achieve this and to actively communicate with capital markets.\n\nEstablish a Foundation for Growth in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan with Price Increases Taking Root in the Food Segment and Structural Reforms Progressing in the Pharmaceutical Segment\n\nOur consolidated financial results in FY2023 showed increases in net sales and operating profit. This was due to price increases and other e/fforts exceeding increased costs in the Food segment. It was also helped by increased demand for antibacterial drugs and improved production and sales e/fficiency in the Pharmaceutical segment. We achieved increased gain on sales of investment securities. However, our profit attributable to owners of parent decreased a/f\\_ter posting an impairment loss. This was the result of posting an equity method loss due to declining profitability at AustAsia Group Ltd., our equity-method a/ffiliate in China. It was also due to declining business performance of our drinking milk and yogurt business for the consumer market in China.\n\nCompared to our initial target for operating profit in the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, we significantly underachieved due to the impact of losses in the Food segment. As a result, our ROE fell. On the other hand, we continued structural reforms and strengthened our revenue platform in the Pharmaceutical segment. Price increases took root in the\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this way, we were able to establish a foundation for growth in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\nIn terms of our financial situation, we achieved an equity-to-asset ratio of 61.9% and debt-to-equity ratio of 0.07. Despite high financial soundness, there were issues from the perspective of growth. We fell considerably short of our initial plan with capital expenditures of JPY 218.7 billion over the three years. However, we made sure to make the investment necessary for growth in our overseas business. At the same time, the book value of our cross-shareholdings contracted by a cumulative total of 41.6% over the period. This reduction exceeded our target of 30% in the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\n## Strengthening Business Management through ROIC to Reshape the Business Portfolio\n\nThe concept behind our 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan is 'The Evolution of Meiji ROESG Management.' We aim to return to a growth trajectory by transforming focus markets, business structure, and our behavior. As CFO, I am keenly aware of the need to reshape our business portfolio to achieve sustainable growth. Our core businesses such as yogurt have driven growth in the past. I expect to achieve stable growth by focusing on these profit centers. We will then actively allocate cash generated from our core domestic businesses to future growth in overseas and B2B businesses in the Food segment, and research and development in the Pharmaceutical segment.\n\nWe will also strengthen our business management through ROIC to reshape our business portfolio. Increased costs were the major cause of lower Food segment ROIC during the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan. However, our management system also had issues. The first issue was that it was unclear who had responsibility for each business, as the management unit for ROIC, in an organization divided by function. The second issue was that the ROIC management unit was too fragmented. Under the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, the organization in charge of the Food segment has been changed to a system of business divisions with the general managers of each division having responsibility for the ROIC of that division. With overseas businesses also incorporated into the business divisions, we will improve capital e/fficiency globally. In addition, we manage ROIC through four business units (excluding others) in the Food segment and three business units in the Pharmaceutical segment. We will utilize the ROIC tree to identify and improve issues for each business.\n\nWe will also update the way we manage invested capital. In investment decisions, we apply the payback period method using discounted cash flow (DCF). Previously, we used the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as the discount rate across the board. Going forward, we will set\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndiscount rates by segment (hurdle rates) and adjust them according to risks, including capital expenditures, M&A activity, and whether domestic or overseas. In terms of monitoring, we previously conducted monitoring of investments. In addition to this, we have newly established business strategy reviews to be conducted by business division general managers. In the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we set a target ROIC of 8.5% against company-wide WACC of 5%. However, this is only a point along the path to our ROIC aim of 10% or more.\n\n## Strengthen Business Management through ROIC\n\nSteadily expand spread and aim to achieve ROIC level of 10% in the future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                         | FY2021       | FY2022       | FY2023       | FY2024 Plan   | FY2026 Target   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| ROIC (Consolidated)                     | 8.4%         | 6.3%         | 6.2%         | 7.0%          | 8.5% or more    |\n| Adjusted NOPLAT                         | JPY 67.3 bn  | JPY 51.6 bn  | JPY 51.1 bn  | -             | -               |\n| Invested capital (Average of two terms) | JPY 801.1 bn | JPY 822.9 bn | JPY 822.3 bn | -             | -               |\n| ROIC (Food)                             | 9.8%         | 6.3%         | 6.3%         | 7.5%          | 9% or more      |\n| ROIC (Pharmaceutical)                   | 6.6%         | 8.0%         | 7.7%         | 8.0%          | 11% or more     |\n\n## Total Return Ratio of 50% or More to Enhance Shareholder Returns\n\nWe will preferentially allocate operating cash flow to Japan and overseas growth investments. Our M&A activities will be based on debt financing. We will also set an upper debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5 times.\n\nFor shareholder returns, we have set a target for a total return ratio of 50% or more. We also aim to continuously increase dividends per share. We have set total shareholder returns, for the three years of the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, at JPY 120 billion or more. We will also spend JPY 30 billion for share buybacks in FY2024. We will conduct opportunistic share buybacks going forward depending on our cash position and stock price trends. As CFO, I will further engage in dialogue with shareholders and investors, and proactively provide feedback internally, with the aim of building trust by improving management.",

This was due to recording share of loss of entities accounted for using equity method and impairment loss related to the China business in the Food segment. ROE was 6.9%, and ROIC was 6.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, we sold cross-shareholdings of approximately JPY 14.0 billion. The equity ratio was 61.9%, maintaining a strong financial structure. Therefore, we increased our annual dividend for the 10th consecutive year, achieving the target payout ratio of 40% in our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\n## Three-year Summary by Segment\n\n## Food Segment\n\nOur top priority was to respond to rising raw material costs, and our success in tackling the key issue of recovering from the stagnation in our core business was limited. In addition, overseas business performed well in the U.S., but impairment losses were incurred in a part of the China business. As a result of this and other factors, e/fforts to expand overseas business were only partially successful.\n\n## Pharmaceutical Segment\n\nWe succeeded in implementing structural reforms and shi/f\\_ting to a business model that can ensure stable profits. The Overseas Ethical Pharmaceuticals business also expanded steadily, and we strengthened the pipeline that will drive future growth, including the acquisition of mRNA technology.",

        "page_content": "## Discussion with Outside Directors\n\n## Looking back at our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, how would you rate its implementation?\n\nMr. Kawata: The 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan was launched with challenging targets driven by the momentum of the times. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic and other dramatic changes in the business environment meant that those targets were not achieved. As one of the plan's key strategies, globalization produced reasonable results if you look at sales growth alone, but its contribution to profits was lacking. Despite the Group's hard work throughout the three years of the plan, there were a number of quantitative and qualitative issues that remained. They now need to be addressed by the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\nMr. Pedersen: I was very impressed with the new Meiji ROESG Management concept put forward in the plan, and e/fforts to put it into practice. However, my impression is that globalization, diversity and cultural reform, as important issues for the Meiji Group, were le/f\\_t half-done. These three strategies are the foundations for further growth for the Group. The 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan was a/ffected by changes in the business environment as Mr. Kawata just mentioned. This resulted in energy being put into achieving the KPIs, leaving no time to spend on improving the organizational culture. This has le/f\\_t major issues to be addressed in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\n## MESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\n## Do you have any comments about how the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan was formulated?\n\nMr. Kawata: Discussions were quite fruitful. We debated major directions in the Board of Directors and held several meetings outside of the Board as well where we had extensive discussions with relevant people. In light of our review of our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, we Outside Directors also participated actively in putting together the final plan.\n\nMr. Pedersen: I agree that the process of formulating the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan worked very well, with active involvement of the Outside Directors in discussions and making necessary adjustments as they went.\n\nMr. Kawata: Transformation is an important keyword in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, but the question going forward will be how committed the Meiji Group is to accomplishing it. This refers to transformation of focus markets, business structure, and our behavior. Changing focus markets means globalization. Changing business structure refers to how far sustainability management can permeate. And changing our behavior means reforming the organizational culture and increasing human resource value. Transformation of organizational culture in particular, including DE&I, is important because it will lead to expansion of globalization. These are all extremely di/fficult challenges, and the future of the Meiji Group will depend on its commitment to them. Therefore, the three years of the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan will be a crucial period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMr. Pedersen: I personally feel that three years is too short for executing a medium-term business plan. In these current times, it is natural that forecasts become imprecise as society changes, but three years does not leave enough time for a recovery shot. Of course, we will need to discuss the ideal period of time for a medium-term business plan in the future. We also need to ask and consider the opinions of our younger employees when formulating a plan, and we need to do that with plenty of time to spare. A/f\\_ter all, engagement is achieved through a sense of ownership, initiative, and spontaneity. As much as possible, we need to reflect the ideas of the younger generation, as the leaders of the future, about what they want the Meiji Group to become. Engagement will not increase without a sense of having contributed to the creation of the medium-term business plan. This might be an additional step, but it is a necessary step to increase engagement. This is the process that I would like to propose we follow when formulating the next medium-or long-term business plans.\n\nMr. Kawata: At present, the Meiji Group are considering a long-term vision. We Outside Directors are also contributing to this discussion. If we can incorporate feedback from our younger employees from the front lines at this time, as Mr. Pedersen just said, I believe that we will create a more substantive vision. Ideally, the vision would be one that all employees would want to achieve as their own. We could then work back from that vision to plan and incorporate into single-year plans. I would be keen to support this type of management.",

        "page_content": "## Discussion with Outside Directors\n\nRegarding the need to transform the organizational culture, where are the issues and what needs to be changed?\n\nMr. Pedersen: The Meiji Group employees are both diligent and dedicated in their work. However, it is not necessarily the case that all our employees would endorse the Group purpose and work with conviction. At the same time, insu/fficient e/ffort is being spent in giving people on the front lines 'license to innovate' and 'license to create.' In other words, giving them the freedom to o/ffer opinions that lead to transformation and creation. A company that combines these two things-employees taking ownership of the company purpose, and employees being given license to do things-naturally leads to innovation. And with innovation, motivation also increases. We have to create a positive cycle like this.\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nABOUT THE MEIJI GROUP\n\n## MESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nMr. Kawata: I would like to put the issue that Mr. Pedersen just spoke about on the agenda for the Board of Directors. The Board is in charge of making decisions related to important investments and business strategies. However, I want to take this to a higher level and discuss topics that may be a little vague but must be addressed anyway. Regarding organizational culture, we also need to understand the situation of how much psychological safety employees have in the workplace, whether they are really taking a bottom-up approach in their discussions, and how the management line is functioning in that process. And from there, how do we guide organizational culture reform and link it to changed behaviors. I want to have in-depth discussions on these things at the Board of Directors level.\n\nWhat strategies are you focusing on in implementing the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan?\n\nFrom the level of the Board of Directors, we should create a culture of active and free discussion that can be used as an influential model within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMr. Pedersen: Fusion of sustainability and business strategies can express the uniqueness of the Meiji Group. This has enormous potential to highlight the Meiji brand ever more. The Meiji Group has spent several years building the foundations for addressing the fusion of sustainability and business strategies. Now the Meiji Group is going on the o/ffense with the Meiji Sustainable Products Certification System and the Meiji Nutritional Profiling System (Meiji NPS). Vigorous promotion of these systems will lead to improved customer loyalty, so we would like to use them to achieve results in this Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\nMr. Kawata: Globalization is another important strategy. Enormous e/ffort is needed to meet the expectations of stakeholders, and constant awareness of globalization in normal business operations and organizational management is required. In this Medium-Term Business Plan, we need to maintain global contacts through online and other channels, and to more fully understand the situation on the front lines of business. Discussions in the Board of Directors should not be too focused on the minute details of individual topics. Nevertheless, we should actively participate and share information on topics related to improving corporate value.\n\nMr. Pedersen: The Meiji Group does not yet have the mindset of a global company. It is still at the stage of just establishing overseas sites. In this Medium-Term Business Plan, it should transform itself into a single team conducting business on a global scale.",

        "page_content": "## Discussion with Outside Directors\n\n## What are your thoughts on corporate governance within the Meiji Group?\n\nMr. Pedersen: Corporate governance can be considered as having at least three layers; operational governance, global governance, and social governance. Of these, operational governance acts as the foundation. As an indicator for this layer, the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors is extremely high.\n\nMr. Kawata: I agree that e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors is at a high level. Going forward, we want to develop an even stronger culture within the Board, with no barriers between Internal and Outside Directors and lively discuss many future-oriented topics.\n\nMr. Pedersen: As he says, we need to spend more time on free discussions of important management topics without regard to our position inside or outside the company. We plan to hold several o/ffsite meetings this fiscal year for just this purpose, and I am very much looking forward to them.\n\nMr. Kawata: There is an increasing number of management issues to tackle that cannot be addressed with knowledge accumulated within the company alone. The primary role of the Board of Directors is to make decisions about these issues using the combined expertise of individual directors. We currently have four Outside Directors, each di/fferent from the others, so naturally we get di/fferent opinions. Thanks to this diversity on the Board, discussions can proceed with a\n\n## MESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND\n\nCORPORATE VALUE\n\nmore three-dimensional, comprehensive view of each topic. I just spoke about the need for organizational culture reform within the Meiji Group. We need to start from the Board of Directors, the top of the organization, by creating a culture of more frank, active, and free discussions that can be influential within the company as a model for the workplace.\n\nMr. Pedersen: We have to improve operational governance in this way to make global governance work, but the fact is that the Board does not really have a full grasp on how global strategy is progressing. We need to create systems and practices that enable regular discussions with the executives in charge of each global site, thereby making management and investment decisions based on an understanding of the actual situation of each business. And then, we are addressing social governance, at the top of three layers, more than\n\nother companies. However, our share price has not been traded as a premium unfortunately, just because we are implementing ROESG management. The awareness of capital markets overall also needs to change for social governance to truly function. I hope that initiatives of the Meiji Group serve as opportunities for investors to evaluate us from the long-term perspective.\n\nMr. Kawata: If I may o/ffer another opinion from the governance perspective, the Meiji Group currently operates under a holding company structure and I think we have to reconsider what a holding company should be. Of course, we are pursuing synergies between food and pharmaceutical businesses, but the reality is that bringing out synergies across all levels of the businesses is di/fficult. However, realizing synergies in management is very much possible, and I think appointing holding company chief o/fficers to oversee areas spanning the Group to improve\n\nWe should leverage the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan to increase employee engagement and unlock the potential for innovation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also need to strengthen the functions of the holding company by demonstrating the combined strength of the Meiji Group and further improving external relations and communication abilities.\n\n## Is the Meiji Group attempting to increase corporate value by elevating non-financial value to the level of financial value?\n\nMr. Kawata: The Meiji Group is pursuing economic and social value through the fusion of sustainability and business strategies, and it should be commended for its e/fforts. It is tackling a number of critical social issues, including the problems of biodiversity and malnutrition around the world. Although di/fficult to quantify the Group's contributions, its e/fforts to become involved and solve these issues should nevertheless be highlighted. This would enable our employees also to have pride in being a member of the Meiji Group, and it would raise awareness of the fusion of sustainability and business strategies. And this should lead to improved corporate value. Although this initiative does not link immediately to financial value and it is not easily reflected in the share price, it will be an extremely important initiative in the long run. It really comes down to integrity as a company. I consider that improving both financial and non-financial value, while improving this integrity, is a major issue to address in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\nABOUT THE MEIJI GROUP\n\n## MESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nMr. Pedersen: The share price of a company reflects expectations for that company. The Meiji Group share price shows expectations for new innovation from the Group, including in areas of non-financial value, creation of new markets one a/f\\_ter another, and growth. The various strengths of the Meiji Group, from sustainability to brand promises, are still disjointed. Therefore, the major challenges going forward are to create a single story to connect these elements and to communicate internally and externally the potential for innovation. This is the purpose behind Meiji ROESG management, and if the Meiji Group really drives the fusion of sustainability and business strategies, then it should be able to achieve this integration as well.\n\n## What are your future aspirations as Outside Directors and your expectations for the Meiji Group going forward?\n\nMr. Kawata: I view my position as an Outside Director to be to bring three perspectives to the table; a perspective on business management, a perspective on what the holding company structure should be, and a perspective on globalization. I have been involved in several global mergers and acquisitions in the past, including some failures. However, the knowledge I gained through all these cases is as relevant now as it was then, so I hope to use it to contribute to the growth of the Meiji Group in the global market. Regarding how the Board of Directors should operate, I hope to collaborate with the other Outside Directors to take the Board to an even higher level of e/ffectiveness with a future orientation rather\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthan a conventional one. I see great potential for growth in the Meiji Group, and it is our mission as Directors to help it realize this potential. Having strong ownership, I am determined to carry out the three transformations put forward in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\nMr. Pedersen: I want the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan to be used to increase employee engagement. Rather than just emphasizing the achievement of KPIs, I want to establish a culture of employees creating and executing their own preferred business plans. This can be done by asking them, early in the process, what they personally want to do to help realize the Medium-Term Business Plan. Achieving the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, while improving feelings of participation and increasing engagement among our employees in this way, will allow the Meiji Group to jump to the next stage. As an Outside Director, I also want to go beyond just being a monitor on the Board to become a participating stakeholder in the Board in the future. With highly motivated involvement in the business front lines as well, I will be able to gain a better understanding of the actual situation and be more e/ffective in my role. While this means much more responsibility, I personally believe it will make the job more interesting. By going beyond my own role here, I hope to help the Meiji Group become even better.",

Therefore, we will work to improve capital e/fficiency using ROIC. We will continuously improve our operating profit margin led by sales growth and cost reduction, and control invested capital.\n\nIn addition, we will invest approximately JPY 350 billion as part of our three-year cash allocation policy to improve corporate value. These investments will mainly use cash inflows from operating cash flow and asset reduction as the main source of funds. We will aggressively invest in growth fields, including M&A, utilizing debt financing.\n\nAs our policy for returns to shareholders, we are aiming for a total return ratio of 50% or more in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan.

We are also aiming for overseas net sales of the whole Group of JPY 154.0 billion (overseas net sales ratio of 13.3%).\n\n## Food Segment\n\n## Pharmaceutical Segment\n\nNet sales are projected to increase 1.5% year on year to JPY 913.8 billion. In Japan, we will firmly establish the price increases implemented in the previous fiscal year, strengthen the value of existing brands, and launch high-value-added products.

We will also expand the scope of sales through the development of products with unique value.\n\n## Operating profit\n\n## Variance Analysis (JPY bn)\n\nNet sales are projected to increase 19.3% year on year to JPY 245.8 billion. We will work to stabilize our supply of antibacterial drugs, which continue to be in high demand due to the epidemic of various infectious diseases caused by the recovery in people's activities.

In the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, we failed to meet our numerical targets. However, we were able to make investments for the future in Japan and overseas. Based on this business foundation, we will build strong sales and profits globally by creating products with unique Meiji value and contributing to society.\n\n## Summary of the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan\n\n## Growth Strategy Stagnates While Dealing with Cost Increases\n\nLaunched in FY2021, our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan was met with unexpected changes in the business environment, resulting in poor results in terms of profits in particular. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic dragging on, supply chains as a whole were disrupted with Russia-Ukraine conflict. We had to deal with not only higher raw material and energy costs, but skyrocketing packaging and logistics costs as well. As a result, raw material and other costs rose by more than JPY 60 billion over the three years of the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan. This had a dramatic impact on profits despite implementing a range of measures, including price increases , specification changes, and smaller package sizes. At the same time, Japan's domestic economy contracted and we had to continue focusing our e/fforts on\n\nbrand protection, so new product development stagnated. To continue growing into the future, we need to keep developing best-selling products that lead to the creation of new markets. The development of such structures is a major part of the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\nOne of our key issues in the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan was expanding overseas business, and we actively invested in that area. Although we achieved solid growth in the U.S. and Europe, we were less successful than planned in China, where expectations were high. We struggled in the dairy business in particular, with drinking milk and yogurt. We experienced pandemic-related delays in the time it took from the construction of our plants to their operation, and we were impacted by deteriorating market conditions. We urgently need to rebuild our business in China, so we have created a revival plan. In our 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we will ensure to implement this plan, and then accelerate business growth overseas.",

The first is taking on the challenge of new market creation and restoring growth potential.\n\nTo restore growth potential, we will rebuild the process for creating best-selling products as the source of such growth. We will start by holding cross-divisional product development meetings. We will adopt a gate system for discussing whether products satisfy unmet needs at the concept stage and then determining whether they move on to implementation. In this way, we aim to encourage problem-solving product planning that creates new markets. Furthermore, we are adopting the Meiji Sustainable Products Certification System and the Meiji Nutritional Profiling System (Meiji NPS) as ways to add new value to Meiji products. In the future, all products in the Food segment will pass through these two filters.\n\nWe also plan to further drive open innovation to develop new markets. So far, we have launched the Meiji Accelerator Program in collaboration with startup companies, and the meiji Business Development (mBD) for developing new businesses through an internal application process. Both of these initiatives are already producing results. One outcome from the mBD program is FRESH CHEESE STUDIO, a new brand that conveys the\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nABOUT THE MEIJI GROUP\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\nappeal of freshly produced dairy products. Through such successful e/fforts, our younger employees in particular are increasingly motivated to take on new challenges. We will build a new marketing model that e/ffectively promotes such added value to customers.\n\nPage 33\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Focusing on B2B Business as a Promising Growth Area and Creating New Markets for Commercial Users\n\nB2B business is another promising growth area. In the past, the role that B2B business in the Food segment played for us was mainly in processing and selling our excess production. For this reason, we would always prioritize the products for the consumer market if consumer demand increased. However, in the case of the commercial market, profitability can be increased according to the level of processing required. There is enormous potential for creating new markets by focusing the abundant resources of our Food segment on meeting the needs of commercial users. We also opened the Meiji Application Center to expand business opportunities. We invite customers from the food manufacturing industry and restaurant businesses, and through direct dialogue with them, we can develop products tailored to their needs. In this B2B business concept, our aim is to transform from raw material manufacturer to processed food manufacturer. Therefore, we are working to energize this business by recruiting human resources with lots of new ideas from the younger generation in particular.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further Development of the Global Market Also an Essential Strategy for Growth\n\nTo achieve further growth, we have to increase our focus on overseas business. In China, we plan to fundamentally reform our dairy business. On the other hand, we are also developing the markets for our strongly-performing chocolate and ice cream businesses by developing products that meet local needs and implementing sales strategies through collaborations with foreign-owned supermarkets.\n\nIn the U.S., our chocolate business is growing strongly. Meiji brand products for the large supermarket chains are strong. In fact, they exceeded sales of our local mainstay brand products in FY2023. In Asia, in addition to our chocolate business, we are focusing on the nutrition business, including infant formula and enteral formula products. We plan to expand our businesses there while helping to solve health issues faced by local populations. In Europe, we are experiencing extremely strong sales of our cube-type infant formula, through a collaboration with Danone, and we are expanding our sales areas.\n\n## Page 34\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan\n\n|                     |            |   FY2023 Result |   FY2024 Plan | FY2026 Target (vs. FY2023)   |\n|---------------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------------|\n|                     | Net sales  |            24.3 |          31   | 60.3 (+147.2%/+35.9)         |\n|                     | Op.

To improve ROIC, we have to grow operating profit, as its numerator. As already explained, we will create profits through new initiatives, but there is also a pressing need to reinforce our core domestic businesses, including yogurt and chocolate, as products that contribute considerably to profits. We are repositioning the businesses as stable earner and targeting stable profits by increasing the added value in the products. For example, the functional yogurt market is becoming saturated with new competition continually entering the market. Therefore, we aim to develop marketing structures that remind customers of the appeal of Meiji yogurt products based on outstanding lactobacilli. In terms of chocolate, we are making a shi/f\\_t toward development of products that increase the value of cocoa. In particular, the concept of sustainability is more incorporated into product\n\n## Operating Profit Margin Improvement (JPY bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Invested Capital Control\n\n- \u00b7 Reduction of assets, focusing on optimization of production system and reduction of fixed costs\n- \u00b7 Aggressive investment in growth areas with reduced resources \u2192Invested capital will increase compared to FY2023, but the amount of increase will be controlled.\n\n6.3\n\n%\n\nABOUT THE MEIJI GROUP\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nSTRATEGY\n\ndevelopment and sales strategies. Our aim is to increase awareness that Meiji chocolate is a product that contributes to society, and to build trust so that customers continue to choose the Meiji brand.\n\nIn terms of invested capital, as the denominator for calculating ROIC, we will invest in growth areas according to clear criteria while retiring equipment without hesitation if it o/ffers no promise of returns. We will become much stricter in our assessment of return on investment, and make sure to optimize production systems and reduce fixed costs. While doing so, we will be resolute in our decisions should there be a need to correct plant operations or workforces. We will work to improve each business in this way, focusing on both the numerator and denominator of ROIC, and we will improve competitiveness and capital e/fficiency (see the diagram below).\n\n| 10% 15% Company-wide WACC 5% Hurdle rate for the Food segment 6%   | 10% 15% Company-wide WACC 5% Hurdle rate for the Food segment 6%                                                 | 10% 15% Company-wide WACC 5% Hurdle rate for the Food segment 6%                                                                |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dairy                                                              | \u00b7 Rebuild China business                                                                                         | \u00b7 Enhance proposals for value-added products \u00b7 Establish optimal production system \u00b7 Discontinue or restage low-profit products |\n| Chocolate                                                          | value on products \u00b7 Develop global brands                                                                        |                                                                                                                                 |\n| Nutrition Food                                                     | \u00b7 Cultivate new domestic markets  (infant formula, femcare, etc.) \u00b7 Evolve marketing methods                     |                                                                                                                                 |\n| solutions                                                          | \u00b7 Expand areas to overseas                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                                                    | \u00b7 Grow B2B business through new cacao  ingredients and value-added dairy products \u00b7 Reform low-profit businesses | \u00b7 Grow B2B business through new cacao  ingredients and value-added dairy products \u00b7 Reform low-profit businesses                |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * ROIC by business is a simplified calculation (NOPLAT + Share of profit and loss of entities accounted for using equity method/Invested capital in a single year)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Vision for the Food Segment\n\n## Spreading the Joy of Eating to Create a Fulfilling and Healthy World\n\nOur aim through the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan is to restore growth potential and become a Group that continually develops into the future. While cherishing our founder's spirit of 'contributing to the country through nutrition,' we need to remind the world about the joy of eating. Everything about eating leads to enjoyment, from sight to smell and taste, and the physical processes of chewing and swallowing. And this enjoyment ensures a healthy mind and body. By sharing these thoughts with as many people as possible, we will create a fulfilling and healthy world through eating, and contribute to the creation of a sustainable society.

We promote new product development that links sustainability to economic value based on the Meiji Sustainable Products Certification System and the Meiji Nutritional Profiling System. We also make full use of DX to develop solutions that help address personal health issues.\n\n## The Meiji Sustainable Products Certification System Adds Social Value to Products and Changes Patterns of Consumption\n\nThe Meiji Sustainable Products Certification System is an internal product certification system. It certifies products that are associated with sustainability activities that help address social issues in the chain of processes from new product development through to provision to customers. Products are certified as sustainable products if they satisfy four or more of the five standards we have set, as shown in the figure below. In the future, we will be able to show a product's social value, or its contribution to sustainability, in addition to the conventional product values of taste, quality, function, and package design. While increasing interest in the Meiji brand, this will also bring innovation to the patterns of consumption of our customers.\n\n## Sustainability innovation to resolve social issues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthus far\n\n## Evaluate and certify based on 5 standards\n\n- 1.

Reducing environment load in production, logistics and product designs\n- * Make a certain level of fulfillment of parameters set for each standard for requirement for certification\n- * Going forward, standards and requirements for certification are subject to change\n\n## The Meiji NPS Brings to Focus on Product Nutrition to Help to Solve Health Problems\n\nThe Meiji Nutritional Profiling System (Meiji NPS) clarifies the nutrients required in a Japanese diet according to di/fferent life stages. It is one of our material sustainability activities to address the specific health issues of each generation and region. Rather than being an internal system only, we are developing the Meiji NPS with the involvement of governments and companies so that it becomes the default nutritional profiling system in society as a whole.\n\nMeiji NPS  |  Nutrition Initiatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Immunology Testing Service to Help Address Health Issues of Individual Customers\n\nOne of our new solution services, based on digital technologies, is the Immunology Testing Service. The service was developed by fusing the food and healthcare knowledge of the Meiji Group with the testing platform technologies of H.U. Group. Customers collect a sample of saliva at home, which is tested for immune status, and the results and lifestyle advice are then sent to the customer's smartphone or other device. From our many years of immunology research, we recognize the importance of immune status for helping people lead healthier lives. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, more people have needed to be able to monitor one's own immune status. We therefore developed this service in collaboration with H.U. Group, a leading company in clinical laboratory testing and in vitro diagnostics. Going forward, we will work on developing solutions for visualizing health status outside the area of immunology as well.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have also created structures for driving business growth, with the heads of each business division now also having responsibility for their profits in overseas markets. We will accelerate growth by proactively investing our management resources and turning the unique Meiji value in our products and technologies into a competitive advantage aligned with the needs of each region and market.\n\n## Dairy Business and Food Solutions Business (Drinking Milk, Yogurt, Ice Cream, B2B, etc.)\n\nIn China, we started operations at our new plants in Guangzhou and Shanghai in 2024 as part of a new system for supplying products tailored to local needs. Going forward, we plan to launch a series of new products o/ffering unique value, such as our Hokkaido Flavor Yogurt .\n\nWe are also rebuilding our sales strategy from scratch for the drinking milk and yogurt business. Emphasizing profitability, while ensuring stock keeping unit (SKU) management locally, we are reviewing the sale of unprofitable products and transactions with customers. On the other hand, B2B business sales exceeded the sales to the consumer market in FY2023, so B2B products are a growth area with a greater presence in China. Demand is quite high for our products, which are rated highly for quality as customers understand that value exceeds price. We will therefore further develop these markets with high value-added products that leverage the technological strengths we have developed over many years.\n\n## China, Asia Focus area\n\n- \u00b7 Review of sales areas to consider profitability \u00b7 Cost reduction and optimization of production structure\n- \u00b7 Increase the composition ratio of value-added products and strengthen the B2B business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHokkaido Flavor Yogurt Launched in June 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABOUT THE MEIJI GROUP\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n## Chocolate Business (Chocolate, etc.)\n\nIn the U.S., we are ramping up production capacity to meet increasing demand for Meiji brand products for large supermarket chains, in addition to local Stau/ffer brand products. We are enhancing new marketing initiatives that are attracting attention, including use of billboards at Major League Baseball stadiums where Japanese players are active. In the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, expenses for production capacity expansion will be incurred upfront, but the top line will grow steadily.\n\nIn China, we tripled production capacity with the opening of a new Guangzhou plant and production line expansion at our Shanghai plant.

Working to expand innovative new drugs globally using a business foundation that supports solid earnings. We will achieve strong growth going forward as an indispensable pharmaceutical company in society. And as the driving force for the Meiji Group into the future, I will lead the way with confidence in the Pharmaceutical segment.\n\n## Summary of the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan\n\nConcentrating Our Management Resources in the Area of Infectious Diseases and Turning National Strategies into Our Own Growth Strategies\n\nThe 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan was launched into the turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we achieved a record operating profit for two consecutive years, FY2022 and FY2023. We took the opportunity of the pandemic to transform our business portfolio and focus our resources on the area of infectious diseases, which has always been our forte. From these initiatives, we developed an infectious disease control platform with a good reception in society. It has also contributed to our strong performance.\n\nIn the Pharmaceutical segment, we hold a major share of the market for antibacterial drugs. These drugs are essential in the treatment of infectious diseases and prevention of infectious diseases during surgical operations. Very few pharmaceutical companies in Japan are able to manufacture antibacterial drugs. The COVID-19 pandemic also showed the\n\nvulnerabilities of the domestic supply structures for these drugs, so that the government is making moves to strengthen the value chain. This resulted in some of our antibacterial drugs, classed as essential drugs, being excluded from the list of drugs subject to NHI drug price revisions. From the perspective of economic security, the government has selected certain drugs as specified critical materials that must be produced domestically. Penicillin-based antibacterial drugs, which are our core products, are included in those drugs. We are therefore working to develop a production structure from bulk drug through to final products. Antibacterial drugs are now important pharmaceutical drugs that need stable supplies. With responsibility for supply, we have the opportunity to turn such national strategies into our own growth strategies.\n\nBy driving structural reforms during the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, we were able to build a solid operating foundation as a company with a role in controlling infectious diseases. With su/fficient capacity for investment, we are in a position to take on the challenge of innovative drug discovery. In this way, we will continue to grow and aim for great progress.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will work to grow our stable earnings base, built on antibacterial drugs and vaccines, while expanding into new markets with new drugs and generic drugs (see the figure below).\n\nIn terms of new drugs, during the term of the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we expect to obtain approval for several things being developed. From this point we will start to reap the benefits of our new drug development. We will work according to schedule and gradually add product lines to our business portfolio as they are able to be expanded globally.\n\nFor generic drugs, we have separated our production and sales functions and established subsidiary companies for them. We are refining our expertise in each of these areas to build a competitive advantage. As society ages, demand for generic drugs is expected to increase continuously. However, due to the structure of the industry, there has recently been serious shortages of supply. To overcome this issue, the government has developed a consortium concept to stimulate collaborations between companies. We hope to take advantage of our abundant assets in this generic drugs business to lead a restructuring of the industry.\n\nFor antibacterial drugs, in line with national policy, we will further strengthen stable supply structures.\n\nPage 63  Technological Development Strategy\n\nEnsuring a Reliable Supply of Critical Pharmaceuticals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor vaccines, we are in the process of developing two modalities linked to government policy to build a stable\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nsupply of domestic vaccines for COVID-19. By providing multiple vaccine options, we will contribute to increased vaccination rates among Japanese people as well. We also consider Asia to be an important market due to its poor access to pharmaceuticals.

In line with the concept of fusing sustainability and business strategies, as set forth in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we will achieve business growth while addressing the social issues of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.\n\nWe have a solid technology base to achieve this aim. In fact, we are one of the few pharmaceutical companies around the world able to target both bacteria and viruses, the pathogenic causes of infectious diseases. Going forward, we will also work to develop biopharmaceuticals able to regulate the immune function of people, the hosts of these pathogens. The Meiji Group is the one and only platformer for infectious disease control, which will become important for future society as well. As such, I personally have great expectations for the future of the Pharmaceutical segment.",

Combining a range of excellent knowledge, from Japan and overseas, with the assets it developed in the Pharmaceutical segment, we have achieved many successful outcomes.\n\n## Global Expansion of Translational Research\n\nCurrently, 80% of the groundbreaking new drugs being created around the world are developed through translational research, which bridges promising research outcomes from academia and bioventures with clinical environments. Even middle-sized pharmaceutical companies have a major opportunity to create groundbreaking new drugs through open innovation. In this business environment, the Meiji Group has succeeded in developing its KOSTAIVE intramuscular injection, a self-amplifying next-generation mRNA vaccine against COVID-19. We acquired a license to supply and sell in Japan a potential mRNA vaccine created by U.S. biotech company Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. Then, we became the first company in the world to be approved to manufacture and sell it as KOSTAIVE in just one year a/f\\_ter commencing clinical trials. In addition to vaccines, the mRNA technologies that we acquired through this process can be transferred to other areas as well, including the treatment of immune diseases, and will also lead to the creation of new drugs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promising Pipeline\n\nThere are three core areas of our R&D: infectious diseases, hematology, and immunology and inflammation. We are currently engaged in joint research projects to create innovative new drugs with representative Japanese researchers and academic institutions. To further expand this open innovation network, we established an open innovation base in Boston, the U.S., and sent researchers there from Japan to research the seeds of new drugs. Through these initiatives, we will enrich our pipeline for developing di/fferentiated and groundbreaking new drugs. (See our pipeline on the following pages.)\n\n## ME3183 (Selective PDE4 Inhibitor)\n\nAs a drug for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis and arthropathy, ME3183 works by inhibiting the function of the PDE4 enzyme. In Phase II trials, it met its primary endpoint and showed high e/fficacy soon a/f\\_ter administration, suggesting good tolerability*. We are currently preparing for Phase III trials. With high pharmacological activity and low intracerebral transfer, ME3183 has the potential to become a drug of first choice for patients as a next-generation selective PDE4 inhibitor that is both safe and highly e/ffective. * Tolerability is the degree to which a patient can tolerate the side e/ffects of a drug.\n\n## OP0595 (Nacubactam, Novel \ua7b5-Lactamase Inhibitor)\n\nUsed in combination with \ua7b5-lactam-based antibacterial drugs, OP0595 is a drug that improves antibacterial activity against drug-resistant bacteria that produce \ua7b5-lactamase. Carbapenem-resistant enterobacterial infections that have acquired resistance to \ua7b5-lactam-based antibacterial drugs have become a social issue. OP0595 has the potential to provide the optimal treatment method to respond to all resistant enzyme forms by selecting a concomitant drug. We are currently conducting multi-regional Phase III trials with the aim of applying for approval during FY2025.\n\n## KD2-396 (Six-in-One Combination Vaccine)\n\nKD2-396 is a six-in-one combination vaccine for children developed by combining our Quintovac five-in-one combination vaccine (pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b), launched in FY2024, with our Bimmugen vaccine for the Hepatitis B virus. As a purely domestic six-in-one combination vaccine with all active ingredients produced in Japan, making e/ffective use of drugs that have already been approved and have a history of use, KD2-396 is expected to show high levels of safety and e/fficacy. It will also reduce the burden on children and families by reducing the number of vaccinations required during childhood.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will strengthen business development in Asia with the aim of helping to improve access to drugs and expand vaccinations. We will also work to ensure the launch of new drugs currently.\n\n## Rolling Out Vaccines to the Asian Market\n\nVaccination is an e/ffective method of controlling the spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. However, rates of vaccination in Southeast Asian countries have remained low compared to Europe and the U.S. We will start by implementing initiatives to supply influenza vaccines to Asian countries. We will then consider initiatives that help develop the public health infrastructure of our partner countries by leveraging the technologies of the Meiji Group. We also need to consider purchasing power parity and other aspects of those countries to promote the spread of vaccines. Therefore, we are specifically thinking about technical partnerships with local companies instead of producing and exporting from Japan.\n\nAnother important project is the supply of smallpox vaccines. The Meiji Group and a European company are the only two pharmaceutical companies worldwide capable of producing smallpox vaccines. Smallpox vaccines themselves are extremely important for protecting their citizens from a bio-terrorist attack. In August 2022, our smallpox vaccine received approval in Japan for the additional indication of the 'prevention of Mpox.' As Mpox infections are spreading in some foreign countries, we will work with the Japanese government to expand the number of countries to which we supply our smallpox vaccines.\n\n## Global Vaccine Strategy Targeting Dengue Fever\n\nWe are working to deliver our newly developed vaccines to the world. The one that we hold the highest expectations for is our KD-382 dengue fever vaccine. There are needs for vaccines that are e/ffective against all four serotypes of the dengue virus. With warnings that the dengue fever will become the world's greatest threat in the future, we are developing a vaccine against this infectious disease with the support of the Strategic Center of Biomedical Advanced Vaccine Research and Development for Preparedness and Response (SCARDA) and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving Access to Drugs through the CMO/CDMO Business\n\nThe world's population is set to hit 9 billion people soon, with numbers increasing rapidly in the Global South in particular. Access to drugs is expanding rapidly as a result, but there are concerns about supply shortages in India and Africa, where the populations are particularly large. We are operating our contract manufacturing organization (CMO) and contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) business through our subsidiary in India, Medreich Ltd. We will invest more in these businesses going forward to boost our production capacity and contribute to even better access to drugs in West Asia and Africa.\n\n## Using Abundant Resources to Drive Agile Overseas Business\n\nMany of our engineers involved in R&D and production have overseas work experience, and we employ many local sta/ff who share our vision and have years of working experience. One of our strengths in the Pharmaceutical segment is our ability to quickly move to implementation if we develop new strategies overseas. In addition to our existing production bases in India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Spain, we have been developing structures over recent years for driving overseas business, including establishing a subsidiary in the U.S. for local clinical development.\n\n## Global Stable Supply System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This concept is synonymous with sustainability transformation (SX). In fact, we achieved a certain level of success in our sustainability strategy during the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan. We tackled the ESG elements of Meiji ROESG using five indicators set by an external evaluation body, and we achieved our targets for each. However, the level of achievement for each of these elements was di/fferent. For this reason, in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we are targeting even higher evaluations for indicators that were found to have room for improvement.\n\nIssues from the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan include a steady reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through implementation of climate change measures, but with the current methods of energy e/fficiency reaching their limits. For instance, there are new challenges that we must address, including replacing the fuel currently used at our plants with hydrogen and ammonia. And Scope 3 emissions present a major challenge to figure out how to reduce GHG emissions over which we have no control. Therefore, we are considering regenerative agriculture and other initiatives in collaboration with stakeholders.\n\nSeparately, we are still facing the issue of human rights. Although we started human rights due diligence in 2019, it has not yet extended to our overseas Group companies. We positioned overseas business as a growth driver in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, so we have to strengthen our sustainability strategy in response to that. Additionally, in building a responsible supply chains, the dairy industry, which provides essential raw materials such as raw milk, is facing various social issues. While initiatives to address these issues are being undertaken, they are still only halfway complete. For cocoa, we are making steady progress toward the switch to using Meiji Sustainable Cocoa Beans . Going forward, we will work toward achieving our new targets, ensuring the establishment of traceability, zero child labor and zero deforestation.\n\nFrom the perspective of marketing, we have room for improvement in the content of two policies we previously established; the Meiji Group Marketing Communication to Children Policy and Meiji Group Food Nutrition Labeling Policy. Both policies currently fall short of global standards, and neither is being su/fficiently implemented or enforced. Our goal going forward is to further pursue responsible marketing in the downstream areas of our supply chain.\n\n- * ROESG is a registered trademark for a management indicator developed by Kunio Ito, a professor at Hitotsubashi University.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are using this word 'deepen' to express our intention to conduct sustainability activities that truly embody the essence of Meiji ROESG Management. In line with this policy, we have identified 12 materialities in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan. We started by identifying around 30 sustainability issues from the perspectives of environment, society and economy according to SASB, GRI and other international guidelines. We then quantitatively evaluated them on the two axes of 'importance to stakeholders' and 'importance to the Meiji Group's business.' We then created a matrix of sustainability issues according to their importance and found 12 issues were important on both axes. During this process, we incorporated the opinions from external experts and discussed the topics in the ESG Advisory Board, which meets twice a year. Through thorough discussions, we identified materialities to prioritize. We then organized the 12 materialities into a conceptual diagram that structures activity themes conducted by the Meiji Group (refer to the figure on the right). For each materiality, we established specific initiatives and quantitative KPIs, making our activity guidelines clearer.\n\nAs a symbolic initiative to fuse sustainability with our business strategies, we newly adopted the Meiji Sustainable Products Certification System. This system establishes a set of certification criteria for sustainability activities in the value chain, from research and development through to consumption, and certifies internally products that meet a certain number of these criteria. In addition to quality, functionality and design, which have been the basis for product value to date, we are adding the new qualifier of social value, generated through the product's relationship to e/fforts to solve social issues, as the basis for product value from now on. The aim is to strengthen market competitiveness by incorporating the element of sustainability as a competitive focus. In FY2024, we will evaluate about 600 of our products that are available to consumers in Japan. From next fiscal year, we plan to expand the scope of these evaluations to also include products for professional use and pharmaceuticals. Following this approach, we expect that employees involved with each product will work with an awareness of the Meiji Sustainable Products Certification System, which will give them a sense of ownership of the issue of sustainability.\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\n## Structure of the Meiji Group' Sustainability Activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFoundation of corporate activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability 2026 Vision\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recently, the concept of nature positive* has gained a lot of attention, and Japan is also promoting the National Biodiversity Strategy. As part of this strategy, Japan has set a target to achieve nature positive by 2030. We recognize that contributing to nature positive is an important management issue for the Meiji Group, which depends on nature's gi/f\\_ts. To achieve this, we will promote the three-way approach of carbon neutrality, circular economy, and ecosystem conservation and restoration, in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\nTo achieve nature positive, it is important to figure out how to make positive contributions while minimizing negative impacts on nature as much as possible. The Meiji Group has been implementing GHG reduction initiatives for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, while contributing toward carbon neutrality, to reduce its impact on nature. We have been working hard to reduce the amount of petroleum-derived plastics we use, reduce food loss by extending the best before dates, and recycle le/f\\_tover plant and animal materials from food waste. Through these initiatives, we are focusing on creating a circular economy that restricts the use of virgin resources. On the other hand, we are also taking on the challenge of regenerative agriculture as a positive contribution, including conducting a carbon farming verification project. The agroforestry that we have been practicing for years is another typical example of regenerative agriculture. Through such activities, we will contribute to ecosystem conservation and restoration.\n\nWe hope that our e/fforts in these areas will achieve both sustainable business growth for the Meiji Group and well-being for our planet.\n\n- * Nature positive means halting and reversing biodiversity loss and putting nature on a path to recovery\n\n## Nature Positive Underpinned by Three Elements\n\nDriving the three-way approach of carbon neutrality, circular economy, and ecosystem conservation and restoration are important for achieving nature positive.\n\nNATURE POSITIVE\n\nEcosystem Conservation and Restoration Ecosystem Conservation and Restoration\n\nWe aim to realize a society that lives in harmony with nature by focusing on conserving and restoring ecosystems.\n\nPage 48\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCircular Economy\n\nThe circular economy is an economic model for e/ffective use of resources and minimization of waste to create sustainable, recycling-oriented economic activity.\n\nPage 47\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarbon Neutrality\n\nWe are working to o/ffset our GHG emissions by reducing them and absorbing any remaining emissions from the atmosphere.\n\nPage 46\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability Strategy  |  Message from CSO\n\n## Internalizing the External Diseconomies of Business Activities Is Now Essential for Survival\n\nI have just been appointed as CSO in FY2024, but what I sense most strongly is that, from the perspective of sustainability, we are now at a major turning point in history. Consumption of resources through human activity has exceeded the capacity of the Earth to provide them, and it would not be an exaggeration to say that the sustainability of the world itself is under threat. What companies need to do in such an environment is to internalize the external diseconomies of business activities. We can no longer have a free ride on the natural environment.\n\nTo survive in these di/fficult times, each and every employee must feel an a/ffinity with sustainability, and incorporating sustainability into their daily work needs to become commonplace. As CSO, I want to foster this type of corporate culture, so I am creating a working environment that will enable this to happen. We are also providing e-learning-based training through the Meiji Sustainability College, which was launched as a framework for in-house education. In addition, we have been holding an internal event since FY2023, called Sustainability Days, as part of e/fforts to promote and raise awareness of the concept of sustainability and make it more accessible.\n\nIt is also important to focus on speed with sustainability activities. We have already started tackling the comparatively easy social issues, with only the di/fficult ones remaining, so the next steps will be extremely challenging. Nevertheless, the Meiji Group wants to\n\nABOUT THE MEIJI GROUP\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nalways be the first penguin to seize an opportunity, and I support that vision as CSO. My role is to lead the Meiji Group to demonstrate leadership on sustainability within the industry and drive innovation industry-wide. As CSO for the Group, I am actively engaged in outside communications where I try to raise and discuss issues in a positive manner. Sustainability is not an area of competition, so there are many areas in which we can collaborate to tackle common issues faced by all companies in the industry. For example, reducing GHG emissions is an issue that the dairy industry as a whole is facing, not just the Meiji Group. And other companies in the industry are facing similar issues. For this reason, the Meiji Group should play a central role in creating an ecosystem where the strengths and know-how of every company can be utilized. Through these activities, we aim to become a global sustainability leader by FY2026. We have therefore begun to reorganize the ESG indicators in Meiji ROESG. While continuing to engage with MSCI ESG Rating and DJSI, for which our progress is still underway, we have added ISS ESG* as a new indicator. If we can achieve the new targets we have set, we will naturally become one of the global leaders in this area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * ISS ESG: Sustainability rating evaluation by the responsible investment arm of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., a proxy advisory firm.\n\n## Focus on Communication That Turns Social Value into Customer Value\n\nIn the Meiji Group, we are promoting sustainability transformation with sustainability at the core of our management. We will achieve sustainable growth while\n\ncreating social and economic value through a trade-on approach. As CSO, I am more determined than ever to accelerate the various initiatives we have implemented to date. On the other hand, when fusing sustainability and business strategies, it is important to focus on ways to turn social value into value for customers. We will therefore put a lot of e/ffort into external communications. We need to explain that there are social issues associated with products that are familiar to our customers, but that these products are available thanks to e/fforts of the Meiji Group to address these issues. By providing such information, we aim to incorporate ethical elements into our products as a purchasing criterion for customers, and to spread the idea that, rather than being a cost, sustainability is an investment in our future. We also hope to encourage a change of behavior among consumers that leads to improved corporate value for the Meiji Group.",

From the perspective of nature positive, increasing CO2 absorption through activities such as forest planting or conservation of forests helps conserve ecosystems. The Meiji Group is continuously implementing new initiatives to reduce GHG emissions through business activities, aiming to achieve nature positive.\n\n## CFP Calculations for Meiji Oishii Gyunyu , One of the Meiji Group's Main Products\n\nTo achieve carbon neutrality in the dairy industry, we are working to visualize GHG emissions (CO2 conversion) by calculating the carbon footprint of products (CFP) related to drinking milk production. In FY2022, we calculated the CFP of Meiji Organic Milk according to international standards. Furthermore, in FY2023, we participated in a verification project led by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to establish common rules for calculating the CFP of processed foods. Based on the rules formulated through this project, we are currently calculating the CFP of Meiji Oishii Gyunyu , one of our main products produced at the Kyushu Plant of Meiji Co., Ltd.\n\n## Details of CFP Calculations for Each Process in the Supply Chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Establishment of Doto Carbon Farming Study Group\n\nCarbon farming is an agricultural method that aims to reduce GHG emissions by capturing atmospheric CO2 in farm soil and improving the quality of the soil. To promote carbon farming in the dairy industry, the Meiji Group established the Doto Carbon Farming Study Group in August 2023 with dairy farmers in Betsukai Town, Hokkaido, the largest raw milk production area in Japan. In FY2023, its first year, the study group investigated the CO2 storage capacity of soil. Based on the first year's results, the study group plans to research and implement measures to enhance CO2 storage. We believe that the CO2 absorption and storage of soil holds considerable potential for the dairy industry, which relies on vast tracts of pastureland.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe vast farms used by the dairy industry hold considerable potential for CO2 reduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConducting a soil survey in 2023\n\n## Business Model Promotion through Collaboration with Ajinomoto Co., Inc.\n\nWe have created a business model using the J-Credit Scheme in collaboration with Ajinomoto Co., Inc. to simultaneously achieve reduction of GHG emissions and the creation of economic value in the dairy industry. By using feed additives produced by Ajinomoto we are able to improve the amino acid balance in animal feed, thereby reducing the generation of nitrous oxide (N2O) from cows manure and urine and converting the reduced GHG emissions into J-Credits, providing dairy farmers with an additional source of income. As of June 2024, about 3,000 head dairy cows are being fed on four farms based on this model, and the business is expanding steadily.\n\nInnovative Feeding Strategies for CowsA Joint Initiative for Dairy Industry Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MORE INFORMATION\n\nAcquisition of SBT Certification\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverview of Engagement Implementation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n<!-- image -->",

From the perspective of nature positive, reducing the burden on the natural environment by reusing and recycling resources also leads to reduced negative impact on ecosystems. The Meiji Group is working on more e/fficient use of the limited resources essential to its business activities and through these e/fforts, creating new economic value that enriches society.\n\n## Upcycling Cocoa Husks, the Underutilized Part of Cocoa into Miscellaneous Goods and Clothes\n\nCurrently, the only part of the cocoa fruit used to make chocolate is the cocoa beans. Even including the pulp, which is used for fermentation energy, only about 30% of the entire cocoa fruit is used as raw materials. Under the slogan ' Now Open the Cacao by Meiji ' the Meiji Group is trying to create new cocoa value by addressing the entire cocoa fruit. In FY2023, we focused on cocoa bean husks, the cocoa bean's outer shell, which are not being actively used in the manufacturing process in Japan, and we launched CACAO STYLE as a lifestyle brand for non-food products. Through co-creation with external partners, we are developing and selling a range of upcycled products such as miscellaneous goods and clothes. Furthermore, we have successfully materialized cacao ceramide*, a moisturizing ingredient, for the first time in the world, connecting all the hidden potential in cocoa to new value and aiming for a circular economy. Through such initiatives, we will bring pleasure to everyone involved in cocoa, from the producers to the customers, and help to address the issues faced by cocoa producing areas.\n\n- * Page 62 Technology Development Strategy  |  Maximizing the Potential of Raw materials\n\nProduct example: GATO bonbonni\u00e8re (small candy box)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainable upcycled lacquer ware made by blending cocoa bean husks with waste wood dust from Yamanaka lacquer ware, a traditional Japanese cra/f\\_t\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strengthening Plastic Resource Recycling E/fforts\n\nIn recent years, the importance of recycling plastic resource has been increasing, so the Meiji Group has made reducing the amount of plastic used in containers and packaging a top priority.

To ensure the sustainable production of our main raw materials, including dairy ingredients and cocoa beans, which are examples of our precious natural capital, it is crucial to maintain these ecosystems and contribute to achieving nature positive. We are committed to addressing nature-related risks and opportunities outlined in the TNFD recommendations, while engaging in various activities to conserve and restore ecosystems. Furthermore, we adhere to relevant conventions and laws, striving to create a society that lives in harmony with nature.\n\n## Identifying Nature-Related Risks and Opportunities (Dairy Ingredients and Cocoa Beans)\n\nUsing the LEAP approach in version 1.0 of the TNFD framework, we have identified priority areas and nature-related risks and opportunities* for each high-priority dependency and impact in the Meiji Group's main dairy ingredient producing regions and cocoa bean producing regions. Going forward, we will also pursue e/fforts to avoid and mitigate nature-related risks, and to realize related opportunities, by conducting gap analysis for production areas.\n\n- * In a pessimistic scenario of maximum physical and transition risks (extremely advanced degradation of nature, extremely high stakeholder concerns about nature, and major social changes toward wanting to prevent degradation of nature)\n\n## Evaluation and Analysis Flow Using the LEAP Approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvaluate Dependency and impact relationships* 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLocate Place of activities* 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAssess\n\nRisks and opportunities\n\n- *1 Using Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure (ENCORE) and other tools\n- *2 Using Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter, Aqueduct, WWF Water Risk Filter and other indicators\n\n## Evaluation Examples (High-Priority Dependency and Impact Relationships and Priority Areas, and Nature-Related Risks and Opportunities)\n\n| Dependencies and impacts                        | Priority areas                                                                        | Risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Opportunities                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mitigation of the  impact of natural  disasters | Dominican Republic, Ecuador,  Ghana, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela  and Vietnam, etc.       | Increased procurement costs associated with lower  production of cocoa beans due to wind and flood  damage                                                                                                                         | Improved supply chain resilience through appropriate  management of forests at farms where materials are procured  through stable provision of ecosystem services that  contribute to mitigation of the impact of natural disasters |\n| Changes in  terrestrial  ecosystem usage        |                                                                                       | Limited procurement amounts due to tighter  regulations aimed at protecting terrestrial ecosystems  including forests                                                                                                              | Avoidance and reduction of impacts on new regulatory  enhancements through measures such as the introduction  of agroforestry to mitigate land conversion risks                                                                     |\n| Greenhouse gas  emissions                       | Australia, China, Denmark,  Germany, Ireland, Japan, New  Zealand and Singapore, etc. | Decreased brand value and sales due to insu/fficient e/fforts  to reduce GHG emissions in dairy ingredient production,  along with expansion of ethical consumption driven by  increased consumer awareness towards climate change | Increased sales due to higher demand for products using  sustainable dairy ingredients driven by expansion of ethical  consumption, and expanded product lineups                                                                    |\n| Water pollution                                 |                                                                                       | Reputation risk and decreased sales due to criticism  from environmental organizations if sourcing from  farms with problems                                                                                                       | Increased demand for products using sustainable dairy  ingredients due to increased social needs for preventing  water pollution                                                                                                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Addressing Deforestation in Cocoa Farms\n\nWe are investigating whether our sourcing farms interfere with forest reserves or other protected areas using the methods such as GPS mapping, and are working to protect and restore forests.

We aim to use this value to achieve sustainable growth by contributing globally to all our stakeholders. To achieve this, we need to link our strategic human resource development with management strategies, and empower our diverse employees to create innovation. Corporate growth is undeniably achieved through human resources. Therefore, we treat our employees as important capital for creating corporate value and we actively invest in them. We have decided to unify the way to refer to all members working in the Meiji Group as 'employees.' This is our way of recognizing them as people who share our aspirations and grow together with the Group.\n\nThe Meiji Group worked as one to implement human capital management during our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan. We established the Meiji Group Human Capital Committee, chaired by our CEO, in 2022. We also established the new position of CHRO and created our CHRO system in 2023. We will promote Meiji's unique human capital management during the current 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, which will be the implementation phase of our many discussions on this topic.\n\nThree Pillars of Our Human Resource Strategy in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan\n\nAs part of the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we formulated Our Value Creation Story (see chart on the le/f\\_t side of the next page) as a further embodiment of connections between our management strategies and human resource strategy. The story will be based on the keywords we have promoted previously-external competitiveness and diversity. It will also identify the ideal human resources and organization for realizing our management strategies and Group Philosophy. We expect our diverse human resources to be autonomous, take on challenges, grow, co-create, and generate innovation. And to realize the ideal human resources and organization, we will also promote three pillars of our human resource strategy that are linked to management strategies.\n\nThe first pillar is developing human resources and working environments for competing globally. To expand business with a focus on overseas markets, we urgently need to recruit and develop global human resources who can demonstrate leadership and produce results. We will introduce a more e/ffective educational program by assessing the satisfaction of our human resources, and use a rotation system to enhance skills development. We will also continue to promote diversity, equity and inclusion to create an organizational culture that supports our global business expansion.",

        "page_content": "ABOUT THE MEIJI GROUP\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\n## Human Resource Strategy  |  Message from CHRO\n\nThe second pillar is promoting human capital sustainability. To achieve sustainable growth, it is important to create working environments where each of our employees can continue to take on challenges and grow with a high degree of motivation, and continually demonstrate their capabilities. It is therefore vital that we have systems and mechanisms for rewarding employees who produce results. We are currently starting to reform our Group-wide HR system. The new system will have fewer seniority-based components. We aim to create mechanisms for motivated human resources to play active roles by recruiting and promoting the right people to the right places. We also aim to promote smart work. We believe that this will lead to workplaces where unreasonable workload are reduced, and creative time is increased, to improve productivity, as well as worker-friendliness and job satisfaction for our diverse employees. In FY2024, we established new subcommittees under the control of the Meiji Group Human Capital Committee. While promoting health and productivity management, and occupational safety, we are creating working environments that are stimulating and employee friendly.\n\nThe third pillar is improving the e/ffectiveness of Group HR functions. Essential to our Group human resource management structure, centered on the CHRO, are the HR departments that lead management strategies and help promote business strategies. To enhance HR functions for this purpose, we are discussing which roles and functions need to be addressed. We have also started centralizing human resource data from Group companies to install data-driven HR that will help in this process. Our aim in this is to achieve talent management through data.\n\nOur Value Creation Story: Human Resource Strategy Based on Management Strategies\n\nPage 26 Overview of the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan\n\n## Realizing the Group Philosophy and Management Strategies\n\nFurthe P\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuman resource strategy that realizes our ideals\n\nGlobal\n\nFusion of Sustainability and business strategies\n\nGroup collaboration enhancement\n\n## Diverse human resources who are autonomous, take on challenges, grow, co-create, and generate innovation\n\n## Human resources\n\n## Organizational culture\n\nProfessional human resources who continue to take on challenges and grow, and possess the necessary expertise to lead the world in food and health\n\nAn organizational culture that supports the well-being of diverse human resources and that maximizes the potential of individuals and teams\n\nDevelopment of human resources and working environments for competing globally\n\nPromotion of human capital sustainability\n\nImprovement of the e/ffectiveness of Group HR functions\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n## Enabling Employees and the Group to Grow Together\n\nEmployee engagement is the sum of the three pillars of our human resource strategy outlined above. In the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, we defined employee engagement as 'the degree of an employee's empathy toward the Group.' We also calculated that engagement score as the gap between the employee's expectations and level of satisfaction. Although we did not achieve the target score set in the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, the most recent survey showed a trend toward improvement in areas of concern, and our e/fforts are beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan, we redefined employee engagement as 'a state where each employee's\n\n## Human Resource Strategy and the Value Creation Cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvision aligns with that of the Meiji Group, fostering a desire to grow together.' By improving employee engagement, our employees and the Group can work together to foster the drivers for realizing our Group Philosophy and management strategies.\n\nAnother thing we monitor is the value creation rate achieved through the performance of each of our employees. We consider employee engagement and value creation rate to be a single linked cycle. Our aim is to develop relationships between employees and the Group in which each improves the other and our diverse human resources can work with energy to create new value.\n\n## CHRO's Mission to Transform Human Resource Management\n\nThe concept of transformation in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan is embodied by our human resources. I recognize that transforming our people and the organization is the most important issue for realizing our management strategies. I take this matter very seriously. While carefully identifying the unique Meiji Group characteristics that should be preserved, I will transform human resource management with a bold commitment to changing other characteristics as well. As CHRO, I will proactively get involved in changing the awareness and behavior of our employees for the growth of them and the Meiji Group together.",

While implementing initiatives on a Group-wide scale, we have also been focusing measures on the levels with the most issues.\n\nIn the survey that we conducted in June 2024 to conclude our 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, our Employee Engagement Score was ranked at the 'B' level, which was the same as for FY2021 to FY2023. However, we did see signs of improvement in the categories of 'employees at plants' and 'younger employees (up to 35 years old),' with the most issues. We are also following up individually with workplaces that scored low on engagement and we are supporting them in their e/fforts to improve.\n\n## Initiatives at Plants\n\nWhile actively holding town hall meetings with management, we are providing communication training at some of our plants to create workplaces with an open atmosphere.

In particular, to strengthen operation of the pool of human resources who will lead Group management in the future, we are focusing on identification and development of strategic human resources who instigate change as candidates for the next generation of Group management, and on recruiting and developing human resources who will drive global business, which is essential for further growth of the Group going forward.\n\n## Developing Managers Who Drive the Group Forward\n\nWith a focus on our leadership values, the Meiji Group established a system for developing managers who drive the Group forward with the aim of developing human resources for management who are principally strategic and instigate change. The goal of the development program based on this system is to develop two capability groups; strategy and execution skills (ability to develop clear strategies, take action, and resolve unprecedented situations in Japan and overseas) and people skills (ability to draw out and cultivate the capabilities of the organization, use surroundings with an open mind and lead the organization).

Self-care is extremely important for women a/ffected by female hormones, so our seminars in FY2023 focused on the relationship between dietary habits and mental health. About 600 of our employees attended these seminars to learn about self-care methods using the Meiji Group products.\n\n## Occupational Safety\n\nThe Meiji Group considers occupational safety and health to be management theme for the Group as a whole. We established the Occupational Safety Strategy Map to create a Group of energetic employees who prioritize safety as a matter of course, and we are implementing related initiatives. Using the Occupational Safety Strategy Map, we identify issues from the perspectives of safety awareness, work and equipment, and tra/ffic safety.

Based on the Meiji Group's slogan of Now ideas for wellness , we have reexamined the technological assets accumulated by each Group company. As a result, we recognized microbial control, process technology, and evaluation technology as common and important elemental technologies. Furthermore, we established product diversity (diversification of values towards products) and life diversity (diversification of people's lifestyles and views on life) as the base concept of our strategy, and formulated six domains based on these two aspects. In doing so, we will promote diverse technological development for diverse social issues without being bound by existing frameworks.\n\nAs we work to materialize our technological development, we will coordinate with our intellectual property strategy from an early stage to maximize the value of our developed technologies. We will also actively drive open innovation with external startup companies and academia. Furthermore, the Open Innovation Promotion Committee (Chairperson: CEO, Vice Chairperson: COOs, Members: General Managers of R&D Div.) established in Meiji Holdings will take the lead in promoting this technological development strategy to strengthen synergies within and outside the Group.\n\n## Now ideas for wellness\n\nGroup Slogan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Wellness Science Labs\n\nLab Director\n\n## Masashi Nagata\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTechnology-driven Transformation\n\nin line with Technological Development Strategy This technological development strategy was formulated by a cross-group team, including the Wellness Science Labs (herea/f\\_ter, 'the Labs'), a research organization that crosses the fields of food and pharmaceuticals. What the Meiji Group needs now is transformation. The Labs will initiate change from a technology-driven perspective in line with this strategy. We will present the Group with a methodology for transformation through technological development, while also creating a culture of producing new value through repeated trial and error. The Meiji Group has a diverse range of technologies and excellent DNA cultivated over many years. It is possible to create unique technologies that cover both food and pharmaceuticals by adapting these technologies to the times. I intend to contribute to the Group's further growth and go beyond the development of technologies to the creation of businesses based on them.\n\n## Wellness Science Labs\n\nThe Co-Creation Center was established in 2019 to create synergies between food and pharmaceutical businesses. It was then re-named to the Wellness Science Labs in 2023. The Wellness Science Labs take on the challenge of research and development in new domains. It also consolidates the lactobacilli research functions within the Group and develop technologies to support the operating base.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(hereina/f\\_ter 'Farmnote'). The partnership promotes sustainable dairy farming by combining the advanced technology developed by Farmnote with the knowledge and assets of the Meiji Group.\n\n## Promoting Smart Dairy Farming through Collaboration Between Farmnote and the Meiji Group\n\nFarmnote promotes smart dairy farming to solve issues that dairy farmers face through advanced technologies and devices.

In our technological development strategy, we have set 'making diverse foods accessible' as a key area of focus. We are working to solve this issue by developing technologies such as biomanufacturing and cell-cultured cocoa.\n\n## Towards Biomanufacturing, a Unique Strength of the Meiji Group with its Abundant Microbial Resources\n\nAs a leader in biomanufacturing which will change society, the Meiji Group is taking on the challenge of innovation in manufacturing by fully utilizing its abundant microbial resources. In the Food segment, we hold more than 6,000 strains of lactobacilli and other microbials as assets. In the Pharmaceutical segment, we hold approximately 80,000 strains of actinomycetes, filamentous fungi, and other microbials as well. We are first considering applying biomanufacturing to\n\nthe Food segment. Specifically, we will create engineered cells for the e/fficient production of high value-added food materials that can help solve health issues in order to build a technological foundation for the production of diverse food materials. To accomplish this, we will accelerate infrastructure building and commercialization by collaborating with cutting-edge players in biomanufacturing in Japan and overseas.\n\n## What can be Achieved through Biomanufacturing\n\n- \u00b7 Unparalleled development speed\n- \u00b7 Production of new useful substances\n- \u00b7 Highly e/fficient production of substances\n- \u00b7 Utilization of unused substances and reduction of environmental impact\n\n## What is Biomanufacturing?\n\nBiomanufacturing has been attracting worldwide attention recently, as it is expected to both address social issues and help achieve economic growth. It utilizes the capabilities of microbes and other living organisms to produce substances, using cutting-edge biological and digital technologies. Progress is underway on the research and development of engineered cells, which use genetic recombination and genome editing to\n\ndesign cells with the ability to produce substances in accordance with targeted manufacturing. Biomanufacturing using these engineered cells will greatly improve the production e/fficiency of foods and other products and enable the production of ingredients that have been di/fficult to produce industrially in the past.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving the Sustainability of Cocoa Production through the Development of Cell-cultured Cocoa Technology\n\nCocoa production faces various challenges. These challenges include social issues such as child labor and deforestation on farms, reduction of farmland due to global warming and impact of pests and diseases on yield; production issues such as lack of cultivation techniques and agricultural materials; and unstable production and supply conditions as evidenced by the recent price hikes caused by these issues. The Meiji Group is engaged in various initiatives* from the perspective of nature positive. We are also working to improve the sustainability of cocoa production from the aspect of technological development through a new technology called cell-cultured cocoa.\n\n- Page 45 Sustainability Strategy  |  Living in Harmony with Nature *\n\n## Open Innovation with U.S. Startup Company California Cultured Inc.\n\nWe have invested in California Cultured Inc., a U.S. startup company that is pursuing cell-cultured cocoa technology, to promote open innovation toward its practical application. We are developing unique and attractive products made from cell-cultured cocoa through collaborative creation using California Cultured's cutting-edge cell culture technology and the Meiji Group's extensive technologies and expertise in quality improvement and processing long cultivated in our chocolate business to date.

In this section, we will introduce the development of products in new fields using unused parts of cocoa (cocoa husk), our unique maturation technology for balancing the growth of white and blue mold as well as technology for extracting the original deliciousness of raw milk.\n\n## Cocoa Ceramide, the World's First New Material Developed from Cocoa Husks\n\nThe Meiji Group has been focusing on cocoa husk (seed husk of cocoa beans), which had not been e/ffectively utilized until now. Cocoa husk contains plant-based ceramide*. Through continued research, we discovered that in addition to glucosylceramide, which is used as a food ingredient, cocoa husk also contains a large amount of human-type free ceramide, which has the same structure as ceramide found in humans. Based on these findings, we succeeded in creating cocoa ceramide, an ingredient with high moisturizing properties, for the first time in the world.\n\n- * One of the moisturizing factors contained in the stratum corneum of the epidermis of the skin\n\n## Giving New Value to Unutilized Parts of Cocoa to Sustain Cocoa Production\n\nWe created cocoa ceramide through a research collaboration with Professor Jinichiro Koga of Teikyo University. We used the free-type ceramide analysis technology established by Professor Koga to jointly demonstrate that the human-type free ceramide contained in cocoa husks is much higher than that of ordinary plants. Human-type free ceramide is in high demand from the\n\ncosmetics industry, which can be produced in large quantities from cocoa husks that had previously been disposed of. Cocoa husks also contain glucosylceramide, which is usually used in food products. This means that we can create a market for this new material, cocoa ceramide, in both cosmetics and food areas. In this way, we will give value to the underutilized part of cocoa husks and link them to new products (upcycling), while also providing a new source of income for cocoa farmers to improve the sustainability of cocoa production.\n\nBiomolecular Chemistry Laboratory Teikyo University Professor Jinichiro Koga\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Glucosylceramide and Free-type Ceramide Content Found in Plants\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Partially modified from 2004 Hokkaido Agricultural Research Center results; cocoa material measured by LC-MS/MS.\n\n## New Products Born from Milk and Microbe Utilization Technology\n\n## Meiji Hokkaido Tokachi Camembert Blue Cheese\n\nIn the past, it has been di/fficult to control the balance of growth of white and blue mold in cheese aging. We pursued the optimum balance with our originally developed aging method, creating a\n\nproduct that combines the delicious taste of Camembert with the rich aroma of blue cheese. We are trying to revitalize the market by conveying the appeal of blue cheese, which Japanese people are still unfamiliar with.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Milk\n\nRegular ice cream is made by adding various ingredients to dairy products in pursuit of flavor. In contrast to this, Dear Milk ice cream achieves the rich taste of only dairy products. This is due to technologies such as the Ajiwai Production Method, in which raw milk is passed through an NF membrane to concentrate its\n\ndeliciousness and a deoxygenation process to prevent flavor deterioration, as well as the world's first freeze concentration production method, which brings out the original deliciousness of milk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are focusing on this as an initiative related to the domains of fundamental research on sustainable supply chain and life science for wellness.\n\n## Toward the Establishment of a Domestic Production System for Antibacterial Drugs, Enabling Stable Supply\n\nAntibacterial drugs are one of the main products in the Pharmaceutical segment and we have the responsibility to provide a stable supply to the medical community. These drugs are used to treat infectious diseases and prevent infections during surgery. The use of antibacterial drugs has also increased over the years due to the increase in the elderly population. However, before the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan was almost 100% dependent on overseas suppliers for procuring bulk drugs. In the past, there have been situations in which there were shortages of antibacterial drugs in Japan due to temporary supply stoppages at other companies caused by problems at their Chinese suppliers. This means that any disruption in the supply of antibacterial drugs would hinder medical care. In order to avoid such a situation, and from the viewpoint of economic security, the Japanese government has recently established a framework to support the domestic production of antibacterial drugs. The Meiji Group, as Japan's top manufacturer of antibacterial drugs, produces many drugs designated by the Japanese government as 'key drugs' and 'stable supply medicines,' as well as 'specified critical materials' that have a significant impact on the survival of the people and economic activities. Therefore, we are establishing a domestic production system for penicillin bulk drug with the support of the government. We are also working with other companies to develop a supply chain that is fully contained within Japan.\n\n## Changes in the quantity of injectable antibacterial drugs (51 ingredients)\n\n(10,000 units)\n\n18,000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeiji Seika Pharma's Product Share\n\n%\n\n100\n\nPenicillin G\n\n%\n\n54\n\n75\n\n%\n\nVancomycin Meropenem\n\n%\n\n80\n\nSulbactam/ Ampicillin\n\n49\n\n%\n\nTazobactam/ Piperacillin\n\n82\n\n%\n\nKey Drugs 10 active ingredients\n\n65 % Stable supply medicines Category A 6 active ingredients\n\n53 % Specified critical materials 4 active ingredients\n\nQuantity of two penicillin components for which Meiji Seika Pharma conducts contracted domestic manufacturing of the bulk drug\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 IQVIA.

The Gifu plant started operation in 1971 as a bulk drug plant for penicillin. It was a production base engaged in the manufacturing of penicillin until 1994. The plant still stores production strains and has one of the largest culture facilities in Japan, as well as large utilities and wastewater treatment facilities. In addition, the plant maintains\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpertise in cultivation and manufacturing, with experienced engineers in penicillin bulk drug manufacturing . Therefore, we are currently building a system for the mass production of 6-APA, a common raw material for penicillin-based antibacterial drugs, using these assets and planning to start operations in FY2025. We are also introducing AI technology that contributes to stricter management and labor savings, improving the accuracy of raw material analysis and productivity by introducing the latest technology as well as enhancing exhaust and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the impact on the surrounding environment. This will lead to establishing highly competitive penicillin manufacturing technology. These e/fforts to introduce bulk drug manufacturing facilities and stockpiling systems at the Gifu plant were approved by the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare in 2023 as part of the 'Plan for the Stable Supply of Antibacterial Substances.' In parallel with this initiative, we also plan to develop bulk drug manufacturing processes a/f\\_ter 6-APA through collaboration with other companies.\n\nPanoramic view of Gifu Plant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLarge-scale fermentation equipment for penicillin production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have now moved from the establishment phase to the promotion and execution phase. The Group's intellectual property strategy consists of three perspectives: (1) obtain patents strategically; (2) manage technological know-how; and (3) utilize trademarks that are unique to the Group. Under this strategy that leads to value for wellness and help solve social issues, we will strive to realize Now ideas for wellness .\n\n## Phase Transition from Establishing Intellectual Property Governance Structure to Promoting and Executing Strategy\n\nThe Meiji Group has been implementing structural reforms by positioning intellectual property as one of the most important management resources for improving corporate value over the medium- to long-term. In April 2023, the Intellectual Property Strategy Department was newly established under the umbrella of Meiji Holdings. One of the department's missions is to establish an intellectual property governance system so that intellectual property strategy is formulated and executed under appropriate supervision by the Board of Directors. The Group Intellectual Property Committee was established as an advisory body to the Executive Committee. This has created a system where the Meiji Group's management proactively formulates intellectual property strategy.\n\nEach Meiji Group company executes the intellectual property strategy formulated as stated above, and also establishes a collaboration system to promote such strategy as a unified group. Specifically, we set the Group Intellectual Property Liaison Meeting to have company-wide discussions on creating innovation, and the Trademark Committee to formulate and execute specific measures for brand creation.\n\n## System to Promote and Execute the Meiji Group's Intellectual Property Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy Formulation by the Group Intellectual Property Committee\n\nAt its first meeting, the Group Intellectual Property Committee decided on an intellectual property strategy slogan for FY2026: 'Improve the intellectual property literacy of the entire Meiji Group and take major steps to become an excellent intellectual property company that possesses both global level intellectual property value and responsiveness that contributes to the Meiji Group's technological development capabilities.' The Committee also discussed the implementation of strategic intellectual property activities and its targeted direction, as well as the improvement of intellectual property capabilities. The CEO and other members of management are fully committed to these e/fforts. They confirmed that they will aggressively promote this strategy that contributes to improving corporate value.\n\n## Outline of Intellectual Property Strategy in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan\n\n## Integration of Strategic Activities\n\n- - Promote strategic intellectual property activities closely aligned with business strategies to ensure business superiority.\n- - React appropriately to intellectual property in areas such as global expansion, alliances, and M&A.\n- - Strengthen support for the formulation and execution of a technology development strategy and aim to obtain patents and other assets from a medium- to long-term perspective.\n\n## Establishing Governance\n\n- - Promote Group-wide intellectual property strategies.\n- - Establish a global Group-wide intellectual property management system to maximize the value of our patents and trademarks.\n\n## Strengthening Information Dissemination\n\n- - Actively disseminate intellectual property information, such as activity policies, achievements, and awards, both internally and externally.\n- - Strengthen our appeal to stakeholders and foster an intellectual property mindset within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Food segment will expand its profits by promoting an intellectual property strategy based on globalization and quality.\n\n## Protecting World-Class, High-Quality Technology through Intellectual Property to Expand Global Business Profitability\n\nAnalysis using patent analysis tools shows that the patent portfolio of the Food segment is in a relatively good position among its domestic peers in both the globalization index of patents and the technological value index of patents. However, there is currently a gap with top global companies. We aim for the Food segment to be on par with these companies in the future. Looking at individual businesses, the group of patents related to cube-type infant formula that support global business expansion are at a high level (within the red box in the square below), which is on par with top global companies.

To organize our promotion structures, we started in April 2024 by transferring our DX promotion function from the operating companies to Meiji Holdings, and we aggregated our digital resources. We also established the position of Chief Digital O/fficer (CDO) to oversee Group-wide DX strategy, and I was appointed to that role.\n\nThe framework for our DX strategy in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan is reproduced at the bottom right. Naturally, it is essential that we strengthen Group-wide foundations to support more sophisticated management regarding enhancement of digital promotion structures and strengthening of the digital foundation. Over the three years of the plan, we will further raise the level of initiatives implemented to date. They include developing optimal promotion structures for the Group, developing DX human resources, enhancing information security, and establishing a DX governance structure.\n\nBased on this robust digital foundation, we need to execute strategy with a balance of o/ffense and defense elements. Our o/ffense DX will involve creation and\n\nprovision of new customer value, while our defense DX will involve business transformation and productivity improvement. As an example of a system that truly combines o/ffense and defense, we operate an online search function for stores that handle our food products on our website. Not only does this enable customers to easily search for stores that stock certain products by themselves, it also improves the e/fficiency of customer support for us. In FY2024, we aim to formulate concrete strategies and execution plans from the medium- to long-term perspective for o/ffense DX in particular to contribute to improved corporate value for the Meiji Group.\n\nDX is constantly advancing, but being able to use digital technologies well is as important now as it was in the past.

The Nomination Committee's primary role is to deliberate on the election and dismissal of directors of the Company and major operating companies, and report and advise the Board of Directors. However, there has not been a succession since I became a director in 2018, so it may be di/fficult to understand our activities from the outside. In reality, the Nomination Committee first discusses the election and dismissal of the top management each year. A/f\\_ter deciding that reappointment is acceptable, we deliberate on other major personnel issues and advise the Board of Directors, which then makes decisions based on our advice. For this reason, we believe that transparency and objectivity are ensured in the decision-making process for the Meiji Group's major executive appointments, and that an e/ffective corporate governance system has been established.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairperson of the Nomination Committee\n\nMariko Matsumura Independent Outside Member of the Board",

However, we will decline to do so if we think that it would negatively impact the business relationships with the Group or if it would clearly harm the common interests of shareholders.\n\nWhen a company holding Meiji shares for strategic purposes (cross-shareholding company) indicates the intention to sell the share, we do not interfere with the sale of the share.\n\nWe do not engage in transactions that would interfere with Group and shareholder common interests, including transactions with cross-shareholding companies without su/fficiently validating the economic feasibility of the transaction.\n\nABOUT THE MEIJI GROUP\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE MANAGEMENT\n\nCREATING MARKETS AND CORPORATE VALUE\n\n## Status of Cross-Shareholdings Shares\n\n## 1) Reduction status for the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan (FY2021-FY2023)\n\nDuring the period of the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, we planned and worked towards reducing strategic cross-shareholding by 30% based on book value as of the end of March 2021.\n\nEvery year, the Board of Directors reviews all the brands the Group holds and determines whether the Company should continue holding them or dispose of them. For each brand, the Board considers the rationale for holding the brand, the transactions for the brand in the past year, the medium- to long-term outlook for the brand, and the amount of dividend.\n\nIn FY2023, the final year of the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, the Company sold as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 All Shares Sold: 9 brands     \u00b7 Partially Sold: 9 brands\n- \u00b7 Holdings Maintained: 22 brands\n\nAs a result, during the period of the 2023 Medium-Term Business Plan, the Meiji Group's cross-shareholdings have been reduced by 41.6% from the end of FY2020. The total amount for cross-shareholdings recorded to the balance sheets as of the end of FY2023 was equivalent to 5.1% of consolidated net assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2) Reduction plan for the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan (FY2024-FY2026)\n\nDuring the period of the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan (FY2024 to FY2026), we intend to reduce the total amount for cross-shareholdings recorded to the balance sheets to less than 5% of consolidated net assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We aim to achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value over the medium- to long-term.\n\nWe have established the Group Sustainability Committee, which reports its discussions and performance results to the Board of Directors. Furthermore, the Chief Sustainability O/fficer (CSO), oversees sustainability initiatives across the entire Group and works to fuse business operations and sustainability e/fforts.

As a next step, we will work with other companies on reducing methane gas emitted from cow belches to achieve sustainable dairy farming.\n\n## Formulation of Sustainability Strategy in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan\n\n- \u00b7 Until now, our corporate value has been evaluated based on sales and profits. However, we believe we are entering an era in which sustainability, in addition to sales and profits, will determine corporate value by fusing financial and non-financial areas. ROESG, which we are currently promoting, is a concept that fits the future trend. We would like to firmly evolve the concept of ROESG in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan.\n\n## Key Discussion Topics and Opinions from the ESG Advisory Board (August 2023 and January 2024) (Excerpts)\n\n## Identification of Materiality for Our Next Vision\n\n- \u00b7 We believe that materiality should be business activities aimed at solving social issues that can only be undertaken by the Meiji Group. We must also express our materiality in a way that is easy to understand and empathize with for both our customers and our employees.\n\n## Setting of Materiality and KPIs in Sustainability Strategy in the 2026 Medium-Term Business Plan\n\n- \u00b7 Materiality is the roadmap for realizing our vision. The phrase 'Realizing a Better Future for People, Society and the Earth' in the value creation process is the Meiji Group's commitment. We should convey our intention to realize this.\n\n## ESG Advisory Board\n\nThe ESG Advisory Board Members consist of four internal members and four outside experts with expertise and experience in the fields of environment, society, and corporate governance.\n\n## Experts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTakeshi Kamigochi Member of the Board, Executive O/fficer, Senior Vice President & COO, J-OIL MILLS, INC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMari Kogiso Co-CEO, SDG Impact Japan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRika Sueyoshi (Appointed in April 2024) CEO, Ethical Association\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter David Pedersen Representative Director, Next Leaders' Initiative for Sustainability (NELIS) Independent Outside Member of the Board, Meiji Holdings Co., Ltd.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For Audit & Supervisory Board Members, the Company has prepared a skills matrix similar to the one for directors to confirm the status of 'finance and accounting' and 'legal a/ffairs and risk management' skills, which are critical to auditing business execution by directors.\n\n## Reasons for Selection and Definition of Skills\n\n| Skills required to lead and supervise medium- and long-term improvements in corporate value through sustainable growth to realize the  Group's vision of continuing growing in Japan and the world by creating values which are one step ahead for food and health Management strategy                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| perspective towards steadily capturing overseas markets as we aim to accelerate the speed of global development and become a truly global  Global business                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Skills required to lead and oversee the formulation of e/ffective sales and marketing strategies towards securing an overwhelming advantage in  core businesses and establishing a foundation for growth in overseas markets Sales and marketing                                                                                                            |\n| Skills required to make judgments and supervise from a finance and accounting perspective to build a stable management foundation towards  achieving an optimal capital structure while balancing strategic business investments aimed at medium- and long-term improvements to  corporate value with aggressive shareholder returns Finance and accounting |\n| Skills required to formulate and supervise human resource strategy and diversity management policies, and practice human capital  management that positions human resources as important assets towards improving corporate value HR and diversity                                                                                                          |\n| Skills required to formulate and supervise Group-wide policies related to legal a/ffairs and risk management to enhance group governance  towards strengthening group management Legal a/ffairs and risk management                                                                                                                                         |\n| Skills required to formulate and supervise communication strategies towards building trust-based relationships with a wide range of  stakeholders, including customers, business partners, shareholders, and investors Corporate communication                                                                                                              |\n| Skills required to lead and supervise the balance between economic value and social and environmental value to realize the Meiji Group  Sustainability 2026 Vision and resolve social issues through sustainability innovation Sustainability                                                                                                               |\n| Skills required to lead and supervise the Meiji Group DX strategy to accelerate our realization of creating and providing new customer value,  and business transformation and productivity improvement Digital                                                                                                                                             |",

The scope of calculation of industrial waste is limited to production plants.\n- *3 Category 4 (Upstream transportation and distribution) and Category 9 (Downstream transportation and distribution) have been added and are included in the calculation for Scope 3 from FY2018. In addition, the Consolidated Results calculation for Category 1 was expanded to include the raw materials that make up the majority of what is needed for production.\n- *4 Meiji Co., Ltd. and Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd. up until FY2014, and the domestic Meiji Group from FY2015.\n- *5 From FY2018, only industrial waste generated from production plants was included in the waste.\n\nFor environmental data for FY2023 that has been assured by an independent practitioner, please refer to our website.\n\nEnvironmental Data (PDF)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Calculation Methods of Non-Financial Information\n\n## [Energy consumption volume]\n\n(Japan) Calculated based on the Act on Rationalization of Energy Use and Shi/f\\_t to Non-fossil Energy (Energy Conservation Act).\n\n(Overseas) Calculated using methods based on the Act on Rationalizing Energy use and Shi/f\\_ting to Non-fossil Energy (Energy Conservation Act).\n\n## [CO2 emissions: Scope 1, 2]\n\n(Japan) Calculated based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures. From FY2022 onward, adjusted emission factors of each electricity supplier are used for calculating Scope 2 purchased electricity (basic emission factors of each electricity supplier were used until FY2021).\n\n(Overseas) For Scope 1, emission factors based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures are used, and for Scope 2, the latest version of IEA Emissions from Fuel Combustion is used.\n\n## [CO2 emissions: Scope 3]\n\n(Japan and overseas) Calculations of Scope 3 for Japan and overseas are based on the emission intensities from Japan's Ministry of the Environment's database and IDEA (Inventory Database for Environmental Analysis) Ver.3.2.0.\n\nScope 3 Categories included in calculation: 1. Purchased goods and services, 2. Capital goods, 3. Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 and 2), 4. Upstream transportation and distribution, 5. Waste generated in operations, 6. Business travel, 7. Employee commuting, 9. Downstream transportation and distribution, 12. End-of-life treatment of sold products.\n\nCategory 1: Calculated by multiplying the purchase weight of major raw materials and packaging materials (paper, plastic, cardboard, steel, aluminum, glass) related to the food and pharmaceutical businesses by the IDEA emission intensity (For \"pharmaceutical active ingredients, raw powders, raw liquids\" among major raw materials, since there is no weight intensity, it is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the IDEA emission intensity.)\n\n## [Waste Amount]\n\n(Japan) Calculated based on the Act on Waste Management and Public Cleaning.\n\n(Overseas) Calculated using methods based on the Act on Waste Management and Public Cleaning.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As shown in the picture below, we were able to meet with the artist KOTO online to discuss the actual artwork in front of us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Paralym Art World Cup 2023 was held on the theme of 'JOURNEY,' which for KOTO meant reading stories. KOTO created her artwork on the motif of folklore around Japan, with each story told carefully down the canvas from north to south. KOTO told us a range of stories about the process and the work, including Ginga Tetsudo no Yoru (Night on the Galactic Railroad) and Satomi Hakkenden (Eight Dog Warriors), which KOTO particularly liked.

We are conscious of the need to tell our stories in an easy-to-understand way, from our responses to issues identified through dialogue with our diverse stakeholders to our directions for management going forward. We hope this report helps readers to understand our aim of sustainably improving corporate value while taking on new challenges based on our strengths built up over the long history of the Meiji Group.\n\nTo compile the report, our investor relations division, with the support of a team of people from divisions spanning sustainability, corporate development, intellectual property and research and development, had many interviews and discussions with management and stakeholders inside and outside the Group. We have disclosed additional information on our website, which we encourage everyone to read.\n\nWe will continue striving to further enhance information disclosure and dialogue going forward. As always, we look forward to receiving your honest opinions and feedback.\n\nMeiji Holdings Co., Ltd.
